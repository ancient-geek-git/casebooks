<p id="c54f1fbc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditionally, the most important property rights concerned tangible objects — most notably, land. Wealth is increasingly embodied in less tangible resources, such as financial assets. The least tangible thing imaginable is an idea. Can one own an idea? Ideas are free for public use, but the law grants some expressions of ideas, as well as some inventions and commercial marks, the status of limited property rights. Intellectual property law regulates control over the products of intellectual effort. It is one of the fastest growing areas of property law and of legal practice.</p>
<p id="c54f1fbd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The core subjects of intellectual property law — copyrights and patents — are governed by federal statutes. The U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 8. Pursuant to this clause, Congress has passed legislation protecting both copyrights and patents. Copyright law grants exclusive rights in literary and artistic works, including books, poetry, song, dance, dramatic works, computer programs, movies, sculpture, and paintings. Patent law grants exclusive rights in inventions, including processes, machines, and compositions of matter.</p>
<p id="c54f1fbe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third major area of intellectual property law is trademark law. Trademark law grants exclusive rights in symbols that indicate the source of goods or services. Unlike copyright and patent law, trademark law originated in state common law; federal legislation generally supplements, but does not displace, the common law in these areas. Trademark law grew out of the law of unfair competition and misappropriation, which prohibits companies from using information obtained from competitors in ways that unfairly appropriate the products of their competitors’ efforts.</p>
<p id="c54f1fbf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State common law also protects other forms of valuable information, such as “trade secrets” and “publicity rights.” Limited protection has also emerged for “moral <span title="176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-176">p. 176</span>rights” that give artists the ability to prevent their works from being mutilated or misrepresented by subsequent owners. Cultural property is closely related to intellectual property and, as its name suggests, provides legal protection for certain important aspects of culture, such as antiquities and Native American funerary objects.</p>

<p id="c54f46d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intellectual property law is beset by internal tensions. Once disclosed, ideas are generally not subject to ownership. We must be free to use ideas, our own and others’, in order to engage in all human activity. Too much private property in ideas would limit our autonomy and block desirable economic activity by creating insuperable transaction costs. At the same time, exclusive control over certain intellectual products enhances the autonomy of authors and inventors. Property rights can also protect the ability of creators to get credit for their works and create economic incentives to spur intellectual inquiry. Determining when the products of human effort should be subject to the creator’s control and when they should become the common property of humankind is the core problem of intellectual property law.</p>
<p id="c54f46d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intellectual property scholars have justified intellectual property rights using many of the same theories we have already seen in the context of tangible property.<i> See</i> Chapter 2. The three dominant theories at work in intellectual property discussions are (1) utilitarian/economic theories; (2) Lockean natural rights theories; and (3) Hegelian/personhood theories.<i> See</i> Robert Merges, Peter S. Menell &amp; Mark A. Lemley, <i>Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age</i> 2-22 (6th ed. 2012); <i>see also</i> Robert P. Merges, <i>Justifying Intellectual Property</i> (2010).</p>
<p id="c54f46d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Utilitarian/economic theories.</b> Utilitarian and economic theories of intellectual property, like Harold Demsetz’s theory of property and Garrett Hardin’s discussion of the “tragedy of the commons,” focus on the problem of externalities. Both of those discussions, which focused on tangible resources, emphasized <i>negative</i> externalities (costs not included in the resource-user’s cost-benefit analysis) that tended to lead the user to overconsume. <i>See</i> Chapter 2, §3.2. In contrast, within intellectual property discussions, the focus is on the uncompensated <i>positive</i> externalities produced by creative or inventive activities.</p>

<p id="c54f46d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Public goods</b> are resources that are consumed <b>nonrivalrously</b> and from which it is impossible to exclude others. Just as the behavioral assumptions of economic theory predict that people will engage in too much of the harm-producing activities, such as consumption of open-access commons, when those harms are shared with others, the same assumptions predict that people will decline to engage in activities, such as the creation of public goods, when the activities themselves are costly and the benefits of those activities are shared with others. Because others cannot be prevented from freely enjoying the benefits of public goods, self-interested actors have an incentive to sit back and take a <b>free ride</b> on the (costly) productive behavior of others rather than bear the costs of engaging in producing public goods <span title="177" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-177">p. 177</span>themselves. If everyone adopts the same strategy, public goods will not be produced. To overcome this free-rider problem, economists favor taking affirmative steps to encourage the production of public goods. Where creating mechanisms to facilitate the prevention of free riding is costly or undesirable, government provision is a common solution. Classic examples of government-provided public goods are national defense or the network of public roads.</p>
<p id="c54f46d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Innovation often has the features of a public good. It is costly to produce, both in terms of time and resources, but once an innovative idea is produced and disseminated, it is difficult (in the absence of some collective action) to prevent others from copying it. Because copyists do not have to pay for the (sunk) costs of innovation, they can profitably sell the innovative product for close to its marginal cost of production (the cost of producing an additional unit of the good, excluding sunk costs, such as the cost of innovation). Where innovation is costly and copying is cheap and easy, economic theory predicts that innovation will tend to be underproduced in the absence of some mechanism to empower actors to recoup their investment in innovation. One such mechanism is to create a legal monopoly that enables the innovator to prohibit others from copying her invention. This is the most common utilitarian explanation for the institution of intellectual property in the domains of copyright and patent law. <i>See</i> Richard A. Posner, <i>The Economic Analysis of Law</i> §§11.2, 11.5 (9th ed. 2014). <span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10096_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10096_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> Is government provision another possibility? What would it look like as a tool for overcoming the free-rider problem in the innovation context?</p>
<p id="c54f6deb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to understand the limits of this utilitarian argument for intellectual property. It does not rely on the notion that creators are morally entitled to capture the benefits they create. As in the tangible property context, utilitarian arguments for intellectual property are forward-looking and based on incentives to act in ways that enhance social welfare; they are not based on notions of individual desert. Where copying is not easy, or where innovators can recapture the value of their investment through the market advantages of being the <b>first mover</b>, the utilitarian argument does not offer much support for intellectual property rights. Indeed, where innovators can recover the costs of their innovation, the existence of copyists can be socially beneficial, since they help to propagate the innovation and foster competition. Their presence may even help to generate more innovation, as creators seek to stay one step ahead of the copyists. This is what seems to happen in the fashion industry. Fashion designs are not protected by intellectual property in the United States, and copying is rampant. But this does not seem to have harmed the industry, with its rapid cycle of innovation and its robust market in knock-off designs. <i>See</i> Kal Raustiala &amp; Christopher Sprigman, <i>The Piracy Paradox: Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design</i>, 92 Va. L. Rev. 1688 (2006).</p>

<p id="c54f6dee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In their 2006 article, <i>The Piracy Paradox</i>, Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman describe how the lack of IP protection for fashion actually increases the rate of innovation in the industry:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c54f6def-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fashion cycle has long been familiar. What is less commonly appreciated is the role of IP law in fostering the cycle. We argue that fashion’s low-IP regime is paradoxically advantageous for the industry. IP rules providing for free appropriation of fashion designs accelerate the diffusion of designs and styles. We call this process “induced obsolescence.” If copying were illegal, the fashion cycle would occur very slowly. Instead, the absence of protection for creative designs and the regime of free design appropriation speeds diffusion and induces more rapid obsolescence of fashion designs. As Miucci Prada put it recently, “We let others copy us. And when they do, we drop it.” The fashion cycle is driven faster, in other words, by widespread design copying, because copying erodes the positional qualities of fashion goods. Designers in turn respond to this obsolescence with new designs. In short, piracy paradoxically benefits designers by inducing more rapid turnover and additional sales.</p>

<p id="c54f6df0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Might the same dynamic arise in other property contexts where owners are confronted with positive externalities?</p>
</div>
<p id="c54f6df1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="178" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-178">p. 178</span>The utilitarian argument does not assert that all positive externalities must be internalized. After all, as Demsetz observed, the creation of intellectual property rights, like the creation of property rights more generally, generates costs of its own. First, since all innovation must rely upon the storehouse of prior knowledge, increasing the cost of using that prior knowledge (<i>e.g</i>., by protecting at least some of it as intellectual property) drives up the cost of innovation for creators. This suggests that, applying the assumptions of economic theory, the interaction between intellectual property protection and the speed of innovation will be complex. The creation of intellectual property rights that are too robust might even have the perverse effect of deterring innovation. Where too many people have intellectual property rights over inputs necessary to create a useful product, transaction costs can make it extremely expensive to gather the permissions necessary to bring the product to market. Michael Heller has called this situation — high transaction costs generated by a large number of property-based veto rights — the “tragedy of the anticommons.” Michael A. Heller, <i>The Tragedy of the Anticommons</i>, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 621 (1998).</p>
<p id="c54f6df2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another cost of creating intellectual property is that preventing free riders from competing with innovators in the marketplace (by granting the inventor a monopoly) drives up the price of the invention for consumers. Monopoly pricing will usually result in reduced consumption of the invention by consumers willing to pay more than the marginal cost of producing the good. Economists refer to this forgone consumption as “deadweight loss.” Finally, because intellectual property protects its owners from competition, the creation of intellectual property encourages those who wish to escape from competition to lobby for the creation of intellectual property even where it will not be socially beneficial. This kind of behavior — what economists call “rent seeking” — is wasteful in its own right. <i>See</i> Mark A. Lemley, <i>Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding</i>, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 1031, 1064 (2005). How to calibrate intellectual property rights to optimize the balance of the various costs and benefits of intellectual property is a difficult problem that is the subject of a great deal of debate among courts, politicians, interest groups, and scholars.</p>
<p id="c54f6df3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Lockean theories.</b> As we saw in Chapter 2, John Locke’s theory of property builds from twin premises of self-ownership and the original common endowment of the <span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>world’s resources to the conclusion that people should be entitled to the products of their own labor, except where doing so would make others worse off by failing to leave them “enough and as good” of the common resources. <i>See</i> John Locke, <i>Second Treatise of Government</i>, ch. V (1698). Although Locke did not have much to say about the ownership of ideas, contemporary scholars have argued that his theory applies with special force in the context of intellectual production. Innovative ideas, the argument goes, are the products of the inventor’s (intellectual) labor, and because they constitute something genuinely new, their protection as intellectual property cannot be thought to make anyone else worse off by taking anything out of the original common endowment.<i> See</i> Lawrence C. Becker, <i>Deserving to Own Intellectual Property</i>, 68 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 609 (1993); Justin Hughes, <i>The Philosophy of Intellectual Property</i>, 77 Geo. L.J. 287 (1988).</p>
<p id="c54f9504-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with utilitarian theories of intellectual property, however, Lockean theories suffer from tensions of their own. The most intractable problems for Lockean theories concern the difficulty of disentangling an innovator’s contribution to an invention from the contribution of the intellectual “raw materials” supplied by prior knowledge. Rewarding an innovator with an exclusive right to her creation requires some way of defining that creation so to give the innovator her due while acknowledging that almost all individual creation draws on the work of others. Consider the challenge of defining with any precision the contribution of a writer who pens a novel that draws on prior tropes but also pushes the boundaries of literature in new directions.</p>
<p id="c54f9505-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, note that the focus of the Lockean theory is on the relationship between the innovator and her creation. It simply asks whether the creation comes from the innovator’s productive labor. Thus, it would seem to justify protecting intellectual property rights for all independent creators, even those who are not the first to discover an invention. Although copyright protects such independent creation, American patent law traditionally has not.</p>
<p id="c54f9506-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Hegelian/personhood theories.</b> Hegelian personhood theory, which we also first encountered in Chapter 2, §7, has also been influential in discussions of intellectual property, particularly copyright and publicity rights. The idea is that through the creative process, the inventor or creator’s very identity becomes bound up with the invention or creation. This bond between the creator and her creation gives rise to an entitlement to control the dissemination and use of the created work. The theory seems to have the most intuitive appeal when applied to highly individualized acts of creation — the inventor toiling away in her basement, or the artist or author at work in her studio. For discussions of personhood theories of intellectual property, see Hughes, <i>supra</i>, at 350-353; <i>Linda J. Lacey, Of Bread and Roses and Copyrights</i>, 1989 Duke L.J. 1532; Neil Netanel, <i>Copyright Alienability Restrictions and the Enhancement of Author Autonomy: A Normative Evaluation</i>, 24 Rutgers L.J. 347 (1993). Again, personhood theory seems to generate its own tensions for intellectual property rights. The same ambiguities surrounding intellectual borrowing that bedevil Lockean theories apply in the personhood context. Moreover, the identity of others besides the original creator can become tied up with an intellectual creation. To take an extreme example, fans can become “consumed” by their identification with works created by <span title="180" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-180">p. 180</span>another person. <i>See</i> Christopher S.

<p id="c54fbc20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A trademark is a name, symbol, or type of packaging that identifies the producer of a good or service. Unlike copyright and patent law, trademark law is primarily based on state common law, not federal statute. The patent and copyright clause of the U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to provide protection for original works of authorship and inventions. U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 8. The Supreme Court struck down the first trademark laws, passed by Congress in 1870 and 1876, because they applied without regard to originality or novelty, crucial requirements for copyrights and patents. <i>United States v. Steffens</i> (<i>The Trade-Mark Cases</i>), 100 U.S. 82 (1879). Congress does, however, have the power to regulate interstate commerce. U.S. Const. art. I, §8, cl. 3. Because the Court considered trademarks to be a form of property within the purview of state regulation, Congress responded by passing statutes in 1881 and 1905 that addressed the interstate use of trademarks. The current federal trademark act, called <span title="181" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-181">p. 181</span>the <i>Lanham Act</i>, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1127, provides for the registration of trademarks created by state law, along with some rights that may supplement or displace state law.</p>

<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="c54fbc22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left">Terms:</p></div>
<p id="c54fbc23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Abandonment</b> is a term of art in trademark law and does not always mean the same thing as it does in other contexts. As with tangible property, mere nonuse of a trademark does not constitute abandonment. Intent to abandon is also required. But failure to use a trademark for an extended period will, by itself, constitute evidence of intent to abandon the mark. The <i>Lanham Act</i> treats nonuse for two years as prima facie evidence of abandonment. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1127.</p>
</div>
<p id="c54fbc24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trademark law gives the owner of the “mark” the exclusive right to use it in connection with the sale of a particular good or service in a particular area. This protects consumers from the <i>confusion</i> resulting from different companies using the same or similar names. <i>See Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</i>, 841 F. Supp. 506 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (holding that “Jordache Basics 101” may be confusingly similar to “Levi’s 501” jeans). However, trademark law does not give consumers a legal claim. Only a company that is using the mark may sue to prevent competitors from appropriating the goodwill associated with its mark. Trademark law grows out of state unfair competition law that prohibits “palming off” one’s products as those of another. It therefore protects the goodwill associated with a particular company or product line from unfair competition.</p>
<p id="c54fbc25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike copyright and patents, trademarks garner protection only if they are used in commerce to sell goods or services. Failure to use a mark for a long time may constitute <b>abandonment</b> of it. The first to use the mark in connection with a business establishes the mark and will prevail over a later user. The trademark’s value, of course, is much more than just ease of identification. Once customers develop loyalty to a brand name, the trademark itself has substantial value. A name can become associated with quality, and this goodwill is a substantial property interest. For this reason, a trademark infringement will be found if confusion may result from a competitor’s later use of a mark.</p>
<p id="c54fbc26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Words that describe goods generally (<b>generic</b> names) cannot be trademarked both because they are unlikely to signal a particular maker and because competitors are likely to need to use those words to sell their goods. Names that began by representing particular companies may become generic over time if people start using the trade name to mean the product itself, such as Scotch tape or Kleenex tissues. <i>See America Online v. AT&amp;T Corp.</i>, 243 F.3d 812 (4th Cir. 2001) (“instant messaging” and “you have mail” cannot be trademarked because they are generic terms; however, “Buddy List” may not be generic in the eyes of the public).</p>
<p id="c54fbc27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Lanham Act</i> provides notice of trademarks by allowing them to be registered with the federal Patent and Trademark Office. 15 U.S.C. §1072. Those wishing to register a mark must assert that they are currently using the mark in connection with a business or that they intend to do so shortly; use must commence within 24 months at the latest. Like the recording system for deeds, see Chapter 12, §5, registration places the whole world on actual or constructive notice of existing trademarks. Later users of a mark cannot claim to have used it in good faith or without knowledge of its prior use. A trademark may not be registered if it was in prior use by another (unless that use has been abandoned) or if there is a likelihood of confusion.<span title="182" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-182">p. 182</span></p>

<p id="c54fe33d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in this case is whether the <i>Trademark Act of 1946</i> (<i>Lanham Act</i>), 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1127, permits the registration of a trademark that consists, purely and simply, of a color. We conclude that, sometimes, a color will meet ordinary legal trademark requirements. And, when it does so, no special legal rule prevents color alone from serving as a trademark.</p>
<p id="c54fe33e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case before us grows out of petitioner Qualitex Company’s use (since the 1950’s) of a special shade of green-gold color on the pads that it makes and sells to dry cleaning firms for use on dry cleaning presses. In 1989, respondent Jacobson Products (a Qualitex rival) began to sell its own press pads to dry cleaning firms; and it colored those pads a similar green-gold. In 1991, Qualitex registered the special green-gold color on press pads with the Patent and Trademark Office as a trademark. Qualitex subsequently added a trademark infringement count, 15 U.S.C. §1114(1), to an unfair competition claim, §1125(a), in a lawsuit it had already filed challenging Jacobson’s use of the green-gold color.</p>
<p id="c54fe33f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Lanham Act</i> gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to “register” a trademark, 15 U.S.C. §1052, and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, §1114(1). Both the language of the Act and the basic underlying principles of trademark law would seem to include color within the universe of things that can qualify as a trademark. The language of the <i>Lanham Act</i> describes that universe in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks “include any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof.” §1127. Since human beings might use as a “symbol” or “device” almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particular sound (of NBC’s three chimes), and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread). If a shape, a sound, and a fragrance can act as symbols why, one might ask, can a color not do the same?</p>
<p id="c54fe340-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A color is also capable of satisfying the more important part of the statutory definition of a trademark, which requires that a person “use” or “intend to use” the mark “to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.” 15 U.S.C. §1127.</p>
<p id="c54fe341-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, a product’s color is unlike “fanciful,” “arbitrary,” or “suggestive” words or designs, which almost <i>automatically</i> tell a customer that they refer to a brand. The imaginary word “Suntost,” or the words “Suntost Marmalade,” on a jar of orange jam immediately would signal a brand or a product “source”; the jam’s orange color does not do so. But, over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a product or its packaging (say, a color that in context seems unusual, such as pink on a firm’s insulating material or red on the head of a large industrial bolt) as signifying a brand. And, if so, that color would have come to identify and distinguish the goods — <i>i.e.</i>, <span title="183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-183">p. 183</span>“to indicate” their “source” — much in the way that descriptive words on a product (say, “Trim” on nail clippers or “Car-Freshner” on deodorizer) can come to indicate a product’s origin. In this circumstance, trademark law says that the word (<i>e.g.</i>, “Trim”), although not inherently distinctive, has developed “secondary meaning.” <i>See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.</i>, 456 U.S. 844, 851, n.11 (1982) (“Secondary meaning” is acquired when “in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature . . . is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself”).</p>
<p id="c54fe342-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law any obvious theoretical objection to the use of color alone as a trademark, where that color has attained “secondary meaning” and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its “source”). In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, “reduce[s] the customer’s costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions,” 1 J. McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> §2.01[2], pp. 2-3 (3d ed. 1994), for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that <i>this</i> item — the item with this mark — is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby “encourage[s] the production of quality products,” and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer’s inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. It is the source-distinguishing ability of a mark — not its ontological status as color, shape, fragrance, word, or sign — that permits it to serve these basic purposes. And, for that reason, it is difficult to find, in basic trademark objectives, a reason to disqualify absolutely the use of a color as a mark.</p>
<p id="c54fe343-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither can we find a principled objection to the use of color as a mark in the important “functionality” doctrine of trademark law. The functionality doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting a firm’s reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature. It is the province of patent law, not trademark law, to encourage invention by granting inventors a monopoly over new product designs or functions for a limited time, 35 U.S.C. §§154, 173, after which competitors are free to use the innovation. If a product’s functional features could be used as trademarks, however, a monopoly over such features could be obtained without regard to whether they qualify as patents and could be extended forever (because trademarks may be renewed in perpetuity). . . . This Court consequently has explained that, “in general terms, a product feature is functional,” and cannot serve as a trademark, “if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article,” that is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage. <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 850, n.10. Although sometimes color plays an important role (unrelated to source identification) in making a product more desirable, sometimes it does not. And, this latter fact — the <span title="184" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-184">p. 184</span>fact that sometimes color is not essential to a product’s use or purpose and does not affect cost or quality — indicates that the doctrine of “functionality” does not create an absolute bar to the use of color alone as a mark.</p>
<p id="c5500a54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would seem, then, that color alone, at least sometimes, can meet the basic legal requirements for use as a trademark. It can act as a symbol that distinguishes a firm’s goods and identifies their source, without serving any other significant function. Indeed, the District Court, in this case, entered findings . . . that show Qualitex’s green-gold press pad color has met these requirements. The green-gold color acts as a symbol. Having developed secondary meaning (for customers identified the green-gold color as Qualitex’s), it identifies the press pads’ source. And, the green-gold color serves no other function. Accordingly, unless there is some special reason that convincingly militates against the use of color alone as a trademark, trademark law would protect Qualitex’s use of the green-gold color on its press pads.</p>
<p id="c5500a55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent Jacobson Products says that there are . . . special reasons why the law should forbid the use of color alone as a trademark. We shall explain, in turn, why we, ultimately, find them unpersuasive.</p>
<p id="c5500a56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First</i>, Jacobson says that, if the law permits the use of color as a trademark, it will produce uncertainty and unresolvable court disputes about what shades of a color a competitor may lawfully use. Because lighting (morning sun, twilight mist) will affect perceptions of protected color, competitors and courts will suffer from “shade confusion” as they try to decide whether use of a similar color on a similar product does, or does not, confuse customers and thereby infringe a trademark. Jacobson adds that the “shade confusion” problem is “more difficult” and “far different from” the “determination of the similarity of words or symbols.”</p>
<p id="c5500a57-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not believe, however, that color, in this respect, is special. Courts traditionally decide quite difficult questions about whether two words or phrases or symbols are sufficiently similar, in context, to confuse buyers. They have had to compare, for example, such words as “Bonamine” and “Dramamine” (motion-sickness remedies); “Huggies” and “Dougies” (diapers); “Cheracol” and “Syrocol” (cough syrup); “Cyclone” and “Tornado” (wire fences); and “Mattres” and “1-800-Mattres” (mattress franchisor telephone numbers).</p>
<p id="c5500a58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second</i>, Jacobson argues, as have others, that colors are in limited supply. Jacobson claims that, if one of many competitors can appropriate a particular color for use as a trademark, and each competitor then tries to do the same, the supply of colors will soon be depleted. . . . [I]n the context of a particular product, only some colors are usable. By the time one discards colors that, say, for reasons of customer appeal, are not usable, and adds the shades that competitors cannot use lest they risk infringing a similar, registered shade, then one is left with only a handful of possible colors. And, under these circumstances, to permit one, or a few, producers to use colors as trademarks will “deplete” the supply of usable colors to the point where a competitor’s inability to find a suitable color will put that competitor at a significant disadvantage.</p>
<p id="c5500a59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument is unpersuasive, however, largely because it relies on an occasional problem to justify a blanket prohibition. When a color serves as a mark, normally alternative colors will likely be available for similar use by others. Moreover, if that is not <span title="185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-185">p. 185</span>so — if a “color depletion” or “color scarcity” problem does arise — the trademark doctrine of “functionality” normally would seem available to prevent the anticompetitive consequences that Jacobson’s argument posits, thereby minimizing that argument’s practical force.</p>
<p id="c5500a5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The functionality doctrine . . . forbids the use of a product’s feature as a trademark where doing so will put a competitor at a significant disadvantage because the feature is “essential to the use or purpose of the article” or “affects [its] cost or quality.” The functionality doctrine thus protects competitors against a disadvantage (unrelated to recognition or reputation) that trademark protection might otherwise impose, namely their inability reasonably to replicate important non-reputation-related product features.</p>

<p id="c5500a5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Dilution.</b> In 1996, the <i>Lanham Act</i> was amended to protect owners of “famous marks” against “dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark” by giving them the right to obtain injunctive relief against competing uses even in the absence of consumer confusion. 15 U.S.C. §1125(c) (codifying the <i>Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995</i>, Pub. L. No. 104-374, §3 (1996)). The statute explicitly allows use of a mark in “comparative commercial advertising.” <i>Id.</i> §1125(c)(4)(A). State antidilution laws continue to apply to “nonfamous” marks.</p>
<p id="c5500a5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A mark may be diluted either because of <b>tarnishment</b> or <b>blurring</b>. Tarnishment occurs if a company sells inferior quality products. For example, the Singer name is commercially associated with sewing machines. If a business starts selling Singer vacuum cleaners, and they are of inferior quality, the Singer name might come to be associated with shoddy products and the value of the Singer name associated with sewing machines might decrease.</p>
<p id="c5500a5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Blurring occurs when a distinctive mark begins to lose its association with a particular company. For example, Pepperidge Farm obtained an injunction ordering Nabisco to stop selling goldfish-shaped cheddar cheese-flavored crackers because this particular product was strongly associated with Pepperidge Farm, and sale of similar products by Nabisco would dilute the distinctive quality of Pepperidge Farm’s mark. <i>Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc.</i>, 191 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>
<p id="c5500a60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One issue is whether injunctive relief should be granted in the absence of proof of actual economic harm. Some courts allowed relief based solely on the possibility of blurring while others held that dilution could be established only by showing actual economic harm resulting from the competing product. Congress answered this question in 2006 by amending the <i>Federal Trademark Dilution Act</i> to provide for relief when a mark is “likely to cause dilution.” 15 U.S.C. §1125(c)(1).</p>
<p id="c5503171-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Cybersquatting and gripe web sites.</b> In the early years of the Internet, some people obtained web site domain names for the sole purpose of selling them to existing trademark holders, a practice that came to be known as “cybersquatting.” Often no confusion resulted from this because anyone accessing the web site would know immediately that it was not owned by the company in question. However, in the spirit <span title="186" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-186">p. 186</span>of the <i>Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995</i>, Congress passed the <i>Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act</i> (ACPA), 15 U.S.C. §1125(d), in 1999. This law prohibits anyone from registering or using a domain name “with bad faith intent to profit from another’s trademark.” Anyone who obtains a domain name with the intent of selling it to the relevant company or somehow profiting from the traffic the famous trademark name generates would almost certainly violate the act. <i>See, e.g., PETA v. Doughney</i>, 263 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 2001) (registration of the domain name “peta.org” allegedly on behalf of a fictional “People Eating Tasty Animals” violates the ACPA where used in bad faith to attempt to extract payment from the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals);<i> Virtual Works, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.</i>, 238 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2001) (<i>www.vw.net</i> domain name violates ACPA when registered by Virtual Works, Inc. because the company intended to profit from the name recognition attached to the common abbreviation for Volkswagen). Is “cybersquatting” any different than strategically buying a piece of land that another person is trying to acquire (say, as part of an effort to assemble a larger parcel) in order to profit by selling it to them? Why do you think Congress intervened in these disputes between “cybersquatters” and trademark owners? Is the law aptly named?</p>
<p id="c5503172-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disagreements have arisen among courts about gripe web sites that intend to criticize a company by using its name or its name plus a disparaging word such as “sucks.” Although it has been argued that this is a noncommercial use outside the scope of the ACPA and that the first amendment protects such usages, one court has granted relief on behalf of a trademark owner against such a site when the site sought to “get even” with the trademark owner. <i>Morrison &amp; Foerster v. Wick</i>, 94 F. Supp. 2d 1125 (D. Colo. 2000). Most courts, however, have held that use of a company’s trademarked name in a web site address violates neither the ACPA nor the <i>Lanham Act</i> when the name is not used for commercial purposes or in a manner that would confuse potential customers. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Lamparello v. Falwell</i>, 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005) (web site using the misspelled domain name fallwell.com and dedicated to criticizing Jerry Falwell’s views on homosexuality did not constitute infringement or cybersquatting);<i> Aviva USA Corp. v. Vazirani</i>, 902 F. Supp. 2d 1246 (D. Ariz. 2012); <i>see also Bosley Medical Institute, Inc. v. Kremer</i>, 403 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2005). Nevertheless, such uses may still violate the ACPA if they are done “with bad faith intent to profit” from the trademarked name.</p>

<p id="c550317b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Copyright law is regulated by a federal statute that substantially preempts state law on the subject. 17 U.S.C. §101 <i>et seq.</i> The <i>Copyright Act</i> grants owners of “original works of authorship” that are fixed in a “tangible medium of expression,” §102, exclusive rights to copy, distribute, perform, or display those works publicly and to make derivative works from them, §106. Ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted; only original <i>expressions</i> of ideas can be protected by copyright law. Authors own what they create unless they performed “work for hire”; such works are owned by the author’s employer. §201(b). Copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years, after which time the work becomes part of the public domain. With respect to works for hire, the copyright lasts for 95 years from the date of first publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first. §302(c). Copyright protection is created automatically, with no need by the author or creator to take any affirmative steps, although authors need to register their copyrights before suing for infringement.</p>

<p id="c550a5d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case requires us to clarify the extent of copyright protection available to telephone directory white pages.</p>
<p id="c550a5d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc., is a certified public utility that provides telephone service to several communities in northwest Kansas. It is subject to a state regulation that requires all telephone companies operating in Kansas to issue annually an updated telephone directory. Accordingly, as a condition of its monopoly franchise, Rural publishes a typical telephone directory, consisting of white pages and yellow pages. The white pages list in alphabetical order the names of Rural’s subscribers, together with their towns and telephone numbers. The yellow pages list Rural’s business subscribers alphabetically by category and feature classified advertisements of various sizes. Rural distributes its directory free of charge to its subscribers, but earns revenue by selling yellow pages advertisements.</p>
<p id="c550a5d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Feist Publications, Inc., is a publishing company that specializes in area-wide telephone directories. Unlike a typical directory, which covers only a particular calling area, Feist’s area-wide directories cover a much larger geographical range, reducing the need to call directory assistance or consult multiple directories. The Feist directory that is the subject of this litigation covers 11 different telephone service areas in 15 counties and contains 46,878 white pages listings — compared to Rural’s approximately 7,700 listings. Like Rural’s directory, Feist’s is distributed free of charge and includes both white pages and yellow pages. Feist and Rural compete vigorously for yellow pages advertising.</p>
<p id="c550a5d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the sole provider of telephone service in its service area, Rural obtains subscriber information quite easily. Persons desiring telephone service must apply to Rural and provide their names and addresses; Rural then assigns them a telephone number. Feist is not a telephone company, let alone one with monopoly status, and therefore lacks independent access to any subscriber information. To obtain white pages listings for its area-wide directory, Feist approached each of the 11 telephone companies operating in northwest Kansas and offered to pay for the right to use its white pages listings.</p>
<p id="c550a5d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the 11 telephone companies, only Rural refused to license its listings to Feist. Rural’s refusal created a problem for Feist, as omitting these listings would have left a gaping hole in its area-wide directory, rendering it less attractive to potential yellow pages advertisers. . . . </p>
<p id="c550cce8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unable to license Rural’s white pages listings, Feist used them without Rural’s consent. Feist began by removing several thousand listings that fell outside the geographic <span title="190" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-190">p. 190</span>range of its area-wide directory, then hired personnel to investigate the 4,935 that remained. These employees verified the data reported by Rural and sought to obtain additional information. As a result, a typical Feist listing includes the individual’s street address; most of Rural’s listings do not. Notwithstanding these additions, however, 1,309 of the 46,878 listings in Feist’s 1983 directory were identical to listings in Rural’s 1982-1983 white pages. Four of these were fictitious listings that Rural had inserted into its directory to detect copying.</p>
<p id="c550cce9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rural sued for copyright infringement in the District Court for the District of Kansas taking the position that Feist, in compiling its own directory, could not use the information contained in Rural’s white pages. Rural asserted that Feist’s employees were obliged to travel door-to-door or conduct a telephone survey to discover the same information for themselves. Feist responded that such efforts were economically impractical and, in any event, unnecessary because the information copied was beyond the scope of copyright protection.</p>
<p id="c550ccea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case concerns the interaction of two well-established propositions. The first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that compilations of facts generally are.</p>
<p id="c550cceb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an undeniable tension between these two propositions. Many compilations consist of nothing but raw data — <i>i.e.</i>, wholly factual information not accompanied by any original written expression. . . . The key to resolving the tension lies in understanding why facts are not copyrightable. The <i>sine qua non</i> of copyright is originality. To qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author. Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity. Originality does not signify novelty; a work may be original even though it closely resembles other works so long as the similarity is fortuitous, not the result of copying. To illustrate, assume that two poets, each ignorant of the other, compose identical poems. Neither work is novel, yet both are original and, hence, copyrightable.</p>
<p id="c550ccec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Originality is a constitutional requirement. The source of Congress’ power to enact copyright laws is Article I, §8, cl. 8, of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress to “secure for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their respective Writings.” In two decisions from the late 19th century — <i>The Trade-Mark Cases</i>, 100 U.S. 82 (1879); and <i>Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony</i>, 111 U.S. 53 (1884) — this Court defined the crucial terms “authors” and “writings.” In so doing, the Court made it unmistakably clear that these terms presuppose a degree of originality.</p>
<p id="c550cced-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is this bedrock principle of copyright that mandates the law’s seemingly disparate treatment of facts and factual compilations. “No one may claim originality as to facts.” This is because facts do not owe their origin to an act of authorship. The distinction is one between creation and discovery: The first person to find and report a particular fact has not created the fact; he or she has merely discovered its existence.</p>
<p id="c550ccee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Factual compilations, on the other hand, may possess the requisite originality. The compilation author typically chooses which facts to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the collected data so that they may be used effectively by readers. These choices as to selection and arrangement, so long as they are made <span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity, are sufficiently original that Congress may protect such compilations through the copyright laws. Thus, even a directory that contains absolutely no protectible written expression, only facts, meets the constitutional minimum for copyright protection if it features an original selection or arrangement.</p>
<p id="c550ccef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This protection is subject to an important limitation. The mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected. Originality remains the <i>sine qua non</i> of copyright; accordingly, copyright protection may extend only to those components of a work that are original to the author. Thus, if the compilation author clothes facts with an original collocation of words, he or she may be able to claim a copyright in this written expression. Others may copy the underlying facts from the publication, but not the precise words used to present them. Where the compilation author adds no written expression but rather lets the facts speak for themselves, the expressive element is more elusive. The only conceivable expression is the manner in which the compiler has selected and arranged the facts. Thus, if the selection and arrangement are original, these elements of the work are eligible for copyright protection. No matter how original the format, however, the facts themselves do not become original through association.</p>
<p id="c550ccf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This inevitably means that the copyright in a factual compilation is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another’s publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement.</p>
<p id="c550ccf1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may seem unfair that much of the fruit of the compiler’s labor may be used by others without compensation. As Justice Brennan has correctly observed, however, this is not “some unforeseen byproduct of a statutory scheme.” <i>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises</i>, 471 U.S. 539, 589 (1985) (dissenting opinion). It is, rather, “the essence of copyright,” and a constitutional requirement. The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. To this end, copyright assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work. This principle, known as the idea/expression or fact/expression dichotomy, applies to all works of authorship. As applied to a factual compilation, assuming the absence of original written expression, only the compiler’s selection and arrangement may be protected; the raw facts may be copied at will. This result is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which copyright advances the progress of science and art.</p>
<p id="c550ccf2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In enacting the <i>Copyright Act of 1976</i>, 17 U.S.C. §101 <i>et seq.</i>, Congress [reaffirmed the view that copyright law protects only original works rather than the “sweat of the brow” by dropping] reference to “all the writings of an author” and replac[ing] it with the phrase “original works of authorship.” 17 U.S.C. §102(a). . . . [The 1976 <i>Copyright Act</i> made clear] that compilations [are] not copyrightable <i>per se</i>. . . . The definition of “compilation” is found in §101 of the 1976 Act. It defines a “compilation” in the copyright sense as “a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data <i>that</i> are selected, coordinated, or arranged <i>in such a way that</i> <span title="192" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-192">p. 192</span>the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship” (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="c550ccf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of the statutory definition is to emphasize that collections of facts are not copyrightable <i>per se</i>. [A] compilation, like any other work, is copyrightable only if it satisfies the originality requirement (“an <i>original</i> work of authorship”). Although §102 states plainly that the originality requirement applies to all works, the point was emphasized with regard to compilations to ensure that courts would not repeat the mistake of the [courts that had protected the “sweat of the brow” in the absence of originality].</p>
<p id="c550ccf4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, the 1976 revisions to the <i>Copyright Act</i> leave no doubt that originality, not “sweat of the brow,” is the touchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works. . . . The revisions explain with painstaking clarity that copyright requires originality, §102(a); that facts are never original, §102(b); that the copyright in a compilation does not extend to the facts it contains, §103(b); and that a compilation is copyrightable only to the extent that it features an original selection, coordination, or arrangement, §101.</p>
<p id="c550ccf5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is whether . . . Feist, by taking 1,309 names, towns, and telephone numbers from Rural’s white pages, cop[ied] anything that was “original” to Rural[.] Certainly, the raw data does not satisfy the originality requirement. Rather, these bits of information are uncopyrightable facts.</p>
<p id="c550ccf6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question that remains is whether Rural selected, coordinated, or arranged these uncopyrightable facts in an original way. The selection, coordination, and arrangement of Rural’s white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection. In preparing its white pages, Rural simply takes the data provided by its subscribers and lists it alphabetically by surname. The end product is a garden-variety white pages directory, devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity.</p>
<p id="c550ccf7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rural’s selection of listings could not be more obvious: It publishes the most basic information — name, town, and telephone number — about each person who applies to it for telephone service. This is “selection” of a sort, but it lacks the modicum of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression. Rural expended sufficient effort to make the white pages directory useful, but insufficient creativity to make it original.</p>
<p id="c550ccf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor can Rural claim originality in its coordination and arrangement of facts. The white pages do nothing more than list Rural’s subscribers in alphabetical order. This arrangement may, technically speaking, owe its origin to Rural [b]ut there is nothing remotely creative about arranging names alphabetically in a white pages directory. It is not only unoriginal, it is practically inevitable. This time-honored tradition does not possess the minimal creative spark required by the <i>Copyright Act</i> and the Constitution.</p>
<p id="c550ccf9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by Feist were not original to Rural and therefore were not protected by the copyright in Rural’s combined white and yellow pages directory. . . . Because Rural’s white pages lack the requisite originality, Feist’s use of the listings cannot constitute infringement. This decision should not be construed as demeaning Rural’s efforts in compiling its directory, but rather as making clear that copyright rewards originality, not effort. As this Court <span title="193" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-193">p. 193</span>noted more than a century ago, “ great praise may be due to the plaintiffs for their industry and enterprise in publishing this paper, yet the law does not contemplate their being rewarded in this way.’ ” <i>Baker v. Selden</i>, 101 U.S. 99, 105 (1880).</p>

<p id="c550f40c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Infringement and contributory infringement.</b> A person is liable for infringing a copyright when she “violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 121.” <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §501(a). A person can be liable for <b>contributory infringement</b> when “with the knowledge of the infringing activity [by others, she] induces, causes, or materially contributes” to it. <i>Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management</i>, 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971). When video cassette recorders (VCRs) first became available to home consumers in the 1970s, movie studios feared they would lead to widespread copyright piracy. Two studios sued Sony, a manufacturer of VCRs, alleging that Sony was liable for the infringing activities of VCR users. The Supreme Court held that a device maker is not liable for contributory infringement where its product is “capable of substantial non-infringing uses.” <i>Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios</i>, 464 U.S. 417, 442 (1984). Because the VCR is capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the Court reasoned, Sony was not liable just because some people put its product to infringing uses. <i>See id.</i> In <i>Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.</i>, 545 U.S. 913 (2005), the Court considered a lawsuit by a group of copyright owners (including movie studios, recording companies, songwriters, and others) against Grokster, Inc. and StreamCast Networks, Inc., distributors of software products that allowed computer users to share electronic files (including copyrighted content) through networks in which users’ computers communicate directly with one another. A unanimous Supreme Court held that, even though such peer-to-peer file-sharing software might be capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the device makers could not take advantage of the Court’s holding in <i>Sony</i> since they distributed their products with the purpose of affirmatively promoting infringing uses. The Court pointed to numerous statements by Grokster and StreamCast in marketing materials suggestive of an intent to facilitate the sharing of copyrighted content. Would the holding in <i>Grokster</i> apply to a company marketing a similar product that did not make such statements?</p>
<p id="c550f40d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are web sites, such as YouTube, that permit users to post and share their own content, liable for contributory infringement if users post infringing content? In 1998, Congress enacted the <i>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</i> (DMCA) that aimed to curb copyright infringement over the Internet. Title II of the DMCA (separately titled the <i>Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</i> (OCILLA)), included a series of safe harbors insulating on-line service providers, storage providers, and location tools (such as search engines) from liability for users’ copyright infringement. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §512(a)-(d). The statute imposes a complex system of criteria for determining who is covered by the safe harbors, with web sites that serve as mere passive conduits of user content enjoying protection, provided they do not know of the infringement and are sufficiently responsive when notified of the presence of infringing content on their <span title="194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-194">p. 194</span>servers. The precise dimensions of these safe harbors, however, are a matter of continuing litigation. <i>See</i> Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC, 826 F.3d 78 (2d Cir. 2016); <i>UMG Recordings v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC</i>, 718 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2013); <i>Columbia Pictures Industry, Inc. v. Fung</i>, 710 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2013);<i> Viacom International, Inc. v.

<p id="c550f410-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Copyright lasts for a long time. It was not always this way. As recently as 1976, copyright lasted only 28 years, with an option to renew the copyright for an additional 28 years if the creator took the affirmative step of registering for the extension. Consider the example of the famous “Happy Birthday” song. Rights to the song, which was written in the late nineteenth century by sisters Patty and Mildred Hill, passed through various entities over the years, ending up in the hands of Warner Music Group in 1998. Warner has aggressively policed its copyright in the song, demanding significant licensing fees for the rights to use of the song in films and on television. The result was that, while the song has long been ubiquitous in public life, it was far less frequently sung on the big or small screen. For many years, Warner collected at least $2 million a year in licensing fees for the song.<i> See</i> Bernard Vaughan, <i>“Happy Birthday to You” Belongs to Us All, Lawsuit Says,</i> Reuters, June 13, 2013. Warner Music’s entitlement to the song has not gone unchallenged, however. In a recent article, Professor Robert Brauneis said he could find no evidence of an actual copyright for the lyrics of “Happy Birthday to You” sung to the usual tune. <i>See</i> Robert Brauneis, <i>Copyright and the World’s Most Popular Song</i>, 56 J. Copyright Socy. of the U.S.A. 335 (2009). In 2014, Warner’s rights became the subject of a legal challenge brought by a singer/songwriter, Rupa Marya. In 2015, a federal trial court granted Marya summary judgment. <i>See Marya v. Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.</i>, 131 F. Supp. 3d 975 (M.D. Cal. 2015). The parties subsequently settled the case, with Warner agreeing to pay millions of dollars to compensate former licensees. Why do you think it took so long for someone to mount a lawsuit challenging Warner’s entitlement to licensing fees?</p>

<p id="c550f411-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Copying in the digital age.</b> One of the core exclusive rights protected by copyright law is the right “to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies.” <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §106. Section 101 defines “copies” as “material objects . . . in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed” and it defines “fixed” as a form that is “sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than a transitory duration.” In the age of cassette tapes and paper books, a copy was easy enough to recognize. But what about today, when music and literature are frequently consumed in digital form? What does it mean to make a copy of a digital music file? What if, every time you play the song on your computer, the computer copies the digital file from your hard drive into the computer’s working memory? Is that file in the working memory a copy of the song? <i>See MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.</i>, 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993) (transferring program from a computer’s hard drive to its RAM, where it becomes perceptible to users until the computer is turned off, creates a copy of the program within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. §101); <i>but see Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc.</i>, 536 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2008) (reading <i>MAI Systems</i> narrowly and holding that the transfer of a digital video file into a “buffer” where it was only present for a fleeting period of time did not create a copy within the meaning of §101); <i>CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc.</i>, 373 F.3d 544 (4th Cir. 2004) (transitory copies made by conduits of information, such as Internet service providers, are not copies).</p>
<p id="c550f412-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Copyfraud and orphan works.</b> Copyright’s long duration and automatic application to qualifying works generate a number of problems. Assertions of copyright over long-existing works have at least <i>prima facie</i> credibility. And yet the expense of determining the facts of the matter — or the statutory damages imposed for simply ignoring what turns out to be a meritorious demand — can easily exceed the <span title="195" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-195">p. 195</span>price demanded by the person asserting the copyright. This mix of costs and benefits creates the potential for what Jason Mazzone has dubbed “copyfraud,” the bad faith or fraudulent assertion of copyright in order to extract unmerited licensing fees. <i>See</i> Jason Mazzone, <i>Copyfraud and Other Abuses of Intellectual Property Law</i> (2011).</p>
<p id="c550f413-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second problem arises from the fact that most works subject to copyright protection do not enjoy much commercial success. Since most works generate almost no revenue for their owners, most owners have no interest in policing their works’ use by others. And yet those works remain subject to (automatic) copyright protection. Tracking down the owner of the copyright many years after the work’s creation can be a difficult task, particularly after the original creator has died and the copyright has passed to the creator’s heirs, who may not even be aware that they own the copyright. But using the work in certain ways without the current copyright owner’s express permission could subject the user to significant inconvenience, not to mention costly statutory penalties, should an unhappy owner eventually surface. The existence of <b>orphan works</b> (works that are subject to copyright but lack an easily identifiable owner) has been an obstacle to efforts to build comprehensive digital libraries, such as Google’s plan to create a text-searchable database of millions of books. After Google announced its plans, a group of authors and publishers sued Google and several libraries participating in Google’s digitization project, alleging that the creation of repositories of digital copies of books currently covered by copyright violates the rights of copyright owners, including the owners of orphan works. In late 2013, the district court concluded that Google’s digitization was a transformative “fair use” and granted Google’s motion for summary judgment. In doing so it noted that Google’s project was likely to enhance the value of the copyrighted works included in the database.<i> See Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google Inc.,</i> 954 F. Supp. 2d 282 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), <i>aff’d</i> 804 F.3d 202 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>

<p id="c5511b2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this opinion, we decide whether publication of <i>The Wind Done Gone</i> (“TWDG”), a fictional work admittedly based on Margaret Mitchell’s <i>Gone with the Wind</i> (“GWTW”), should be enjoined from publication based on alleged copyright violations. The district court granted a preliminary injunction against publication of TWDG. . . . We vacate the injunction and remand for consideration of the remaining claims.</p>
<p id="c5511b2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I. Background</i></p>
<p id="c5511b2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">SunTrust is the trustee of the Mitchell Trust, which holds the copyright in GWTW. Since its publication in 1936, GWTW has become one of the best-selling books in the world, second in sales only to the Bible. The Mitchell Trust has actively managed the copyright, authorizing derivative works and a variety of commercial items. It has <span title="196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-196">p. 196</span>entered into a contract authorizing, under specified conditions, a second sequel to GWTW to be published by St. Martin’s Press. The Mitchell Trust maintains the copyright in all of the derivative works as well.</p>
<p id="c5511b2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alice Randall, the author of TWDG, persuasively claims that her novel is a critique of GWTW’s depiction of slavery and the Civil-War era American South. To this end, she appropriated the characters, plot and major scenes from GWTW into the first half of TWDG.</p>
<p id="c5511b2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After discovering the similarities between the books, SunTrust asked Houghton Mifflin to refrain from publication or distribution of TWDG, but Houghton Mifflin refused the request. Subsequently, SunTrust filed an action alleging copyright infringement, violation of the <i>Lanham Act</i>, and deceptive trade practices, and immediately filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p id="c5511b30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Discussion</i></p>
<p id="c5511b31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our primary focus at this stage of the case is on the appropriateness of the injunctive relief granted by the district court. In our analysis, we must evaluate the merits of SunTrust’s copyright infringement claim, including Houghton Mifflin’s affirmative defense of fair use. As we assess the fair-use defense, we examine to what extent a critic may use a work to communicate her criticism of the work without infringing the copyright in that work. To approach these issues in the proper framework, we should initially review the history of the Constitution’s Copyright Clause and understand its relationship to the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5511b32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A. History and Development of the Copyright Clause</i></p>
<p id="c5511b33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Copyright Clause finds its roots in England, where, in 1710, the Statute of Anne “was designed to destroy the booksellers’ monopoly of the book trade and to prevent its recurrence.” L. Ray Patterson, <i>Understanding the Copyright Clause</i>, 47 J. Copyright Soc’y USA 365, 379 (2000). This Parliamentary statute assigned copyright in books to authors, added a requirement that only a new work could be copyrighted, and limited the duration, which had been perpetual, to two fourteen-year terms. It is clear that the goal of the Statute of Anne was to encourage creativity and ensure that the public would have free access to information by putting an end to “the continued use of copyright as a device of censorship.” Patterson at 379. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution relied on this statute when drafting the Copyright Clause of our Constitution, which reads, “The Congress shall have Power . . . to promote the Progress of Science . . . by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their respective Writings. . . .” U.S. Const. art. 1, §8, cl. 8. Congress directly transferred the principles from the Statute of Anne into the copyright law of the United States in 1783, first through a recommendation to the states to enact similar copyright laws, and then in 1790, with the passage of the first American federal copyright statute.</p>
<p id="c5511b34-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Copyright Clause was intended “to be the engine of free expression.” <i>Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters</i>., 471 U.S. 539, 558 (1985). To that end, copyright laws have been enacted to achieve the three main goals: the promotion of learning, the protection of the public domain, and the granting of an exclusive right to the author.</p>
<p id="c5511b35-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-197">p. 197</span><i>1. Promotion of Learning</i></p>
<p id="c5511b36-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, copyright has always been used to promote learning by guarding against censorship. Throughout the nineteenth century, the copyright in literature was limited to the right “to publish and vend books.” Patterson, at 383. The term “copy” was interpreted literally; an author had the right only to prevent others from copying and selling her particular literary work. This limited right ensured that a maximum number of new works would be created and published. It was not until the 1909 Act, which codified the concept of a derivative work, that an author’s right to protect his original work against imitation was established.</p>
<p id="c5511b37-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a further protection of the public interest, until 1976, statutory copyright law required that a work be published before an author was entitled to a copyright in that work. Therefore, in order to have the sole right of publication for the statutory period, the author was first required to make the work available to the public. In 1976, copyright was extended to include any work “fixed in any tangible medium of expression” in order to adapt the law to technological advances. <i>Copyright Act of 1976</i>, 17 U.S.C. §102(a). Thus, the publication requirement was removed, but the fair use right was codified to maintain the constitutionally mandated balance to ensure that the public has access to knowledge.</p>
<p id="c5511b38-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Copyright Act</i> promotes public access to knowledge because it provides an economic incentive for authors to publish books and disseminate ideas to the public. Without the limited monopoly, authors would have little economic incentive to create and publish their work. Therefore, by providing this incentive, the copyright law promotes the public access to new ideas and concepts.</p>
<p id="c5514249-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>2. Protection of the Public Domain</i></p>
<p id="c551424a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second goal of the Copyright Clause is to ensure that works enter the public domain after an author’s rights, exclusive, but limited, have expired. Parallel to the patent regime, the limited time period of the copyright serves the dual purpose of ensuring that the work will enter the public domain and ensuring that the author has received “a fair return for [her] labors.” <i>Harper &amp; Row</i>, 471 U.S. at 5463. This limited grant “is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors . . . by the provision of a special reward, and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired.” <i>Sony Corp. of America v. Univ. City Studios, Inc.</i>, 464 U.S. 417, 429 (1984). The public is protected in two ways: the grant of a copyright encourages authors to create new works, . . . and the limitation ensures that the works will eventually enter the public domain, which protects the public’s right of access and use.</p>
<p id="c551424b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>3. Exclusive Rights of the Author</i></p>
<p id="c551424c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Copyright Clause grants the author limited exclusive rights in order to encourage the creation of original works. Before our copyright jurisprudence developed, there were two separate theories of copyright in England — the natural law copyright, which was the right of first publication, and the statutory copyright, which was the right of continued publication. The natural law copyright, which is not a part of our system, implied an ownership in the work itself, and thus was preferred by the <span title="198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-198">p. 198</span>booksellers and publishers striving to maintain their monopoly over literature as well as by the Crown to silence “seditious” writings. Even after passage of the Statute of Anne, the publishers and booksellers resisted the loss of their monopoly in the courts for more than sixty years. Finally, in 1774, the House of Lords ruled that the natural law copyright, that is, the ownership of the work itself, expires upon publication of the book, when the statutory copyright attaches.</p>
<p id="c551424d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This bifurcated system was carried over into our copyright law. As of the 1909 Act, an author had “state common law protection [that] persisted until the moment of general publication.” <i>Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr. v. CBS, Inc.</i>, 194 F.3d 1211, 1214 (11th Cir. 1999). After the work was published, the author was entitled to federal statutory copyright protection if she had complied with certain federal requirements (i.e. publication with notice). If not, the work was released into the public domain. The system illustrates that the author’s ownership is in the copyright, and not in the work itself, for if the author had an ownership interest in the work itself, she would not lose that right if she published the book without complying with federal statutory copyright requirements. Compliance with the copyright law results in the guarantee of copyright to the author for a limited time, but the author never owns the work itself.</p>

There are “conflicting interests that must be accommodated in drawing a definitional balance” between the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment. 1 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> §1.10[B][1] (2001). In establishing this balance “on the copyright side, economic encouragement for creators must be preserved and the privacy of unpublished works recognized. Freedom of speech[, on the other hand,] requires the preservation of a meaningful public or democratic dialogue, as well as the uses of speech as a safety valve against violent acts, and as an end in itself.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5514252-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In copyright law, the balance between the First Amendment and copyright is preserved, in part, by the idea/expression dichotomy and the doctrine of fair use.</p>
<p id="c5514253-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>1. The Idea/Expression Dichotomy</i></p>
<p id="c5514254-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Copyright cannot protect an idea, only the expression of that idea. The result is that “copyright assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages <span title="199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-199">p. 199</span>others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by the work.” <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.</i>, 499 U.S. 340, 349-350 (1991). It is partly through this idea/expression dichotomy that copyright law embodies the First Amendment’s underlying goal of encouraging open debate and the free exchange of ideas. Holding an infringer liable in copyright for copying the expression of another author’s ideas does not impede First Amendment goals because the public purpose has been served — the public already has access to the idea or the concepts. A new author may use or discuss the idea, but must do so using her own original expression.</p>

Had fair use not been recognized as a right under the 1976 Act, the statutory abandonment of publication as a condition of copyright that had existed for over 200 years would have jeopardized the constitutionality of the new Act because there would be no statutory guarantee that new ideas, or new expressions of old ideas, would be accessible to the public. Included in the definition of fair use are “purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . . , scholarship, or research.” §107. The exceptions carved out for these purposes are at the heart of fair use’s protection of the First Amendment, as they allow later authors to use a previous author’s copyright to introduce new ideas or concepts to the public. Therefore, within the limits of the fair-use test, any use of a copyright is permitted to fulfill one of the important purposes listed in the statute.</p>
<p id="c5516968-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the First Amendment principles built into copyright law through the idea/expression dichotomy and the doctrine of fair use, courts often need not entertain related First Amendment arguments in a copyright case.</p>

Therefore, the narrower question in this case is to what extent a critic may use the protected elements of an original work of authorship to communicate her criticism without infringing the copyright in that work. As will be discussed below, this becomes essentially an analysis of the fair use factors. As we turn to the analysis required in this case, we must remain cognizant of the First Amendment protections interwoven into copyright law.</p>

<p id="c551696e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first step in evaluating the likelihood that SunTrust will succeed on merits is to determine whether it has established the prima facie elements of a copyright infringement claim: (1) that SunTrust owns a valid copyright in GWTW and (2) that Randall copied <i>original</i> elements of GWTW in TWDG.</p>
<p id="c551696f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first element, SunTrust’s ownership of a valid copyright in GWTW, is not disputed. Houghton Mifflin does assert, however, that SunTrust did not establish the second element of infringement, that TWDG appropriates copyright-protected expression from GWTW. In order to prove copying, SunTrust was required to show a “substantial similarity” between the two works such that “an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work.” Not all copying of a work is actionable, however, for . . . “no author may copyright facts or ideas. The copyright is limited to those aspects of the work-termed expression’ that display the stamp of the author’s originality.” <i>Harper &amp; Row</i>, 471 U.S. at 547. Thus, we are concerned with substantial similarities between TWDG and GWTW only to the extent that they involve the copying of original, protected expression.</p>
<p id="c5516970-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no bright line that separates the protectable expression from the nonprotectable idea in a work of fiction. . . . At one end of the spectrum, <i>scenes a faire</i> — the stock scenes and hackneyed character types that “naturally flow from a common theme” — are considered “ideas,” and therefore are not copyrightable. But as plots become more intricately detailed and characters become more idiosyncratic, they at some point cross the line into “expression” and are protected by copyright.</p>
<p id="c5519081-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our own review of the two works reveals substantial use of GWTW. TWDG appropriates numerous characters, settings, and plot twists from GWTW. For example, Scarlett O’Hara, Rhett Butler, Bonnie Butler, Melanie Wilkes, Ashley Wilkes, Gerald O’Hara, Ellen O’Hara, Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, Prissy, Belle Watling, Carreen O’Hara, Stuart and Brenton Tarleton, Jeems, Philippe, and Aunt Pittypat, all characters in GWTW, appear in TWDG. Many of these characters are renamed in TWDG: Scarlett becomes “Other,” Rhett Butler becomes “R.B.,” Pork becomes “Garlic,” Prissy becomes “Miss Priss,” Philippe becomes “Feleepe,” Aunt Pittypat becomes “Aunt Pattypit,” etc. In several instances, Randall renamed characters using Mitchell’s descriptions of those characters in GWTW: Ashley becomes “Dreamy Gentleman,” Melanie becomes “Mealy Mouth,” Gerald becomes “Planter.” The fictional settings from GWTW receive a similarly transparent renaming in TWDG: Tara becomes “Tata,” Twelve Oaks Plantation becomes “Twelve Slaves Strong as Trees.” TWDG copies, often in wholesale fashion, the descriptions and histories of these fictional characters and places from GWTW, as well as their relationships and interactions with one another. TWDG appropriates or otherwise explicitly references many aspects of GWTW’s plot as well, <span title="201" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-201">p. 201</span>such as the scenes in which Scarlett kills a Union soldier and the scene in which Rhett stays in the room with his dead daughter Bonnie, burning candles. After carefully comparing the two works, we agree with the district court that, particularly in its first half, TWDG is largely “an encapsulation of [GWTW] [that] exploits its copyrighted characters, story lines, and settings as the palette for the new story.”</p>

<p id="c551b799-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">§107. In assessing whether a use of a copyright is a fair use under the statute, we bear in mind that the examples of possible fair uses given are illustrative rather than exclusive, and that “all [of the four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together in light of the purposes of copyright.” <i>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</i>, 510 U.S. 569, 557-578 (1994). [O]ne of the most important purposes to consider is the free flow of ideas — particularly criticism and commentary.</p>
<p id="c551b79a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Houghton Mifflin argues that TWDG is entitled to fair-use protection as a parody of GWTW. In <i>Campbell</i>, the Supreme Court held that parody, although not specifically listed in §107, is a form of comment and criticism that may constitute a fair use of the copyrighted work being parodied. Parody, which is directed toward a particular literary or artistic work, is distinguishable from satire, which more broadly addresses the institutions and mores of a slice of society. Thus, “parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim’s . . . imagination, whereas satire can stand on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of borrowing.”</p>
<p id="c551b79b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before considering a claimed fair-use defense based on parody, however, the Supreme Court has required that we ensure that “a parodic character may reasonably be perceived” in the allegedly infringing work. The Supreme Court’s definition of parody in <i>Campbell</i>, however, is somewhat vague. On the one hand, the Court suggests that the aim of parody is “comic effect or ridicule,” but it then proceeds to discuss parody more expansively in terms of its “commentary” on the original. In light of the admonition in <i>Campbell</i> that courts should not judge the quality of the work or the success of the attempted humor in discerning its parodic character, we choose to take the <span title="202" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-202">p. 202</span>broader view. For purposes of our fair-use analysis, we will treat a work as a parody if its aim is to comment upon or criticize a prior work by appropriating elements of the original in creating a new artistic, as opposed to scholarly or journalistic, work. Under this definition, the parodic character of TWDG is clear. TWDG is not a general commentary upon the Civil-War-era American South, but a specific criticism of and rejoinder to the depiction of slavery and the relationships between blacks and whites in GWTW. The fact that Randall chose to convey her criticisms of GWTW through a work of fiction, which she contends is a more powerful vehicle for her message than a scholarly article, does not, in and of itself, deprive TWDG of fair-use protection. We therefore proceed to an analysis of the four fair-use factors.</p>
<p id="c551b79c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>i. Purpose and Character of the Work</i></p>
<p id="c551dead-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first factor in the fair-use analysis, the purpose and character of the allegedly infringing work, has several facets. The first is whether TWDG serves a commercial purpose or nonprofit educational purpose. §107(1). Despite whatever educational function TWDG may be able to lay claim to, it is undoubtedly a commercial product. . . . The fact that TWDG was published for profit is the first factor weighing against a finding of fair use.</p>
<p id="c551deae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, TWDG’s for-profit status is strongly overshadowed and outweighed in view of its highly transformative use of GWTC’s copyrighted elements. “The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 579. “The goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.” <i>Id.</i> A work’s transformative value is of special import in the realm of parody, since a parody’s aim is, by nature, to transform an earlier work.</p>
<p id="c551deaf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second factor in the “purpose and character” analysis relevant to this case is to what extent TWDG’s use of copyrighted elements of GWTW can be said to be “transformative.” The inquiry is “whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 579. The issue of transformation is a double-edged sword in this case. On the one hand, the story of Cynara and her perception of the events in TWDG certainly adds new “expression, meaning, [and] message” to GWTW. From another perspective, however, TWDG’s success as a pure work of fiction depends heavily on copyrighted elements appropriated from GWTW to carry its own plot forward.</p>
<p id="c551deb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, as noted above, TWDG is more than an abstract, pure fictional work. It is principally and purposefully a critical statement that seeks to rebut and destroy the perspective, judgments, and mythology of GWTW. Randall’s literary goal is to explode the romantic, idealized portrait of the antebellum South during and after the Civil War. In the world of GWTW, the white characters comprise a noble aristocracy whose idyllic existence is upset only by the intrusion of Yankee soldiers, and, eventually, by the liberation of the black slaves. Through her characters as well as through direct narration, Mitchell describes how both blacks and whites were purportedly better off in <span title="203" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-203">p. 203</span>the days of slavery: “The more I see of emancipation the more criminal I think it is. It’s just ruined the darkies,” says Scarlett O’Hara. Free blacks are described as “creatures of small intelligence . . . like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they ran wild — either from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance.” Blacks elected to the legislature are described as spending “most of their time eating goobers and easing their unaccustomed feet into and out of new shoes.”</p>
<p id="c551deb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the district court noted: “The earlier work is a third-person epic, whereas the new work is told in the first-person as an intimate diary of the life of Cynara. Thematically, the new work provides a different viewpoint of the antebellum world.” While told from a different perspective, more critically, the story is transformed into a very different tale, albeit much more abbreviated. Cynara’s very language is a departure from Mitchell’s original prose; she acts as the voice of Randall’s inversion of GWTW. She is the vehicle of parody; she is its means — not its end. It is clear within the first fifty pages of Cynara’s fictional diary that Randall’s work flips GWTW’s traditional race roles, portrays powerful whites as stupid or feckless, and generally sets out to demystify GWTW and strip the romanticism from Mitchell’s specific account of this period of our history. Approximately the last half of TWDG tells a completely new story that, although involving characters based on GWTW characters, features plot elements found nowhere within the covers of GWTW.</p>
<p id="c551deb2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where Randall refers directly to Mitchell’s plot and characters, she does so in service of her general attack on GWTW. In GWTW, Scarlett O’Hara often expresses disgust with and condescension towards blacks; in TWDG, Other, Scarlett’s counterpart, is herself of mixed descent. In GWTW, Ashley Wilkes is the initial object of Scarlett’s affection; in TWDG, he is homosexual. In GWTW, Rhett Butler does not consort with black female characters and is portrayed as the captain of his own destiny. In TWDG, Cynara ends her affair with Rhett’s counterpart, R., to begin a relationship with a black Congressman; R. ends up a washed out former cad. In TWDG, nearly every black character is given some redeeming quality — whether depth, wit, cunning, beauty, strength, or courage — that their GWTW analogues lacked.</p>
<p id="c551deb3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of this, we find it difficult to conclude that Randall simply tried to “avoid the drudgery in working up something fresh.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 580. It is hard to imagine how Randall could have specifically criticized GWTW without depending heavily upon copyrighted elements of that book. A parody is a work that seeks to comment upon or criticize another work by appropriating elements of the original. “Parody needs to mimic an original to make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its victim’s (or collective victims’) imagination.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 580-581. Thus, Randall has fully employed those conscripted elements from GWTW to make war against it. Her work, TWDG, reflects transformative value because it “can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 579.</p>
<p id="c551deb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While “transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use, . . . the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors.” <i>Id.</i> In the case of TWDG, consideration of this factor certainly militates in favor <span title="204" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-204">p. 204</span>of a finding of fair use, and, informs our analysis of the other factors, particularly the fourth, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="c551deb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>ii. Nature of the Copyrighted Work</i></p>
<p id="c551deb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second factor, the nature of the copyrighted work, recognizes that there is a hierarchy of copyright protection in which original, creative works are afforded greater protection than derivative works or factual compilations. GWTW is undoubtedly entitled to the greatest degree of protection as an original work of fiction. This factor is given little weight in parody cases, however, “since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive works.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 586.</p>
<p id="c551deb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>iii. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used</i></p>
<p id="c551deb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third fair-use factor is “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.” §107(3). It is at this point that parody presents uniquely difficult problems for courts in the fair-use context, for “parody’s humor, or in any event its comment, necessarily springs from recognizable allusion to its object through distorted imitation. . . . When parody takes aim at a particular original work, the parody must be able to conjure up’ at least enough of that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 588. Once enough has been taken to “conjure up” the original in the minds of the readership, any further taking must specifically serve the new work’s parodic aims.</p>
<p id="c551deb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">GWTW is one of the most famous, popular, and enduring American novels ever written. Given the fame of the work and its primary characters, SunTrust argues that very little reference is required to conjure up GWTW. As we have already indicated in our discussion of substantial similarity, TWDG appropriates a substantial portion of the protected elements of GWTW. Houghton Mifflin argues that TWDG takes nothing from GWTW that does not serve a parodic purpose, the crux of the argument being that a large number of characters had to be taken from GWTW because each represents a different ideal or stereotype that requires commentary, and that the work as a whole could not be adequately commented upon without revisiting substantial portions of the plot, including its most famous scenes.</p>
<p id="c551deba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are numerous instances in which TWDG appropriates elements of GWTW and then transforms them for the purpose of commentary. TWDG uses several of GWTW’s most famous lines, but vests them with a completely new significance. For example, the final lines of GWTW, “Tomorrow, I’ll think of some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day,” are transformed in TWDG into “For all those we love for whom tomorrow will not be another day, we send the sweet prayer of resting in peace.”</p>
<p id="c551debb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, however, we are told that not all of TWDG’s takings from GWTW are clearly justified as commentary. We have already determined that TWDG is a parody, but not every parody is a fair use. SunTrust contends that TWDG, at least at the margins, takes more of the protected elements of GWTW than was necessary to serve a parodic function.</p>
<p id="c551debc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in a sworn declaration to the district court, Randall stated that she needed to reference the scene from GWTW in which Jeems is given to the Tarleton <span title="205" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-205">p. 205</span>twins as a birthday present because she considers it “perhaps the single most repellent paragraph in Margaret Mitchell’s novel: a black child given to two white children as a birthday present . . . as if the buying and selling of children thus had no moral significance.” Clearly, such a scene is fair game for criticism. However, in this instance, SunTrust argues that TWDG goes beyond commentary on the occurrence itself, appropriating such nonrelevant details as the fact that the twins had red hair and were killed at Gettysburg. There are several other scenes from GWTW, such as the incident in which Scarlett threw a vase at Ashley while Rhett was hidden on the couch, that are retold or alluded to without serving any apparent parodic purpose. Similar taking of the descriptions of characters and the minor details of their histories and interactions that arguably are not essential to the parodic purpose of the work recur throughout. . . . But we must determine whether the use is fair. In doing so, we are reminded that literary relevance is a highly subjective analysis ill-suited for judicial inquiry. Thus we are presented with conflicting and opposing arguments relative to the amount taken and whether it was too much or a necessary amount.</p>
<p id="c551debd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court in <i>Campbell</i> did not require that parodists take the bare minimum amount of copyright material necessary to conjure up the original work. Parody “must be able to conjure up <i>at least</i> enough of [the] original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 588.</p>
<p id="c55205ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A use does not necessarily become infringing the moment it does more than simply conjure up another work. Rather, “once enough has been taken to assure identification, how much more is reasonable will depend, say [1] on the extent to which the [work’s] <i>overriding purpose and character is to parody</i> the original or, in contrast [2] the likelihood that the parody may serve as <i>a market substitute</i> for the original.” <i>Campbell</i>, 510 U.S. at 588. As to the first point, it is manifest that TWDG’s <i>raison d’etre</i> is to parody GWTW. The second point indicates that any material we suspect is “extraneous” to the parody is unlawful only if it negatively effects the potential market for or value of the original copyright. Based upon this record at this juncture, we cannot determine in any conclusive way whether “ the quantity and value of the materials used’ are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.” <i>Id.</i> at 586.</p>

In fact it’s not even past.” In the film, Pender says: “The past is not dead. Actually, it’s not even past. You know who said that? Faulkner, and he was right. I met him too. I ran into him at a dinner party.” The owner of the Faulkner literary rights sued Sony Picture Classics, the studio behind <i>Midnight in Paris</i>, for copyright infringement. The federal district court granted Sony’s motion to dismiss, holding that the film’s quotation constituted fair use. “How Hollywood’s flattering and artful use of literary allusion is a point of litigation, not celebration, is beyond this court’s comprehension. The court, in its appreciation for both William Faulkner as well as the homage paid him in Woody Allen’s film, is more likely to suppose that the film indeed helped the plaintiff and the market value of <i>Requiem</i> if it had any effect at all.” <i>Faulkner Literary Rights, LLC v.

However, the Supreme Court and other appeals courts have made clear that, particularly in cases of parody, evidence of harm to the potential market for or value of the original copyright is crucial to a fair use determination. . . . </p>

Thus, we conclude, based on the current record, that SunTrust’s evidence falls far short of establishing that TWDG or others like it will act as market substitutes for GWTW or will significantly harm its derivatives.

The court determined that, although scholars generally are not paid for the articles they produce in scholarly journals, the journals themselves lost income they would have garnered had Texaco negotiated licensing fees with the journal publishers or purchased enough copies for use by its scientists who wanted to archive copies.

Although J.K. Rowling was a fan of the web site, when Vander Ark made plans to publish the encyclopedia in book form, as an A-to-Z guide to the creatures, characters, objects, events, and places that exist in the world of <i>Harry Potter</i>, she sued to enjoin the publication because she was planning to publish her own encyclopedia about the series. The court found the encyclopedia to violate Rowling’s copyright because it copied so much of the original works. “Most of the Lexicon’s 2,437 entries contain direct quotations or paraphrases, plot details, or summaries of scenes from one or more of the <i>Harry Potter</i> novels. Although hundreds of pages or thousands of fictional facts may amount to only a <span title="208" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-208">p. 208</span>fraction of the seven-book series, this quantum of copying is sufficient to support a finding of substantial similarity where the copied expression is entirely the product of the original author’s imagination and creation.” <i>Warner Bros.

However, the court found the encyclopedia not to constitute a fair use. Although the “purpose and character” of the encyclopedia were “transformative,” the “commercial nature” of the intended publication counted heavily against finding a fair use, and it often copied more than necessary for its informative purposes and thus “appropriates too much of Rowling’s creative work for its purposes as a reference guide.” <i>Id.</i> at 553.

<p id="c5525403-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many European countries, artists have the right to prevent the mutilation or alteration of their artworks after the works have been sold. This legally protected interest is called <b>moral right</b>, or <i>droit moral</i>. Artworks protected by moral rights are effectively encumbered by a covenant, which “runs with” the artwork when it is sold, creating an obligation on the part of the owner not to mutilate the artwork so as to destroy the artist’s vision. Such rights are generally inalienable; they interpret the interest in preserving the artist’s vision as a collective good that benefits the community and that cannot be traded away.</p>
<p id="c5525404-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until recently, moral rights were not recognized in the United States. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Vargas v. Esquire</i>, 164 F.2d 522 (7th Cir. 1947); <i>Crimi v. Rutger’s Presbyterian Church</i>, 89 N.Y.S.2d 813 (Sup. Ct. 1949). In 1979, however, California passed the <i>California Art Preservation Act</i>, Cal. Civ. Code §§987-989, which permits injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees for intentional or threatened mutilation or alteration of an artist’s work. A bill was passed in New York in 1983 prohibiting alterations that would harm the artist’s reputation. <i>New York Artists’ Authorship Rights Act</i>, N.Y. Arts &amp; Cult. Aff. Law §14.03(1). Moral rights legislation has been passed in at least nine states. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Conn. Gen. Stat. §42-116; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §85S; Pa. Stat. tit. 73, §§2101-2110; R.I. Gen. Laws §5-62-2(e); 3 M. Nimmer &amp; D. Nimmer, <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> §8D.02[A] (2011).</p>
<p id="c5525405-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1990, Congress passed the <i>Visual Artists Rights Act</i> (VARA), 17 U.S.C. §§101, 106a, and 113, granting living artists rights to protect “works of visual art” unless the works are “made for hire,” <i>id.</i> §101(B), or are “applied art,” meaning “ornamentation or decoration that is affixed to otherwise utilitarian objects,” <i>Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.</i>, 71 F.3d 77, 84-85 (2d Cir. 1995). The statute grants the artist the right to prevent “any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of [the] work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation,” 17 U.S.C. §106a(a)(3)(A), and to prevent any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work of “recognized <span title="209" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-209">p. 209</span>stature,” <i>id.</i> §106a(a)(3)(B). Owners of buildings can remove works of art, such as murals, floor mosaics, or architectural components, if they can do so without destroying or mutilating them, so long as they make a good faith effort to notify the artist. <i>Id.</i> §113(d)(2). The artist’s right to prevent mutilation of the work that is part of a building is lost if the artist fails to remove the work or pay for its removal. If the artwork cannot be removed without destroying it, the artist who has not waived her right to do so may have the power to prevent destruction of the work and therefore may have the extraordinary power to control whether the building is renovated, destroyed, or redeveloped. Building developers ordinarily require artists to waive their rights to prevent destruction of the work when they are embedded in a building such that they cannot be removed without destroying them. Note that only works of “recognized stature” are protected from destruction. <i>Cf. Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.</i>, 288 F. Supp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2003) (VARA does not prevent removal of sculptures from a public park, even though they were specifically designed for that terrain and location, and the artist thought separation from the setting would destroy the artistic integrity of the sculptures); <i>Phillips v.

<p id="c5527b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The human genome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each gene is encoded as DNA, which takes the shape of the familiar “double helix” that Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first described in 1953. Each “cross-bar” in the DNA helix consists of two chemically joined nucleotides. The possible nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), <span title="210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-210">p. 210</span>each of which binds naturally with another nucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. The nucleotide cross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate backbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA helix. Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino acids, which in turn are used in the body to build proteins. Only some DNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these nucleotides are known as “exons.” Nucleotides that do not code for amino acids, in contrast, are known as “introns.”</p>
<p id="c5527b22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Creation of proteins from DNA involves two principal steps, known as transcription and translation. In transcription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate, and the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands. A single strand is used as a template to create a complementary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The nucleotides on the DNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with the exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). Transcription results in a single strand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleotides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which it was created. Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corresponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA molecule. The pre-RNA is then naturally “spliced” by the physical removal of the introns. The resulting product is a strand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding only to the exons from the original DNA strand. The exons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which creates amino acids through translation. In translation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each set of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA. Each codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20 possible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop signal that ends amino acid production.</p>
<p id="c5527b23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DNA’s informational sequences and the processes that create mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally within cells. Scientists can, however, extract DNA from cells using well known laboratory methods. These methods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA — for instance, a particular gene or part of a gene — which can then be further studied, manipulated, or used. It is also possible to create DNA synthetically through processes similarly well known in the field of genetics. One such method begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the natural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new, synthetic DNA molecule. The result is the inverse of the mRNA’s inverse image of the original DNA, with one important distinction: Because the natural creation of mRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic DNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon sequences. This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory from mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).</p>

Before Myriad’s discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in establishing a woman’s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, but they did not know which genes were associated with those cancers.</p>

That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to develop medical tests that are useful for detecting mutations in a patient’s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby assessing whether the patient has an increased risk of cancer.</p>
<p id="c5527b26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number of patents. Myriad’s patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive right to isolate an individual’s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (or any strand of 15 or more nucleotides within the genes) by breaking the covalent bonds that connect the DNA to the rest of the individual’s genome. The patents would also give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create BRCA cDNA. In Myriad’s view, manipulating BRCA DNA in either of these fashions triggers its “right to exclude others from making” its patented composition of matter under the Patent Act. 35 U.S.C. §154(a)(1); see also §271(a) (“[W]hoever without authority makes . . . any patented invention . . . infringes the patent”).</p>
<p id="c5527b27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But isolation is necessary to conduct genetic testing, and Myriad was not the only entity to offer BRCA testing after it discovered the genes. The University of Pennsylvania’s Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided genetic testing services to women. Petitioner Dr. Harry Ostrer, then a researcher at New York University School of Medicine, routinely sent his patients’ DNA samples to GDL for testing. After learning of GDL’s testing and Ostrer’s activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting that the genetic testing infringed Myriad’s patents. In response, GDL agreed to stop testing and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept patient samples. Myriad also filed patent infringement suits against other entities that performed BRCA testing, resulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to cease all allegedly infringing activity. Myriad, thus, solidified its position as the only entity providing BRCA testing.</p>
<p id="c5527b28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some years later, petitioner Ostrer, along with medical patients, advocacy groups, and other doctors, filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration that Myriad’s patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C. §101.</p>

Rather, “ they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work’ ” that lie beyond the domain of patent protection. <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 2). As the Court has explained, without this exception, there would be considerable danger that the grant of patents would “tie up” the use of such tools and thereby “inhibit future innovation premised upon them.” <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 17). This would be at odds with the very point of patents, which exist to promote creation. <i>Diamond v.

<p id="c5527b2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule against patents on naturally occurring things is not without limits, however, for “all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas,” and “too broad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscerate patent law.” 566 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As we have recognized before, patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating “incentives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery” and “imped[ing] the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.” <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 23). We must apply this well-established standard to determine whether Myriad’s patents claim any “new and useful . . . composition of matter,” §101, or instead claim naturally occurring phenomena.</p>
<p id="c5527b2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that Myriad did not create or alter any of the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The location and order of the nucleotides existed in nature before Myriad found them. Nor did Myriad create or alter the genetic structure of DNA. Instead, Myriad’s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13. The question is whether this renders the genes patentable.</p>
<p id="c5527b2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Myriad recognizes that our decision in <i>Chakrabarty</i> is central to this inquiry. In <i>Chakrabarty</i>, scientists added four plasmids to a bacterium, which enabled it to break down various components of crude oil. The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable. It explained that the patent claim was “not to a hitherto unknown natural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter — a product of human ingenuity having a distinctive name, character [and] use.’ ” The <i>Chakrabarty</i> bacterium was new “with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature,” 447 U.S., at 310, due to the additional plasmids and resultant “capacity for degrading oil.” In this case, by contrast, Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention.</p>
<p id="c5527b30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the §101 inquiry. In <i>Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co</i>., 333 U.S. 127 (1948), this Court considered a composition patent that claimed a mixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that helped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and fix it in the soil. <i>Id</i>., at 128-129. The ability of the bacteria to fix nitrogen was well known, and farmers commonly “inoculated” their crops with them to improve soil nitrogen levels. But farmers could not use the same inoculant for all crops, both because plants use different bacteria and because certain bacteria inhibit each other. <i>Id</i>., at 129-130. Upon learning that several nitrogen-fixing bacteria did not inhibit each other, however, the patent applicant combined them into a single inoculant and obtained a patent. <i>Id</i>., at 130. The Court held that the composition was not patent eligible because the patent holder did not alter the bacteria in any way. <i>Id</i>., at 132 (“There is no way in which we could call [the bacteria mixture a product of invention] unless we borrowed invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself”). His patent claim thus fell squarely within the law of nature exception. So do Myriad’s. Myriad <span title="213" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-213">p. 213</span>found the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render the BRCA genes “new . . . composition[s] of matter,” §101, that are patent eligible.</p>
<p id="c5527b31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many of Myriad’s patent descriptions simply detail the “iterative process” of discovery by which Myriad narrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it sought.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10872_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10872_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> Myriad seeks to import these extensive research efforts into the §101 patent-eligibility inquiry.

<p id="c5527b33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor are Myriad’s claims saved by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and thereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule. Myriad’s claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemical changes that result from the isolation of a particular section of DNA. Instead, the claims understandably focus on the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. If the patents depended upon the creation of a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could arguably avoid at least Myriad’s patent claims on entire genes by isolating a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair. Such a molecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule “invented” by Myriad. But Myriad obviously would resist that outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with the information contained in the genetic sequence, not with the specific chemical composition of a particular molecule.</p>

One company, Gene by Gene, Ltd., offered tests priced at $995. Myriad responded by suing the companies under patent claims that had not been at issue in the Supreme Court litigation.

As already explained, creation of a cDNA sequence from mRNA results in an exons-only molecule that is not naturally occurring. Petitioners concede that cDNA differs from natural DNA in that “the non-coding regions have been removed.” They nevertheless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because “[t]he nucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by the lab technician.” That may be so, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a “product of nature” and is patent eligible under §101, except insofar as very short series of DNA may have no intervening introns to remove when <span title="214" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-214">p. 214</span>creating cDNA.

Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA were well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad’s patents “were well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for a gene would likely have utilized a similar approach,” 702 F. Supp. 2d, at 202-203, and are not at issue in this case.</p>
<p id="c552a24b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, “[a]s the first party with knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences, Myriad was in an excellent position to claim applications of that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are limited to such applications.” 689 F.3d, at 1349.</p>
<p id="c552a24c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we consider the patentability of DNA in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered. Scientific alteration of the genetic code presents a different inquiry, and we express no opinion about the application of §101 to such endeavors.

The syrup and water are mixed together immediately before the beverage is dispensed, which is usually after the consumer requests the beverage. In contrast, in a “pre-mix” beverage dispenser, the syrup concentrate and water are pre-mixed and the beverage is stored in <span title="215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-215">p. 215</span>a display reservoir bowl until it is ready to be dispensed. The display bowl is said to stimulate impulse buying by providing the consumer with a visual beverage display. A pre-mix display bowl, however, has a limited capacity and is subject to contamination by bacteria. It therefore must be refilled and cleaned frequently.</p>
<p id="c552c965-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The invention claimed in the ’405 patent is a post-mix beverage dispenser that is designed to look like a pre-mix beverage dispenser. The claims require the post-mix dispenser to have a transparent bowl that is filled with a fluid that simulates the appearance of the dispensed beverage and is resistant to bacterial growth. The claims also require that the dispenser create the visual impression that the bowl is the principal source of the dispensed beverage, although in fact the beverage is mixed immediately before it is dispensed, as in conventional post-mix dispensers.</p>

The court explained that the purpose of the invention “is to create an illusion, whereby customers believe that the fluid contained in the bowl is the actual beverage that they are receiving, when of course it is not.” Although the court acknowledged Juicy Whip’s argument that the invention provides an accurate representation of the dispensed beverage for the consumer’s benefit while eliminating the need for retailers to clean their display bowls, the court concluded that those claimed reasons for the patent’s utility “are not independent of its deceptive purpose, and are thus insufficient to raise a disputed factual issue to present to a jury.” The court further held that the invention lacked utility because it “improves the prior art only to the extent that it increases the salability of beverages dispensed from post-mix dispensers”; an invention lacks utility, the court stated, if it confers no benefit to the public other than the opportunity for making a product more salable. Finally, the court ruled that the invention lacked utility because it “is merely an imitation of the pre-mix dispenser,” and thus does not constitute a new and useful machine.</p>

<p id="c552c96b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 101 of the Patent Act of 1952, 35 U.S.C. §101, provides that “[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,” may obtain a patent on the invention or discovery. The threshold of utility is not high: An invention is “useful” under section 101 if it is capable of providing some identifiable benefit. <i>See Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc</i>., 977 F.2d 1555, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (“To violate §101 the claimed device must be totally incapable of achieving a useful result”); <i>Fuller v. Berger</i>, 120 F. 274, 275 (7th Cir. 1903) (test for utility is whether invention “is incapable of serving any beneficial end”).</p>
<p id="c552c96c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, since Justice Story’s opinion in <i>Lowell v. Lewis</i>, 15 F. Cas. 1018 (C.C.D. Mass. 1817), it has been stated that inventions that are “injurious to the well-being, good policy, or sound morals of society” are unpatentable. As examples of such inventions, Justice Story listed “a new invention to poison people, or to promote debauchery, or to facilitate private assassination.” <i>Id</i>. at 1019. Courts have continued to recite Justice Story’s formulation, but the principle that inventions are invalid if they are principally designed to serve immoral or illegal purposes has not been applied broadly in recent years. For example, years ago courts invalidated patents on gambling devices on the ground that they were immoral, but that is no longer the law.</p>
<p id="c552c96d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In holding the patent in this case invalid for lack of utility, the district court relied on two Second Circuit cases dating from the early years of this century, <i>Rickard v. Du Bon</i>, 103 F. 868 (2d Cir. 1900), and <i>Scott &amp; Williams v. Aristo Hosiery Co</i>., 7 F.2d 1003 (2d Cir. 1925). In the <i>Rickard</i> case, the court held invalid a patent on a process for treating tobacco plants to make their leaves appear spotted. At the time of the invention, according to the court, cigar smokers considered cigars with spotted wrappers to be of superior quality, and the invention was designed to make unspotted tobacco leaves appear to be of the spotted — and thus more desirable — type. The court noted that <span title="217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-217">p. 217</span>the invention did not promote the burning quality of the leaf or improve its quality in any way; “the only effect, if not the only object, of such treatment, is to spot the tobacco, and counterfeit the leaf spotted by natural causes.” 103 F. at 869.</p>
<p id="c552c96e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Aristo Hosiery</i> case concerned a patent claiming a seamless stocking with a structure on the back of the stocking that imitated a seamed stocking. The imitation was commercially useful because at the time of the invention many consumers regarded seams in stockings as an indication of higher quality. The court noted that the imitation seam did not “change or improve the structure or the utility of the article,” and that the record in the case justified the conclusion that true seamed stockings were superior to the seamless stockings that were the subject of the patent. <i>See Aristo Hosiery</i>, 7 F.2d at 1004. “At best,” the court stated, “the seamless stocking has imitation marks for the purposes of deception, and the idea prevails that with such imitation the article is more salable.” <i>Id</i>. That was not enough, the court concluded, to render the invention patentable.</p>
<p id="c552f07f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We decline to follow <i>Rickard</i> and <i>Aristo Hosiery</i>, as we do not regard them as representing the correct view of the doctrine of utility under the Patent Act of 1952. The fact that one product can be altered to make it look like another is in itself a specific benefit sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement of utility.</p>
<p id="c552f080-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not at all unusual for a product to be designed to appear to viewers to be something it is not. For example, cubic zirconium is designed to simulate a diamond, imitation gold leaf is designed to imitate real gold leaf, synthetic fabrics are designed to simulate expensive natural fabrics, and imitation leather is designed to look like real leather. In each case, the invention of the product or process that makes such imitation possible has “utility” within the meaning of the patent statute, and indeed there are numerous patents directed toward making one product imitate another. <i>See, e.g</i>., U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,968 (method for producing imitation grill marks on food without using heat); U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,038 (laminated flooring imitating wood); U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,545 (imitation hamburger). Much of the value of such products resides in the fact that they appear to be something they are not. Thus, in this case the claimed post-mix dispenser meets the statutory requirement of utility by embodying the features of a post-mix dispenser while imitating the visual appearance of a pre-mix dispenser.</p>
<p id="c552f081-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that customers may believe they are receiving fluid directly from the display tank does not deprive the invention of utility. Orange Bang has not argued that it is unlawful to display a representation of the beverage in the manner that fluid is displayed in the reservoir of the invention, even though the fluid is not what the customer will actually receive. Moreover, even if the use of a reservoir containing fluid that is not dispensed is considered deceptive, that is not by itself sufficient to render the invention unpatentable. The requirement of “utility” in patent law is not a directive to the Patent and Trademark Office or the courts to serve as arbiters of deceptive trade practices. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration, are assigned the task of protecting consumers from fraud and deception in the sale of food products.</p>
<p id="c552f082-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, Congress is free to declare particular types of inventions unpatentable for a variety of reasons, including deceptiveness. <i>Cf.</i> 42 U.S.C. §2181(a) (exempting <span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-218">p. 218</span>from patent protection inventions useful solely in connection with special nuclear material or atomic weapons). Until such time as Congress does so, however, we find no basis in section 101 to hold that inventions can be ruled unpatentable for lack of utility simply because they have the capacity to fool some members of the public. The district court therefore erred in holding that the invention of the ’405 patent lacks utility because it deceives the public through imitation in a manner that is designed to increase product sales.</p>

<p id="c552f085-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Patents in living things.</b> As the Court reaffirmed in <i>Myriad</i>, it is possible to obtain a patent in living things, such as bacteria or plant varieties. The key is that the organism not be naturally occurring. It must instead be the product of human manipulation and satisfy the general requirements of patentability. <i>See Diamond v. Chakrabarty</i>, 447 U.S. 303 (1980) (allowing a patent in genetically modified bacteria).</p>
<p id="c552f086-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Natural phenomena, laws of nature, and abstract ideas.</b> Why should the question whether a substance (or organism) is naturally occurring be decisive for the question of patentability? In addition to naturally occurring substances (“natural phenomena”), abstract principles and laws of nature are also not patentable, even when discovering them requires the investment of substantial resources and effort. <i>See Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</i>, 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012). Does the distinction make sense for a Lockean theory of intellectual property? A utilitarian theory? A Hegelian theory? Which principles, if any, do these exclusions from patentability all share? In <i>Mayo</i>, the Court invalidated a patent that claimed a method for measuring certain metabolites in a patient’s bloodstream in order to determine the appropriate dosage of certain drugs. <i>See</i> 132 S. Ct. at 1294-1296. The Court held that the methods claimed under the patent were “well known in the art” and that the process amounted to “nothing significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients.” <i>Id.</i> at 1298. The Court has described its decision in <i>Mayo</i> as setting out a two-step test for determining whether a claimed patent falls within the “natural phenomenon, laws of nature, and abstract ideas” exclusion. <i>See Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank International</i>, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2355 (2014). In the first step, the Court “determine[s] whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts.” <i>Id.</i> If so, in step two, the Court asks, “What else is there in the claims before us?” <i>Id.</i> This second step is, in the Court’s words, a search for an “inventive concept” that separates the claimed patent from the non-patentable natural phenomenon, law of nature, or abstract idea. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c552f087-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Deceptive patents.</b> Are you convinced by the Federal Circuit’s reasoning in <i>Juicy Whip</i>? If you were the lawyer for Orange Bang, how would you distinguish the examples of cubic zirconium, imitation gold leaf, and synthetic fabrics? Is the sole purpose of those products to fool consumers? Might a consumer, informed of the nature of those products, nonetheless have reasons for wanting to purchase them? Do the products in <i>Rickard</i> and <i>Aristo Hosiery</i> have more in common with the Juicy Whip <span title="219" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-219">p. 219</span>machine in being aimed solely at fooling consumers? Is the shift away from Justice Story’s moral approach to utility a salutary one? Is it the proper role of the PTO to evaluate whether an invention promotes “sound morals”? Is it a proper role for Congress?</p>
<p id="c5531798-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Business methods.</b> Until recently, it was not possible to patent a “business method” because most business and financial innovations were either considered not to be “novel” or to be unpatentable because they did not involve physical processes. However, after the Federal Circuit decided that business methods are patentable, <i>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group</i>, 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the Patent Office has issued hundreds of patents covering methods of doing business.</p>
<p id="c5531799-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What constitutes a “novel” and “nonobvious” business method is hard to sort out. For example, in <i>Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc.</i>, 73 F. Supp. 2d 1228 (W.D. Wash. 1999), <i>rev’d</i>, 239 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001), Amazon.com sued Barnesandnoble.com alleging infringement of Amazon.com’s patent for a “one-click” method for placing purchase orders over the Internet. This method allowed users to place personal information with the company that it could access on later visits to allow the buyer to complete a purchase by one computer mouse click on a “buy” button. Defendant argued that the patent was invalid because the invention of this method was neither novel nor nonobvious. The trial court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction ordering defendant to cease using a similar one-click method on its web site without plaintiff’s consent. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that several prior methods of Internet purchasing <i>did</i> anticipate the one-click method, making it neither novel nor nonobvious. The court therefore denied a preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the trial court.</p>
<p id="c553179a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty of applying the criteria of patentability to business methods, the vagueness of many business methods patents, and questions about whether businesses really need the incentive of a patent in order to generate innovative business models has led to a great deal of dissatisfaction with business methods patents. <i>See, e.g.,</i> David S. Olson, <i>Taking the Utilitarian Basis for Patent Law Seriously</i>, 82 Temp. L. Rev. 181, 227-236 (2009). In <i>Bilski v. Kappos</i>, 561 U.S. 593 (2010), the Supreme Court considered an appeal from a patent applicant whom the PTO had denied a patent for a method of hedging risk in the field of commodities trading in energy markets. The PTO had rejected the application based on the lack of patentable subject matter under §101 of the Patent Act. The Federal Circuit heard the applicant’s appeal en banc and affirmed the PTO’s rejection of the application. In its decision, the Federal Circuit appeared to try to hem in the business methods patent category by holding that a process would only be patentable if it (1) is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) if it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.<i> See In re Bilski</i>, 545 F.3d 943, 959-960 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit’s exclusive “machine-or-transformation” test, concluding that it constituted an improper attempt to cabin the broad language defining the subject matter scope of patentability under §101. “Congress took this permissive approach to patent eligibility to ensure that ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement.” 561 U.S. at 601(internal quotation marks omitted). Only the longstanding (though judicially <span title="220" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-220">p. 220</span>created) prohibitions on patenting “laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas” properly limit the broad reach of §101. <i>See id.</i> Nevertheless, the Court affirmed the denial of the patent application, holding that it represented an impermissible effort to patent the abstract idea of hedging. In a sweeping and exhaustively researched opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Stevens recounted the history and policy of patent law and argued that business methods should not be patentable at all. “The[] many costs of business method patents not only may stifle innovation,” he argued, “but they are also likely to stifle competition.” <i>Id.</i> at 656 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>

<p id="c55317a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice C<span class="epub-small-caps">LARENCE</span> T<span class="epub-small-caps">HOMAS</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c55317a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner eBay operates a popular Internet Web site that allows private sellers to list goods they wish to sell, either through an auction or at a fixed price. Petitioner Half.com, now a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay, operates a similar Web site. Respondent MercExchange, L.L.C., holds a number of patents, including a business method patent for an electronic market designed to facilitate the sale of goods between private individuals by establishing a central authority to promote trust among participants. <i>See</i> U.S. Patent No. 5,845,265. MercExchange sought to license its patent to eBay and Half.com, as it had previously done with other companies, but the parties failed to reach an agreement. MercExchange subsequently filed a patent infringement suit against eBay and Half.com in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. A jury found that MercExchange’s patent was valid, that eBay and Half.com had infringed that patent, and that an award of damages was appropriate.</p>
<p id="c55317a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following the jury verdict, the District Court denied MercExchange’s motion for permanent injunctive relief. 275 F. Supp. 2d 695 (2003). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, applying its “general rule that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances.” 401 F.3d 1323, 1339 (2005). We granted certiorari to determine the appropriateness of this general rule. 546 U.S. 1029 (2005).</p>
<p id="c5533eb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to well-established principles of equity, a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo</i>, 456 U.S. 305, 311-313 (1982); <i>Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell</i>, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987). The decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Romero-Barcelo</i>, 456 U.S., at 320.</p>
<p id="c5533eb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="221" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-221">p. 221</span>These familiar principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the Patent Act. As this Court has long recognized, “a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied.” <i>Id</i>. Nothing in the Patent Act indicates that Congress intended such a departure. To the contrary, the Patent Act expressly provides that injunctions “may” issue “in accordance with the principles of equity.” 35 U.S.C. §283.</p>
<p id="c5533eb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, the Patent Act also declares that “patents shall have the attributes of personal property,” §261, including “the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention,” §154(a)(1). According to the Court of Appeals, this statutory right to exclude alone justifies its general rule in favor of permanent injunctive relief. 401 F.3d, at 1338. But the creation of a right is distinct from the provision of remedies for violations of that right. Indeed, the Patent Act itself indicates that patents shall have the attributes of personal property “[s]ubject to the provisions of this title,” 35 U.S.C. §261, including, presumably, the provision that injunctive relief “may” issue only “in accordance with the principles of equity,” §283.</p>
<p id="c5533eb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This approach is consistent with our treatment of injunctions under the Copyright Act. Like a patent owner, a copyright holder possesses “the right to exclude others from using his property.” <i>Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal</i>, 286 U.S. 123, 127 (1932); <i>see also id</i>. at 127-128 (“A copyright, like a patent, is at once the equivalent given by the public for benefits bestowed by the genius and meditations and skill of individuals and the incentive to further efforts for the same important objects” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like the Patent Act, the Copyright Act provides that courts “may” grant injunctive relief “on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.” 17 U.S.C. §502(a). And as in our decision today, this Court has consistently rejected invitations to replace traditional equitable considerations with a rule that an injunction automatically follows a determination that a copyright has been infringed.</p>
<p id="c5533eb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals below fairly applied these traditional equitable principles in deciding respondent’s motion for a permanent injunction. Although the District Court recited the traditional four-factor test, 275 F. Supp. 2d, at 711, it appeared to adopt certain expansive principles suggesting that injunctive relief could not issue in a broad swath of cases. Most notably, it concluded that a “plaintiff’s willingness to license its patents” and “its lack of commercial activity in practicing the patents” would be sufficient to establish that the patent holder would not suffer irreparable harm if an injunction did not issue. <i>Id</i>., at 712. But traditional equitable principles do not permit such broad classifications. The court’s categorical rule is also in tension with <i>Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.</i>, 210 U.S. 405, 422-430 (1908), which rejected the contention that a court of equity has no jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to a patent holder who has unreasonably declined to use the patent.</p>
<p id="c5533eb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reversing the District Court, the Court of Appeals departed in the opposite direction from the four-factor test. The court articulated a “general rule,” unique to patent disputes, “that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged.” 401 F.3d, at 1338. Just as the District Court erred in its categorical <span title="222" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-222">p. 222</span>denial of injunctive relief, the Court of Appeals erred in its categorical grant of such relief.</p>
<p id="c5533eba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we conclude that neither court below correctly applied the traditional four-factor framework that governs the award of injunctive relief, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, so that the District Court may apply that framework in the first instance.</p>
<p id="c5533ebb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice J<span class="epub-small-caps">OHN</span> R<span class="epub-small-caps">OBERTS</span>, with whom Justice A<span class="epub-small-caps">NTONIN</span> S<span class="epub-small-caps">CALIA</span> and Justice R<span class="epub-small-caps">UTH</span> B<span class="epub-small-caps">ADER</span> G<span class="epub-small-caps">INSBURG</span> join, concurring.</p>
<p id="c5533ebc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with the Court’s holding that “the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity, in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards,” ante, and I join the opinion of the Court. That opinion rightly rests on the proposition that “a major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied.” <i>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo</i>, 456 U.S. 305, 320 (1982).</p>
<p id="c5533ebd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From at least the early 19th century, courts have granted injunctive relief upon a finding of infringement in the vast majority of patent cases. This “long tradition of equity practice” is not surprising, given the difficulty of protecting a right to exclude through monetary remedies that allow an infringer to use an invention against the patentee’s wishes — a difficulty that often implicates the first two factors of the traditional four-factor test. This historical practice, as the Court holds, does not entitle a patentee to a permanent injunction or justify a general rule that such injunctions should issue. At the same time, there is a difference between exercising equitable discretion pursuant to the established four-factor test and writing on an entirely clean slate. “Discretion is not whim, and limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike.” <i>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.</i>, 546 U.S. 132, 139 (2005). When it comes to discerning and applying those standards, in this area as others, “a page of history is worth a volume of logic.” <i>New York Trust Co. v. Eisner</i>, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.).</p>

<p id="c5533ebf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court is correct, in my view, to hold that courts should apply the well-established, four-factor test — without resort to categorical rules — in deciding whether to grant injunctive relief in patent cases. The Chief Justice is also correct that history may be instructive in applying this test. The traditional practice of issuing injunctions against patent infringers, however, does not seem to rest on “the difficulty of protecting a right to exclude through monetary remedies that allow an infringer to use an invention against the patentee’s wishes.” Both the terms of the Patent Act and the traditional view of injunctive relief accept that the existence of a right to exclude does not dictate the remedy for a violation of that right. To the extent earlier cases establish a pattern of granting an injunction against patent infringers almost as a matter of <span title="223" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-223">p. 223</span>course, this pattern simply illustrates the result of the four-factor test in the contexts then prevalent. The lesson of the historical practice, therefore, is most helpful and instructive when the circumstances of a case bear substantial parallels to litigation the courts have confronted before.</p>
<p id="c5533ec0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In cases now arising trial courts should bear in mind that in many instances the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases. An industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but, instead, primarily for obtaining licensing fees. For these firms, an injunction, and the potentially serious sanctions arising from its violation, can be employed as a bargaining tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent. When the patented invention is but a small component of the product the companies seek to produce and the threat of an injunction is employed simply for undue leverage in negotiations, legal damages may well be sufficient to compensate for the infringement and an injunction may not serve the public interest. In addition injunctive relief may have different consequences for the burgeoning number of patents over business methods, which were not of much economic and legal significance in earlier times. The potential vagueness and suspect validity of some of these patents may affect the calculus under the four-factor test.</p>
<p id="c55365d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The equitable discretion over injunctions, granted by the Patent Act, is well suited to allow courts to adapt to the rapid technological and legal developments in the patent system.</p>

Defendant James F. Bolen is the sole proprietor of a business known as B &amp; S Sales, which manufactures and sells various plastic products as funeral accessories. Defendant James E. Bolen, the son of James F. Bolen, developed the concept of marketing a plastic bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and formed a company, B &amp; S Enterprises, to sell the busts, which would be manufactured by B &amp; S Sales. B &amp; S Enterprises was later incorporated under the name of American Heritage Products, Inc.</p>
<p id="c5538cef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Bolen sought the endorsement and participation of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Social Change, Inc., in the marketing of the bust, the Center refused Bolen’s offer. Bolen pursued the idea, nevertheless, hiring an artist to prepare a mold and an agent to handle the promotion of the product. Defendant took out two half-page advertisements in the November and December 1980 issues of Ebony magazine, which purported to offer the bust as “an exclusive memorial” and “an opportunity to support the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Social Change.” The advertisement stated that “a contribution from your order goes to the King Center for Social Change.” Out of the $29.95 purchase price, defendant Bolen testified he set aside 3% or $.90, as a contribution to the Center. The advertisement also offered “free” with the purchase of the bust a booklet about the life of Dr. King entitled “A Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.”</p>
<p id="c5538cf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the two advertisements in Ebony, defendant published a brochure or pamphlet which was inserted in 80,000 copies of newspapers across the country. The brochure reiterated what was stated in the magazine advertisements, and also contained photographs of Dr. King and excerpts from his copyrighted speeches. The brochure promised that each “memorial” (bust) is accompanied by a Certificate of Appreciation “testifying that a contribution has been made to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Social Change.”</p>
<p id="c5538cf1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 21, 1980, and December 19, 1980, the plaintiffs demanded that the Bolens cease and desist from further advertisements and sales of the bust, and on December 31, 1980, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. . . . The motion for an injunction sought (1) an end to the use of the Center’s name in advertising and marketing the busts, (2) restraint of any further copyright infringement and (3) an end to the manufacture and sale of the plastic busts. The defendants agreed to discontinue the use of the Center’s name in further promotion. Therefore, the court granted this part of the injunction. <span title="225" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-225">p. 225</span>The district court found that the defendants had infringed the King copyrights and enjoined all further use of the copyrighted material.</p>
<p id="c5538cf2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ruling on the third request for injunction, the court confronted the plaintiffs’ claim that the manufacture and sale of the busts violated Dr. King’s right of publicity which had passed to his heirs upon Dr. King’s death. The defendants contended that no such right existed, and hence, an injunction should not issue.</p>
<p id="c5538cf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has certified the following questions:</p>

</ol>
<p id="c5538cf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right of publicity may be defined as a celebrity’s right to the exclusive use of his or her name and likeness. The right is most often asserted by or on behalf of professional athletes, comedians, actors and actresses, and other entertainers. This case involves none of those occupations. As is known to all, from 1955 until he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, Dr. King, a Baptist minister by profession, was the foremost leader of the civil rights movement in the United States. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1964. Although not a public official, Dr. King was a public figure, and we deal in this opinion with public figures who are neither public officials nor entertainers. Within this framework, we turn to the questions posed.</p>
<p id="c5538cf9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Is the “right of publicity” recognized in Georgia as a right distinct from the right of privacy?</p>
<p id="c5538cfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Georgia has long recognized the right of privacy. In <i>Pavesich v. New England Life Ins. Co.</i>, 50 S.E. 68 (Ga. 1905), the picture of an artist was used without his consent in a newspaper advertisement of the insurance company. Analyzing the right of privacy, this court held: “The publication of a picture of a person, without his consent, as a part of an advertisement, for the purpose of exploiting the publisher’s business, is a violation of the right of privacy of the person whose picture is reproduced, and entitles him to recover without proof of special damage.” If the right to privacy had not been recognized, advertisers could use photographs of private citizens to promote sales and the professional modeling business would not be what it is today.</p>
<p id="c553b30b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the course of its opinion the <i>Pavesich</i> court said several things pertinent here. It noted that the commentators on ancient law recognized the right of personal liberty, including the right to exhibit oneself before the public at proper times and places and in a proper manner. As a corollary, the court recognized that the right of personal liberty included the right of a person not to be exhibited before the public, saying: “The right to withdraw from the public gaze at such times as a person may see fit, when his <span title="226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-226">p. 226</span>presence in public is not demanded by any rule of law is also embraced within the right of personal liberty. Publicity in one instance and privacy in the other is each guaranteed. If personal liberty embraces the <i>right of publicity</i>, it no less embraces the correlative right of privacy; and this is no new idea in Georgia law.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p id="c553b30c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing the possibility of a conflict between the right of privacy and the freedoms of speech and press, this court said: “There is in the publication of one’s picture for advertising purposes not the slightest semblance of an expression of an idea, a thought, or an opinion, within the meaning of the constitutional provision which guarantees to a person the right to publish his sentiments on any subject.” The defendants in the case now before us make no claim under these freedoms and we find no violation thereof.</p>
<p id="c553b30d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Observing in dicta that the right of privacy in general does not survive the death of the person whose privacy is invaded, the <i>Pavesich</i> court said: “While the right of privacy is personal, and may die with the person, we do not desire to be understood as assenting to the proposition that the relatives of the deceased can not, in a proper case, protect the memory of their kinsman, not only from defamation, but also from an invasion into the affairs of his private life after his death. This question is not now involved, but we do not wish anything said to be understood as committing us in any way to the doctrine that against the consent of relatives the private affairs of a deceased person may be published and his picture or statue exhibited.” 50 S.E. at 76.</p>
<p id="c553b30e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finding that Pavesich, although an artist, was not recognized as a public figure, the court said: “It is not necessary in this case to hold, nor are we prepared to do so, that the mere fact that a man has become what is called a public character, either by aspiring to public office, or by holding public office, or by exercising a profession which places him before the public, or by engaging in a business which has necessarily a public nature, gives to everyone the right to print and circulate his picture.” 50 S.E. at 79-80. Thus, although recognizing the right of privacy, the <i>Pavesich</i> court left open the question facing us involving the likeness of a public figure.</p>
<p id="c553b30f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, in <i>Waters v. Fleetwood</i>, 91 S.E.2d 344 (Ga. 1956), it was held that the mother of a 14-year-old murder victim could not recover for invasion of the mother’s privacy from a newspaper that published and sold separately photographs of her daughter’s body taken after it was removed from a river. There the court found that publication and reproduction for sale of a photograph incident to a matter of public interest or to a public investigation could not be a violation of anyone’s right of privacy.</p>
<p id="c553b310-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to publicity is not absolute. In <i>Hicks v. Casablanca Records</i>, 464 F. Supp. 426 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), the court held that a fictional novel and movie concerning an unexplained eleven-day disappearance by Agatha Christie, author of numerous mystery novels, were permissible under the first amendment. On the other hand, in <i>Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.</i>, 433 U.S. 562 (1977), a television station broadcast on its news program plaintiff’s 15-second “human cannonball” flight filmed at a local fair. The Supreme Court held that freedom of the press does not authorize the media to broadcast a performer’s entire act without his consent, just as the media could not televise a stage play, prize fight or baseball game without consent. Quoting <span title="227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-227">p. 227</span>from Kalven, <i>Privacy in Tort Law — Were Warren and Brandeis Wrong?</i>, 31 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 326, 332 (1966), the Court said: “The rationale for [protecting the right of publicity] is the straight-forward one of preventing unjust enrichment by the theft of good will. No social purpose is served by having the defendant get free some aspect of the plaintiff that would have market value and for which he would normally pay.”</p>

<p id="c553b313-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the <i>Lugosi</i> case, California’s legislature overruled the decision. In 1984, it enacted a statute making publicity rights in that state descendible and transferable for 70 years after the celebrity’s death. <i>See</i> Cal. Civ. Code §3344.1. Courts initially held that the statute did not apply to celebrities who died before it went into effect, a group that included celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, whose publicity rights still had significant commercial value. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Shaw Family Archives Ltd. v. CMG Worldwide, Inc.</i>, 486 F. Supp. 2d 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). Soon thereafter, the California legislature went back to the drawing board and amended the statute to retroactively cover celebrities who died before 1985. <i>See</i> Cal. Civ. Code 3344.1(b).</p>
</div>
<p id="c553b314-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he courts in Georgia have recognized the rights of private citizens, as well as entertainers, not to have their names and photographs used for the financial gain of the user without their consent, where such use is not authorized as an exercise of freedom of the press. We know of no reason why a public figure prominent in religion and civil rights should be entitled to less protection than an exotic dancer or a movie actress. Therefore, we hold that the appropriation of another’s name and likeness, whether such likeness be a photograph or sculpture, without consent and for the financial gain of the appropriator is a tort in Georgia, whether the person whose name and likeness is used is a private citizen, entertainer, or as here a public figure who is not a public official.</p>
<p id="c553b315-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">. . . We conclude that while private citizens have the right of privacy, public figures have a similar right of publicity, and that the measure of damages to a public figure for violation of his or her right of publicity is the value of the appropriation to the user. As thus understood the first certified question is answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p id="c553b316-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. Does the “right of publicity” survive the death of its owner (<i>i.e.</i>, is the right inheritable and devisable)?</p>
<p id="c553b317-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right of publicity is assignable during the life of the celebrity, for without this characteristic, full commercial exploitation of one’s name and likeness is practically impossible. That is, without assignability the right of publicity could hardly be called a “right.”</p>
<p id="c553b318-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts that have considered the problem are not . . . unanimous. . . . In <i>Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc.</i>, 579 F.2d 215 (2d Cir. 1978),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BA5_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BA5_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> Elvis Presley had assigned his right of publicity to Boxcar Enterprises, which assigned that right to Factors after Presley’s death. Defendant Pro Arts published a poster of Presley entitled “In Memory.” In affirming the grant of injunction against Pro Arts, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c553da2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The identification of this exclusive right belonging to Boxcar as a transferable property right compels the conclusion that the right survives Presley’s death. The death of <span title="228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-228">p. 228</span>Presley, who was merely the beneficiary of an income interest in Boxcar’s exclusive right, should not in itself extinguish Boxcar’s property right. Instead, the income interest, continually produced from Boxcar’s exclusive right of commercial exploitation, should inure to Presley’s estate at death like any other intangible property right. To hold that the right did not survive Presley’s death, would be to grant competitors of Factors, such as Pro Arts, a windfall in the form of profits from the use of Presley’s name and likeness. At the same time, the exclusive right purchased by Factors and the financial benefits accruing to the celebrity’s heirs would be rendered virtually worthless.</p>
</div>
<p id="c553da2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Lugosi v. Universal Pictures</i>, 603 P.2d 425 (Cal. 1979), the Supreme Court of California, in a 4 to 3 decision, declared that the right of publicity expires upon the death of the celebrity and is not descendible. Bela Lugosi appeared as Dracula in Universal Picture’s movie by that name. Universal had acquired the movie rights to the novel by Bram Stoker. Lugosi’s contract with Universal gave it the right to exploit Lugosi’s name and likeness in connection with the movie. The majority of the court held that Lugosi’s heirs could not prevent Universal’s continued exploitation of Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula after his death. The court did not decide whether Universal could prevent unauthorized third parties from exploitation of Lugosi’s appearance as Dracula after Lugosi’s death.</p>
<p id="c553da2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Memphis Development Foundation v. Factors Etc., Inc.</i>, 616 F.2d 956 (6th Cir. 1980), Factors, which had won its case against Pro Arts in New York (see above), lost against the Memphis Development Foundation under the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit’s interpretation of Tennessee law. There, the Foundation, a non-profit corporation, planned to erect a statue of Elvis Presley in Memphis and solicited contributions to do so. Donors of $25 or more received a small replica of the proposed statue. The Sixth Circuit reversed the grant of an injunction favoring Factors, holding that a celebrity’s right of publicity was not inheritable even where that right had been exploited during the celebrity’s life.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BC7_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BC7_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span> The court reasoned that although recognition of the right of publicity during life serves to encourage effort and inspire creative endeavors, making the right inheritable would not.</p>
<p id="c553da2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons which follow we hold that the right of publicity survives the death of its owner and is inheritable and devisable. Recognition of the right of publicity rewards and thereby encourages effort and creativity. If the right of publicity dies with the celebrity, the economic value of the right of publicity during life would be diminished because the celebrity’s untimely death would seriously impair, if not destroy, the value of the right of continued commercial use. Conversely, those who would profit from the fame of a celebrity after his or her death for their own benefit and without authorization have failed to establish their claim that they should be the beneficiaries of the celebrity’s death. Finally, the trend since the early common law has been to recognize survivability, notwithstanding the legal problems which may thereby arise. We therefore answer question 2 in the affirmative.</p>
<p id="c553da2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-229">p. 229</span>3. Must the owner of the right of publicity have commercially exploited that right before it can survive?</p>
<p id="c553da30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Exploitation is understood to mean commercial use by the celebrity other than the activity which made him or her famous, <i>e.g.</i>, an inter vivos transfer of the right to the use of one’s name and likeness. The cases which have considered this issue . . . involved entertainers. The net result of following them would be to say that celebrities and public figures have the right of publicity during their lifetimes (as others have the right of privacy), but only those who contract for bubble gum cards, posters and tee shirts have a descendible right of publicity upon their deaths. That we should single out for protection after death those entertainers and athletes who exploit their personae during life, and deny protection after death to those who enjoy public acclamation but did not exploit themselves during life, puts a premium on exploitation. Having found that there are valid reasons for recognizing the right of publicity during life, we find no reason to protect after death only those who took commercial advantage of their fame.</p>
<p id="c553da31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps this case more than others brings the point into focus. A well-known minister may avoid exploiting his prominence during life because to do otherwise would impair his ministry. Should his election not to take commercial advantage of his position during life <i>ipso facto</i> result in permitting others to exploit his name and likeness after his death? In our view, a person who avoids exploitation during life is entitled to have his image protected against exploitation after death just as much if not more than a person who exploited his image during life.</p>
<p id="c553da32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without doubt, Dr. King could have exploited his name and likeness during his lifetime. That this opportunity was not appealing to him does not mean that others have the right to use his name and likeness in ways he himself chose not to do. Nor does it strip his family and estate of the right to control, preserve and extend his status and memory and to prevent unauthorized exploitation thereof by others. Here, they seek to prevent the exploitation of his likeness in a manner they consider unflattering and unfitting. We cannot deny them this right merely because Dr. King chose not to exploit or commercialize himself during his lifetime.</p>
<p id="c553da33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Question 3 is answered in the negative, and therefore we need not answer question 4.</p>

It should be noted that our own constitutional provision, Art. I, Sec. I, Par.

Its language is plain and all-encompassing: “No law shall ever be passed to curtail, or restrain the liberty of speech, or of the press; any person may speak, write and publish his sentiments, on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.”</p>
<p id="c5540146-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the majority says that the fabrication and commercial distribution of a likeness of Dr. King is not “speech,” thereby removing the inquiry from the ambit of First <span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>Amendment or Free Speech inquiries. To this conclusion I most vigorously dissent. When our Constitution declares that anyone may “speak, write and publish his sentiments, on all subjects” it does not confine that freedom exclusively to verbal expression. Art. I, Sec. I, Par.

If, then, a two-dimensional likeness in oil and canvas is an expression of sentiment, how can it be said that a three-dimensional likeness in plastic is <i>not</i>?</p>
<p id="c5540148-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, says the majority, our new right to publicity is violated only in cases involving financial gain. Did the sculptors of our Confederate soldiers, and of our chief justices, labor without gain? Was Dr. King’s portraitist unpaid for his work? If “financial gain” is to be the watershed of violation <i>vel non</i> of this new-found right, it cannot withstand scrutiny. It is rare, indeed, that any expression of sentiment beyond casual conversation is not somehow connected, directly or indirectly, to “financial gain.” For example, a school child wins a $25 prize for the best essay on Dr. King’s life. Is this “financial gain”? Must the child then account for the winnings? The essay, because of its worth, is reprinted in a commercial publication. Must the publisher account? The publication is sold on the newsstand. Must the vendor account?</p>
<p id="c5540149-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority will say “free speech.” Very well. The same child wins a $25 prize in the school art fair. His creation — a bust of Dr. King. Must he account? The local newspaper prints a photograph of the child and of his creation. Must it account? The school commissions replicas of the bust to raise money for its library. Must it account? UNICEF reproduces the bust on its Christmas cards. Must it account? Finally, a purely commercial venture undertakes to market replicas of the bust under circumstances similar to those of this case. Must it account?</p>
<p id="c554014a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Obviously, the answers to the above questions will vary, and properly so, because the circumstances posited are vastly different. The dividing line, however, cannot be fixed upon the presence or absence of “financial gain.” Rather, it must be grounded in the community’s judgment of what, <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, is unconscionable.</p>
<p id="c554014b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were it otherwise, this “right of publicity,” fully extended, would eliminate scholarly research, historical analysis, and public comment, because food and shelter, and the financial gain it takes to provide them, are still essentials of human existence. Were it otherwise, no newspaper might identify any person or any incident of his life without accounting to him for violation of his “right to publicity.” Were it otherwise, no author might refer to any event in history wherein his reference is identifiable to any individual (or his heirs!) without accounting for his royalties.</p>
<p id="c554014c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each lawful restraint [on speech] finds its legitimacy, then, <i>not</i> because it is laid against some immutable rule (like the weights and measures of the Bureau of Standards) but because it is perceived that it would be irresponsible to the interest of the community — to the extent of being <i>unconscionable</i> — that such conduct go <span title="231" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-231">p. 231</span>unrestrained. The doctrine of unjust enrichment finds its genesis in such a reckoning. It can be applied to just such a matter as that before us. Were we to do so, we could avoid entering the quagmire of combining considerations of “right of privacy,” “right of publicity,” and considerations of <i>inter vivos</i> exploitation. We would also retain our constitutional right of free speech uncluttered and uncompromised by these new impediments of indeterminate application. And we could sanction relief <i>in this case</i> — where relief is plainly appropriate.</p>

<p id="c554014f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Imitators.</b> A recent version of the right of publicity has been used to challenge advertisements that <i>imitate</i> artists as a way to appropriate their image. The singer and actress Bette Midler brought a lawsuit against Young &amp; Rubicam, an advertising agency that had hired one of her former backup singers to imitate Midler’s rendition of her 1973 hit “Do You Want to Dance?” to promote Ford Motor Co.’s Mercury Sable car. Midler claimed that the agency had stolen her voice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, holding that “when a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs and have committed a tort in California.” <i>Midler v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 849 F.2d 460, 463 (9th Cir. 1988). <i>Accord, Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc.</i>, 978 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir. 1992) (singer Tom Waits obtains $375,000 in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages against company that imitated his distinctive voice and singing style in a radio commercial).</p>
<p id="c5542860-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does prohibition of imitation go too far? In <i>White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.</i>, 971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992), the court held that a copyright violation might well be established when a company used a robot in advertising that was intended to evoke images of Vanna White and the game show in which she became famous. Samsung was clearly using her image to sell its products without her consent in a way that might have created confusion as to whether White had agreed to allow her image to be used by the company. However, in a dissent to a decision denying a petition for rehearing, 989 F.2d 1512, 1513 (9th Cir. 1993), Judge Kozinski criticized the ruling.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5542861-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Saddam Hussein wants to keep advertisers from using his picture in unflattering contexts. Clint Eastwood doesn’t want tabloids to write about him. Rudolf Valentino’s heirs want to control his film biography. The Girl Scouts don’t want their image soiled by association with certain activities. George Lucas wants to keep Strategic Defense Initiative fans from calling it “Star Wars.” Pepsico doesn’t want singers to use the word “Pepsi” in their songs. Guy Lombardo wants an exclusive property right to ads that show big bands playing on New Year’s Eve. Uri Geller thinks he should be paid for ads showing psychics bending metal through telekinesis. Paul Prudhomme, that household name, thinks the same about ads featuring corpulent bearded chefs. And scads of copyright holders see purple when their creations are made fun of.</p>
<p id="c5542862-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Something very dangerous is going on here. Private property, including intellectual property, is essential to our way of life. It provides an incentive for investment and innovation; it stimulates the flourishing of our culture; it protects the moral entitlements of people to the fruits of their labors. But reducing too much to private property can be bad medicine. Private land, for instance, is far more useful if separated from other <span title="232" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-232">p. 232</span>private land by public streets, roads and highways. Public parks, utility rights-of-way and sewers reduce the amount of land in private hands, but vastly enhance the value of the property that remains.</p>
<p id="c5542863-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So too it is with intellectual property. Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it. Creativity is impossible without a rich public domain. Nothing today, likely nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new: Culture, like science and technology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those who came before. Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it’s supposed to nurture.</p>
<p id="c5542864-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The panel’s opinion is a classic case of overprotection. Concerned about what it sees as a wrong done to Vanna White, the panel majority erects a property right of remarkable and dangerous breadth: Under the majority’s opinion, it’s now a tort for advertisers to <i>remind</i> the public of a celebrity. Not to use a celebrity’s name, voice, signature or likeness; not to imply the celebrity endorses a product; but simply to evoke the celebrity’s image in the public’s mind. This Orwellian notion withdraws far more from the public domain than prudence and common sense allow. It conflicts with the <i>Copyright Act</i> and the Copyright Clause. It raises serious First Amendment problems. It’s bad law, and it deserves a long, hard second look.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5542865-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Circuit found a likely violation of publicity rights when licensed airport Cheers bars used animatronic robots that resembled two characters from the <i>Cheers</i> television show. Although the actors had no right to prevent dissemination of the show itself, they had the right to prevent use of their images to sell products related to the show. <i>Wendt v. Host International</i>, 125 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 1997) (applying California law). Does this distinction make sense?</p>
<p id="c5542866-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Free speech.</b> Does the right of publicity interfere with the right of free speech? <i>See Parks v. La Face Records</i>, 329 F.3d 437 (6th Cir. 2003) (grappling with the conflict between free speech rights and property rights in one’s name); <i>Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc</i>., 21 P.3d 797 (Cal. 2001) (balancing publicity rights against the first amendment rights of an artist who sold lithographic print and silkscreened t-shirt reproductions of his drawings of the Three Stooges). After playwright Susan Ross wrote a play based on the life of the singer Janis Joplin, she was sued by Joplin’s family and Manny Fox, a New York producer who owns the rights to make a film and play based on Joplin’s life, on the ground that Ross had wrongly appropriated the plaintiffs’ right of publicity in Joplin’s image without obtaining the consent of Joplin’s estate. The family claimed “the exclusive right to exploit stage productions, theatrical films and television productions based on the life and times of Janis Joplin.” Judge Coughenour held that the play was a protected form of expression under the first amendment and that Joplin’s family could not control artistic expressions based on her life. <i>Joplin Enterprises v. Allen</i>, 795 F. Supp. 349 (W.D. Wash. 1992). <i>See also ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing, Inc.</i>, 332 F.3d 915 (6th Cir. 2003) (first amendment prevents assertion of publicity right against an artist who painted Tiger Woods’s victory at 1997 Master Tournament); <i>Matthews v. Wozencraft</i>, 15 F.3d 432 (5th Cir. 1994) (despite publicity right, defendant is entitled to produce a fictionalized biography without plaintiff’s consent). Do you agree with the majority or dissenting opinions in the <i>Martin Luther King</i> case?</p>
<p id="c5542867-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="233" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-233">p. 233</span><b>3. <i>Lanham Act.</i></b> Section 43(a) of the federal <i>Lanham Act</i>, 15 U.S.C. §1125, may support a publicity rights claim because it creates a civil claim against any person who identifies his product so to deceive consumers as to the association of the product’s producer with another person or to cause consumers to falsely believe that other person has sponsored or approved of the product. <i>See ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing, Inc.</i>, 332 F.3d 915, 924 (6th Cir. 2003) (“The elements of a Lanham Act false endorsement claim are similar to the elements of a right of publicity claim under Ohio law.” (citing Bruce P. Keller, <i>The Right of Publicity: Past, Present, and Future,</i> 1207 PLI Corp. Law and Prac. Handbook 159, 170 (October 2000))). In contrast, to show infringement of the common law right of publicity, the claimant need not show a possibility of confusion; all that is required is unauthorized use. <i>Cf. Tyne v. Time Warner Entertainment Co.</i>, 901 So. 2d 802 (Fla. 2005) (state statute prohibiting use of a person’s name or likeness for “commercial purposes” does not apply to a movie like <i>The Perfect Storm</i> that dramatizes real events and persons and does not directly promote a good or service).</p>
<p id="c5542868-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Cultural icons.</b> The images of famous people become part of popular culture — a common asset of the community. Absolute protection of someone’s image would prevent others from commenting on or referring to the image without permission from the owner. At the same time, commercial exploitation of someone’s image may harm an individual by associating her with a product with which she does not want to be associated. Such exploitation could also limit a celebrity’s ability to derive commercial benefit from her own popularity. Should it make a difference if someone is simply trying to make money from a person’s image — for example, using her to sell a product — or using her image in an artistic or literary fashion? <i>Compare Groucho Marx Productions, Inc. v. Day &amp; Night Co.</i>, 689 F.2d 317 (2d Cir. 1982) (right of publicity does not survive the death of the owner; producers of a play mimicking the Marx Brothers could not be held liable to his heirs), <i>with John W. Carson v. Here’s Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc.</i>, 698 F.2d 831 (6th Cir. 1983) (holding that defendant could not imitate Ed McMahon’s introduction of Johnny Carson —  “Here’s Johnny!” — to sell its portable toilets). <i>See also</i> Cal. Civ. Code §§3344, 3344.1; Fla. Stat. §540.08; Tenn. Code §§47-25-1101 to 47-25-1108 (protecting the right of publicity).</p>
<p id="c5544f79-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Titles.</b> In <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi</i>, 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989), dancer and film star Ginger Rogers sued filmmaker Federico Fellini for using her name in a movie called <i>Ginger and Fred</i>. That movie was about two cabaret dancers who became known to their fans as Fred and Ginger because they imitated Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in their act. The court held that the use of a title is protected by the first amendment unless it has “no artistic relevance” to the underlying work, or if there is artistic relevance, that the title “explicitly misleads as to the source of the content of the work.” <i>Id.</i> at 999. Applying this test, the court concluded that use of Ginger Rogers’s name in the title was protected by the first amendment and thus barred claims based on either publicity rights or the <i>Lanham Act</i>. In contrast, the court in <i>Parks v. La Face Records</i>, 329 F.3d 437 (6th Cir. 2003), granted civil rights leader Rosa Parks the right to go forward with publicity rights and <i>Lanham Act</i> claims against the band OutKast and record producer LaFace Records for using her name as the title for a song. The district court had concluded that the title was artistically relevant to the song lyrics because the lyrics contain <span title="234" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-234">p. 234</span>the phrase “Everybody move to the back of the bus” — a phrase obviously related to Parks. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that a jury could conclude that the song was not about Rosa Parks in any way. The “back of the bus” phrase was used to suggest that competitors to OutKast should get back and let OutKast get out front. This use starkly contrasts, for example, with the song “Rosa, Rosa” by blues artist Otis Taylor, which is clearly a tribute to Rosa Parks. Were the <i>Rogers</i> and <i>Parks</i> cases correctly decided?</p>
<p id="c5544f7a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Trade secrets.</b> In addition to publicity rights, another important area for state law protection of information is the law of “trade secrets.” Trade secrets are tools or practices or processes or formulas (they can be virtually anything) that are not generally known and that confer a commercial advantage on their possessor. <i>See Restatement (First) of Torts</i> §757. As long as the information remains secret (<i>i.e</i>., not general knowledge) and as long as the rightful holder of the trade secret takes reasonable steps to keep the information secret, state law typically protects the information against misappropriation (defined as acquisition of the information by improper means) by third parties. <i>See Uniform Trade Secrets Act</i> §§1, 2. Violations of trade secret rights are subject to both injunctive relief and damages. <i>See id.</i> §§3, 4. Like trademark, this legal protection endures as long as the trade conditions above continue to hold. Famous trade secrets include the “eleven herbs and spices” in Kentucky Fried Chicken’s “Original Recipe” and the formula for Coca Cola. Why might a business prefer patent protection for information conceivably covered by trade secret? Why might it prefer trade secret law? Can it protect the same information with both?</p>

Although some states refuse to extend the right of publicity after death, see N.Y. Civ. Rights §50, most states, like Georgia, do recognize such rights and sometimes provide time limits, see Cal. Civ. Code §3344.1 (70 years after death); Tenn. Code §47-25-1104 (10 years after death if not exploited; if commercially exploited, the rights ends 2 years after the use ceases); Tex. Prob.

<p id="c5544f7e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A surviving relative of Tasunke Witko (known in English as Crazy Horse) sought to prevent a beer company from selling “Crazy Horse Malt Liquor” on the ground that the law of the Rosebud Sioux Nation recognized a form of publicity right that was descendible and still in existence more than a century after the death of Crazy Horse. Crazy Horse was a spiritual leader of the Sioux people and opposed the use of liquor in any form. The Rosebud Sioux Trial Court strongly suggested that tribal law would recognize such a right but found no jurisdiction in tribal court because the beer was not sold on the reservation. Although the Rosebud Sioux Supreme Court reversed on the jurisdictional finding, a subsequent ruling by a federal judge held that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the claim. <i>In the Matter of the Estate of Tasunke Witko v. G. Heileman Brewing Co.</i> (Civ. No. 93-204) (Rosebud Sioux Tr. Ct., Oct. 25, 1994), <i>rev’d</i> (Rosebud Sioux Sup. Ct., May 1, 1996), <i>judgment vacated by Hornell Brewing Co. v.

Assume that the state in which suit is brought recognizes publicity rights but does not allow them to be inherited, at least where the individual did not take advantage of commercial use of the name during his lifetime. Plaintiff claims that publicity rights are a form of personal property and that the law of the domicile of a person at the time of death ordinarily applies to determine who inherits such property at death. Because Crazy Horse was domiciled on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation at his death, Rosebud law should apply to govern the case. Defendant beer company argues that such cases concern the regulation of business enterprises, and the law of the place where goods are sold should control the case. Which law should apply?</p>

<p id="c5549dab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The marvelous artifacts of ancient Egypt, so wondrous in their beauty and in what they teach of the advent of civilization, inevitably invite the attention, not just of scholars and aesthetes, but of tomb-robbers, smugglers, black-marketeers, and assorted thieves. Every pharaoh, it seems, has a price on his head (at least if the head is cast in stone); and if the price is right, a head-hunter will be found to sever the head from its lawful owner. So, at least, is the theory of the instant indictment, which alleges, in effect, that the defendant and one or more co-conspirators arranged to steal highly valuable ancient Egyptian artifacts — including a million-dollar head of Amenhotep III — and “fence” them in New York. This, says the indictment, makes the defendant guilty of conspiracy to violate section 2315 of Title 18, United States Code, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]hoever receives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of any goods, wares, or merchandise . . . which have crossed a State or United States boundary after being stolen . . . knowing the same to have been stolen . . . [is guilty of a crime].”</p>
<p id="c5549dac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-236">p. 236</span>The defendant has pleaded not guilty and is presumed innocent. For purposes of this pre-trial motion [to dismiss his indictment], however, he assumes the facts as stated in the indictment and maintains that the indictment nonetheless fails to state a conspiracy to violate section 2315 because it presupposes, wrongly in his view, that someone who conspires to smuggle ancient artifacts out of Egypt is thereby guilty of, among other things, dealing in stolen goods, by virtue of Egyptian Law 117. That law provides that, as of 1983, all Egyptian “antiquities” — that is, objects over a century old having archeological or historical importance (Law 117, Art. 1) — “are considered to be public property,” that is, property of the state. The defendant principally argues: (i) that Law 117, despite its assertion of state ownership, is really more in the nature of a licensing and export regulation, the violation of which does not constitute theft of property in the sense covered by section 2315; [and] (ii) that, assuming Law 117 really does work an expropriation of property by Egypt, the special kind of property thereby vested in that foreign state does not give rise to interests entitled to protection under United States law.</p>
<p id="c5549dad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The primary problem with defendant’s first argument — that Law 117 is really regulatory in nature — is the language of the law itself, which unequivocally asserts state ownership of all antiquities (Art. 6), requires their recording by the state (Art. 26), prohibits (with certain practical exceptions) private ownership, possession, or disposal of such antiquities (Arts. 6-8), and requires anyone finding or discovering a new antiquity to promptly notify the Antiquities Authority (Arts. 23-24), which, in the case of movable antiquities, then takes physical possession and stores the antiquities in the museums and storage facilities of the Authority (Art. 28). Thus, so far as Egyptian antiquities are concerned, Law 117 on its face vests with the state most, and perhaps all, the rights ordinarily associated with ownership of property, including title, possession, and right to transfer. This, on its face, is far more than a licensing scheme or export regulation.</p>
<p id="c5549dae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, Law 117 qualifies certain aspects of state ownership where obvious practicalities so require. For example, while every newly-discovered but immovable antiquity is still deemed state owned, nonetheless “where the find is located on private property, the Authority shall decide within three months whether to remove the find, to initiate measures for expropriating the land upon which it is located, or to leave the antiquity in its place and register it in accordance with the provisions of this law.” (Art. 23). Similarly, pre-1983 owners or possessors of antiquities, though now required to register their antiquities with the state if they have not already done so, may in certain circumstances maintain possession or even dispose of their antiquities, but only with permission of the Authority. <i>See, e.g</i>., Arts. 7, 8, 9, 13. These adjustments to physical and historical circumstances only serve to confirm, however, that the statute’s primary purpose is to transfer ownership to the state to the extent reasonably practicable.</p>
<p id="c5549daf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the plain language of Law 117, however, defendant argues that, in practice, even those antiquities discovered after 1983 have been left in the hands of their discoverers or other private transferees and that the law in operation really works more like a licensing or export regulation than like a transfer of property. But when, <span title="237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-237">p. 237</span>in response to these and other defense assertions, the Court convened an evidentiary hearing, pursuant to Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the defendant was unable to adduce any material, let alone persuasive evidence to support this contention. The most he could offer in this respect was the opinion of Professor Abou El Fadl, a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern law at UCLA Law School, to the effect that nothing in Law 117 definitively prevents the Antiquities Authority from leaving physical possession of even an antiquity discovered after 1983 in the hands of a private finder, so long as the private finder promptly notifies the Authority of his find.</p>
<p id="c5549db0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to this purely hypothetical opinion, the Government presented, among much else, the testimony of Dr. Gaballa Ali Gaballa, Secretary General to the Supreme Council of Antiquities, that in fact the state takes immediate physical custody of newly discovered antiquities, sometimes by the tens of thousands. Another Government witness, General Ali Sobky, Director of Criminal Investigations for the Antiquities Police (which employs more than 400 police officers), testified that his department regularly investigates and prosecutes dozens of serious violations of Law 117, of which relatively few are for smuggling and most are for trafficking within Egypt (including unlawfully possessing and disposing of state-owned antiquities). General Sobky also testified that even in the case where someone is acquitted of stealing a newly discovered antiquity, the antiquity is confiscated by the state as the lawful owner.</p>
<p id="c5549db1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear, therefore, that Law 117, far from being a disguised licensing scheme or export regulation, is precisely what it purports to be: a transfer of ownership of Egyptian antiquities to the state, effective 1983.</p>
<p id="c5549db2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for defendant’s second argument — to the effect that American law does not, or should not, recognize the kind of “special” property interest created by “patrimony” laws like Law 117 — it should first be noted that section 2315, which expressly refers to foreign commerce, has consistently “been applied to thefts in foreign countries and subsequent transportation into the United States,” <i>United States v. McClain</i>, 545 F.2d 988, 994 (5th Cir. 1977) (citing cases): an implicit recognition of the interest of the United States in deterring its residents from dealing in the spoils of foreign thefts. In effectuating this policy, why should it make any difference that a foreign nation, in order to safeguard its precious cultural heritage, has chosen to assume ownership of those objects in its domain that have historical or archeological importance, rather than leaving them in private hands?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D7F_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D7F_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> If an American conspired to steal the Liberty Bell and sell it to a foreign collector of artifacts, there is no question he could be prosecuted under section 2315. <i>Mutatis mutandis,</i> the same is true when, as here alleged, a United States resident conspires to steal Egypt’s antiquities.</p>
<p id="c5549db4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="238" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-238">p. 238</span>To be sure, even if the Government proves the defendant knew he was importing antiquities that were smuggled out of Egypt — an act that may not be inherently violative of United States law and policy — there may still be a jury question as to whether he knew he was dealing in stolen goods, an essential element of a section 2315 violation. But the indictment alleges he possessed such knowledge, and the Government asserts that it will prove, inter alia, that the defendant knew that at least two of the items he conspired to import had been stolen from the Antiquities Police. This is more than sufficient for purposes of the present motion.</p>
<p id="c5549db5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While defendant raises still other arguments in support of his motion to dismiss the indictment, the Court finds them sufficiently meritless as not to warrant discussion here.</p>
<p id="c5549db6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the Court, confirming its Order of December 27, 2001, hereby denies defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>

Legal protection of cultural property.</b> In 1970, the United Nations approved the <i>Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property</i>, Nov. 14, 1970, 823 U.N.T.S. 231, 232-234.  The law has spurred adoption of rules to prevent import and export of cultural property, and efforts to enforce older national laws prohibiting removal of artifacts. Museum guidelines promulgated in 2008, for example, discourage acquisition of any cultural artifacts without proof of removal from their country of origin before 1970, or removal with the consent of the country after that year. In a 2009 article in the <i>Yale Law Journal</i>,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DAB_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DAB_cee9f541-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span> Kristen Carpenter, Sonia Katyal, and Angela Riley observe that the growing tendency to speak about cultural heritage in property terms has sparked something of a backlash:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c554c4cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a recent <i>New York Times</i> column, Edward Rothstein complained that cultural property laws had engendered “a new form of protection, philistinism triumphing in the name of enlightened ideas.” Legal scholars in particular — including those who typically align themselves with progressive causes — strongly criticize indigenous peoples’ efforts to assert ownership and autonomy over their tangible and intangible traditional resources, arguing that culture is and must remain part of an entitlement-free commons. In one recent article, for example, Naomi Mezey contends that “the idea of property has so colonized the idea of culture that there is not much culture left in cultural property.” For Mezey, the notion of indigenous cultural property raises the likelihood that once indigenous peoples obtain title to cultural property, they will use it to exclude others — a practice that would inevitably limit the free flow of culture.</p>
</div>
<p id="c554c4cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Carpenter, Katyal, and Riley defend the use of the language of property as a tool for protecting indigenous cultural heritage. Building on the personhood theory of <span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-239">p. 239</span>property elaborated by Margaret Jane Radin, they develop “a model of property and peoplehood, and in so doing articulate[] a justification for group-oriented legal claims to indigenous cultural property.” “Peoplehood,” they argue, “dictates that certain lands, resources, and expressions are entitled to legal protection as cultural property because they are integral to the group identity and cultural survival of indigenous peoples.”</p>
<p id="c554c4cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Cultural patrimony versus cultural internationalism.</b> In recent years, there have been a number of high profile cases in which museums have returned antiquities and other cultural property to their places of origin. In 2007, for example, after lengthy negotiations, Yale University returned hundreds of Incan stone, metal, and ceramic artifacts to Peru. That same year, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles returned 40 items to Italy. Among them was the Morgantina Venus, which the museum had purchased in 1988 for $18 million. When the Getty acquired it, the statue was an “orphan,” meaning that no one knew exactly where it came from and whether it had been looted from Italy. The Getty therefore knew it was taking a risk when it purchased the statue. In 2006, the museum adopted stricter acquisition policies in response to criticism that it was not complying with international norms.</p>
<p id="c554c4ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the longest running, and certainly among the highest profile, conflicts over cultural property involves sculptures removed by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, from the Parthenon in Athens and sold to the British Museum in 1816, where they are still displayed as the “Elgin Marbles.” Since 1983, the Greek government has been seeking the return of these sculptures, which the British Museum has resisted. Professor John Henry Merryman, in an article called <i>Thinking About the Elgin Marbles</i>, 83 Mich. L. Rev. 1881 (1985), notes that international law in 1801, when Elgin removed the Marbles, appears to have validated the transfer, as Elgin obtained permission from officials of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled Greece for nearly four centuries at that point. That permission, however, did not resolve the question whether the British were somehow morally obligated to return the Marbles. Professor Merryman describes the argument for their return as cultural nationalism:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c554c4cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most obvious argument is that the Marbles belong in Greece because they are Greek. They were created in Greece by Greek artists for the civic and religious purposes of the Athens of that time. The appealing implication is that, being in this sense Greek, they belong among Greeks, in the place (the Acropolis of Athens) for which they were made. This argument, which I will call the argument from cultural nationalism, requires careful examination, since it is basic to the Greek position and because arguments like it are frequently made by other governments calling for the return of cultural property (and is strongly implied in their use of the term “repatriation”).</p>
<p id="c554c4d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its truest and best sense, cultural nationalism is based on the relation between cultural property and cultural definition. For a full life and a secure identity, people need exposure to their history, much of which is represented or illustrated by objects. Such artifacts are important to cultural definition and expression, to shared identity and community. They tell people who they are and where they come from. A people deprived of its artifacts is culturally impoverished.</p>
<p id="c554c4d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="240" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-240">p. 240</span>The difficulty comes in relating the notion of cultural deprivation to the physical location of the Marbles. By their removal to London and exposure in the British Museum, they have brought admiration and respect for the Greek achievement. Still, the argument for possession as an aspect of cultural nationalism has an instinctive appeal.</p>
<p id="c554c4d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final component of the nationalism argument is political: the belief that the presence of the Marbles in England, or in any place other than Greece, is an offense to Greeks and to the Greek nation. The weight one gives to this kind of argument for the return of the Marbles depends to a large extent on one’s attitude toward political nationalism itself. [I]f one sees it as at best a dubious good, with large elements of superstition and prejudice, with an unsavory record as the religion of the state, and as a source of international economic, social, political, and armed conflict, then the nationalist argument becomes an uncomfortable one to sustain.</p>
</div>
<p id="c554c4d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Merryman dismisses this argument for several reasons: “it expresses values not clearly entitled to respect (political nationalism),” “it is founded on sentiment and mysticism rather than reason,” and “it is a two-edged argument that is equally available to the British.” Merryman calls the argument on the other side cultural internationalism:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c554c4d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of May 14, 1954, states in its preamble that “cultural property belonging to any people whatsoever” is “the cultural heritage of all mankind.” [I]f the legal and moral arguments are treated as evenly balanced, and if the argument from nationalism is also inconclusive, are there considerations from the point of view of cultural internationalism (which the Hague Convention language expresses) that indicate the proper way to allocate the Marbles?</p>
<p id="c554c4d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Preservation takes priority for obvious reasons. [I]f one compares the record of care for works on the Acropolis and in the British Museum since 1816, it is clear where the greater danger has lain. The sculptural reliefs remaining on the Parthenon and the Caryatids on the Erechtheion have all been badly eroded by exposure to a variety of hazards, including the smog of Athens. The Marbles in the British Museum have fared much better. Under present conditions, the preservation concern favors leaving the Marbles in the British Museum.</p>
<p id="c554c4d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other international interest is distributional; a concern for an appropriate international distribution of the common cultural heritage, so that all of mankind has a reasonable opportunity for access to its own and other people’s cultural achievements. There is a tendency for works of art to flow from the poor to the wealthy nations, and one can imagine the unpleasant extreme of a Third World denuded of cultural property in order to stock the museums and the private collections of a few wealthy nations.</p>
<p id="c554c4d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that Greek antiquities can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the world and that some of the greatest Greek antiquities are found abroad. But it is difficult to argue that Greece itself is in this sense impoverished. One of the reasons people go to Greece is to enjoy its wealth of antiquities. [I]t seems difficult to argue convincingly for the return of the Marbles to Athens on distributional grounds. If we focus instead on the question of access, there seems little reason to suppose that the Marbles would be more accessible to the world’s peoples in Athens than they are in London.</p>

<p id="c554c4d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Which law?</b> In <i>Schultz</i>, the United States District Court applies the law of Egypt in determining that removal of antiquities from Egypt, if proven to have occurred as alleged by the government, constituted “theft” and therefore made the defendant liable for prosecution in the United States for importing antiquities into the United States. Is that appropriate? What interest does the United States have in enforcing Egyptian law governing antiquities?</p>
<p id="c554c4da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In his discussion of the legality of the Marbles’ removal, Merryman applies international law at the time of their removal, a time during which the Greek people were under the rule of Ottoman Empire. Is that the right law to apply? Or should we evaluate the legality of the Marbles’ removal in terms of contemporary international law?</p>

<p id="c554ebf5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Wana the Bear, a direct descendant of the Bear People Lodge of the Miwok Indians, seeks reversal of a judgment that the Native American burial ground under development by defendant Community Construction, Inc., is not a cemetery entitled to protection under the California cemetery law.</p>
<p id="c554ebf6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case comes to us shrouded in the history of an ancient Indian people whose remains, bulldozed from their resting place, stir the anguish of their descendants. But there is no succor for these profound sensitivities in the law to which plaintiff appeals, the sepulchral confines of the California cemetery law.</p>
<p id="c554ebf7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On August 6, 1979, a final subdivision map was approved by the Stockton City Council and defendant went about excavating the subject property in the course of developing a residential tract. In the fall of 1979, defendant uncovered human remains on the property. Defendant continued developing the property, disinterring the remains of over 200 human beings. The burial ground had been used by the Miwok Indians until they were driven out of the area between 1850 and 1870. The site is known to be a burial ground and has been the subject of numerous archeological studies. The site still contains the remains of six or more persons. Plaintiff, a descendant of the Bear People Lodge of the Miwok Indians and related to some or all of the persons whose remains lie there, brought suit to enjoin further excavation and other “desecration” of the property on July 1, 1980.</p>
<p id="c554ebf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>The central issue in this case is whether the burial ground achieved a protectable status as a public cemetery under the 1872 cemetery law by virtue of its prior status as a public grave yard. We hold that it did not.</p>
<p id="c554ebf9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff seeks enforcement by injunction of Health and Safety Code section 7052, which makes criminal the disinterment of human remains without authority of law. He argues that the section protects a cemetery, as defined by Health and Safety Code section 8100: “Six or more human bodies being buried at one place constitute the place a cemetery.” He alleges, and we take it as true, that six or more human bodies are buried on the burial site. In order to escape the problem that the burial site does not comply with either of the two methods of creating a public cemetery, dedication or prescriptive use, plaintiff argues that section 8100, by virtue of its derivation from the 1854 cemetery law, applies to burial sites created prior to 1873 which, he claims, became public cemeteries, by the law of 1854, without dedication or prescriptive use.</p>
<p id="c554ebfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The 1854 law made punishable the mutilation of any public grave yard and the disinterment of any deceased person in any grave yard. It defined a public grave yard as follows: “Where the bodies of six or more persons are buried, it is . . . a public grave yard.” In 1872, this statute was replaced by chapter V of the new Political Code. It enacted the two means for creating a public cemetery, dedication and prescriptive use. Section 3106 of the Political Code read essentially as Health and Safety Code section 8100 does now: “Six or more human bodies being buried at one place constitutes the place a cemetery.” Section 3105 vested title to lands “used as a public cemetery or graveyard, situated in or near to any city, town, or village, and used by the inhabitants thereof continuously, without interruption, as a burial-ground for five years” in the inhabitants and prohibited use of the lands “for any other purpose than a public cemetery.” Section 3107 delineated the manner of dedicating public lands to “cemetery” or burial purposes. When the Health and Safety Code was created in 1939, these provisions were carried over into the present law.</p>
<p id="c554ebfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff claims that the presence of six or more bodies at the burial site in the period between 1854 and the time when the Miwoks were driven out (sometime between 1850 and 1870) rendered the burial ground a “public grave yard,” indelibly impressing it with such character. But the 1854 law was not incorporated into the 1872 and subsequent law as claimed by plaintiff. The 1872 law did not simply reenact section 4 of the 1854 act (making a place where six bodies were buried a “public grave yard”). It added a prescriptive use condition, vesting title of the grave yard in the city or village using it only when the land was “used as a public cemetery . . . continuously, without interruption, as a burial-ground for five years.” It further declared that “[n]o part of (the code was) retroactive unless expressly so declared.” The Miwoks were no longer using the burial ground in 1873, when chapter V of the Political Code replaced the 1854 law; therefore, the burial ground was not made a cemetery by the operation of new section 3106.</p>
<p id="c554ebfc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff finally makes a claim that public policy protects places where the dead are buried. There is indeed such a policy, but it is codified in the statutes governing the disposition of human remains. But they also establish the limits of the policy chosen <span title="243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-243">p. 243</span>by the Legislature.

<p id="c554ebfd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

The museum’s public relations director defends keeping the remains because they are “a potentially important source of anthropological information” and because the “public has the right to expect authenticity and not to be shown mere reproductions.” One morning, she finds a package on her desk. When she opens it, she sees arm and leg bones with a note explaining that “[y]ou won’t bury the bones of our ancestors because you say the public has the right to expect authenticity in the museum when it comes to look at skeletons. Therefore I am sending you a couple of authentic skeletons of ancestors [from] the cemetery in the woods behind the Episcopal Church of Saint Luke.” The note goes on: “[T]o make sure they would be perfectly authentic, I chose two whose identities you can personally confirm yourself.” The note concludes by explaining that the remains in the box are those of her grandparents.

The legislation requires property owners who discover American Indian human remains on their property to notify public officials and to negotiate with representatives of the affected tribe for reburial of the remains and associated objects. <i>See People v.

If such descendants cannot be found, the items belong to the tribe on whose tribal land they were found or to the tribe having the closest cultural affiliation with them. 25 U.S.C. §3002(a).</p>
<p id="c5551315-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Return of human remains held by museums.</b> As of 1991, the Smithsonian Institution and other institutions in the United States held tens of thousands of human remains of American Indians; the number may have been as high as 300,000. Margaret B. Bowman, <i>The Reburial of Native American Skeletal Remains: Approaches to the Resolution of a Conflict,</i> 13 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 147, 149 (1989). In addition to regulating human remains and funerary objects found on tribal and federal lands, NAGPRA provides that human remains and cultural items held by federal agencies and museums receiving federal funds shall be turned over to lineal descendants or to the appropriate American Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. 25 U.S.C. §3005(a). The statute makes an exception to this rule when “the items are indispensable for completion of a specific scientific study, the outcome of which would be of major benefit to the United States.” 25 U.S.C. §3005(b). Such items shall be returned within 90 days of the completion of the scientific study. Although the Smithsonian Institution is expressly excluded from coverage by the statute, 25 U.S.C. §3001(4) and (8), it is required to return those remains by the <i>National Museum of the Indian Act</i>, 20 U.S.C. §§80q to 80q-15. This statute requires the Smithsonian to return “any Indian human remains . . . identified by a preponderance of the evidence as those of a particular individual or as those of an individual culturally affiliated with a particular Indian tribe, . . . upon the request of the descendants of such individual or of the Indian tribe.” 20 U.S.C. §80q-9(c). It therefore allows the museum to retain any human remains for study that cannot be proven to have a connection to an identifiable tribe. As between the museum and American Indian nations, who has a stronger claim to the unidentified human remains held by the Smithsonian?</p>
<p id="c5551316-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Native American artifacts.</b> Under NAGPRA, sacred objects “needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present day adherents” (25 U.S.C. §3001(3)(C)) and “objects of cultural patrimony” that have “ongoing historical, traditional or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture” discovered on federal or tribal lands after the effective date of the law belong to the tribe on whose land they are found <span title="245" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-245">p. 245</span>or to the tribe having the closest affiliation with the objects. 25 U.S.C. §3002(a). This provision of NAGPRA does not apply to items found on private or state land. As to sacred items or objects of cultural patrimony discovered prior to the effective date of the law and now in the hands of federal agencies or museums that receive federal funding, those objects must be returned (upon request) to tribes that can successfully establish a cultural affiliation with them. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. §3005. The agency or museum will not have to return the item if it can establish that it acquired the item from someone authorized to convey them or that the items are essential to important scientific research. <i>See id.</i> If the latter exception applies, the agency or museum must return the item when the research is completed.<i> See id.</i>; <i>see also</i> 43 C.F.R. §10.10.</p>

He put labels with his name on the items and sold several of them to the Bishop Museum in Honolulu and the Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts. In 2003, those items were repatriated from the museums and reburied in the cave. It is not clear whether the items were repatriated pursuant to NAGPRA — that is, whether they were affiliated with any Native Hawaiian organization. In 2004, Daniel Taylor, the owner of an antiquities store in Hawai`i, learned of the objects’ reburial through a friend. He found the cave, which is on state land, pushed aside a stone that had been placed in front of the entrance, and found the artifacts, some of which still had Emerson’s labels affixed to them. Taylor took about 157 artifacts valued at between $800,000 and $1.2 million and tried to sell them. A grand jury in Hawai`i indicted Taylor for first-degree theft, a class B felony. To be guilty of theft under Hawai`i law, a defendant must intend to “obtain or exert control over the property of another.” Taylor moved for the dismissal of his indictment, arguing that the state did not present the grand jury with evidence sufficient to establish that the property he took was “the property of another.” Does NAGPRA answer the question of who owns the items Taylor took? Does state property law? What is the relevance, if any, of the law of Native Hawaiians who claim an affiliation with the items? <i>See State v. Taylor</i>, 269 P.2d 740 (Haw. 2011).</p>
<p id="c5553a2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3.</b> In a famous case, human remains more than 9,000 years old were found on federal land in Washington State. When the Army Corps of Engineers sought to return the remains of the “Kennewick man” to a group of Columbia River tribes, a group <span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>of scientists objected on the ground that the physiological features of the Kennewick man meant that he was Caucasian rather than Indian, that he could not be a lineal ancestor of the tribes in the area, and that examination of the remains was essential for scientific purposes. They were very eager to study the remains for scientific purposes because the presence of a Caucasian in the area at that time would change anthropologists’ views of human biological and social history. The tribes contended that his genetic makeup was irrelevant and that if he had died in that spot 9,000 years ago, then he was on tribal land and within the jurisdiction of the tribe, and it would violate their religious beliefs not to rebury his remains. They also claimed a right to rebury him and a religious claim to prevent him from being prodded by scientists. The Ninth Circuit sided with the scientists on the ground that the Kennewick man was not a Native American and that the tribes could not prove they were related to him. The statute defines “Native American” as “relating to, a tribe, people, or culture <i>that is</i> indigenous to the United States,” 25 U.S.C. §3001(9) (emphasis added), and the court determined that the use of the present tense implied that to take control of the remains, the tribe must prove they are related to a currently existing tribe or culture rather than asserting a relation between a past tribe or culture. Given his age, it was impossible to do that, and the tribes lost because they could not meet that burden. <i>Bonnichsen v. United States Department of Army</i>, 367 F.3d 864 (9th Cir. 2004). <i>See</i> Rebecca Tsosie, <i>Privileging Claims to the Past: Ancient Human Remains and Contemporary Cultural Values</i>, 31 Ariz. St. L.J. 583 (1999). Did the court interpret the statute correctly? Did it do the right thing? The secretary of the interior has promulgated rules under NAGPRA that regulate the disposition of Native American human remains that cannot be associated with a particular current federally recognized tribe by requiring repatriation to the tribe on whose land the remains were found. 43 C.F.R. §10.11.</p>

Suppose the Miwok Indians had argued before the California legislature that the bodies of their ancestors had to remain where they were found because moving the bodies would disturb their souls. The Miwoks further argued that the ground where the ancestors were found was holy land. They therefore sought legislation that would prohibit removal and reburial of human remains from ground deemed to be holy by the tribe most closely affiliated with the persons whose remains were found.</p>
