<p id="c57e6cfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public planning and the regulation of land use in the United States have origins that trace to colonial history. Public officials planned early towns, such as Annapolis and Williamsburg, as well as cities such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. As the nation grew, frontier settlements were regularly laid out in orderly fashion, with provisions for specific types of development, street grids, and public infrastructure. <i>See generally</i> James D. Kornwolf,<i> Architecture and Town Planning in Colonial North America</i> (2003). By the time of the Founding, it was common to have laws that, for example, mandated the development of underutilized land, directed such lands to specific uses such as mills, compelled the draining of wetlands, set fencing requirements to prevent animals from wandering, and required the removal of noxious plants. Other land use laws created specific residential areas in towns, regulated the height and materials, as well as the aesthetics, of buildings, and imposed a variety of affirmative obligations on urban land owners. <i>See</i> John F. Hart, <i>Colonial Land Use Law and Its Significance for Modern Takings Doctrine</i>, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1252, 1259-1281 (1996).</p>
<p id="c57e6cfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As cities grew rapidly in the nineteenth century, fueled by immigration and widespread industrialization after the Civil War, the need for planning and land use regulation grew. Between 1840 and 1880, the number of American cities with populations over 100,000 grew from 3 to 77. Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, <i>Land Use Planning and Development Regulation Law</i> §1.3, at 5 (3d ed. 2013). After the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, the City Beautiful Movement spread the ideal of civic improvement, and local governments responded with infrastructure investments and an era of grand public architecture.</p>
<p id="c57e6cfc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the turn of the twentieth century, urban planning began to develop as a profession. The architect Daniel H. Burnham, who is famously (although perhaps <span title="424" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-424">p. 424</span>apocryphally) attributed with the saying “make no small plans, they have no magic to stir men’s blood,” was the mastermind behind the 1911 General Plan of Chicago, which was the first adopted comprehensive city plan. The Plan of Chicago was a sweeping vision for the city’s development, outlining future parks, boulevards, monuments, a civic center, and other improvements, and sparked broad interest in urban planning. <i>See</i> Carl Smith, <i>The Plan of Chicago: Daniel Burnham and the Remaking of the American City</i> 86-87 (2006).</p>
<p id="c57e940d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As comprehensive planning was gaining acceptance, local governments were also experimenting with new approaches to land use regulation. In 1904 and 1905, Boston enacted ordinances that divided the city into distinct height districts, a practice that the Supreme Court upheld in <i>Welch v. Swasey</i>, 214 U.S. 91 (1909). Los Angeles passed the first modern zoning code in 1909, a city-wide ordinance that separated residential from industrial uses. New York City in 1916 enacted a comprehensive zoning code that defined commercial, retail, and residential uses. And in the 1920s, the federal government began promoting zoning as a tool for economic development, promulgating legislation that included a model state statute to enable local governments to zone.</p>

<p id="c57ebb2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The entire area of the village is divided by the ordinance into six classes of use districts, denominated U-1 to U-6, inclusive; three classes of height districts, denominated H-1 to H-3, inclusive; and four classes of area districts, denominated A-1 to A-4, inclusive. The use districts are classified in respect of the buildings which may be erected within their respective limits, as follows: U-1 is restricted to single family dwellings, public parks, water towers and reservoirs, suburban and interurban electric railway passenger stations and rights of way, and farming, non-commercial greenhouse nurseries, and truck gardening; U-2 is extended to include two-family dwellings; U-3 is further extended to include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, public libraries, museums, private clubs, community center buildings, hospitals, sanitariums, public playgrounds, and recreation buildings, and a city hall and courthouse; U-4 is further extended to include banks, offices, studios, telephone exchanges, fire and police stations, restaurants, theaters and moving picture shows, retail stores and shops, sales offices, sample rooms, wholesale stores for hardware, drugs, and groceries, stations for gasoline and oil (not exceeding 1,000 gallons storage) and for ice delivery, skating rinks and dance halls, electric substations, job and newspaper <span title="426" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-426">p. 426</span>printing, public garages for motor vehicles, stables and wagon sheds (not exceeding five horses, wagons or motor trucks), and distributing stations for central store and commercial enterprises; U-5 is further extended to include billboards and advertising signs (if permitted), warehouses, ice and ice cream manufacturing and cold storage plants, bottling works milk bottling and central distribution stations, laundries, carpet cleaning, dry cleaning, and dyeing establishments, blacksmith, horseshoeing, wagon and motor vehicle repair shops, freight stations, street car barns, stables and wagon sheds (for more than five horses, wagons or motor trucks), and wholesale produce markets and salesroom; U-6 is further extended to include plants for sewage disposal and for producing gas, garbage and refuse incineration, scrap iron, junk, scrap paper, and rag storage, aviation fields, cemeteries, crematories, penal and correctional institutions, insane and feeble-minded institutions, storage of oil and gasoline (not to exceed 25,000 gallons), and manufacturing and industrial operations of any kind other than, and any public utility not included in, a class U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, or U-5 use. There is a seventh class of uses which is prohibited altogether.</p>
<p id="c57ebb30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Class U-1 is the only district in which buildings are restricted to those enumerated. In the other classes the uses are cumulative — that is to say, uses in class U-2 include those enumerated in the preceding class U-1; class U-3 includes uses enumerated in the preceding classes, U-2, and U-1; and so on. In addition to the enumerated uses, the ordinance provides for accessory uses; that is, for uses customarily incident to the principal use, such as private garages. Many regulations are provided in respect of such accessory uses.</p>
<p id="c57ebb31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee’s tract of land comes under U-2, U-3 and U-6. The first strip of 620 feet immediately north of Euclid Avenue falls in class U-2, the next 130 feet to the north, in U-3, and the remainder in U-6. The uses of the first 620 feet, therefore, do not include apartment houses, hotels, churches, schools, or other public and semipublic buildings, or other uses enumerated in respect of U-3 to U-6, inclusive. The uses of the next 130 feet include all of these, but exclude industries, theaters, banks, shops, and the various other uses set forth in respect of U-4 to U-6, inclusive.</p>
<p id="c57ebb32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinance is assailed on the grounds that it is in derogation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution in that it deprives appellee of liberty and property without due process of law and denies it the equal protection of the law, and that it offends against certain provisions of the Constitution of the state of Ohio. The court below held the ordinance to be unconstitutional and void, and enjoined its enforcement, 297 F. 307.</p>
<p id="c57ebb33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bill alleges that the tract of land in question is vacant and has been held for years for the purpose of selling and developing it for industrial uses, for which it is especially adapted, being immediately in the path of progressive industrial development; that for such uses it has a market value of about $10,000 per acre, but if the use be limited to residential purposes the market value is not in excess of $2,500 per acre; that the first 200 feet of the parcel back from Euclid Avenue, if unrestricted in respect of use, has a value of $150 per front foot, but if limited to residential uses, and ordinary mercantile business be excluded therefrom, its value is not in excess of $50 per front foot.</p>
<p id="c57ee244-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="427" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-427">p. 427</span>It is specifically averred that the ordinance attempts to restrict and control the lawful uses of appellee’s land, so as to confiscate and destroy a great part of its value; that [prospective] buyers of land for industrial, commercial, and residential uses in the metropolitan district of Cleveland are deterred from buying any part of this land because of the existence of the ordinance; that the ordinance constitutes a cloud upon the land, reduces and destroys its value, and has the effect of diverting the normal industrial, commercial, and residential development thereof to other and less favorable locations.</p>
<p id="c57ee245-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record goes no farther than to show, as the lower court found, that the normal and reasonably to be expected use and development of that part of appellee’s land adjoining Euclid Avenue is for general trade and commercial purposes, particularly retail stores and like establishments, and that the normal and reasonably to be expected use and development of the residue of the land is for industrial and trade purposes.</p>
<p id="c57ee246-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Building zone laws are of modern origin. They began in this country about 25 years ago. Until recent years, urban life was comparatively simple; but, with the great increase and concentration of population, problems have developed, and constantly are developing, which require, and will continue to require, additional restrictions in respect of the use and occupation of private lands in urban communities. Regulations, the wisdom, necessity, and validity of which, as applied to existing conditions, are so apparent that they are now uniformly sustained, a century ago, or even half a century ago, probably would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive. Such regulations are sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable. And in this there is no inconsistency, for, while the meaning of constitutional guaranties never varies, the scope of their application must expand or contract to meet the new and different conditions which are constantly coming within the field of their operation. In a changing world it is impossible that it should be otherwise. But although a degree of elasticity is thus imparted, not to the meaning, but to the application of constitutional principles, statutes and ordinances, which, after giving due weight to the new conditions, are found clearly not to conform to the Constitution, of course, must fall.</p>
<p id="c57ee247-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinance now under review, and all similar laws and regulations, must find their justification in some aspect of the police power, asserted for the public welfare. The line which in this field separates the legitimate from the illegitimate assumption of power is not capable of precise delimitation. It varies with circumstances and conditions. A regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid as applied to the great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities. In solving doubts, the maxim “<i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>,” which lies at the foundation of so much of the common law of nuisances, ordinarily will furnish a fairly helpful clew. And the law of nuisances, likewise, may be consulted, not for the purpose of controlling, but for the helpful aid of its analogies in the process of ascertaining the scope of, the power. Thus the question whether the power exists to forbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use, like the question whether a <span title="428" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-428">p. 428</span>particular thing is a nuisance, is to be determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing considered apart, but by considering it in connection with the circumstances and the locality. <i>Sturgis v. Bridgeman</i>, L.R. 11 Ch. 852, 865. A nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard. If the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control. <i>Radice v. New York</i>, 264 U.S. 292, 294 (1924).</p>
<p id="c57ee248-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no serious difference of opinion in respect of the validity of laws and regulations fixing the height of buildings within reasonable limits, the character of materials and methods of construction, and the adjoining area which must be left open, in order to minimize the danger of fire or collapse, the evils of overcrowding and the like, and excluding from residential sections offensive trades, industries and structures likely to create nuisances.</p>
<p id="c57ee249-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, however, the exclusion is in general terms of all industrial establishments, and it may thereby happen that not only offensive or dangerous industries will be excluded, but those which are neither offensive nor dangerous will share the same fate. But this is no more than happens in respect of many practice-forbidding laws which this court has upheld, although drawn in general terms so as to include individual cases that may turn out to be innocuous in themselves. The inclusion of a reasonable margin, to insure effective enforcement, will not put upon a law, otherwise valid, the stamp of invalidity. Such laws may also find their justification in the fact that, in some fields, the bad fades into the good by such insensible degrees that the two are not capable of being readily distinguished and separated in terms of legislation. In the light of these considerations, we are not prepared to say that the end in view was not sufficient to justify the general rule of the ordinance, although some industries of an innocent character might fall within the proscribed class. It cannot be said that the ordinance in this respect “passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.” <i>Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch</i>, 226 U.S. 192, 204 (1912).</p>
<p id="c57ee24a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that the village of Euclid is a mere suburb of the city of Cleveland; that the industrial development of that city has now reached and in some degree extended into the village, and in the obvious course of things will soon absorb the entire area for industrial enterprises; that the effect of the ordinance is to divert this natural development elsewhere, with the consequent loss of increased values to the owners of the lands within the village borders. But the village, though physically a suburb of Cleveland, is politically a separate municipality, with powers of its own and authority to govern itself as it sees fit, within the limits of the organic law of its creation and the state and federal Constitutions. Its governing authorities, presumably representing a majority of its inhabitants and voicing their will, have determined, not that industrial development shall cease at its boundaries, but that the course of such development shall proceed within definitely fixed lines. If it be a proper exercise of the police power to relegate industrial establishments to localities separated from residential sections, it is not easy to find a sufficient reason for denying the power because the effect of its exercise is to divert an industrial flow from the course which it would follow, to the injury of the residential public, if left alone, to another course where such injury will <span title="429" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-429">p. 429</span>be obviated. It is not meant by this, however, to exclude the possibility of cases where the general public interest would so far outweigh the interest of the municipality that the municipality would not be allowed to stand in the way.</p>
<p id="c57ee24b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find no difficulty in sustaining restrictions of the kind thus far reviewed. The serious question in the case arises over the provisions of the ordinance excluding from residential districts apartment houses, business houses, retail stores and shops, and other like establishments. This question involves the validity of what is really the crux of the more recent zoning legislation, namely, the creation and maintenance of residential districts, from which business and trade of every sort, including hotels and apartment houses, are excluded.</p>
<p id="c57ee24c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports which bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view that the segregation of residential, business and industrial buildings will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase the safety and security of home life, greatly tend to prevent street accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential sections, decrease noise and other conditions which produce or intensify nervous disorders, preserve a more favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities — until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances.</p>
<p id="c57ee24d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If these reasons, thus summarized, do not demonstrate the wisdom or sound policy in all respects of those restrictions which we have indicated as pertinent to the inquiry, at least, the reasons are sufficiently cogent to preclude us from saying, as it must be said before the ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, that such provisions are clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</p>
<p id="c57ee24e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that when, if ever, the provisions set forth in the ordinance in tedious and minute detail, come to be concretely applied to particular premises, including those <span title="430" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-430">p. 430</span>of the appellee, or to particular conditions, or to be considered in connection with specific complaints, some of them, or even many of them, may be found to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. But where the equitable remedy of injunction is sought, as it is here, not upon the ground of a present infringement or denial of a specific right, or of a particular injury in process of actual execution, but upon the broad ground that the mere existence and threatened enforcement of the ordinance, by materially and adversely affecting values and curtailing the opportunities of the market, constitute a present and irreparable injury, the court will not scrutinize its provisions, sentence by sentence, to ascertain by a process of piecemeal dissection whether there may be, here and there, provisions of a minor character, or relating to matters of administration, or not shown to contribute to the injury complained of, which, if attacked separately, might not withstand the test of constitutionality.</p>
<p id="c57ee24f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under these circumstances, therefore, it is enough for us to determine, as we do, that the ordinance in its general scope and dominant features, so far as its provisions are here involved, is a valid exercise of authority, leaving other provisions to be dealt with as cases arise directly involving them.</p>

<p id="c57f0962-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. A “fairly helpful clew”?</b> The Supreme Court in <i>Euclid</i> invokes the maxim <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i> to explain the scope of legitimate authority to zone. The village of Euclid’s zoning code, as the Court discussed, separated apartment buildings from single-family homes (and two-family homes from one-family homes). In those residential zones, apartment buildings could be “a mere parasite,” the Court stated, and “come very near to being nuisances.” What harms, specifically, did the Court contemplate this separation of uses preventing?</p>
<p id="c57f0963-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court in <i>Euclid,</i> although striking down the statute, noted that the “blighting of property values and the congesting of population, whenever the colored or certain foreign races invade a residential section, are so well known as to be within the judicial cognizance.” <i>Ambler Realty Co. v. Village of Euclid</i>, 297 F. 307, 313 (N.D. Ohio 1924). The Supreme Court in <i>Buchanan v. Warley</i>, 245 U.S. 60 (1917), struck down a Louisville, Kentucky statute that prohibited both white persons and African Americans from moving into and occupying a residence on a street that included a majority of owners of the opposite race. After <i>Buchanan</i>, local governments could not directly use zoning authority to regulate race, but a consistent critique of zoning since its inception has been its tendency to foster segregation. <i>See</i> Richard H. Chused, Euclid<i>’s Historical Imagery</i>, 51 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 597, 604-615 (2001). Constitutional and statutory constraints on discriminatory and exclusionary zoning are discussed below in §5.</p>
<p id="c57f0964-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Judicial deference.</b> The Court in <i>Euclid</i> stated that “[i]f the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes be fairly debatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed to control.” Courts regularly invoke this deference to legislative judgment when reviewing zoning ordinances. As we will see, however, there are a number of circumstances where courts take a more searching, less deferential, approach to challenges to zoning ordinances. <i>See</i> §3.</p>
<p id="c57f0965-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="431" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-431">p. 431</span><b>3. Zoning legislation and the planning process.</b> State governments, as the Supreme Court alluded to in <i>Euclid</i>, are the ultimate repositories of the <b>police power</b>, the authority to regulate for health, welfare, and safety. One of the major ways states regulate property is by delegating power to local governments to regulate land use. States delegate zoning power through legislation, often called <b>zoning enabling acts</b>. The acts define both the scope of the powers delegated to local governments and the procedures by which the zoning process operates.</p>
<p id="c57f0966-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Voters in the local government elect a governing body, such as a <b>city council</b> or <b>county board of commissioners</b>. (Many smaller communities in New England have a <b>town meeting</b> form of government that allows voters to attend regularly scheduled meetings and vote on local laws.) The governing body is the legislative branch of government and has the power to adopt local laws governing land use in the jurisdiction, usually called <b>zoning ordinances</b> or <b>by-laws</b>. Many local governments have an executive branch as well, under a <b>mayor</b>, <b>county executive</b>, <b>board of selectmen</b>, or other forms, and departments within the executive branch that enforce zoning codes.</p>
<p id="c57f0967-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zones are meant to be established in accordance with a rational scheme for promoting development by separating incompatible uses; many zoning enabling acts also require local governments to establish a <b>comprehensive plan</b> for the jurisdiction as a whole. Such plans show the general divisions of the jurisdiction into residential, agricultural, commercial, and industrial uses and describe objectives, such as a certain level of residential growth, the preservation of specified open space, particular types of industrial development, and the like.</p>
<p id="c57f0968-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The comprehensive plan and the zoning ordinance itself are generally prepared by a <b>planning commission</b> before adoption by the local legislative body. Planning commissions are composed of community members appointed by the local legislative body. In addition to developing plans and codes, the planning commission holds public hearings, investigates and obtains relevant information, and recommends changes over time in the local zoning law or in standards for applying or administering it. The commission is often aided by a <b>planning department</b> composed of professional planners. If the local government is too small to have a planning department, it may hire a private planning firm to aid it in drafting a comprehensive plan and/or the zoning law itself.</p>
<p id="c57f0969-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The planning commission also receives petitions from particular landowners who are seeking amendments to the zoning law as it applies to their parcels. Although the planning commission has no power to pass a zoning law itself, it does hold public hearings on such petitions and makes recommendations to the city council or other legislative body to accept or reject such petitions, and its recommendations are often accepted by the lawmaking body.</p>
<p id="c57f307a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, most zoning enabling acts authorize municipalities to delegate power to an administrative agency, often called the <b>zoning board</b> or <b>board of adjustment</b>. This agency primarily serves to evaluate requests for administrative relief from zoning requirements, as discussed in detail below. <i>See</i> §4.</p>
<p id="c57f307b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. The mechanics of Euclidean zoning.</b> Traditional “Euclidean” zoning, so called because of the <i>Euclid</i> case, not the ancient Greek mathematician, consists of <span title="432" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-432">p. 432</span>both use and area zoning. <b>Use zoning</b> divides municipalities into districts and regulates the kinds of uses allowed within each district. For example, some areas may allow only agricultural uses; others may allow residential uses; still others may allow commercial uses (stores and restaurants); and, finally, others permit industrial uses. As in <i>Euclid</i>, such zoning is usually cumulative; the uses form a pyramidal structure, with the most intensive uses at the top. Single-family housing is often allowed in multi-family districts and residential housing can be allowed in industrial districts — if anyone is willing to place housing there. This pyramid generally does not work in the reverse; apartment buildings are not allowed in single-family districts, industry is excluded from residential areas, and so forth.</p>
<p id="c57f307c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Area zoning</b>, by contrast, regulates the size of lots, the height of buildings, requirements to set back structures a certain distance from property borders, and other aspects of the physical configuration of the property. In order for an owner to understand the range of what is allowed on her property under a zoning ordinance, it is necessary to examine use and area restrictions together.</p>
<p id="c57f307d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to statutory language specifying various use and area zones, zoning ordinances also generally include a <b>zoning map</b>. The map is necessary to show where specific zones are physically located in a given jurisdiction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101B9_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101B9_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> The portion of the 1922 zoning map for the Village of Euclid that contains Ambler Realty’s parcel is reproduced on page 425. Zoning maps are available on municipal and county web sites in many communities. Can you find the zoning map for the neighborhood you grew up in? Where you go to law school?</p>
<p id="c57f307f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Motivations for zoning.</b> Zoning is often justified, as it was in <i>Euclid</i>, as a means of prospectively limiting the harms that might arise from the proximity of incompatible land uses. Is zoning a better tool for this purpose than nuisance law? Than agreements between neighboring owners? What are the best arguments for distinguishing each of these approaches to controlling the uses of land? Are they necessarily mutually exclusive?</p>
<p id="c57f3080-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use regulation can also be understood as a tool that local governments use to influence the composition of their communities and the tax and budgeting implications that flow from that composition. Property taxes are a primary source of revenue for most local governments, which can shape zoning incentives. Can you see how?</p>
<p id="c57f3081-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">William Fischel has argued that because homeowners tend to concentrate their assets in their homes, they are particularly politically aware of policies that may affect the value of those homes. <i>See</i> William Fischel, <i>The Homevoter Hypothesis: How <span title="433" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-433">p. 433</span>Home Values Influence Local Government Taxation, School Finance, and Land-Use Policies</i> (2001). This creates a political incentive to respond to the policy preferences of these “homevoters,” which can translate to zoning that tends to preserve the value of owner-occupied property. What kinds of land use regulations would you expect to follow from this? Who might this tend to exclude? <i>See</i> Edward L. Glaeser &amp; Joseph Gyourko, <i>Zoning’s Steep Price</i>, 25 Reg. 24 (2002) (arguing that zoning contributes to high housing costs).</p>

<p id="c57f3084-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning is only one of a number of related regulatory regimes that define the uses and development of land. Another prominent example is <b>subdivision regulation</b>. In many jurisdictions, an owner seeking to subdivide a large parcel, for example to build a neighborhood of single-family homes, must go through a rigorous review process to ensure, among other things, that the new subdivision will have sufficient infrastructure such as streets, sidewalks, and sewers, and that the subdivision will conform to legal requirements for lot sizes, open space, police and emergency vehicle access, and connection to the jurisdiction’s street and utility grids. Even where a parcel is not being subdivided, large-scale development in many jurisdictions nonetheless requires a process of <b>site-plan review</b>. This process similarly focuses on whether there is sufficient infrastructure and services related to the new development. Subdivision control and site-plan review work with zoning, but can involve different officials and focus on different regulatory goals.</p>
<p id="c57f3085-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another important regulatory regime involves housing, building, and development codes. These codes focus on structural safety, the quality of building materials, and public health concerns, such as ensuring sufficient light and air in residential buildings. These are often based on model codes that are adopted by local governments, at times with modifications. In recent years, building codes have increasingly focused on issues such as energy efficiency and sustainability.</p>
</div>
<div id="c57f3086-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c57f3087-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">§1.4 Modernizing Zoning</p></h3></div>

<p id="c57f3088-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Euclidean zoning traditionally focused on separating uses in order to prospectively manage land use conflicts on a comprehensive basis. Although that remains an important aspect of most zoning codes, modern land use regulation has evolved significantly to encompass broader goals and new techniques. Zoning can now focus as much on development incentives, community aesthetics, combating so-called big box development, and historic preservation as it does on classifying land.</p>
<p id="c57f3089-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One criticism of traditional zoning is that it favors a distinctly suburban model of land use that fosters sprawling development and a privatized approach to community through the kind of residential zones upheld in <i>Euclid</i>. In response, “smart growth” or growth management laws limit and channel the overall development in a jurisdiction, seeking to utilize existing urban infrastructure, preserve open space, reduce car-dependency, and promote public health. They do so through a combination of <span title="434" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-434">p. 434</span>regulations that promotes the mixing, rather than the separation, of land uses, emphasizes a scale and density of development that facilitates transportation options such as transit and walking, and caps the pace or footprint of new development. Growth management laws have generated legal challenges, which will be explored in §5.</p>
<p id="c57f308a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>New Urbanism</b> similarly approaches development regulation with an emphasis on compact, mixed-use communities that favor walkability and transit. The heart of the new-urbanist critique of Euclidean zoning is that its approach to land use regulation stands in stark tension with an older tradition of urbanism that facilitated human-scale community. <i>See</i> Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk &amp; Jeff Speck, <i>Suburban Nation: The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream</i> (2001). <b>Form-based codes</b> are an increasingly popular zoning technique to advance New Urbanism. Such codes generally describe an allowable building envelope and the aesthetics of new development, leaving the specific uses of a given building largely unregulated. These codes often regulate through illustrations enacted into law as opposed to the text and map approach of traditional zoning. The idea is to focus on the experience of the streetscape and the form of the community rather than on potential conflicts between incompatible uses.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10221_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10221_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> These modern approaches to land use regulation place more emphasis on sustainability and equity, with a greater recognition of the environmental and social costs of traditional zoning.</p>
</div>
<div id="c57f579c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c57f579d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">§1.5 Patterns in Land Use Litigation</p></h3></div>

<p id="c57f579e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disputes over land use regulation tend to follow two broad patterns. In the first, a property owner who is aggrieved about a land use restriction challenges a given action by the relevant local government agency. This can involve situations where the initial imposition of zoning or other land use regulation interferes with an existing use or with an owner’s plans for her property. This kind of dispute, however, more often involves owners’ challenges to unfavorable decisions when owners seek to rezone their property, to obtain discretionary relief from zoning, or to obtain other required approvals for new development.</p>
<p id="c57f579f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second common pattern of litigation, an owner is granted the right to do something with her property that neighbors or other community members object to, and those neighbors challenge the local government’s decision. In these cases, there can be questions of <b>standing</b>, or entitlement to litigate, given that neighbors and others may be affected by, but not directly subject to, a zoning decision. Decisions on standing usually turn on a fact-specific combination of legislative authorization under the relevant zoning code and an analysis of the extent of the injury to the aggrieved party. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>,<i> Ray v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore</i>, 59 A.3d 545 (Md. <span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>2013) (residents who lived more than 1,000 feet from a site that was approved for rezoning lacked sufficient particular aggrievement for standing), <i>with Heffernan v. Missoula City Council</i>, 255 P.3d 80, 90-96 (Mont. 2011) (neighbors had standing because they fell within the statutory definition of parties entitled to challenge land use regulatory decisions and met the state constitutional requirement of alleging “a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right”).</p>
<p id="c57f57a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public opinion and citizens associations are quite powerful in zoning practice. Organized citizen groups may affect both the general shape of the zoning law and individual zoning board decisions on particular development proposals. Property developers must contend with neighborhood opposition to particular projects and may need to negotiate with citizens organizations to obtain their consent or acquiescence. These negotiations can lead to <b>community benefit agreements</b> that specify certain obligations for developers regarding issues such as affordable housing, local jobs, and development-impact mitigation. Zoning boards and city councils may also block particular developments until changes are made so as to address the concerns of neighbors and community activists. Perhaps not surprisingly, land use regulation, at least when it involves large-scale development, has increasingly shifted toward a model of negotiation. This shift may have the advantage of producing zoning rules that more carefully balance the needs of the owner and the community in the context of a given development proposal. Striking such a balance, however, can pose a challenge to the model of neutral, even-handed, prospective rational planning. <i>See</i> Carol Rose, <i>Planning and Dealing: Piecemeal Land Controls as Problem of Local Legitimacy</i>, 71 Cal. L. Rev. 837 (1983).</p>
<p id="c57f57a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Facing opposition from community groups over development or from environmental groups who fear the adverse environmental effects of particular projects, some developers have struck back by bringing lawsuits against community groups to intimidate them into dropping their opposition. The most common action brought is a claim of defamation, in which the developer alleges that defendants have made false statements intended to harm the developer’s reputation. Most courts have dismissed these lawsuits, on the grounds that (1) defendants have free speech rights to petition the government, or (2) the statements alleged to have been made by defendants constitute opinions, not statements of fact, and thus cannot be true or false. These cases have been characterized as <b>SLAPP suits</b>, a term that stands for “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” <i>See</i> Penelope Canan &amp; George W. Pring, <i>SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out</i> (1996).</p>

<p id="c57f57a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When municipalities enact zoning codes, the legislation tends to follow existing land use patterns. This means that owners who are using their property in a certain way, such as for single-family homes or farmland, are able to continue doing so. However, zoning may also require owners to phase out or change existing uses, or may impose new rules in the middle of the development process, as local governments recognize new concerns (or respond to new pressures). Two doctrines in particular, prior nonconforming use and vested rights, can provide legal protection against newly enacted zoning or other land use regulation that surprises owners who had invested in reliance on prior law.</p>
<p id="c57f7eb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The source and status of these doctrines is unclear. They may constitute applications of the federal or state constitutional rules prohibiting uncompensated takings of property, or due process limitations on retroactive legislation. However, many cases applying these rules treat them as nonconstitutional doctrines, suggesting that they are based on an interpretation of the state’s zoning enabling act or its administrative law code. <i>See generally</i> Christopher Serkin, <i>Existing Uses and the Limits of Land Use Regulations</i>, 84 N.Y.U.

<p id="c57fa5d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ometime prior to 1955 Parrillo’s operated as a restaurant and catering service on Harrison Street, Belleville. On January 1, 1955 the Town enacted a new zoning ordinance of which all provisions pertinent here are still in effect. The system created under that ordinance provided for zoning under which specific permitted uses for each zone were itemized. Uses not set forth for a particular zone were deemed prohibited. Parrillo’s was situated in a “B” residence zone, which did not allow restaurants. However, because it had been in existence prior to the effective date of the zoning ordinance, defendant’s establishment qualified as a preexisting nonconforming use<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102CF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102CF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> and, under the terms of the ordinance, was allowed to remain in operation.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="437" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-437">p. 437</span>In 1978 defendant’s owners made certain renovations in the premises. Upon their completion Parrillo’s opened as a discotheque. We readily acknowledge that included among those for whom the term “discotheque” has not, at least until this case, found its way into their common parlance are some members of this Court; and on the assumption that there may be others whose experience has denied them an intimate familiarity with the term and the milieu to which it applies, we pause to extend the benefit of definition. <i>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary</i> 63a (1976) informs us that a discotheque is a “small intimate nightclub for dancing to recorded music; broadly: a nightclub often featuring psychedelic and mixed-media attractions (as slides, movies, and special lighting effects).” “Disco” appears to be an accepted abbreviation. Defendant’s operation is closer to the broad definition above than it is to a small or intimate cabaret.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after they had opened under the new format, Parrillo’s owners applied for a discotheque license as required by the Town’s ordinance regulating dancehalls. Although the application was denied, defendant continued business as usual. Thereupon the municipal construction code official filed the charges culminating in the conviction under review. The municipal court imposed a fine of $250.00.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On a trial <i>de novo</i> after defendant’s appeal to the Superior Court, Law Division, the defendant was again found guilty. The Appellate Division reversed.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Superior Court Judge Joseph Walsh made extensive and specific findings of fact. They are amply supported by the record and are as follows:</p>
<p id="c57fa5d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The business was formerly advertised as a restaurant; it is now advertised as a “disco.” It was formerly operated every day and now it is open but one day and three evenings. The primary use of the dance hall was incidental to dining; now it is the primary use. The music was formerly provided by live bands and now it is recorded and operated by a so-called “disc-jockey.” An admission charge of $3.00 on the Wednesday opening and $5.00 on the Friday and Saturday openings is now mandatory as opposed to any prior entry charge. There is no charge for Sunday. Formerly there was but one bar; now there are several.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the course of the testimony it was admitted that the business is operated as a “disco.” Normal lighting in the premises was altered to psychedelic lighting, colored and/or revolving, together with mirrored lighting. The premises were crowded and there were long lines waiting to enter. There are now fewer tables than the prior use required and on one occasion there were no tables. The music was extremely loud and the premises can accommodate 431 persons legally. There have been numerous complaints from residents adjacent to the area. During the course of the testimony “disco” dancing was described by the owners as dancing by “kids” who “don’t hold each other close.” The bulk of the prior business was food catering; now there is none. The foods primarily served at the present time are “hamburgers” and “cheeseburgers,” although there are other selections available to people who might come in earlier than the “disco” starting time.</p>
<p id="c57fa5d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the basis of these findings Judge Walsh concluded that there had been a prohibited change in the use of the premises. He found to be dispositive the straightforward proposition that “a ‘disco’ is a place wherein you dance and a restaurant a <span title="438" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-438">p. 438</span>place wherein you eat. It is as simple as that” — an unvarnished exercise in reductionism, perhaps, but one fully justified in this case. He concluded that the defendant had “abandoned all the pretenses of the continued existence of a restaurant as it was before.” We agree with that conclusion.</p>
<p id="c57fa5da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Historically, a nonconforming use has been looked upon as “a use of land, buildings or premises that lawfully existed prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance and which is maintained after the effective date of such ordinance even though it does not comply with the use restrictions applicable to the area in which it is situated.” 6 R. Powell, <i>The Law of Real Property</i>, ¶871 (Perm. ed. 1979). Under the Municipal Land Use Act, N.J. Stat. §§40:55D-1 <i>et seq.</i>, such property is deemed to have acquired a vested right to continue in such form, irrespective of the restrictive zoning provisions:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c57fa5db-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the passage of an ordinance may be continued upon the lot or in the structure so occupied and any such structure maybe restored or repaired in the event of partial destruction thereof. (N.J. Stat. §40:55D-68.)</p>
</div>
<p id="c57fccec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This statutory guarantee against compulsory termination, however, is not without limit. Because nonconforming uses are inconsistent with the objectives of uniform zoning, the courts have required that consistent with the property rights of those affected and with substantial justice, they should be reduced to conformity as quickly as is compatible with justice. In that regard the courts have permitted municipalities to impose limitations upon nonconforming uses. Such restrictions typically relate to the change of use; the enlargement or extension of the repair or replacement of nonconforming structures; and limits on the duration of nonconforming uses through abandonment or discontinuance.</p>
<p id="c57fcced-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The method generally used to limit nonconforming uses is to prevent any increase or change in the nonconformity. Under that restrictive view our courts have held that an existing nonconforming use will be permitted to continue only if it is a continuance of substantially the same kind of use as that to which the premises were devoted at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance. In that regard nonconforming uses may not be enlarged as of right except where the change is so negligible or insubstantial that it does not warrant judicial or administrative interference. Where there is doubt as to whether an enlargement or change is substantial rather than insubstantial, the courts have consistently declared that it is to be resolved against the enlargement or change.</p>
<p id="c57fccee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case it is acknowledged by all parties that the former restaurant had constituted a proper preexisting nonconforming use. The issue then becomes whether the conversion from a restaurant to a discotheque represented a substantial change, and was thus improper. Fundamental to that inquiry is an appraisal of the basic character of the use, before and after the change.</p>
<p id="c57fccef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts that have engaged in that appraisal have proceeded with a caution approaching suspicion.<i> Hantman v. Randolph Twp.</i>, 155 A.2d 554 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1959), well illustrates the proper analysis for examining changes in nonconforming uses. In <i>Hantman</i>, the plaintiffs owned a commercial bungalow colony which was <span title="439" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-439">p. 439</span>primarily dedicated to seasonal use. When the area in which the colony was situated was zoned for residential use, the plaintiffs’ property was afforded preexisting nonconforming use status by the Township. In 1957 the plaintiffs attempted to convert the bungalows into dwellings suitable for year-round occupancy. That effort was challenged by the Township on the ground that the change would constitute an unlawful extension of the nonconforming use.</p>
<p id="c57fccf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reviewing the facts the court established that the plaintiffs’ bungalows were in fact nonconforming uses. It then proceeded to address the question of whether permitting full-time occupancy would effect a substantial change in the premises. Answering in the affirmative, the court declared, “an increase in the time period during which a nonconforming use is operated may justifiably be the basis for finding an unlawful extension thereof, just as changes in the functional use of the land or increases in the area of use have been.” Recognizing that nonconforming uses are disfavored, the Appellate Division emphasized the deleterious effect that year-round operation of the bungalows might have upon the general welfare of the municipality. Noting that where there is doubt as to the substantiality of the extension, it should be disapproved, the court found the proposed conversion represented a substantial, and therefore unlawful, change in the nonconforming property. We fully approve of and adopt the approach and analytical framework of the <i>Hantman</i> court.</p>
<p id="c57fccf1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have already expressed our agreement with the municipal court and with Judge Walsh, presiding at the trial <i>de novo</i>, that defendant’s conversion of the premises from a restaurant to a discotheque resulted in a substantial, and therefore impermissible, change. The entire character of the business has been altered. What was once a restaurant is now a dancehall. Measured by the zoning ordinance the general welfare of the neighborhood has been demonstrably affected adversely by the conversion of defendant’s business. Our strong public policy restricting nonconforming uses requires reversal of the judgment below.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c57fccf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="c57fccf4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Curtailing incompatible uses through amortization.</b> Even where zoning generally follows existing patterns of development, there can be isolated parcels that are being used in ways that are not compatible with the surrounding zone. In many instances, this can be non-controversial, as with a small grocery store in an otherwise residential neighborhood. But nonconforming uses can also undermine the public purposes of zoning and create a legislatively protected monopoly, if an owner has the exclusive right to conduct a business in the area. Early zoning codes generally assumed that disfavored incompatible uses would largely fade away over time, but that turned out not to be the case for many such anomalies. (Can you see why?) Zoning codes thus have to balance the rights of owners whose established uses conflict with the orderly development of a community and the expectations of neighbors who may be relying on the general character of a neighborhood to be protected by zoning.</p>
<p id="c57fccf5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, local governments may require nonconforming uses to be phased out through a process called <b>amortization</b>. With amortization, local governments <span title="440" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-440">p. 440</span>give the nonconforming owner a limited period of time to continue the use. If this gives owners sufficient time to realize a reasonable return on their investment, that will balance the owner’s reliance interest with the public’s needs represented in the zoning code. Amortization periods can be fixed by statute, depending on the nature of the property. <i>See</i> Patricia E. Salkin, <i>Abandonment, Discontinuance and Amortization of Nonconforming Uses: Lessons for Drafters of Zoning Regulations</i>, 38 Real Est. L.J. 486 (2010) (citing local amortization statutes with periods ranging from 3 to 50 years). They can also be set on a case-by-case basis, looking at issues such as the depreciable value of the property and an owner’s specific investment. Courts have upheld both methods, but in so doing, generally look to whether owners can obtain a reasonable return on their investment, weighing public gain against private loss. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Bugsy’s, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach</i>, 530 S.E.2d 890, 895 (S.C. 2000).</p>
<p id="c57fccf6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, nonconforming uses may continue even where property has been transferred from one owner to another. However, in <i>Village of Valatie v. Smith</i>, 632 N.E.2d 1264 (N.Y. 1994), the court upheld a provision that provided the right to continue a nonconforming use would be terminated upon transfer of the property. The defendant had inherited a mobile home that was nonconforming because it was situated outside of a mobile home park. The village sought to have the mobile home removed, and the owner argued that pegging termination to the transfer had no relation either to the village’s land use objectives or to the owner’s investment and impermissibly zoned based on who owns the property, not on the use to which the property is being put. The court rejected these arguments under a general test that looked to the overall reasonableness of the amortization period.</p>
<p id="c57fccf7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Limiting changes for nonconforming uses.</b> <i>Belleville v. Parrillo’s</i> illustrates another way to balance an owner’s interest in continuing a nonconforming use against the public interest in the zoning code, by strictly limiting the owner to the use that existed at the time zoning was imposed. An owner may then continue the nonconforming use indefinitely.</p>
<p id="c57fccf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This right to continue a nonconforming use can raise a number of legal challenges. For example, is an owner allowed to increase the intensity of uses as business grows? <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Piesco v. Hollihan</i>, 47 A.D.3d 938 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008) (nonconforming restaurant and marina allowed to increase the volume and intensity of the use). Can the owner of a nonconforming parcel expand to use more of a given parcel? <i>Compare, e.g.</i>,<i> Shirley Wayside Ltd. Partnership v. Board of Appeals of Shirley</i>, 961 N.E.2d 1055 (Mass. 2012) (nonconforming mobile home park entitled to expand the area on the property that had mobile homes on it),<i> with Adams Outdoor Advertising, L.P. v. Board of Zoning Appeals</i>, 645 S.E.2d 271 (Va. 2007) (owner of nonconforming billboard denied the right to add an electronic message board because the addition increased the billboard’s depth, even though its visible dimensions were unchanged). How should courts evaluate the extent to which a change to a nonconforming use is permissible?</p>
<p id="c57ff409-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Abandonment and destruction.</b> Under many zoning ordinances, if a nonconforming use is abandoned or discontinued, the nonconforming status is lost, even if the owner later attempts to reestablish that use. The standard for abandonment or <span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-441">p. 441</span>discontinuance is generally defined by the relevant zoning code, most of which are interpreted by courts to require proof of the owner’s intent to abandon. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>, <i>Gorgone v. D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment</i>, 973 A.2d 692, 694 (D.C. 2009) (requiring a showing of an overt act or failure to act that implies abandonment as well as evidence of intent by the owner to abandon), <i>with Pike Indus., Inc. v. Woodward</i>, 999 A.2d 257, 261-262 (N.H. 2010) (zoning ordinance did not require evidence of intent to abandon where it provided that if “a non-conforming use has been discontinued for more than one year for any reason, such non-conforming use shall not thereafter be re-established”). If a nonconforming use is not abandoned, but substantially damaged or destroyed, for example in a fire, most zoning ordinances do not allow owners to rebuild.</p>

The issues raised by plaintiffs focus on the validity of the rezoning ordinance. We find no error in trial court’s rulings and affirm its decision.</p>
<p id="c57ff415-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appeal is a zoning dispute involving approximately six acres of land in the city of Wilton, Iowa. Plaintiffs purchased the undeveloped land in June 1979 with the intent of developing a low income, federally subsidized housing project. The project was to consist of several multi-family units; therefore, feasibility of the project depended upon multi-family zoning of the tract. At the time of purchase approximately one-fourth of plaintiffs’ land was zoned R-1, single-family residential, and the remainder was zoned R-2, multi-family residential.</p>
<p id="c57ff416-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the land was purchased, plaintiffs incurred expenses for architectural fees and engineering services in the preparation of plans and plats to be submitted to the city council and its planning and zoning commission. In addition, plaintiffs secured a Farmers’ Home Administration (FHA) loan commitment for construction of the project.</p>
<p id="c57ff417-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December 1979 plaintiffs filed a preliminary plat for the project with the city clerk. In March 1980, following a public meeting, the planning and zoning commission recommended to the city council that land in the northern part of the city be rezoned to single-family residential due to alleged inadequacies of sewer, water and <span title="442" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-442">p. 442</span>electrical services. The rezoning recommendation affected all of plaintiffs’ property plus tracts owned by two other developers. Plaintiffs’ application on May 21, 1980, for a building permit to construct multi-family dwellings was denied due to the pending rezoning recommendation.</p>
<p id="c57ff418-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 1980, plaintiffs filed a petition against the city seeking a declaratory judgment invalidating any rezoning of their property, temporary and permanent injunctions to prohibit passage of any rezoning ordinance, and in the event of rezoning, $570,000 damages for monies expended on the project, anticipated lost profits and alleged reduction in the value of plaintiffs’ land.</p>
<p id="c57ff419-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In accordance with the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the city council passed an ordinance rezoning the land from R-2 to R-1 in June 1980. Following the council’s rezoning decision, the planning and zoning commission approved plaintiffs’ preliminary plat.</p>
<p id="c57ff41a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he inevitable restrictions on individual uses of property which accompany zoning normally do not constitute a taking. Plaintiffs, however, claim to have had a vested right in developing their property as subsidized, multi-family housing and, therefore, the rezoning allegedly amounted to a taking of this right. Consequently, they contend the zoning ordinance should be inapplicable to their project. We disagree.</p>
<p id="c57ff41b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record shows that a factor in the Stones’ choice of property was zoning which permitted multi-family residences. Immediately after purchasing the property in Wilton, plaintiffs made certain expenditures in preparation for obtaining the necessary government financing and in order to comply with city ordinances for platting and building permits. These expenditures totaled approximately $7,900, plus the time and effort expended personally by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p id="c57ff41c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The standard for determining if a property owner has vested rights in a zoning classification was set forth in <i>Board of Supervisors of Scott County v. Paaske</i>, 98 N.W.2d 827, 831 (Iowa 1959):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c57ff41d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is impossible to fix a definite percentage of the total cost which establishes vested rights and applies to all cases. It depends on the type of the project, its location, ultimate cost, and <i>principally the amount accomplished under conformity</i>. Each case must be decided on its own merits, taking these elements into consideration. (Emphasis added.)</p>
</div>
<p id="c5801b2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to rezoning, Paaske purchased a parcel of land onto which he planned to move five houses. The county granted him a permit to move the houses. Paaske excavated the basements for four houses; placed a septic tank underground for the fifth house; laid concrete footings for the basement of two houses; entered into a contract for the building of the foundations under all five houses, and placed a substantial amount of building materials on the property before the land was rezoned. We concluded that Paaske’s endeavors prior to rezoning were so substantial that he had a vested right in completing his project.</p>
<p id="c5801b2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, one of the factors leading to the purchase of this land in Wilton was the fact that it was zoned for multi-family residences. Plaintiffs secured funding from the FHA and engaged the services of an architect and engineer who drew up plans and plats. But these were only the most preliminary steps towards construction. <span title="443" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-443">p. 443</span>The architect’s plans were not the working blueprints of a contractor. The trial court stated they were “the kind [of plans] that one could find in <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i> [magazine].” No construction bids were sought and no construction contracts were let. No materials were placed on the site and no construction or earth work was started. We agree with the trial court that plaintiffs’ efforts and expenditures prior to rezoning were not so substantial as to create vested rights in the completion of the housing project on that particular tract of land in Wilton.</p>
<p id="c5801b30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the facts of this case, plaintiffs had to prove they had a vested right to complete their intended project in order to argue that the rezoning constituted a taking. All that the rezoning did was to deprive plaintiffs of what they considered to be the land’s most beneficial use. If, as we have found, the ordinance is a valid exercise of police power, the fact that it deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not render it an unconstitutional taking.</p>
<p id="c5801b31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“In determining where a zoning regulation ends and a taking of property begins, the test is essentially one of reasonableness.” C. Rhyne, <i>The Law of Local Government Operations</i>, §26.16 at 745 (1980). We do not believe that rezoning a portion of plaintiffs’ property from R-2 to R-1 exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. The city council clearly could have reasonably believed that the general welfare interests of the community outweighed the Stones’ investment interest in constructing subsidized, multi-family housing.</p>
<p id="c5801b32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the testimony of Stones’ expert is accepted, the change in zoning resulted in, at most, a 42% decrease in value of their property. Such economic impact does not constitute a taking in light of the council’s reasonable belief that the public welfare required a change in zoning. <i>See Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (75% diminution in value caused by zoning law did not constitute a taking). Other evidence, however, showed the rezoning to R-1 only slightly affected the fair market value of plaintiffs’ land.</p>
<p id="c5801b33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs’ claim to a right to realize their investment expectations overlooks the fact that “rights granted by legislative action under police power can be taken away when in the valid exercise of its discretion the legislative body sees fit.” [<i>Keller v. City of Council Bluffs</i>, 66 N.W.2d 113, 119 (Iowa 1954).] At most, the decision of the council “took” from plaintiffs a sizeable tax shelter. Because the reasonableness of the council’s decision to rezone plaintiffs’ property clearly is at least a fairly debatable question, we cannot substitute our view of reasonableness for that of the council.</p>
<p id="c5801b34-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the ordinance which rezoned an area of the city of Wilton that included a portion of plaintiffs’ land is valid and applicable to plaintiffs’ land and proposed project.</p>

<p id="c5801b37-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states agree with the standard in <i>Stone</i>: owners have vested rights to existing zoning law if they have invested substantially in good faith reliance on that law. A majority of courts will require an owner’s substantial investment to be made based on a validly issued building permit or other approval. Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer <span title="444" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-444">p. 444</span>&amp; Thomas E. Roberts, <i>Land Use Planning and Development Regulation Law</i> §5.28, at 171 (3d ed. 2013). In some states, by contrast, developers can vest their rights if they incur substantial costs in reasonable reliance on existing law even in the absence of a building permit. <i>See Friends of Yamhill County, Inc. v. Board of Commissioners of Yamhill County</i>, 264 P.3d 1265, 1274 (Or. 2011); <i>see also</i> Va. Code §15.2-2307 (requiring extensive obligations or substantial expenditure in good faith reliance on a “significant affirmative governmental act” such as a rezoning or site plan approval)<i>.</i></p>
<p id="c5801b38-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question of how to measure the necessary substantiality of the investment has divided the courts. In<i> Friends of Yamhill County</i>, the court noted that one approach has been to compare “ ‘the ratio of expenses incurred to the total cost of the project,’ ” measuring “those expenses that related ‘exclusive[ly]’ to the proposed development.” 264 P.3d at 1275 (quoting <i>Town of Hempstead v. Lynne</i>, 222 N.Y.S.2d 526 (1961)). <i>Friends of Yamhill County</i> identified a broader approach, however, adding to the ratio analysis other factors that include:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5801b39-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the good faith of the landowner, whether or not he had notice of any proposed zoning or amendatory zoning before starting his improvements, the type of expenditures, i.e., whether the expenditures have any relation to the completed project or could apply to various other uses of the land, the kind of project, the location and ultimate cost. Also, the acts of the landowner should rise beyond mere contemplated use or preparation, such as leveling of land, boring test holes, or preliminary negotiations with contractors or architects.</p>

<p id="c5801b3b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A minority of states grants developers vested rights upon the filing of a valid and fully complete building permit application, without the need to demonstrate substantial expenditures. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Abbey Road Group, LLC v. City of Bonney Lake</i>, 218 P.3d 180, 182-183 (Wash. 2009). This so-called early vesting approach is thought to promote certainty, because it identifies a moment in the development process when owners and the local government know that the land use rules in force will remain. Some states allow vesting if a developer obtains site-specific approval for development, such as a preliminary subdivision plan, even before a building permit is issued; New Jersey provides such protection. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.J. Stat. §§40:55D-49 to 40:55D-52. Some states go so far as to grant developers vested rights to use their land in accordance with the zoning law in place at the time they <i>apply for</i> site-specific approval. Colo. Rev. Stat. §§24-68-101 to 24-68-106; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, §6; Tex. Loc. Govt. Code §§245.002-245.006; Wash. Rev. Code §§19.27.095, 58.17.033.</p>

<p id="c5801b3e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> In <i>Cumberland Farms v. Town of Groton</i>, 719 A.2d 465 (Conn. 1998), land used as a gas station was rezoned for residential use. The gas station was allowed to continue operation as a prior nonconforming use. However, when the owner was required by federal environmental statutes to clean up pollution caused by leaking underground <span title="445" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-445">p. 445</span>storage tanks on the property, the owner sought to open a little convenience store on the property along with the gas station to raise enough money to pay for the cleanup. Assume that the income from operation of the gas station is not sufficient to pay for the environmental cleanup but that the owner could sell the property at a very low price to someone who could clean up the property, demolish the gas station, and construct condominiums on the land. Such a sale would end the prior nonconforming use and clean up the property but the current owner would have lost his business and received very little in selling the land. The current owner cannot convert the property to condominiums himself because no bank would loan him the money for the project. The property has a viable economic use for another owner but the only economically viable use for the current owner is to open the convenience store and keep operating the gas station.</p>
<p id="c580414f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the current owner entitled to open a small convenience store on the gas station property under the prior nonconforming use doctrine?</p>
<p id="c5804150-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> A licensed day care center operates on a parcel of property that is rezoned for residential use. The day care use is allowed to continue as a prior nonconforming use. The cost of insurance rises so dramatically that it may no longer be profitable to operate the day care center. The site is suitable for a single-family dwelling, but the structure is not; the cost of renovating the day care center to convert it to a single-family home is roughly equivalent to the cost of tearing it down and building an entirely new structure. The owner of the day care center wishes to convert the property for use as classroom facilities for deaf high school students, who would take some classes at the center and other classes with hearing students at the high school. The building is suited to such a use.</p>

<p id="c5804152-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Vested rights.</b> The owner gets the property rezoned for school purposes, begins plans to convert the building, hires and pays fees to an architect and signs a contract with a building contractor to renovate the day care center and a contract with the school board to provide classes in sign language for the deaf high school students in the school district. Both contracts are contingent on obtaining a building permit as required by the local zoning law. The owner applies for, but has not yet been granted, a building permit and has spent a total of $20,000. The neighbors organize opposition to the location of the project and successfully induce the city council to rescind its rezoning of the parcel, effectively returning the parcel to residential use. The owner of the parcel sues the city, claiming that the second rezoning interferes with her vested rights in the prior zoning classification. She argues that owners have vested rights to use property in accordance with existing zoning classifications if they invest substantial amounts of money (in addition to the purchase price of the parcel) in plans to build on the parcel in reasonable reliance on the existing classification. <span title="446" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-446">p. 446</span>The city argues that no vested rights can arise until a building permit has actually been issued, regardless of the sum the owner has spent in preparatory plans.

<p id="c5804155-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Developers who want to build projects that are inconsistent with current zoning requirements may approach the planning board or the city council with a proposal to <b>rezone</b> the parcel in a manner that will authorize the project. Rezoning may be done for particular parcels or for whole districts or portions of districts. Rezoning can involve amendments to the text of the ordinance, which prospectively change the allowable uses or the permitted physical attributes of the development, or can involve map amendments, which change the geographical boundaries of existing zones. Some rezoning involves both text and map amendments.</p>
<p id="c5804156-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many state zoning enabling acts require any changes in the zoning ordinance to accord with the comprehensive plan. This does not mean the plan cannot be changed over time. It does mean, however, that zoning decisions are intended to be made with a broad, long-range view of how uses harmonize in the jurisdiction as a whole. Some courts will hold local legislatures strictly to the requirement that zoning proceed in accord with a general plan, striking down zoning amendments that are not sufficiently justified in light of comprehensive planning.<i> Riya Finnegan LLC v. Township Council of South Brunswick</i>, 962 A.2d 484, 489-491 (N.J. 2008). Many courts grant greater discretion to the governing body; some treat the zoning code itself as evidence of a master plan, and some courts, particularly in states that have no requirement for planning, may not require consistency with planning at all.</p>
<p id="c5804157-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Review for consistency with a general plan is only one of several doctrines under which courts reviewing challenges to particularized zoning changes may take a less deferential approach than normally applied to economic and social regulation. This section reviews several of these doctrines: (1) contract and conditional zoning, (2) spot zoning, (3) the change or mistake doctrine, and (4) characterizing rezoning as a quasi-judicial, rather than legislative, act. These doctrines, which can overlap to some degree in practice, do not necessarily render rezoning invalid, but they can weaken the presumption of validity that generally applies to legislative acts.</p>
<p id="c5804158-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This less deferential approach to judicial review may be justified by concerns about a breakdown in the political process through which a given land use law has been passed, or concerns about local corruption. Alternatively, courts may be seeking to reinforce the primacy of general, prospective, comprehensive zoning. As you read the material in this section, consider whether it is better for courts to defer to local legislatures when owners challenge zoning law or take a more active role in overseeing the local political process.</p>

<p id="c5806871-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 28, 1997, residents attending the town of Bellingham’s (town’s) open town meeting voted to rezone a parcel of land located in the town. Three and one-half years later, several residents living near the parcel brought suit challenging the rezoning. The question before the court is whether the town meeting vote was invalid because the prospective owner of the parcel, IDC Bellingham, L.L.C. (IDC), had offered to give the town $8 million if the rezoning was approved and a power plant was built and operated on the site.</p>
<p id="c5806872-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>1. Background</i></p>
<p id="c5806873-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essential facts of this case are undisputed. In 1993, the town began to examine ways to increase its property tax base. An economic development task force was appointed by the town’s board of selectmen (board) to study the issue. The task force prepared a report recommending that development of industrial land in the town be a priority. The report identified a parcel on the corner of Depot Street and Box Pond Road (locus), which abutted land that was already zoned for industrial use, as a candidate for rezoning from agricultural and suburban use to industrial use. Subsequently, at the town’s May, 1995, town meeting, a zoning article proposing the rezoning of the locus and an adjacent parcel for industrial use fell eight votes short of the required two-thirds majority.</p>
<p id="c5806874-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1997, IDC, which owned a power plant in the town, began discussions with town officials about the possibility of rezoning the locus so that a second plant might ultimately be built on it. These discussions included the subject of what public benefits and financial inducements IDC might offer the town with regard to the proposed plant. The town administrator told IDC officials that the town was facing an $8 million shortfall in its plans to construct a much needed new high school. Shortly thereafter, the president of IDC publicly announced that IDC would make an $8 million gift to the town if IDC (1) decided to build the plant; (2) obtained the financing and permits necessary to build the plant; and (3) operated the plant successfully for one year. The offer was made to generate support for the plant and became common knowledge in the town.</p>
<p id="c5806875-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the genesis of the offer was the need for a new high school, IDC made it clear that the town could use the money for any municipal purpose. The town’s high school building committee, the town’s finance committee, the town’s master plan steering committee, and certain town officials voiced strong support for the plant and the zoning change required for its construction on the locus. Some committee members engaged in a campaign to get voters to the town meeting at which the rezoning was to be considered.</p>
<p id="c5806876-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="448" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-448">p. 448</span>On May 28, 1997, the town held its open town meeting and a zoning article calling for the rezoning of the locus was introduced. IDC made a presentation of its proposed use of the locus for a second power plant and reiterated its offer of an $8 million gift to the town if the plant was built and became operational. The planning board and finance committee both recommended passage of the zoning article. There was some discussion of the zoning aspects of the proposal, as well as discussion regarding the offered gift. Residents for and against the proposal to build a plant on the site spoke, and IDC responded to their comments.

At some point in the summer of 1998, the board learned that IDC was proposing to increase the size of the plant beyond what it had presented to the town meeting in 1997. Consequently, the board wrote a letter to the energy facilities siting board [whose approval is required prior to the construction of any “generating facility,” <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 164, §§69H-69J1/2] withdrawing its support for the plant. Shortly thereafter, representatives of IDC and the board met to negotiate a compromise. The outcome of those negotiations was an agreement by IDC to reduce the size of the plant and, in April, 1999, the execution of an “Agreement for Water/Wastewater Services” between IDC and the town. The agreement provided in part that:</p>

On January 23, 2001, the plaintiffs, eight landowners located near the locus, filed suit in the Land Court against IDC, the town, the town zoning board of appeals, and the owner of the property. [Plaintiffs] seek declaratory judgment that the rezoning of the locus on May 28, 1997, was void because it constituted illegal “contract” zoning.</p>

He viewed the offer of the gift as an “extraneous consideration,” because it was not defended as being in mitigation of the impacts of the project, and therefore concluded that it was “offensive to public policy.” He ultimately concluded that the fact that the offer was made was sufficient, without the necessity of finding that voting town meeting members were influenced by it, to nullify the rezoning vote. The defendants appealed. Because we conclude that the voluntary offer of public benefits beyond what might be necessary to mitigate the development of a parcel of land does not, standing alone, invalidate a legislative act of the town meeting, we reverse.</p>

It will not normally be undone unless the plaintiff can demonstrate “by a preponderance of the evidence that the zoning regulation is arbitrary and unreasonable, or substantially unrelated to the public health, safety . . . or general welfare.” <i>Johnson v. Edgartown</i>, 680 N.E.2d 37, 40 (Mass. 1997).

<p id="c580687f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Municipal zoning procedure is governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A. Section 5 dictates the process a municipality must follow in amending its zoning bylaws. In a town, such an amendment must be submitted to the board [of selectmen], which, within fourteen days, must then refer the amendment to the planning board for review. The planning board has sixty-five days during which to hold a public hearing, with notice provided beforehand, at which members of the public can offer their views on the amendment. Once the hearing has been held, the planning board has twenty-one days to provide its recommendation to the town meeting. Thereafter, the town meeting may adopt, reject, or amend the proposed amendment to the zoning bylaw. The town meeting must act, however, within six months of the planning board hearing. The amendment will not be enacted unless it receives a two-thirds vote from town meeting. Neither party claims that this process was not followed, and the record before us indicates that it was.</p>
<p id="c5806880-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An agreement between a property owner and a municipality to rezone a parcel of land may cause the municipality to violate the process mandated by §5. Such an instance of “contract zoning,” as we will refer to it, involving a promise by a municipality to rezone a property either before the vote to rezone has been taken or before the required §5 process has been undertaken, evades the dictates of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, and may render the subsequent rezoning invalid. The Land Court judge correctly concluded that no such advance agreement existed in this case. IDC pledged that if the town were to rezone the locus for industrial use (and if other events occurred), IDC would pay the town $8 million.

<p id="c5808f94-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge found that absent the $8 million offer, the rezoning was substantively valid. We take that to mean that it was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable, and was substantially related to the public health, safety, or general welfare of the town. In other words, its adoption served a valid public purpose. The record fully supports this conclusion. The locus abutted land zoned for industrial use; a town-appointed task force (preceding and completely unrelated to the power plant development proposal) had recommended its rezoning after studying the town’s tax base and the need for economic development;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10580_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10580_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> and a previous rezoning attempt based on that recommendation had just barely failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at the 1995 town meeting.</p>
<p id="c5808f96-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, the enactment of the bylaw rezoning the locus was not violative of State law or constitutional provisions, and met the substantive requirements of a valid exercise of legislative police power. Nevertheless, the judge set it aside because he concluded that the $8 million offer was an “extraneous consideration,” that is, an offer not “tied to the impacts of the project” and therefore “offensive to public policy.” We must decide whether such a consideration, voluntarily offered as part of a campaign in support of a development project, constitutes an independent ground on which to set aside a legislative act, regardless of its otherwise valid nature. If it is, we must decide further whether the mere existence of an “extraneous consideration” invalidates the legislative act as a matter of law, regardless whether it is proved to have actually influenced the votes of the legislative body. Because we conclude that a voluntary offer of public benefits is not, standing alone, an adequate ground on which to set aside an otherwise valid legislative act, we do not reach the second question.</p>
<p id="c5808f97-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, there is no reason to invalidate a legislative act on the basis of an “extraneous consideration,” because we defer to legislative findings and choices without regard to motive.

We conclude that the proper focus of review of a zoning enactment is whether it violates State law or constitutional provisions, is arbitrary or unreasonable, or is substantially unrelated to the public health, safety, or general welfare. In the absence of any infirmity other than the existence of a voluntary offer to make a gift to the town at some time in the future when the power plant became operational, we conclude that the judge erred in holding the zoning ordinance invalid and granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs.</p>

<p id="c5808f99-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A municipality may not relinquish its police power by contract. The zoning power of a municipality is among its police powers. There is no dispute here that the zoning change is valid on its face, but the issue that must be addressed is whether the town meeting entered into an unlawful agreement that called for it to relinquish its zoning power. In my view, there is no material fact in dispute, and the facts show that the town meeting improperly agreed to exercise its power to rezone land in exchange for a promise to pay money. The exercise of that power to approve the requested zoning change was a condition precedent to the promise of IDC Bellingham, L.L.C. (IDC Bellingham), to pay money under its agreement with the town of Bellingham (town).</p>
<p id="c5808f9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The summary judgment record establishes that IDC Bellingham offered the town $8 million, on condition that the town meeting approve the zoning change. The same request for a zoning change had failed two years earlier, and the only change in circumstances was the $8 million offer. The town meeting accepted the offer and voted for the zoning change. The undisputed evidence indicates that the vote was not “a decision solely in respect of rezoning the locus.” <i>Sylvania Elec. Prods. Inc. v. Newton</i>, 183 N.E.2d 118, 123 (Mass. 1962). The parties struck a bargain: the payment of money in return for a zoning change. Representatives from IDC Bellingham walked away from the town meeting with their zoning change and an unenforceable promise to pay $8 million. There can be no doubt that were IDC Bellingham to default on its promise, the town would be left with a questionable contract claim based on a sale of its police power in reliance on a promise.</p>
<p id="c580b6ab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was a sale of the police power because there is nothing in the record to legitimize the $8 million offer as “intended to mitigate the impact of the development upon the town,” or as “reasonably intended to meet public needs arising out of the proposed development.” <i>Rando v. North Attleborough</i>, 692 N.E.2d 544, 548 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998). The record does not show that the money “bear[s] some identifiable relationship to the locus so that there can be assurance that the town’s legislative body did not act for reasons irrelevant to the zoning of the site at issue.” <i>McLean Hosp. Corp. v. Belmont</i>, 778 N.E.2d 1016, 1022 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002). This analysis is consistent with the law as applied to similar situations in other areas of zoning: towns may not exact hefty payments or require conditions unrelated to any aspect of a site in return for favorable government action. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Middlesex &amp; Boston St. Ry. v. Aldermen of Newton</i>, 359 <span title="452" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-452">p. 452</span>N.E.2d 1279, 1281-85 (Mass. 1977) (city could not condition special permit for garden apartments on developer’s leasing five apartments to town’s low-income housing program). Considerations that are unrelated to the impacts of a proposed development are “extraneous” and may not provide the basis needed to justify an exercise of the police power. <i>Sylvania Elec. Prods. Inc. v. Newton</i>,<i> supra</i>, 183 N.E.2d at 123. Where extraneous considerations are shown to be the basis for an exercise of the police power, the operational vote may be “impeach[ed].” <i>Id.</i> Here, IDC’s offer was unrelated to any aspect of the proposed development or any public need arising out of the zoning change, and therefore was not a legitimate basis for the vote. Sadly, these circumstances demonstrate government and private interests at their shameful worst, and are most likely to involve the most needy towns.</p>

<p id="c580b6ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Contract and conditional zoning.</b> In reviewing requests to rezone parcels, governing bodies often wish to mitigate negative externalities or to improve neighborhood amenities in connection with the change. They sometimes do so by negotiating with the owner and then allowing the rezoning subject to specified conditions designed to ensure that the development is not harmful to the neighbors or the community. These conditions may involve anything from special limitations on uses, to specially tailored height or bulk restrictions, to requiring dedication of land to the city to widen abutting public streets or maintain open space. This process is called <b>contract</b> or <b>conditional zoning</b>.</p>
<p id="c580b6af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contract zoning has often been challenged as (1) unauthorized by the zoning enabling act; (2) inconsistent with the comprehensive plan; or (3) illegal preferential “spot zoning.” It has also been challenged as an unconstitutional form of lawmaking on the ground that laws should not be negotiated with a private party but should be adopted through open procedures that can be monitored by the public. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Mayor &amp; Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enterprises, Inc.</i>, 814 A.2d 469, 488 (Md. 2002); <i>cf. League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates v. City of L.A.</i>, 498 F.3d 1052, 1057 (9th Cir. 2007) (settlement agreement that allowed a synagogue in a neighborhood zoned residential only was invalid absent compliance with ordinary conditional use procedures). While a number of cases strike down contract zoning, others are increasingly approving the practice, with some state statutes now expressly authorizing it. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§9-462.01(E), 11-832. <i>See generally</i> Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, <i>Land Use Planning and Development Regulation Law</i> §5.11, at 141-146 (3d ed. 2013).</p>
<p id="c580b6b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Bilateral and unilateral agreements.</b> Some courts distinguish between so-called bilateral and unilateral arrangements. Bilateral agreements involve promises on both sides, by the owner and by the local government. For example, a city may promise to rezone a lot in return for a promise by the owner to restrict the otherwise allowable development on her lot and perhaps to record the restrictions as covenants. Unilateral promises, by contrast, are commitments by the owner to agree to certain conditions (again, often recorded) in order to induce the municipality to rezone the <span title="453" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-453">p. 453</span>land. Such arrangements protect the rights of the public to attend a public hearing on the rezoning proposal but still raise issues about whether such ad hoc decision making is desirable or promotes corruption and unfair deviations from the comprehensive plan. A handful of courts have held that unilateral conditional zoning is unlawful. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Dacy v. Village of Ruidoso</i>, 845 P.2d 793, 796-798 (N.M. 1992). However, when the restrictions on the rezoned property are agreed to voluntarily by the landowner as part of the rezoning process courts will often uphold the arrangement. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Massey v. City of Charlotte</i>, 550 S.E.2d 838, 844 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001)<i>.</i> These unilateral restrictions are often called conditional (rather than contract) zoning because no promise is made by the governing body that bargains away the police power.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10609_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10609_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span></p>
<p id="c580b6b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Durand</i>, how did the court characterize the nature of the payment that IDC agreed to make to the town of Bellingham? What did IDC get in return? Was the majority in <i>Durand</i> correct to say that the promise of funds was “extraneous”? Why might the court have declined to second-guess the rezoning? Should it have?</p>
<p id="c580ddc3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Spot zoning.</b> Spot zoning refers to selective rezoning by the local legislative body to favor a single parcel or small group of parcels. Spot zoning doctrine originated in state constitutional proscriptions on “special legislation,” that is, government grants or benefits given to individual citizens that are not justified as measures intended to promote the general welfare. Some courts hold that spot zoning is invalid unless there is a “clear showing” of a “reasonable basis” for selective rezoning based on the comprehensive plan and the benefits of the change. <i>Good Neighbors of South Davidson v. Town of Denton</i>, 559 S.E.2d 768, 772 (N.C. 2002). A variation on this is “reverse” spot zoning, where a parcel or small group of parcels is singled out for more onerous restrictions. <i>See Helena Sand and Gravel, Inc. v. Lewis and Clark County Planning and Zoning Commission</i>, 290 P.3d 691, 699-700 (Mont. 2012). It is difficult to win spot or reverse spot zoning challenges; local governments generally have latitude to rezone individual parcels of land when this is deemed to be in the public interest. <i>See, e.g., Historic Charleston Foundation v. City of Charleston</i>, 734 S.E.2d 306 (S.C. 2012) (denying a spot zoning challenge to a municipal decision changing the zoning law to allow a portion of a site that had been limited to buildings of up to 55 feet to allow buildings up to 105 feet tall).</p>
<p id="c580ddc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Change or mistake requirement.</b> In some jurisdictions, rezoning of individual parcels may only be made to reflect changes in the character of a neighborhood since the original zoning code was enacted or mistakes in that zoning. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Albuquerque Commons Partnership v. City Council of Albuquerque</i>, 184 P.3d 411, 425-426 (N.M. 2008) (zoning map amendment not justified based on any change or mistake). As with spot zoning and conformity with a comprehensive plan, the change or mistake doctrine seeks to protect owners’ justifiable reliance on existing zoning and the stability of the overall zoning code by limiting the types of individualized changes that <span title="454" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-454">p. 454</span>may be made to a zoning ordinance over time. This doctrine can raise difficult questions of what constitutes a sufficient change or mistake, and courts often accord some latitude to legislative bodies in applying the relevant standards. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Thomas v. Board of Supervisors of Panola County</i>, 45 So. 3d 1173, 1182-1187 (Miss. 2010).</p>
<p id="c580ddc5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Characterizing rezoning as quasi-judicial.</b> Finally, some jurisdictions temper the deference to local legislative bodies by characterizing statutes that rezone an individual parcel as <b>quasi-judicial</b> or administrative rather than legislative. In the famous case <i>Fasano v. Board of County Commissioners of Washington County</i>, 507 P.2d 23 (Or. 1973), the Oregon Supreme Court explained:</p>

Local and small decision groups are simply not the equivalent in all respects of state and national legislatures. It is not a part of the legislative function to grant permits, make special exceptions, or decide particular cases. Such activities are not legislative but administrative, quasi-judicial, or judicial in character. To place them in the hands of legislative bodies, whose acts as such are not judicially reviewable, is to open the door completely to arbitrary government.</p>

<p id="c58104dc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning can be an inflexible tool because it governs entire municipalities and reflects conditions that may change over time. Municipalities can rezone, but that can be cumbersome if done for the entire community and open to a number of challenges when done for individual properties. From the earliest days of modern land use planning, however, administrative zoning boards have had authority to administer zoning laws in ways that increase their flexibility. In particular, zoning boards generally can grant variances or special exceptions from restrictions imposed by the zoning ordinance. A <b>variance</b> grants permission to use or develop a parcel in a way that otherwise <span title="455" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-455">p. 455</span>violates the zoning ordinance in order to alleviate special hardship.

<p id="c58104e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves the decision of respondent City of Minnetonka to grant a variance to respondent JoAnne Liebeler so that she could expand her nonconforming garage. Appellant Beat Krummenacher is Liebeler’s neighbor and he challenges the City’s decision. The district court upheld the City’s variance, and the court of appeals affirmed. Because we conclude that the City applied the wrong standard to Liebeler’s variance request, we reverse and remand to the City for reconsideration under the correct standard.</p>
<p id="c5812bf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Liebeler owns property located in Minnetonka. Krummenacher is Liebeler’s neighbor to the west. Liebeler’s property consists of a 2.4-acre lot, which contains a 2,975-square-foot home and an attached two-car garage. The property also contains a detached flat-roofed garage that a previous owner constructed sometime in the 1940s. The City has an ordinance requiring that the detached garage be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the property’s boundary line. Minnetonka City Code §300.10. Liebeler’s garage was constructed before this ordinance went into effect, and it does not satisfy the setback requirement. Specifically, the garage is nonconforming because it is set back only 17 feet from the front yard lot line. Because the garage was constructed before the ordinance became effective, however, the garage is a permissible nonconformity.</p>
<p id="c5812bf9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 31, 2008, Liebeler applied for a variance to expand the detached garage by adding a pitched roof and a second-story room above the garage that could be used as a yoga studio and craft room. Liebeler’s proposal was to renovate the garage itself, both to fix its leakage problems and improve its appearance, and also to expand the garage by adding a living space above it. Because adding a second story to the garage would result in a vertical expansion of a nonconforming structure, Liebeler was required, under the Minnetonka City Code, to apply for a variance from the City. <i>See</i> Minnetonka City Code §300.29.3(g). Liebeler’s proposed addition would not alter the <span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-456">p. 456</span>footprint of the garage and would comply with the City zoning requirements for a detached garage with respect to maximum height and size.</p>
<p id="c5812bfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City’s Planning Commission held a public hearing on May 15, 2008, to consider Liebeler’s request. Both Liebeler and Krummenacher had an opportunity to present their arguments at that hearing. Liebeler explained that she believed that the flat roof was causing leakage problems and that the structure itself needed to be updated. Krummenacher objected to Liebeler’s proposed project, explaining that the added height of the garage would obstruct his view to the east.</p>
<p id="c5812bfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Planning Commission approved Liebeler’s request for the variance. Krummenacher appealed the Planning Commission’s decision to the Minnetonka City Council. The City Council held a public hearing on the variance request on June 30, 2008, at which both sides presented their arguments. After an examination of the record, the City Council upheld the Planning Commission’s decision and findings. The City Council found that Liebeler’s “proposal is reasonable and would meet the required standards for a variance.” The council listed four requirements and found that the variance satisfied those requirements as follows:</p>

Municipalities have “broad discretionary power” in considering whether to grant or deny a variance. We review such decisions “to determine whether the municipality “was within its jurisdiction, was not mistaken as to the applicable law, and did not act arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably, and to determine whether the evidence could reasonably support or justify the determination.” <i>In re Stadsvold</i>, 754 N.W.2d 323, 332 (Minn. 2008) (internal quotation omitted).</p>
<p id="c5812c02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Krummenacher argues that the City’s decision was arbitrary and capricious because the City did not apply the proper standard to determine whether Liebeler demonstrated “undue hardship” as defined in Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6. This provision allows a city to grant a variance “from the literal provisions of the ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration.” Minn.

<p id="c5812c06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first factor a variance applicant must establish to satisfy the statute’s definition of “undue hardship” is that “the property in question cannot be put to reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls.” Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6; <i>see also</i> Minnetonka City Code §300.07.1(a). Krummenacher argues that based on the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, a municipality may grant a variance only when the property cannot be put to any reasonable use without it. According to Krummenacher, Liebeler had a reasonable use for her garage without the addition of a yoga studio and craft room — its current use as a storage space for vehicles. Krummenacher argues therefore that the City did not have the statutory authority to grant the variance.</p>
<p id="c5812c07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In] <i>Rowell v. Board of Adjustment of Moorhead</i>, 446 N.W.2d 917 (Minn. Ct. App. 1989), <i>rev. denied</i> (Minn. Dec. 15, 1989), [the court] interpreted the “undue hardship” section of Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6, as requiring a variance applicant to show that the “property owner would like to use the property in a reasonable manner that is prohibited by the ordinance.” <i>Id</i>. at 922.</p>

Specifically, as reflected in the City Council Resolution, the City found that “the proposal is reasonable” and with respect to “undue hardship,” that “[t]here is an undue hardship due to the topography of the site, width of the lot, location of the driveway and existing vegetation.”</p>
<p id="c5812c09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain language of the statute and our precedent compel us to reject the City’s invitation to adopt <i>Rowell</i>’s interpretation of “undue hardship.” The statute provides that to prove “undue hardship,” the variance applicant must show that “the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use” without the variance. Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6.</p>
<p id="c581531a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, in formulating the “reasonable manner” standard, the court in <i>Rowell</i> appears to have relied on the “practical difficulties” standard. <i>See Rowell</i>, 446 N.W.2d at 922. But we have made a clear distinction between the “practical difficulties” standard and the “undue hardship” standard. In <i>Stadsvold</i>, we interpreted Minn. Stat. §394.27, subd. 7, which sets forth the statutory standard for county variances. This <span title="458" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-458">p. 458</span>statute contains both the “practical difficulties” standard and a “particular hardship” standard.

Stat. §462.357, subd. 6, is more demanding than the “practical difficulties” standard the court of appeals appears to have relied on in <i>Rowell</i>, 446 N.W.2d at 922. <i>Rowell</i>’s interpretation of the “undue hardship” standard, requiring only that the proposed use be “reasonable,” would render the “undue hardship” standard in section 462.357 less stringent than the “practical difficulties” standard and much less stringent than the “particular hardship” standard in the county variance statute, which the “undue hardship” standard appears to parallel. <i>See Stadsvold</i>, 754 N.W.2d at 331. In short, our analysis in <i>Stadsvold</i> simply does not leave room for the <i>Rowell</i> “reasonable manner” standard.</p>

Town of Newington</i>, 145 N.H. 727, 766 A.2d 713 (2001), the New Hampshire Supreme Court provided a thorough and insightful review of the development of land use variance law, and its practical construction in modern times. The New Hampshire statute did not contain a specific definition of “unnecessary hardship,” like our statute does, and the court concluded that its prior definition of the statutory term “unnecessary hardship” “ha[d] become too restrictive in light of the constitutional protections by which it must be tempered.” <i>Id</i>. at 717.

<p id="c5815320-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inevitably and necessarily there is a tension between zoning ordinances and property rights, as courts balance the right of citizens to the enjoyment of private property with <span title="459" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-459">p. 459</span>the right of municipalities to restrict property use.

In light of these considerations, the New Hampshire Supreme Court said that “unnecessary hardship” would, in the future, be established when a landowner showed that (1) a zoning restriction as applied interferes with a reasonable use of the property, considering the unique setting of the property in its environment; (2) no fair and substantial relationship exists between the general purposes of the zoning ordinance and the specific restriction on the property; and (3) the variance would not injure the public or private rights of others. <i>Id</i>. at 717.</p>
<p id="c5815322-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had the Minnesota Legislature not defined “undue hardship” in Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6, we might consider the approach articulated in <i>Simplex</i>. A flexible variance standard allows municipalities to make modest adjustments to the detailed application of a regulatory scheme when a zoning ordinance imposes significant burdens on an individual, and relief can be fashioned without harm to the neighbors, the community, or the overall purposes of the ordinance. <i>See</i> David W. Owens, <i>The Zoning Variance: Reappraisal and Recommendations for Reform of a Much-Maligned Tool</i>, 29 Colum. J. Envtl. L. 279, 317 (2004) (“If the variance power is to be used both as a constitutional safeguard and as a tool for flexibility, zoning enabling acts and local ordinances should be amended to delineate these two purposes and set different standards for each. The failure to make such a distinction underlies much of the past controversy regarding variances. Courts and commentators have traditionally viewed the variances as the former — a very limited tool for avoidance of constitutional infirmity in extraordinary cases. Most variance petitions, and consequently most board of adjustment decision-making, have viewed the variances as the latter — a tool to provide flexible implementation rather than constitutional infirmity.”).</p>
<p id="c5817a33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that the <i>Rowell</i> “reasonable manner” standard represents a longstanding interpretation of the undue hardship standard in Minn. Stat. §462.357, subd. 6, and that Minnesota municipalities have been granting variances under the “reasonable manner” standard for many years. We also recognize that our decision will result in a restriction on a municipality’s authority to grant variances as compared with the “reasonable manner” standard. But whatever value we may find in a more flexible standard, particularly with regard to area variances, we cannot ignore the plain language of the statute.</p>

Variance law on the books versus law in action.</b> <i>Krummenacher</i> illustrates a common phenomenon in the application of variance standards where the nominal standard may not be what a city council or zoning board actually applies. Most states <span title="460" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-460">p. 460</span>allow officials to grant variances only when application of zoning to a particular owner results in some variation of an <b>undue</b> or <b>unnecessary hardship</b>, and the test for this can be quite strict.</p>
<p id="c5817a38-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A variance generally will not be granted where the hardship is self-imposed, <i>Board of Adjustment v. Verleysen</i>, 36 A.3d 326, 332 (Del. 2012), leading some courts to hold that the owner’s refusal to sell the property for fair market value to a neighbor who is willing and able to buy constitutes a self-imposed hardship. <i>Commons v. Westwood Zoning Board of Adjustment</i>, 410 A.2d 1138, 1142 (N.J. 1980); <i>see also Sciacca v. Caruso</i>, 769 A.2d 578 (R.I. 2001) (no variance when hardship was self-imposed because of the owner’s acts in separating the property into different parcels that caused the problem). In addition, hardship will often not be found unless there is no economically viable use of the property (or no reasonable return on the owner’s investment) if the zoning law is enforced. <i>See, e.g., Lewis v. Town of Rockport</i>, 870 A.2d 107 (Me. 2005) (grant of a variance reversed where owner did not demonstrate “practical loss of all beneficial use of land”). <i>But see Simplex Technologies v. Town of Newington</i>, 766 A.2d 713 (N.H. 2001) (“unnecessary hardship” standard requires showing that zoning restriction interferes with an owner’s “reasonable use of the property, considering the unique setting of the property in its environment”). Many states have added the requirement that the property must be different in some unique way from surrounding property, such as having an unduly narrow frontage or an odd shape or elevation, and that the hardship arise out of this condition.</p>

<p id="c5817a40-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Krummenacher</i> discusses, however, zoning boards routinely grant variances on a somewhat a lower standard. This is especially the case where the requested variance is not a dramatic change in the structure and if no one (especially abutting neighbors) objects to the granting of the variance, although even when neighbors object, boards sometimes choose to favor development over such objections. In effect, zoning boards often ignore the law and grant variances when there is no showing that the owner has met the standard for undue hardship. Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, <i>Land Use Planning and Development Regulation Law</i> §5.14, at 150-152 (3d ed. 2013); Jesse Dukeminier, Jr. &amp; Clyde L.

Some states go further and allow variances to be issued in unusual circumstances if this will provide a significant public benefit and the variance can be granted “without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose” of the zoning ordinance.

Other states prohibit use variances from being granted by zoning boards on the ground that they are effectively rezonings that should be voted on by the city council (or other lawmaking body) and not granted by an administrative agency such as the zoning board.

<p id="c581a157-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike a variance, which grants the property owner the right to do something ordinarily prohibited by the zoning law to avoid undue hardship, a <b>special exception</b>, which can also be called a <b>special permit</b> or a <b>conditional use</b>, describes a type of land use that is permitted by the zoning law but subject to administrative approval before it may be allowed. The uses subject to the special exception process are often particularly sensitive or may pose the risk of particular harms. Typical examples include gas stations, parking lots, landfills, airports, hospitals, and halfway houses. The special exception process can also apply to more benign uses that nonetheless require evaluation on an individual basis before they are sited because of their potential impact on traffic and parking, such as recreation facilities, schools, and churches. Unlike variances, there is a presumption that the owner can engage in the permitted use so long as the established conditions are met. <i>National Cathedral Neighborhood Association v. D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment</i>, 753 A.2d 984, 986 n.1 <span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-462">p. 462</span>(D.C. 2000). The special exception process generally allows zoning boards to grant permission subject to specific, reasonable conditions that might mitigate negative impacts.</p>
<p id="c581a158-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts regularly uphold decisions by zoning boards to deny special exceptions, see, e.g.,<i> Montgomery County v. Butler</i>, 9 A.3d 824 (Md. 2010) (upholding the denial of a special exception for a landscaping contractor based on a standard of “non-inherent adverse effects,” specifically noise from trucks). Courts, however, will reverse such denials if an owner meets the legislative standards or if zoning boards apply factors that are not in the special exception statute. For example, in <i>New Cingular Wireless PCS v. Sussex County Board of Adjustment</i>, 65 A.3d 607 (Del. 2013), a telephone company sought to build a cellular telephone tower in a commercial zone, on a parcel that also included a gas station, a fast food restaurant, and a convenience store. Because there was a condominium next door, the company was required to obtain a special exception from the county Board of Adjustment. The Board denied the application, finding that the company had failed to show that the cell tower “would not affect adversely the uses of the adjacent properties.” The Delaware Supreme Court reversed because the statutory standard required a finding that the proposed use will not “<i>substantially</i> affect adversely the uses of adjacent and neighboring property.” <i>Id.</i> at 611. As the court noted, the Board had impermissibly imposed a much heavier burden on the company. <i>Id.</i> at 611-612.</p>
<p id="c581a159-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Special exceptions generally require sufficient direction to the zoning board. Vague conditions may be struck down as improper delegations of legislative power from the municipal governing body to the administrative zoning board. <i>Kosalka v. Town of Georgetown</i>, 752 A.2d 183, 187 (Me. 2000) (finding a condition that all proposed developments in a shore area “conserve natural beauty” an unconstitutional delegation because it lacked cognizable, quantitative standards). In <i>Cope v. Inhabitants of the Town of Brunswick</i>, 464 A.2d 223 (Me. 1983), a zoning law gave the zoning board the power to grant an exception to allow multi-unit apartment buildings in a certain area, so long as this would “not adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of the public.” After the zoning board denied the owner’s request for the special exception, the owner challenged the board’s action in court, which struck down the condition relating to public welfare on the ground that it did not give sufficient guidance to the board and effectively delegated legislative power to an unelected administrative agency. As a remedy, the court ordered the town to grant the permit since, by establishing the exception, the enacting legislative body had already determined that the use would ordinarily not be detrimental to the community.</p>

SecurCare Self Storage, Inc.</i>, 10 P.3d 1244 (Colo. 2000). <i>See also Fordham v.

<p id="c581a162-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case attacks the system of land use regulation by defendant Township of Mount Laurel on the ground that low and moderate income families are thereby unlawfully excluded from the municipality.</p>
<p id="c581a163-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is not the slightest doubt that New Jersey has been, and continues to be, faced with a desperate need for housing, especially of decent living accommodations economically suitable for low and moderate income families. Plaintiffs represent the minority group poor (black and Hispanic) seeking such quarters. But they are not the only category of persons barred from so many municipalities by reason of restrictive land use regulations. We have reference to young and elderly couples, single persons and large, growing families not in the poverty class, but who still cannot afford the only kinds of housing realistically permitted in most places — relatively high-priced, single-family detached dwellings on sizeable lots and, in some municipalities, expensive apartments. We will, therefore, consider the case from the wider viewpoint that the effect of Mount Laurel’s land use regulation has been to prevent various categories of persons from living in the township because of the limited extent of their income and resources.</p>
<p id="c581a164-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I. The Facts</i></p>
<p id="c581c875-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mount Laurel is a flat, sprawling township, 22 square miles, or about 14,000 acres, in area, on the west central edge of Burlington County. Under the present ordinance, 29.2% of all the land in the township, or 4,121 acres, is zoned for industry. At the time of trial no more than 100 acres were actually occupied by industrial uses. The rest of the land so zoned has remained undeveloped. [As] happens in the case of so many municipalities, much more land has been so zoned than the reasonable potential for industrial movement or expansion warrants. At the same time, however, the land cannot be used for residential development under the general ordinance.</p>
<p id="c581c876-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The amount of land zoned for retail business use under the general ordinance is relatively small — 169 acres, or 1.2% of the total. The balance of the land area, almost 10,000 acres, has been developed until recently in the conventional form of major subdivisions. The general ordinance provides for four residential zones, designated R-1, R-1D, R-2 and R-3. All permit only single-family, detached dwellings, one house per lot — the usual form of grid development. Attached townhouses, apartments (except on farms for agricultural workers) and mobile homes are not allowed anywhere in the township under the general ordinance. The dwellings are substantial; the average value in 1971 was $32,500 and is undoubtedly much higher today.</p>
<p id="c581c877-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general ordinance requirements, while not as restrictive as those in many similar municipalities, nonetheless realistically allow only homes within the financial <span title="464" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-464">p. 464</span>reach of persons of at least middle income. The R-1 zone requires a minimum lot area of 9,375 square feet, a minimum lot width of 75 feet at the building line, and a minimum dwelling floor area of 1,100 square feet if a one-story building and 1,300 square feet if one and one-half stories or higher. The R-2 zone, comprising a single district of 141 acres in the northeasterly corner, has been completely developed. While it only required a minimum floor area of 900 square feet for a one-story dwelling, the minimum lot size was 11,000 square feet; otherwise the requisites were the same as in the R-1 zone.</p>
<p id="c581c878-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general ordinance places the remainder of the township, outside of the industrial and commercial zones and the R-1D district (to be mentioned shortly), in the R-3 zone. This zone comprises over 7,000 acres — slightly more than half of the total municipal area [and requires a minimum lot size of about one-half acre (20,000 square feet), and the lot width at the building line must be 100 feet].</p>
<p id="c581c879-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The R-1D district [reduces] the minimum lot area from 20,000 square feet required in the R-3 zone to 10,000 square feet (12,000 square feet for corner lots) but with the proviso that one-family houses — the single permitted dwelling use — “shall not be erected in excess of an allowable development density of 2.25 dwelling units per gross acre.” The minimum lot width at the building line must be 80 feet and the minimum dwelling floor area is the same as in the R-3 zone.</p>
<p id="c581c87a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A variation from conventional development has recently occurred in some parts of Mount Laurel, as in a number of other similar municipalities, by use of the land use regulation device known as “planned unit development” (PUD). This scheme differs from the traditional in that the type, density and placement of land uses and buildings, instead of being detailed and confined to specified districts by local legislation in advance, is determined by contract, or “deal,” as to each development between the developer and the municipal administrative authority, under broad guidelines laid down by state enabling legislation and an implementing local ordinance. The stress is on regulation of density and permitted mixture of uses within the same area, including various kinds of living accommodations with or without commercial and industrial enterprises.</p>
<p id="c581c87b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Mount Laurel approved four PUD projects before the state enabling legislation was repealed in 1977.] While multi-family housing in the form of rental garden, medium rise and high rise apartments and attached townhouses is for the first time provided for, as well as single-family detached dwellings for sale, it is not designed to accommodate and is beyond the financial reach of low and moderate income families, especially those with young children. The aim is quite the contrary; as with the single-family homes in the older conventional subdivisions, only persons of medium and upper income are sought as residents.</p>
<p id="c581c87c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still another restrictive land use regulation was adopted by the township through a supplement to the general zoning ordinance enacted in September 1972 creating a new zone, R-4, Planned Adult Retirement Community (PARC). The enactment recited a critical shortage of adequate housing in the township suitable “for the needs and desires of senior citizens and certain other adults over the age of 52.” The permission was essentially for single ownership development of the zone for multi-family <span title="465" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-465">p. 465</span>housing (townhouses and apartments), thereafter to be either rented or sold as cooperatives or condominiums. The extensive development requirements detailed in the ordinance make it apparent that the scheme was not designed for, and would be beyond the means of, low and moderate income retirees.</p>
<p id="c581c87d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All this affirmative action for the benefit of certain segments of the population is in sharp contrast to the lack of action, and indeed hostility, with respect to affording any opportunity for decent housing for the township’s own poor living in substandard accommodations, found largely in the section known as Springville (R-3 zone). The 1969 Master Plan Report recognized it and recommended positive action. The continuous official reaction has been rather a negative policy of waiting for dilapidated premises to be vacated and then forbidding further occupancy. An earlier non-governmental effort to improve conditions had been effectively thwarted. In 1968 a private non-profit association sought to build subsidized, multi-family housing in the Springville section with funds to be granted by a higher level governmental agency. Advance municipal approval of the project was required. The Township Committee responded with a purportedly approving resolution, which found a need for “moderate” income housing in the area, but went on to specify that such housing must be constructed subject to all zoning, planning, building and other applicable ordinances and codes. This meant single-family detached dwellings on 20,000 square foot lots. (Fear was also expressed that such housing would attract low income families from outside the township.) Needless to say, such requirements killed realistic housing for this group of low and moderate income families.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108E7_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108E7_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span></p>
<p id="c581c87f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record thoroughly substantiates the findings of the trial court that over the years Mount Laurel “has acted affirmatively to control development and to attract a selective type of growth” and that “through its zoning ordinances has exhibited economic discrimination in that the poor have been deprived of adequate housing and the opportunity to secure the construction of subsidized housing, and has used federal, state, county and local finances and resources solely for the betterment of middle and upper-income persons.”</p>
<p id="c581c880-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There cannot be the slightest doubt that the reason for this course of conduct has been to keep down local taxes on <i>property</i> (Mount Laurel is not a high tax municipality) and that the policy was carried out without regard for non-fiscal considerations with respect to <i>people</i>, either within or without its boundaries. This conclusion is demonstrated not only by what was done and what happened, as we have related, but also by innumerable direct statements of municipal officials at public meetings over the years which are found in the exhibits.</p>

<p id="c581c883-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Ratable</b> is a term used by local officials and planners to mean property subject to assessment and taxation. <b>Good ratables</b>, like industrial and commercial uses, are those that generate tax revenue with relatively less demand for services.</p>
</div>
<p id="c581c884-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This policy of land use regulation for a fiscal end derives from New Jersey’s tax structure, which has imposed on local real estate most of the cost of municipal and <span title="466" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-466">p. 466</span>county government and of the primary and secondary education of the municipality’s children. The latter expense is much the largest, so, basically, the fewer the school children, the lower the tax rate. Sizeable industrial and commercial ratables are eagerly sought and homes and the lots on which they are situated are required to be large enough, through minimum lot sizes and minimum floor areas, to have substantial value in order to produce greater tax revenues to meet school costs. Large families who cannot afford to buy large houses and must live in cheaper rental accommodations are definitely not wanted, so we find drastic bedroom restrictions for, or complete prohibition of, multi-family or other feasible housing for those of lesser income.</p>
<p id="c581c885-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This pattern of land use regulation has been adopted for the same purpose in developing municipality after developing municipality. Almost every one acts solely in its own selfish and parochial interest and in effect builds a wall around itself to keep out those people or entities not adding favorably to the tax base, despite the location of the municipality or the demand for varied kinds of housing. There has been no effective intermunicipal or area planning or land use regulation. All of this is amply demonstrated by the evidence in this case as to Camden, Burlington and Gloucester counties. One incongruous result is the picture of developing municipalities rendering it impossible for lower paid employees of industries they have eagerly sought and welcomed with open arms (and, in Mount Laurel’s case, even some of its own lower paid municipal employees) to live in the community where they work.</p>
<p id="c581ef96-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other end of the spectrum should also be mentioned because it shows the source of some of the demand for cheaper housing than the developing municipalities have permitted. Core cities were originally the location of most commerce and industry. Many of those facilities furnished employment for the unskilled and semiskilled. These employees lived relatively near their work, so sections of cities always have housed the majority of people of low and moderate income, generally in old and deteriorating housing. Despite the municipally confined tax structure, commercial and industrial ratables generally used to supply enough revenue to provide and maintain municipal services equal or superior to those furnished in most suburban and rural areas.</p>
<p id="c581ef97-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation has become exactly the opposite since the end of World War II. Much industry and retail business, and even the professions, have left the cities. Camden is a typical example. The testimonial and documentary evidence in this case as to what has happened to that city is depressing indeed. For various reasons, it lost thousands of jobs between 1950 and 1970, including more than half of its manufacturing jobs (a reduction from 43,267 to 20,671, while all jobs in the entire area labor market increased from 94,507 to 197,037). A large segment of retail business faded away with the erection of large suburban shopping centers. The economically better situated city residents helped fill up the miles of sprawling new housing developments, not fully served by public transit. In a society which came to depend more and more on expensive individual motor vehicle transportation for all purposes, low income employees very frequently could not afford to reach outlying places of suitable <span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-467">p. 467</span>employment and they certainly could not afford the permissible housing near such locations. These people have great difficulty in obtaining work and have been forced to remain in housing which is overcrowded, and has become more and more substandard and less and less tax productive. There has been a consequent critical erosion of the city tax base and inability to provide the amount and quality of those governmental services  —  education, health, police, fire, housing and the like — so necessary to the very existence of safe and decent city life. This category of city dwellers desperately needs much better housing and living conditions than is available to them now, both in a rehabilitated city and in outlying municipalities. They make up, along with the other classes of persons earlier mentioned who also cannot afford the only generally permitted housing in the developing municipalities, the acknowledged great demand for low and moderate income housing.</p>

<p id="c581ef99-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal question before us, as earlier indicated, is whether a developing municipality like Mount Laurel may validly, by a system of land use regulation, make it physically and economically impossible to provide low and moderate income housing in the municipality for the various categories of persons who need and want it and thereby, as Mount Laurel has, exclude such people from living within its confines because of the limited extent of their income and resources.</p>

<p id="c581ef9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until the 1950s, Mount Laurel was largely agricultural. The town had a stable African American population that included families whose ancestors had arrived as slaves before 1800, and had been a stop on the Underground Railroad. After World War II, however, the town became a suburb for Philadelphia and Camden. Farmers sold the land on which blacks had been tenant farmers, and blacks were relegated to shacks in Springville. The <i>Mount Laurel</i> litigation was catalyzed when the town blocked efforts to build apartment buildings to replace Springville’s dilapidated housing.

<p id="c581ef9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that every such municipality must, by its land use regulations, presumptively make realistically possible an appropriate variety and choice of housing. More specifically, presumptively it cannot foreclose the opportunity of the classes of people mentioned for low and moderate income housing and in its regulations must affirmatively afford that opportunity, at least to the extent of the municipality’s fair share of the present and prospective regional need therefor. These obligations must be met unless the particular municipality can sustain the heavy burden of demonstrating peculiar circumstances which dictate that it should not be required so to do.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10943_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10943_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span></p>
<p id="c581ef9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reach this conclusion under state law and so do not find it necessary to consider federal constitutional grounds urged by plaintiffs. We begin with some fundamental principles as applied to the scene before us.</p>
<p id="c581efa0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="468" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-468">p. 468</span>Land use regulation is encompassed within the state’s police power. It is elementary theory that all police power enactments, no matter at what level of government, must conform to the basic state constitutional requirements of substantive due process and equal protection of the laws. These are inherent in Art. I, par. 1 of our Constitution, the requirements of which may be more demanding than those of the federal Constitution. It is required that, affirmatively, a zoning regulation, like any police power enactment, must promote public health, safety, morals or the general welfare.</p>
<p id="c581efa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A central issue is] <i>whose</i> general welfare must be served or not violated in the field of land use regulation. Frequently the decisions in this state have spoken only in terms of the interest of the enacting municipality, so that it has been thought, at least in some quarters, that such was the only welfare requiring consideration. It is, of course, true that many cases have dealt only with regulations having little, if any, outside impact where the local decision is ordinarily entitled to prevail. However, it is fundamental and not to be forgotten that the zoning power is a police power of the state and the local authority is acting only as a delegate of that power and is restricted in the same manner as is the state. So, when regulation does have a substantial external impact, the welfare of the state’s citizens beyond the borders of the particular municipality cannot be disregarded and must be recognized and served.</p>
<p id="c581efa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This brings us to the relation of housing to the concept of general welfare just discussed and the result in terms of land use regulation which that relationship mandates. There cannot be the slightest doubt that shelter, along with food, are the most basic human needs.</p>
<p id="c58216b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is plain beyond dispute that proper provision for adequate housing of all categories of people is certainly an absolute essential in promotion of the general welfare required in all local land use regulation. Further, the universal and constant need for such housing is so important and of such broad public interest that the general welfare which developing municipalities like Mount Laurel must consider extends beyond their boundaries and cannot be parochially confined to the claimed good of the particular municipality. It has to follow that, broadly speaking, the presumptive obligation arises for each such municipality affirmatively to plan and provide, by its land use regulations, the reasonable opportunity for an appropriate variety and choice of housing, including, of course, low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs, desires and resources of all categories of people who may desire to live within its boundaries. Negatively, it may not adopt regulations or policies which thwart or preclude that opportunity.</p>
<p id="c58216b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also entirely clear, as we pointed out earlier, that most developing municipalities, including Mount Laurel, have not met their affirmative or negative obligations, primarily for local fiscal reasons.</p>
<p id="c58216b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, we are satisfied beyond any doubt that, by reason of the basic importance of appropriate housing and the longstanding pressing need for it, especially in the low and moderate cost category, and of the exclusionary zoning practices of so many municipalities, conditions have changed, and judicial attitudes must be altered to require, as we have just said, a broader view of the general welfare and the presumptive obligation on the part of developing municipalities at least to afford the opportunity by land use regulations for appropriate housing for all.</p>
<p id="c58216b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="469" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-469">p. 469</span>We turn to application of these principles in appraisal of Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance, useful as well, we think, as guidelines for future application in other municipalities.</p>
<p id="c58216b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township’s general zoning ordinance (including the cluster zone provision) permits, as we have said, only one type of housing — single-family detached dwellings. This means that all other types — multi-family including garden apartments and other kinds housing more than one family, town (row) houses, mobile home parks — are prohibited. Concededly, low and moderate income housing has been intentionally excluded. While a large percentage of the population living outside of cities prefers a one-family house on its own sizeable lot, a substantial proportion do not for various reasons. Moreover, single-family dwellings are the most expensive type of quarters and a great number of families cannot afford them. Certainly they are not pecuniarily feasible for low and moderate income families, most young people and many elderly and retired persons, except for some of moderate income by the use of low cost construction on small lots.</p>
<p id="c58216b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As previously indicated, Mount Laurel has allowed some multi-family housing by agreement in planned unit developments, but only for the relatively affluent and of no benefit to low and moderate income families. And even here, the contractual agreements between municipality and developer sharply limit the number of apartments having more than one bedroom. The design of such limitations is obviously to restrict the number of families in the municipality having school age children and thereby keep down local education costs. Such restrictions are so clearly contrary to the general welfare as not to require further discussion.</p>
<p id="c58216b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance is also so restrictive in its minimum lot area, lot frontage and building size requirements, earlier detailed, as to preclude single-family housing for even moderate income families. Required lot area of at least 9,375 square feet in one remaining regular residential zone and 20,000 square feet (almost half an acre) in the other, with required frontage of 75 and 100 feet, respectively, cannot be called small lots and amounts to low density zoning, very definitely increasing the cost of purchasing and improving land and so affecting the cost of housing. As to building size, the township’s general requirements of a minimum dwelling floor area of 1,100 square feet for all one-story houses and 1,300 square feet for all of one and one-half stories or higher is without regard to required minimum lot size or frontage or the number of occupants. Again it is evident these requirements increase the size and so the cost of housing. The conclusion is irresistible that Mount Laurel permits only such middle and upper income housing as it believes will have sufficient taxable value to come close to paying its own governmental way.</p>
<p id="c58216ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Akin to large lot, single-family zoning restricting the population is the zoning of very large amounts of land for industrial and related uses. Mount Laurel has set aside almost 30% of its area, over 4,100 acres, for that purpose; the only residential use allowed is for farm dwellings. In almost a decade only about 100 acres have been developed industrially. Despite the township’s strategic location for motor transportation purposes, as intimated earlier, it seems plain that the likelihood of anywhere near the whole of the zoned area being used for the intended purpose in the foreseeable future <span title="470" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-470">p. 470</span>is remote indeed and that an unreasonable amount of land has thereby been removed from possible residential development, again seemingly for local fiscal reasons.</p>
<p id="c58216bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without further elaboration at this point, our opinion is that Mount Laurel’s zoning ordinance is presumptively contrary to the general welfare and outside the intended scope of the zoning power in the particulars mentioned. A facial showing of invalidity is thus established, shifting to the municipality the burden of establishing valid superseding reasons for its action and non-action. We now examine the reasons it advances.</p>
<p id="c58216bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township’s principal reason in support of its zoning plan and ordinance housing provisions, advanced especially strongly at oral argument, is the fiscal one previously adverted to, <i>i.e</i>., that by reason of New Jersey’s tax structure which substantially finances municipal governmental and educational costs from taxes on local real property, every municipality may, by the exercise of the zoning power, allow only such uses and to such extent as will be beneficial to the local tax rate. In other words, the position is that any municipality may zone extensively to seek and encourage the “good” tax ratables of industry and commerce and limit the permissible types of housing to those having the fewest school children or to those providing sufficient value to attain or approach paying their own way taxwise.</p>
<p id="c58216bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have no hesitancy in now saying, and do so emphatically, that, considering the basic importance of the opportunity for appropriate housing for all classes of our citizenry, no municipality may exclude or limit categories of housing for that reason or purpose. While we fully recognize the increasingly heavy burden of local taxes for municipal governmental and school costs on homeowners, relief from the consequences of this tax system will have to be furnished by other branches of government. It cannot legitimately be accomplished by restricting types of housing through the zoning process in developing municipalities.</p>
<p id="c58216be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III. The Remedy</i></p>
<p id="c58216bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The township is granted 90 days from the date hereof, or such additional time as the trial court may find it reasonable and necessary to allow, to adopt amendments to correct the deficiencies herein specified. It is the local function and responsibility, in the first instance at least, rather than the court’s, to decide on the details of the same within the guidelines we have laid down. If plaintiffs desire to attack such amendments, they may do so by supplemental complaint filed in this cause within 30 days of the final adoption of the amendments.</p>
<p id="c58216c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The municipality should first have full opportunity to itself act without judicial supervision. We trust it will do so in the spirit we have suggested, both by appropriate zoning ordinance amendments and whatever additional action encouraging the fulfillment of its fair share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing may be indicated as necessary and advisable. (We have in mind that there is at least a moral obligation in a municipality to establish a local housing agency pursuant to state law to provide housing for its resident poor now living in dilapidated, unhealthy quarters.) Should Mount Laurel not perform as we expect, further judicial action may be sought by supplemental pleading in this cause.</p>

<p id="c5823dd3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Property and regulation.</b> Does the limitation on exclusionary zoning imposed by the court in <i>Mount Laurel</i> infringe on property rights, or does it protect them? Does it regulate the market for real property, or does it constitute a form of deregulation?</p>
<p id="c5823dd4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Why not federal law?</b> The New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Mount Laurel</i> relied on the New Jersey Constitution as the basis for its decision. Why didn’t the court decide the case under the federal Constitution or under the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §3601 <i>et seq.</i>, which prohibits discrimination in land use regulation by local governments? <i>See</i> Chapter 13. One reason might have been that the Supreme Court has interpreted the federal due process and equal protection clauses to afford great latitude to local governments in the absence of intentional discrimination. <i>See</i> §1.2,<i> supra</i>. As to the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, the analysis of claims that land use regulations have a discriminatory effect proceed under a doctrinal analysis that likewise gives a fair measure of deference to local authority, and that may have been difficult to support the sweeping remedy the <i>Mount Laurel</i> court adopted. <i>See</i> Peter H. Schuck, <i>Judging Remedies: Judicial Approaches to Housing Segregation</i>, 37 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 289, 318 (2002) (arguing that deferential standards under federal constitutional and statutory law best explains the decision by advocates and the New Jersey Supreme Court to focus on income rather than race). Keep in mind as well that any decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court based on federal law would have been reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="c5823dd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Regionalism and land use regulation.</b> In <i>Euclid v. Ambler Realty</i>, one argument against Euclid’s zoning code was that it impeded the natural industrial development of the larger Cleveland region of which the village was a part. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating that the village of Euclid was “politically a separate municipality, with powers of its own and authority to govern itself as it sees fit.” 272 U.S. 365, 389 (1926). In so doing, however, the Court noted that it was not excluding “the possibility of cases where the general public interest would so far outweigh the interest of the municipality that the municipality would not be allowed to stand in the way.” <i>Id.</i> at 390. How did the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <i>Mount Laurel</i> approach the balance between local autonomy and “the general public interest” in evaluating the scale at which authority over land use should be exercised?</p>
<p id="c5823dd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. <i>Mount Laurel II.</i> </b>In <i>Mount Laurel I</i>, the Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered the township of Mount Laurel to amend its zoning law to remove unconstitutional restrictions on the development of low- and moderate-income housing. This remedy depended, to some extent, on trusting the presumed good faith of municipal officials. That trust turned out to be unwarranted. Many municipalities, including Mount Laurel, evaded or ignored the constitutional mandate in <i>Mount Laurel I</i>. Mount Laurel, for example, responded by rezoning 20 acres of land for low-income housing — less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the town’s entire area — on which, for various reasons, it was exceedingly unlikely that low-income housing would ever be built. Other communities similarly failed to comply with the constitutional mandate.</p>
<p id="c5823dd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="472" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-472">p. 472</span>New challenges were brought against the zoning ordinances of many municipalities, including a second case against Mount Laurel itself. Six of these cases were consolidated in a single appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which issued a second <i>Mount Laurel</i> opinion in 1983. <i>South Burlington County NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel</i>, 456 A.2d 390 (N.J. 1983) (<i>Mount Laurel II</i>). Chief Justice Robert Wilentz’s 120-page opinion in <i>Mount Laurel II</i> took more than two years to produce. Under <i>Mount Laurel II</i>, the obligation to provide a realistic opportunity for decent housing for a municipality’s <i>resident</i> poor was extended to cover every municipality in the state rather than being limited to “developing” communities, as under <i>Mount Laurel I</i>. In addition, the court in <i>Mount Laurel II</i> authorized affirmative remedies to encourage the construction of low- and moderate-income housing. For example, the court provided for the appointment of three “regional” trial judges to handle all cases involving challenges to exclusionary zoning ordinances in the northern, central, and southern regions of New Jersey. This arrangement was intended to generate consistent definitions of “regions,” and the housing needs of each region, to determine each community’s fair share of the regional housing need in an orderly way.</p>
<p id="c5823dd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Mount Laurel II</i> court required municipalities to take affirmative steps to encourage the development of housing for low- and moderate-income persons if the <i>Mount Laurel</i> obligations could not otherwise be met. If municipalities failed to comply with the constitutional mandate, courts were empowered to order affirmative remedies, including government subsidies, incentives for private developers to set aside a portion of their developments for low- and moderate-income residents by relaxing various zoning restrictions, and mandatory set-asides for developers. The court also authorized a “builder’s remedy,” which would order a municipality to allow a developer to construct a particular project that includes a substantial amount of lower-income housing unless the “municipality establishes that because of environmental or other substantial planning concerns, the plaintiff’s proposed project is clearly contrary to sound land use planning.” Ultimately, if all of this failed, a special master could be appointed to rewrite the zoning ordinance to comply with the jurisdiction’s constitutional obligations under <i>Mount Laurel</i>.</p>
<p id="c5823dd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. To the legislature and back to the courts.</b> The <i>Mount Laurel II</i> opinion openly invited the New Jersey legislature to enact legislation implementing the constitutional obligation to prevent exclusionary zoning practices. The legislature responded by enacting the <i>Fair Housing Act of 1985</i>, N.J. Stat. §§52:27D-301 to 52:27D-329 (1986), which transferred authority over <i>Mount Laurel</i> cases to a state administrative agency called the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH). The act placed a temporary moratorium on the controversial builder’s remedy; it also allowed municipalities to buy their way out of the <i>Mount Laurel</i> obligation by paying neighboring communities to absorb up to half of their fair-share obligation in what were called “regional contribution agreements.” The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> was upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Hills Development Co. v. Bernards Township</i>, 510 A.2d 621 (N.J. 1986) (often called <i>Mount Laurel III</i>). The provision of the act allowing for regional cooperation agreements was eliminated from the statutory regime in 2008. <i>See In re Denial of Regional <span title="473" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-473">p. 473</span>Contribution Agreement Between Galloway Township and City of Bridgeton</i>, 12 A.3d 232 (N.J. App. Div. 2011). The builder’s remedy survives, however, and is available when the municipality fails to comply fully with its statutory obligations. <i>Toll Brothers, Inc. v. Township of West Windsor</i>, 803 A.2d 53 (N.J. 2002). </p>
<p id="c58264ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Starting in 1987, COAH promulgated a series of rules to define municipal affordable housing obligations, with the most recent — “Third Round Rules” — adopted in 2008. N.J.A.C. 5:96-1.1 to -20.4; N.J.A.C. 5:97-1.1 to -10.5, Appendices A to F. In 2013, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that COAH’s Third Round Rules, which were predicated on a “growth share” methodology that tied a municipality’s obligations to future growth, violated the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. <i>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97</i>, 74 A.3d 893 (N.J. 2013). After nearly two years of delay by COAH with no revised rules, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that parties challenging municipalities and municipalities seeking confirmation of compliance with the act could seek judicial redress. <i>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97</i>, 110 A.3d 31 (N.J. 2015). For the moment, then, the New Jersey courts are back in the business of directly supervising the <i>Mount Laurel</i> doctrine.</p>
<p id="c58264eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Constitutional versus statutory approaches to exclusionary zoning.</b> Although much heralded, the <i>Mount Laurel</i> doctrine is a minority rule, as few states have explicitly interpreted their state constitutions to limit exclusionary zoning. Several states, however, have addressed exclusionary zoning, as New Jersey eventually did, by statute.<i> See</i> James Kushner, <i>Affordable Housing as Infrastructure in the Time of Global Warming</i>, 42/43 Urb. Law. 179, 189 (2011) (noting that at least 16 states have some form of proscription or planning requirement related to exclusionary zoning).</p>
<p id="c58264ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, California, Massachusetts, and Oregon have adopted legislation to limit exclusionary zoning. Cal. Govt. Code §§65580-65589.8; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B, §§20-23; Or. Rev. Stat. §§197.005-197.850. California’s statute, which resembles the <i>New Jersey Fair Housing Act</i>, mandates comprehensive planning by a state agency to ensure that local zoning laws take into account each municipality’s fair share of the regional low-income housing need. Both New Jersey and California employ “inclusionary” zoning techniques such as set-asides and density bonuses. In contrast, Massachusetts enacted a statute known as the <i>Anti-Snob Zoning Act</i>, empowering developers to challenge local permit denials by appealing unfavorable local zoning board decisions to a state review board, which is authorized to overturn local board decisions that exclude low-income housing needed in the municipality. Oregon, like Massachusetts, prevents local governments from excluding low-cost housing. Harold McDougall, <i>From Litigation to Legislation in Exclusionary Zoning</i>, 22 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 623 (1987). <i>See also Britton v. Town of Chester</i>, 595 A.2d 492 (N.H. 1991) (adopting a variation of the <i>Mount Laurel</i> doctrine as an interpretation of the state zoning enabling act).</p>
<p id="c58264ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. Efficiency.</b> In recent years, many municipalities have adopted linkage ordinances that condition real estate development on either providing a certain percentage of housing units for low-income persons or paying a tax to a municipal fund for this purpose. Do these inclusionary zoning techniques have positive or negative effects on social welfare? Some scholars have argued that inclusionary zoning likely will be <span title="474" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-474">p. 474</span>inefficient. Professor Robert Ellickson has argued that such zoning effectively imposes a tax on new construction because some units that would not otherwise be profitable must be included in the development, thereby raising the costs of providing new housing. When the cost of new housing is artificially raised by government regulation, less will be provided, thereby exacerbating the already existing shortage of low-income housing and interfering with the filtering mechanism by which wealthy homeowners move to better housing and leave their prior residences for less wealthy consumers. Robert C. Ellickson, <i>The Irony of “Inclusionary Zoning</i>,<i>”</i> 54 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1167 (1981).</p>
<p id="c58264ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other scholars, however, contend that such techniques are likely to <i>restore</i> the efficient use of land by removing inefficient restrictions on development contained in existing exclusionary zoning laws. Laws that exclude low-income housing from the community arguably decrease social welfare by attempting to create protected enclaves without accounting for the externalities of limiting low-income housing to urban areas. They may also artificially increase the cost of low-income housing by excluding it from areas in which developers could otherwise profitably build it. Andrew G. Dietderich, <i>An Egalitarian’s Market: The Economics of Inclusionary Zoning Reclaimed</i>, 24 Fordham Urb. L.J. 23 (1996).</p>
<p id="c58264ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>8. Has inclusionary zoning worked?</b> The evidence on the effectiveness of inclusionary zoning is mixed, and much depends on the details of any given program. There is some indication that longer-standing programs have stimulated the production of new low-income housing construction. <i>See</i> Jenny Schuetz, Rachel Meltzer &amp; Vicki Been,<i> Silver Bullet or Trojan Horse? The Effects of Inclusionary Zoning on Local Housing Markets in the United States</i>, 14 Urb. Stud. 297 (2011) (collecting empirical studies and indicating, based on programs in suburban Boston and the San Francisco metropolitan area, that production increases were modest and impact on housing prices mixed). There is good evidence that <i>Mount Laurel</i> and the process it created has led to significant new production of low- and moderate-income housing. <i>See</i> Alan Mallach, <i>The</i> Mount Laurel <i>Doctrine and the Uncertainties of Social Policy in a Time of Retrenchment</i>, 63 Rutgers L. Rev. 849, 851 (2011). However, there are genuine questions about whether even <i>Mount Laurel</i> has actually generated social mobility. <i>Id.</i> at 861.</p>
<p id="c58264f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>9. Growth controls.</b> Growth controls and, more recently, “smart growth,” ordinances raise concerns about exclusionary consequences. In the famous case of <i>Golden v. Planning Board of the Town of Ramapo</i>, 285 N.E.2d 291 (N.Y. 1972), the New York Court of Appeals upheld a provision that limited growth based on the availability of adequate municipal services. The town had undertaken an in-depth study of existing land uses, infrastructure, and likely residential, commercial, and industry development and had drafted a master plan based on that study. It then passed amendments to its zoning code that limited the approval of new subdivisions in order to sequence new residential development with planned public improvements. In approving this process, the Court indicated that it would “not countenance . . . under any guise . . . community efforts at immunization or exclusion.” <i>Id.</i> at 302. The Court found, nonetheless, that “far from being exclusionary, the present amendments merely seek, by the implementation of sequential development and timed growth, to provide a balanced cohesive community dedicated to the efficient utilization of land.” <i>Id.</i></p>

In <i>Zuckerman v.

Justice Cordy explained: “Despite the perceived benefits that enforced isolation may bring to a town facing a new wave of permanent home seekers, it does not serve the general welfare of the Commonwealth to permit one particular town to deflect that wave onto its neighbors.” <i>Id</i>. at 850.</p>

<p id="c5828c10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anderson owns property located at 145 N.W. Gilman Boulevard in the City of Issaquah (City). In 1988, Anderson applied to the City for a land use certification to develop the property. The property is zoned for general commercial use. Anderson desired to build a 6800 square foot commercial building for several retail tenants.</p>
<p id="c5828c11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After obtaining architectural plans, Anderson submitted the project to various City departments for the necessary approvals. The process went smoothly until the approval of the Issaquah Development Commission (Development Commission) was sought. This commission was created to administer and enforce the City’s land use regulations. It has the authority to approve or deny applications for land use certification.</p>
<p id="c5828c12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 16.16.060 of the IMC enumerates various building design objectives which the Development Commission is required to administer and enforce.

</div>
<p id="c582b32d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As initially designed, Anderson’s proposed structure was to be faced with off-white stucco and was to have a blue metal roof. It was designed in a “modern” style with an unbroken “warehouse” appearance in the rear, and large retail style windows in the front. The City moved a Victorian-era residence, the “Alexander House,” onto the neighboring property to serve as a visitors’ center. Across the street from the Anderson site is a gasoline station that looks like a gasoline station. Located nearby and within view from the proposed building site are two more gasoline stations, the First Mutual Bank Building built in the “Issaquah territorial style,” an Elk’s hall which is described in the record by the Mayor of Issaquah as a “box building,” an auto repair shop, and a veterinary clinic with a cyclone fenced dog run. The area is described in the record as “a natural transition area between old downtown Issaquah and the new village style construction of Gilman [Boulevard].”</p>
<p id="c582b32e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Development Commission reviewed Anderson’s application for the first time at a public hearing on December 21, 1988. Commissioner Nash commented that “the facade did not fit with the concept of the surrounding area.” Commissioner McGinnis agreed. Commissioner Nash expressed concern about the building color and stated that he did not think the building was compatible with the image of Issaquah. Commissioner Larson said that he would like to see more depth to the building facade. Commissioner Nash said there should be some interest created along the blank back wall. Commissioner Garrison suggested that the rear facade needed to be redesigned.</p>
<p id="c582b32f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="477" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-477">p. 477</span>At the conclusion of the meeting, the Development Commission voted to continue the hearing to give Anderson an opportunity to modify the building design.</p>
<p id="c582b330-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 18, 1989, Anderson came back before the Development Commission with modified plans which included changing the roofing from metal to tile, changing the color of the structure from off-white to “Cape Cod” gray with “Tahoe” blue trim, and adding brick to the front facade. During the ensuing discussion among the commissioners, Commissioner Larson stated that the revisions to the front facade had not satisfied his concerns from the last meeting. In response to Anderson’s request for more specific design guidelines, Commissioner McGinnis stated that the Development Commission had “been giving direction; it is the applicant’s responsibility to take the direction/suggestions and incorporate them into a revised plan that reflects the changes.” Commissioner Larson then suggested that “[t]he facade can be broken up with sculptures, benches, fountains, etc.” Commissioner Nash suggested that Anderson “drive up and down Gilman and look at both good and bad examples of what has been done with flat facades.”</p>
<p id="c582b331-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the discussion continued, Commissioner Larson stated that Anderson “should present a [plan] that achieves what the Commission is trying to achieve through its comments/suggestions at these meetings” and stated that “architectural screens, fountains, paving of brick, wood or other similar method[s] of screening in lieu of vegetative landscaping are examples of design suggestions that can be used to break up the front facade.” Commissioner Davis objected to the front facade, stating that he could not see putting an expanse of glass facing Gilman Boulevard. “The building is not compatible with Gilman.” Commissioner O’Shea agreed. Commissioner Nash stated that “the application needs major changes to be acceptable.” Commissioner O’Shea agreed. Commissioner Nash stated that “this facade does not create the same feeling as the building/environment around this site.”</p>
<p id="c582da42-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commissioner Nash continued, stating that he “personally like[d] the introduction of brick and the use of tiles rather than metal on the roof.” Commissioner Larson stated that he would like to see a review of the blue to be used: “Tahoe blue may be too dark.” Commissioner Steinwachs agreed. Commissioner Larson noted that “the front of the building could be modulated [to] have other design techniques employed to make the front facade more interesting.”</p>
<p id="c582da43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With this, the Development Commission voted to continue the discussion to a future hearing.</p>
<p id="c582da44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 15, 1989, Anderson came back before the Development Commission. In the meantime, Anderson’s architects had added a 5-foot overhang and a 7-foot accent overhang to the plans for the front of the building. More brick had been added to the front of the building. Wood trim and accent colors had been added to the back of the building and trees were added to the landscaping to further break up the rear facade.</p>
<p id="c582da45-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anderson explained the plans still called for large, floor to ceiling windows as this was to be a retail premises: “[A] glass front is necessary to rent the space. . . .” Commissioner Steinwachs stated that he had driven Gilman Boulevard and taken notes. The following verbatim statement by Steinwachs was placed into the minutes:</p>

I see various methods used to provide modulation in both horizontal and vertical lines, such as gables, bay windows, recesses in front faces, porches, rails, many vertical columns, and breaks in roof lines. I see long, sloping, conspicuous roofs with large overhangs. I see windows with panels above and below windows. I see no windows that extend down to floor level. This is the impression I have of Gilman Boulevard as it relates to building design.</p>
</div>
<p id="c582da48-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Commissioner Nash agreed stating, “[T]here is a certain feeling you get when you drive along Gilman Boulevard, and this building does not give this same feeling.” Commissioner Steinwachs wondered if the applicant had any option but to start “from scratch.” Anderson responded that he would be willing to change from stucco to wood facing but that, after working on the project for 9 months and experiencing total frustration, he was not willing to make additional design changes.</p>
<p id="c582da49-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At that point, the Development Commission denied Anderson’s application, giving four reasons:</p>

</div>
<p id="c582da4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anderson, who by this time had an estimated $250,000 into the project, timely appealed the adverse ruling to the Issaquah City Council (City Council). After a lengthy hearing and much debate, the City Council decided to affirm the Development Commission’s decision by a vote of 4 to 3.</p>
<p id="c582da4f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The City Council considered formal written findings and conclusions on April 3, 1989. The City Council verbally adopted its action on that date but required that certain changes be made to the proposed findings and conclusions. Those changes were made and the final findings and conclusions were signed on April 5, 1989 (backdated to April 3). On April 5, a notice of action was issued to Anderson, stating that he had <span title="479" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-479">p. 479</span>14 days <i>from the date of that notice</i> in which to file any appeal. Thirteen days later, on April 18, 1989, Anderson filed a complaint in King County Superior Court.</p>
<p id="c5830060-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Discussion</i></p>
<p id="c5830061-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men [and women] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law. <i>Connally v. General Constr. Co.</i>, 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). In the area of land use, a court looks not only at the face of the ordinance but also at its application to the person who has sought to comply with the ordinance and/or who is alleged to have failed to comply. The purpose of the void for vagueness doctrine is to limit arbitrary and discretionary enforcements of the law.</p>
<p id="c5830062-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Looking first at the face of the building design sections of IMC 16.16.060, we note that an ordinary citizen reading these sections would learn only that a given building project should bear a good relationship with the Issaquah Valley and surrounding mountains; its windows, doors, eaves and parapets should be of “appropriate proportions”; its colors should be “harmonious” and seldom “bright” or “brilliant”; its mechanical equipment should be screened from public view; its exterior lighting should be “harmonious” with the building design and “monotony should be avoided.” The project should also be “interesting.” IMC 16.16.060(D)(1)-(6). If the building is not “compatible” with adjacent buildings, it should be “made compatible” by the use of screens and site breaks “or other suitable methods and materials.” “Harmony in texture, lines, and masses [is] encouraged.” The landscaping should provide an “attractive . . . transition” to adjoining properties. IMC 16.16.060(B)(1)-(3).</p>
<p id="c5830063-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As is stated in the brief of amici curiae, we conclude that these code sections “do not give effective or meaningful guidance” to applicants, to design professionals, or to the public officials of Issaquah who are responsible for enforcing the code. Brief of Amici Curiae, at 1. Although it is clear from the code sections here at issue that mechanical equipment must be screened from public view and that, probably, earth tones or pastels located within the cool and muted ranges of the color wheel are going to be preferred, there is nothing in the code from which an applicant can determine whether his or her project is going to be seen by the Development Commission as “interesting” versus “monotonous” and as “harmonious” with the valley and the mountains. Neither is it clear from the code just what else, besides the valley and the mountains, a particular project is supposed to be harmonious with, although “[h]armony in texture, lines, and masses” is certainly encouraged. IMC 16.16.060(B)(2).</p>
<p id="c5830064-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In attempting to interpret and apply this code, the commissioners charged with that task were left with only their own individual, subjective “feelings” about the “image of Issaquah” and as to whether this project was “compatible” or “interesting.” The commissioners stated that the City was “making a statement” on its “signature street” and invited Anderson to take a drive up and down Gilman Boulevard and “look at good and bad examples of what has been done with flat facades.” One commissioner drove up and down Gilman, taking notes, in a no doubt sincere effort to define that which is left undefined in the code.</p>
<p id="c5830065-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="480" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-480">p. 480</span>The point we make here is that neither Anderson nor the commissioners may constitutionally be required or allowed to guess at the meaning of the code’s building design requirements by driving up and down Gilman Boulevard looking at “good and bad” examples of what has been done with other buildings, recently or in the past. We hold that the code sections here at issue are unconstitutionally vague on their face. The words employed are not technical words which are commonly understood within the professional building design industry. Neither do these words have a settled common law meaning.</p>
<p id="c5830066-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As they were applied to Anderson, it is also clear the code sections at issue fail to pass constitutional muster. Because the commissioners themselves had no objective guidelines to follow, they necessarily had to resort to their own subjective “feelings.” The “statement” Issaquah is apparently trying to make on its “signature street” is not written in the code. In order to be enforceable, that “statement” must be written down in the code, in understandable terms. The unacceptable alternative is what happened here. The commissioners enforced not a building design code but their own arbitrary concept of the provisions of an unwritten “statement” to be made on Gilman Boulevard. The commissioners’ individual concepts were as vague and undefined as those written in the code. This is the very epitome of discretionary, arbitrary enforcement of the law.</p>
<p id="c5830067-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]esthetic standards are an appropriate <i>component</i> of land use governance. Whenever a community adopts such standards they can and must be drafted to give clear guidance to all parties concerned. Applicants must have an understandable statement of what is expected from new construction. Design professionals need to know in advance what standards will be acceptable in a given community. It is unreasonable to expect applicants to pay for repetitive revisions of plans in an effort to comply with the unarticulated, unpublished “statements” a given community may wish to make on or off its “signature street.” It is equally unreasonable, and a deprivation of due process, to expect or allow a design review board such as the Issaquah Development Commission to create standards on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, during the design review process.</p>
<p id="c5830068-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not disputed that Anderson’s project meets all of the City’s land use requirements except for those unwritten and therefore unenforceable requirements relating to building design which the Development Commission unsuccessfully tried to articulate during the course of several hearings. We order that Anderson’s land use certification be issued, provided however, that those changes which Anderson agreed to through the hearing before the City Council may validly be imposed.</p>

<p id="c583277c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts were initially suspicious of aesthetic zoning as a valid object of the police power, see, e.g., <i>Spann v.

Aesthetics and the first amendment.</b> In addition to the kind of due process challenge at issue in <i>Anderson</i><b>,</b> aesthetic regulations can raise significant first amendment concerns. Signage regulations have been a particular flashpoint for this conflict. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> City of Ladue v. Gilleo</i>, 512 U.S. 43 (1994). In <i>Reed v. Town of Gilbert</i>, 135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015), the Supreme Court struck down a municipal ordinance that set different — and increasingly stringent — rules about size, location, and allowable duration for “ideological” signs, which communicate “a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes”; “political” signs, which are “designed to influence the outcome of an election”; and “temporary directional signs,” which, as the name suggests, “direct pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby” to certain specified events. <i>Id.</i> at 2224-2225. After twice being cited for violations of the temporary directional sign provision, a church and its pastor challenged the code, arguing that the categories constituted content-based restrictions in violation of the first amendment. The Court agreed.</p>
<p id="c5832780-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Noting that “[c]ontent-based laws — those that target speech based on its communicative content — are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests,” the Court found that the three categories in the ordinance “depend entirely on the communicative content of the sign.” <i>Id.</i> at 2227. The motivation of the municipality, the Court continued, was irrelevant to the threshold question of the level of scrutiny, as was the fact that the sign ordinance drew no distinction based on viewpoint. Applying strict scrutiny, then, the Court held that even if the municipality’s proffered justifications — preservation of aesthetics and traffic safety — were both compelling governmental interests, neither were narrowly tailored.</p>

The first is to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.

<p id="c5834e9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Local governments frequently seek to regulate unpopular types of expression, such as adult book stores and nude dancing establishments. In <i>City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books</i>, 535 U.S. 425 (2002), the Supreme Court attempted to clarify the standards that apply to such regulations. Los Angeles sought to prevent the grouping of adult uses through an ordinance that barred such uses within 1,000 feet of each other and also required such uses to be more than 500 feet from any religious institution, school, or public park. The ordinance, however, inadvertently allowed multiple adult businesses in a single building. After Los Angeles amended its code to close that loophole, two adult bookstores operating in the same establishment filed suit. In all of this, the city had relied on an old 1977 study that indicated that the concentration of adult uses was associated with higher rates of certain crimes in surrounding areas.</p>
<p id="c5834e9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor, in a plurality opinion, described the framework for evaluating land use regulations that target speech established in <i>Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.</i>, 475 U.S. 41 (1986), which concerned an ordinance banning adult movie theaters <span title="483" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-483">p. 483</span>from locating within 1,000 feet of a residential zone, family dwelling, church, park, or school. First, the Court considers whether the ordinance bans the form of expression altogether. If it does not, the ordinance will be analyzed as “a time, place, and manner regulation.” The Court next considers whether the restriction is “content neutral or content based. If the regulation were content based, it would be considered presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny.” In <i>Renton</i>, the Court found the ordinance to be content-neutral, because it “was aimed not at the content of the films shown at adult theaters, but rather at the secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community, namely, at crime rates, property values, and the quality of the city’s neighborhoods.” If content-neutral, an ordinance would be upheld so long as it “was designed to serve a substantial government interest and that reasonable alternative avenues of communication remained available.” The Court in <i>Renton</i> found that the city met this burden. 535 U.S. at 433-434.</p>
<p id="c5834e9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Alameda Books</i>, the court of appeals had rejected the relevance of the 1977 study because it focused on the concentration of businesses within a neighborhood but not within a given building. To the <i>Alameda Books</i> plurality, however, this was too high a burden. Instead, it opined, local governments are entitled “rely on any evidence that is ‘reasonably believed to be relevant’ for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial, independent government interest.” <i>Id.</i> at 436 (quoting <i>Renton</i>, 475 U.S. at 51-52).</p>

<p id="c58375ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Speech can produce tangible consequences. It can change minds. It can prompt actions. These primary effects signify the power and the necessity of free speech. Speech can also cause secondary effects, however, unrelated to the impact of the speech on its audience. A newspaper factory may cause pollution, and a billboard may obstruct a view. These secondary consequences are not always immune from regulation by zoning laws even though they are produced by speech.</p>
<p id="c58375af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Municipal governments know that high concentrations of adult businesses can damage the value and the integrity of a neighborhood. The damage is measurable; it is all too real. The law does not require a city to ignore these consequences if it uses its zoning power in a reasonable way to ameliorate them without suppressing speech. </p>

<p id="c58375b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 444. Justice Kennedy argued that “[t]hese ordinances are content based, and we should call them so,” but that the <i>Renton</i> analysis should control nonetheless. On that analysis, Justice Kennedy argued, it is not enough to examine secondary effects in isolation in evaluating the evidence a jurisdiction relies on to justify restricting adult speech; instead a court must evaluate “how speech will fare” under the law. If the effect of the ordinance is to reduce secondary effects by reducing (rather than merely dispersing) speech, then it is impermissible. <i>Id.</i> at 450-451.</p>
<p id="c58375b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State constitutional law can be more protective of speech than the federal Constitution. In <i>City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M.</i>, 529 U.S. 277 (2000), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance that effectively banned nude dancing, finding the law a valid content-neutral regulation of conduct rather than expression, geared to protecting the people from the secondary effects of adult entertainment <span title="484" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-484">p. 484</span>establishments. <i>Accord</i>,<i> Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.</i>, 501 U.S. 560, 570 (1991) (government has legitimate interest in preventing public nudity that is “unrelated to the suppression of free expression”). However, in <i>Mendoza v. Licensing Board of Fall River</i>, 827 N.E.2d 180 (Mass. 2005), the state supreme court interpreted its state constitutional free speech guarantee more broadly and found that, while the city could regulate the time, place, and manner of the practice, the city could not completely ban nude dancing from anywhere in the city.</p>

<p id="c5839cc9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For nearly 60 years Westchester Day School (plaintiff, WDS, day school, or school) has been operating an Orthodox Jewish co-educational day school with classes from pre-school to eighth grade. Believing it needed to expand, the school submitted construction plans to the Village of Mamaroneck and an application for the required special permit. When the village zoning board turned the application down, the present litigation ensued.</p>
<p id="c5839cca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Westchester Day School is located in the Orienta Point neighborhood of the Village of Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York. Its facilities are situated on 25.75 acres of largely undeveloped land (property) owned by Westchester Religious Institute. The Mamaroneck Village Code permits private schools to operate in “R-20 Districts” if the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Village of Mamaroneck (ZBA or zoning board) grants them a special permit.</p>
<p id="c5839ccb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a Jewish private school, Westchester Day School provides its students with a dual curriculum in Judaic and general studies. Even general studies classes are taught so that religious and Judaic concepts are reinforced. Thus, the school strives to have every classroom used at times for religious purposes, whether or not the class is officially labeled Judaic. A Jewish day school like WDS exists, at least in part, because Orthodox Jews believe it is the parents’ duty to teach the Torah to their children. Since most Orthodox parents lack the time to fulfill this obligation fully, they seek out a school like WDS.</p>
<p id="c5839ccc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By 1998 WDS believed its current facilities inadequate to satisfy the school’s needs. The district court’s extensive findings reveal the day school’s existing facilities are deficient and that its effectiveness in providing the education Orthodox Judaism mandates has been significantly hindered as a consequence. In October 2001 the day school submitted to the zoning board an application for modification of its special permit to enable it to proceed with this $12 million expansion project. On February 7, 2002 the ZBA voted unanimously to issue a “negative declaration,” which constituted a finding that the project would have no significant adverse environmental impact and thus that consideration of the project could proceed. After the issuance of the <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>negative declaration, a small but vocal group in the Mamaroneck community opposed the project. As a result of this public opposition, on August 1, 2002 the ZBA voted 3-2 to rescind the negative declaration. [After earlier litigation on this issue, the ZBA] proceeded to conduct additional public hearings to consider the merits of the application. The ZBA had the opportunity to approve the application subject to conditions intended to mitigate adverse effects on public health, safety, and welfare that might arise from the project. Rather, on May 13, 2003 the ZBA voted 3-2 to deny WDS’s application in its entirety.</p>
<p id="c5839ccd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The stated reasons for the rejection included the effect the project would have on traffic and concerns with respect to parking and the intensity of use. Many of these grounds were conceived after the ZBA closed its hearing process, giving the school no opportunity to respond. The district court found the stated reasons for denying the application were not supported by evidence in the public record before the ZBA, and were based on several factual errors. It surmised that the application was in fact denied because the ZBA gave undue deference to the public opposition of the small but influential group of neighbors who were against the school’s expansion plans. It also noted that the denial of the application would result in long delay of WDS’s efforts to remedy the gross inadequacies of its facilities, and substantially increase construction costs.</p>
<p id="c5839cce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 29, 2003 the school filed [a complaint raising claims under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §2000cc <i>et seq.</i>, and other statutes]. A seven-day bench trial began on November 14, 2005 and resulted in the March 2006 judgment. The district court ordered the Village to issue WDS’s special permit immediately.</p>

Further, using, building, or converting real property for religious exercise purposes is considered to be religious exercise under the statute. §2000cc-5(7)(B). To remove any remaining doubt regarding how broadly Congress aimed to define religious exercise, RLUIPA goes on to state that the Act’s aim of protecting religious exercise is to be construed broadly and “to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc-3(g).</p>

For example, if a religious school wishes to build a gymnasium to be used exclusively for sporting activities, that kind of expansion would not constitute religious exercise. Or, had the ZBA denied the Westchester Religious Institute’s 1986 request for a special permit to construct a headmaster’s residence on a portion of the property, such a denial would not have implicated religious exercise. Nor would the school’s religious exercise have been burdened by the denial of a permit to build more office space.</p>
<p id="c583c3e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] district court made careful factual findings that each room the school planned to build would be used at least in part for religious education and practice, finding that Gordon Hall and the other facilities renovated as part of the project, in whole and in all of their constituent parts, would be used for “religious education and practice.” In light of these findings, amply supported in the record, the expansion project is a “building [and] conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise” and thus is religious exercise under §2000cc-5(7)(B).</p>
<p id="c583c3e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B. Substantial Burden</i></p>
<p id="c583c3e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Supreme Court precedents teach that a substantial burden on religious exercise exists when an individual is required to “choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion . . . on the other hand.” <i>Sherbert v. Verner</i>, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963). A number of courts use this standard as the starting point for determining what is a substantial burden under RLUIPA. When a municipality denies a religious institution the right to expand its facilities, it is difficult to speak of substantial pressure to change religious behavior, because in light of the denial the renovation simply cannot proceed. Accordingly, when there has been a denial of a religious institution’s building application, courts appropriately speak of government action that directly <i>coerces</i> the religious institution to change its behavior, rather than government action that forces the religious entity to choose between religious precepts and government benefits. <i>See, e.g.</i>, [<i>Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside</i>, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir. 2004)] (“[A] substantial burden is akin to significant pressure which directly coerces the religious adherent to conform his or her behavior accordingly.”). Here, WDS contends that the denial of its application in effect coerced the day school to continue teaching in inadequate facilities, thereby impeding its religious exercise.</p>
<p id="c583c3e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet, when the denial of a religious institution’s application to build is not absolute, such would not necessarily place substantial pressure on the institution to alter its behavior, since it could just as easily file a second application that remedies the problems in the first. As a consequence, rejection of a submitted plan, while leaving open the possibility of approval of a resubmission with modifications designed to address the cited problems, is less likely to constitute a “substantial burden” than definitive rejection of the same plan, ruling out the possibility of approval of a modified proposal. Of course, a conditional denial may represent a substantial burden if the condition itself is a burden on free exercise, the required modifications are economically <span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-487">p. 487</span>unfeasible, or where a zoning board’s stated willingness to consider a modified plan is disingenuous. However, in most cases, whether the denial of the application was absolute is important; if there is a reasonable opportunity for the institution to submit a modified application, the denial does not place substantial pressure on it to change its behavior and thus does not constitute a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion.</p>
<p id="c583c3e9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize further that where the denial of an institution’s application to build will have minimal impact on the institution’s religious exercise, it does not constitute a substantial burden, even when the denial is definitive. There must exist a close nexus between the coerced or impeded conduct and the institution’s religious exercise for such conduct to be a substantial burden on that religious exercise. Imagine, for example, a situation where a school could easily rearrange existing classrooms to meet its religious needs in the face of a rejected application to renovate. In such case, the denial would not substantially threaten the institution’s religious exercise, and there would be no substantial burden, even though the school was refused the opportunity to expand its facilities.</p>
<p id="c583c3ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note, however, that a burden need not be found insuperable to be held substantial. When the school has no ready alternatives, or where the alternatives require substantial “delay, uncertainty, and expense,” a complete denial of the school’s application might be indicative of a substantial burden.</p>
<p id="c583c3eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are, of course, mindful that the Supreme Court’s free exercise jurisprudence signals caution in using effect alone to determine substantial burden. This is because an effect focused analysis may run up against the reality that “[t]he freedom asserted by [some may] bring them into collision with [the] rights asserted by” others and that “[i]t is such conflicts which most frequently require intervention of the State to determine where the rights of one end and those of another begin.” <i>Braunfeld v. Brown</i>, 366 U.S. 599, 604 (1961). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has held that generally applicable burdens, neutrally imposed, are not “substantial.” <i>See Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Bd. of Equalization</i>, 493 U.S. 378, 389-91 (1990).</p>
<p id="c583c3ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This reasoning helps to explain why courts confronting free exercise challenges to zoning restrictions rarely find the substantial burden test satisfied even when the resulting effect is to completely prohibit a religious congregation from building a church on its own land. A number of our sister circuits have applied this same reasoning in construing RLUIPA’s substantial burden requirement. For example, the Seventh Circuit has held that land use conditions do not constitute a substantial burden under RLUIPA where they are “neutral and traceable to municipal land planning goals” and where there is no evidence that government actions were taken “<i>because</i> [plaintiff] is a <i>religious</i> institution.” <i>Vision Church v. Vill. of Long Grove</i>, 468 F.3d 975, 998-99 (7th Cir. 2006). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has held that no substantial burden was imposed, even where an ordinance “rendered [plaintiff] unable to provide education and/or worship” on its property, because the plaintiff was not “precluded from using other sites within the city” and because “there [is no] evidence that the City would not impose the same requirements on any other entity.” [<i>San Jose Christian College v. City of Morgan Hill</i>, 360 F.3d 1024, 1035 (9th Cir. 2004).] The Eleventh Circuit has also ruled <span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-488">p. 488</span>that “reasonable ‘run of the mill’ zoning considerations do not constitute substantial burdens.” <i>Midrash Sephardi</i>, 366 F.3d at 1227-28 &amp; n.11.</p>
<p id="c583c3ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same reasoning that precludes a religious organization from demonstrating substantial burden in the neutral application of legitimate land use restrictions may, in fact, support a substantial burden claim where land use restrictions are imposed on the religious institution arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully. The arbitrary application of laws to religious organizations may reflect bias or discrimination against religion. Where the arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful nature of a defendant’s challenged action suggests that a religious institution received less than even-handed treatment, the application of RLUIPA’s substantial burden provision usefully “backstops the explicit prohibition of religious discrimination in the later section of the Act.” [<i>Saints Constantine &amp; Helen Greek Orthodox Church, Inc. v. City of New Berlin</i>, 396 F.3d 895, 900 (7th Cir. 2005).]</p>
<p id="c583c3ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we deem it relevant to the evaluation of WDS’s particular substantial burden claim that the district court expressly found that the zoning board’s denial of the school’s application was “arbitrary and capricious under New York law because the purported justifications set forth in the Resolution do not bear the necessary substantial relation to public health, safety or welfare,” and the zoning board’s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. Although the Village disputes this finding, we conclude that it is amply supported by both the law and the record evidence.</p>
<p id="c583c3ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he zoning board denied WDS’s application based, in part, on an accusation that the school made “a willful attempt” to mislead the zoning board. In fact, the accusation was unsupported by the evidence and based on the zoning board’s own error with respect to certain relevant facts. The ZBA’s allegations of deficiencies in the school’s traffic study were also unsupported by the evidence before it. The concern about lack of adequate parking was based on the zoning board’s own miscalculation. In each of these instances, the ZBA’s assumptions were not only wrong; they were unsupported by its own experts.</p>
<p id="c583eb00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]wo other factors drawn from our earlier discussion must be considered in reaching such a burden determination: (1) whether there are quick, reliable, and financially feasible alternatives WDS may utilize to meet its religious needs absent its obtaining the construction permit; and (2) whether the denial was conditional. These two considerations matter for the same reason: when an institution has a ready alternative — be it an entirely different plan to meet the same needs or the opportunity to try again in line with a zoning board’s recommendations — its religious exercise has not been substantially burdened.</p>
<p id="c583eb01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the school could not have met its needs simply by reallocating space within its existing buildings. The architectural firm it hired determined that certain essential facilities would have to be incorporated into a new building, because not enough space remained in the existing buildings to accommodate the school’s expanding needs. Further, experts hired by WDS determined that the planned location for Gordon Hall was the only site that would accommodate the new building.</p>
<p id="c583eb02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In examining the second factor we believe the denial of WDS’s application was absolute. First, we observe that the ZBA could have approved the application subject <span title="489" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-489">p. 489</span>to conditions intended to mitigate adverse effects on public health, safety, and welfare. Yet the ZBA chose instead to deny the application in its entirety. Second, were WDS to prepare a modified proposal, it would have to begin the application process anew. This would have imposed so great an economic burden as to make the option unworkable. Third, the district court determined that ZBA members were not credible when they testified they would give reasonable consideration to another application by WDS. When the board’s expressed willingness to consider a modified proposal is insincere, we do not require an institution to file a modified proposal before determining that its religious exercise has been substantially burdened.</p>
<p id="c583eb03-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C. Least Restrictive Means to Further a Compelling State Interest</i></p>
<p id="c583eb04-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under RLUIPA, once a religious institution has demonstrated that its religious exercise has been substantially burdened, the burden of proof shifts to the municipality to prove it acted in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and that its action is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. §2000cc-2(b). Compelling state interests are “interests of the highest order.” <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah</i>, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993). The Village claims that it has a compelling interest in enforcing zoning regulations and ensuring residents’ safety through traffic regulations. However, it must show a compelling interest in imposing the burden on religious exercise in the particular case at hand, not a compelling interest in general.</p>
<p id="c583eb05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court’s findings reveal the ZBA’s stated reasons for denying the application were not substantiated by evidence in the record before it. The court stated the application was denied not because of a compelling governmental interest that would adversely impact public health, safety, or welfare, but was denied because of undue deference to the opposition of a small group of neighbors.</p>
<p id="c583eb06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Further, even were we to determine that there was a compelling state interest involved, the Village did not use the least restrictive means available to achieve that interest. The ZBA had the opportunity to approve the application subject to conditions, but refused to consider doing so.</p>

<p id="c583eb09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Congress versus the courts on religious freedom.</b> The first and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect the “free exercise” of religion. In <i>Employment Division v. Smith</i>, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the Supreme Court held that no violation of the free exercise clause occurs when a neutral and generally applicable regulatory law places a burden on an individual’s religion. With several narrow exceptions, only laws that prohibit specific religious practices or coerce individuals to engage in religious practices raise constitutional issues of free exercise. Responding to <i>Smith</i>, in 1993 Congress passed the <i>Religious Freedom Restoration Act</i> (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. §§2000bb-1 to 2000bb-3, granting exemptions from government regulations that substantially burden the free exercise of religion unless the government could show a compelling governmental interest for the regulation and that the interest could not be achieved in <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>a manner less restrictive of religious practice. In 1997, the Supreme Court held RFRA unconstitutional as applied to state governments because Congress’s power under the fourteenth amendment to regulate the states to protect religious “liberty” could not go beyond the protections afforded by the first amendment. <i>City of Boerne v. Flores</i>, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). Because Congress was, in effect, trying to expand federal protection for religious freedom beyond what the Court believed was encompassed by the first amendment, and because it was attempting to regulate the states, it exceeded its powers.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DCF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DCF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span></p>
<p id="c583eb0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>City of Boerne</i> generated a number of legislative responses. At the state level, a number of states enacted their own versions of RFRA. Alabama, for example, amended its constitution to do so. Ala. Const. amend. 622, §V. Other states that passed such laws by statute include Arizona, Ariz. Stat. §41-1493.01; Connecticut, Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-571b; Florida, Fla. Stat. §§761.01-761.05; Idaho, Idaho Code §73-402; Illinois, 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 35/1-99; New Mexico, N.M. Stat. §§28-22-1 to 28-22-5; Oklahoma, Okla. Stat. tit. 51, §§251-258; Rhode Island, R.I. Gen. Laws §§42-80.1-1 to 42-80.1-4; South Carolina, S.C. Code §§1-32-10 to 1-32-60; and Texas, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §§110.001-110.012.</p>
<p id="c583eb0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the federal level, Congress responded by passing the <i>Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000</i> (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§2000cc to 2000cc-5. More limited in scope, RLUIPA protects the religious exercise rights of prisoners and prohibits governments from “impos[ing] or implement[ing] a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution” unless the regulation furthers “a compelling governmental interest” and “is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. §2000cc.</p>
<p id="c583eb0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To meet the constitutional requirements set out in <i>City of Bourne</i>, the statute applies only if (a) the affected activity receives federal funds, (b) either the substantial burden or the removal of the burden would affect “interstate commerce,” or (c) the burden is imposed in the course of governmental procedures that involve “individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved.” <i>Id.</i> §2000cc(a)(2). The statute further provides that no government “shall impose or implement a land use regulation that (A) totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction; or (B) unreasonably limits religious assemblies, institutions, or structures within a jurisdiction.” <i>Id.</i> §2000cc(b)(3).</p>
<p id="c583eb0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has held that the “institutionalized persons” aspects of RLUIPA do not violate the constitution’s establishment clause, see<i> Cutter v. Wilkinson</i>, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), but has yet to address the act’s land use provisions.</p>
<p id="c583eb0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Religious exercise.</b> <i>Westchester Day School</i> noted how broadly Congress defined religious exercise under §§2000cc-5(7) and 3(g), but nonetheless gave several <span title="491" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-491">p. 491</span>examples of uses related to the religious school that would not have qualified, such as a gymnasium for students or a residence for the headmaster. Do you agree with this interpretation? Why does a given portion of a facility have to be directly used for religious education to constitute “religious exercise”? What if a church believes that part of its ministry includes social gatherings for its members and seeks to build a facility that is used for gatherings, but not worship?</p>
<p id="c5841220-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many faiths include strictures relating to relieving suffering and alleviating poverty and, as a result, many religious institutions offer social services, such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and housing. If a religious institution offers a social service or a service that looks like a commercial activity as part of its mission, is this the “exercise of religion”? <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Greater Bible Way Temple v. City of Jackson</i>, 733 N.W.2d 734 (Mich. 2007) (proposed assisted living facility for elderly and disabled people claimed to be part of a church’s mission was not considered religious exercise). Why might courts limit the scope of the kinds of services that might constitute religious exercise?</p>
<p id="c5841221-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts can also take a narrow view of claims that uses that <i>support</i> a religious mission are themselves the exercise of religion. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Cathedral Church of the Intercessor v. Village of Malverne</i>, 353 F. Supp. 2d 375 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (no RLUIPA claim when expansion of church’s administrative offices was blocked); <i>Scottish Rite Cathedral v. City of L.A.</i>, 67 Cal. Rptr. 3d 207, 215-216 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding that “a burden on a commercial enterprise used to fund a religious organization does not constitute a substantial burden on ‘religious exercise’ within the meaning of RLUIPA”).</p>
<p id="c5841222-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. How substantial does the burden have to be?</b> As <i>Westchester Day School</i> pointed out, some courts hold that land use restrictions are not a substantial burden where such conditions are “neutral and traceable to municipal land planning goals.” <i>Vision Church v. Village of Long Grove</i>, 468 F.3d 975, 998-999 (7th Cir. 2006). In passing RLUIPA, Congress was responding to the Supreme Court’s holding in <i>Smith</i> that the free exercise clause is not violated when a neutral and generally applicable regulatory law burdens an individual’s religion. Does that suggest that even neutral and generally applicable zoning laws might create a substantial burden on religious exercise?</p>
<p id="c5841223-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have taken varying approaches to evaluating whether a land use regulation constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise. In contrast to the standard the Second Circuit applied in <i>Westchester Day School</i>, for example, the Seventh Circuit has held that “a land-use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise is one that necessarily bears direct, primary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering religious exercise — including the use of real property for the purpose thereof within the regulated jurisdiction generally — effectively impracticable.” <i>City League of Urban Believers v. Chicago</i>, 342 F.3d 752, 761 (7th Cir. 2003). For a discussion of the primary factors that courts have looked to in approaching the question of substantial burden, see Karla L. Chaffee &amp; Dwight H. Merriam, <i>Six Fact Patterns of Substantial Burden in RLUIPA: Lessons for Potential Litigants</i>, 2 Alb. Govt. L. Rev. 437, 453-474 (2009) (noting that courts evaluate, among other factors, the level of financial hardship and inconvenience imposed by a regulation, whether current facilities are <span title="492" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-492">p. 492</span>adequate for religious exercise or other property is available, and whether a regulation treats religious institutions differently than secular ones).</p>
<p id="c5841224-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Compelling governmental interest.</b> One of the more difficult questions RLUIPA poses is what constitutes a “compelling governmental interest” in the zoning context. In <i>Westchester Day School</i>, the court avoided this question by holding that the interest asserted was disingenuous. Other courts approach this question by focusing on whether a purported interest is being advanced by the least restrictive means. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of Marietta</i>, 654 F.3d 1231 (11th Cir. 2011) (complete prohibition on religious assemblies in residential zones is not the least restrictive means). But are traditional land use policy rationales such as the separation of incompatible uses, orderly development, and pedestrian and traffic safety “compelling”?</p>
<p id="c5841225-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>International Church of the Foursquare Gospel v. City of San Leandro</i>, 634 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2011), a municipality justified its denial of rezoning and a conditional use permit to a church on the ground that the parcel at issue was located in an industrial park zoning district that did not allow for any “assembly uses” such as churches, clubs, and lodges. The parcel was also situated in a “focus area” designated by the city’s general plan for industrial and technological activity, and the area contained several manufacturing plants and other industrial and light-industrial uses that brought a present and future presence of hazardous materials and activities. The Ninth Circuit held that preserving the land for industrial or technology uses was not a compelling governmental interest. <i>Id.</i> at 1048-1049.</p>
<p id="c5841226-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If keeping large congregations from regularly gathering in the middle of an active industrial zone that is in the vicinity of hazardous wastes is not a “compelling governmental interest” under RLUIPA, would any of the kinds of separation of uses cited by the Supreme Court in <i>Euclid v. Ambler Realty</i>, see §1.2, <i>supra</i>, qualify? Is this a justifiable limitation on local-government authority? How should courts decide which public purposes in land use regulation are “compelling”?</p>
<p id="c5841227-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Discrimination and exclusion claims.</b> In addition to the prohibition on placing a substantial burden on religious exercise in 42 U.S.C. §2000cc(a), RLUIPA also prohibits “[d]iscrimination and exclusion” in §2000cc(b). This encompasses three distinct provisions:</p>

The circuit courts have divided in interpreting this provision. <i>See Centro Familiar Cristiano Buenas Nuevas v. City of Yuma</i>, 651 F.3d 1163, 1169 n.25 (9th Cir. 2011). Most circuits have held that the appropriate focus is whether a religious institution is similarly situated to a nonreligious institution in terms of the given regulatory purpose of the land use provision at issue. <i>See id.</i> at 1172-1173. In <i>Kingdom Ministries v. Village of Hazel Crest</i>, 611 F.3d 367 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), the court added the caveat that the comparison must be made with respect to “accepted zoning criteria,” but found that a restriction on churches allegedly intended to reserve a commercial area for revenue-generating businesses met the test because secular businesses that did not generate revenue, such as libraries and community centers, were banned as well. The Eleventh Circuit, by contrast, has held that if a statute or zoning ordinance facially differentiates between religious and nonreligious assemblies or institutions, it must survive strict scrutiny. <i>Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside</i>, 366 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>
<p id="c584393e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Remedies under RLUIPA.</b> Under RLUIPA, a litigant “may assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” §2000cc-2(a). The Supreme Court has held that “appropriate relief” does not include money damages in suits by prisoners against states because Congress did not abrogate state sovereign immunity. <i>Sossamon v. Texas</i>, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1655 (2011). Justice Sotomayor pointed out in dissent, however, that the land use provisions of the statute may yield a different conclusion. <i>Id.</i> at 1668 n.5. Several circuit courts have held that money damages are available under RLUIPA against <i>local governments</i>, such as municipalities and counties, which do not share the same immunity as states. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Centro Familiar</i>, 651 F.3d at 1168-1169; <i>Lighthouse Institute for Evangelism, Inc. v. City of Long Branch</i>, 510 F.3d 253, 260-261 (3d Cir. 2007).</p>
<p id="c584393f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. Disaster relief and religious land uses.</b> In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, a 2012 storm that devastated wide areas of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and other northeastern states, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would allow federal disaster relief to be provided to churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other religious establishments. <i>See</i> H.R. 592 (2013). Currently, under the <i>Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. <span class="epub-small-caps">§</span>5121 <i>et seq</i>., disaster aid can be provided to religious entities that are performing “essential services of governmental nature.” 42 U.S.C. <span class="epub-small-caps">§§</span>5122(11)(B), 5172(a)(3); <i>see also</i> Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Assistance Policy 9521.3(7)(4)(3) (“Space dedicated to or primarily used for religious, political, athletic, recreational, or vocational purposes, is not eligible for Public Assistance Program assistance under the governing statutes and regulations.”). The case law on whether governmental grants to religious institutions violate the establishment clause is complicated, but in general, the Supreme Court has allowed funding to flow to religious entities through neutral programs that do not single out such organizations. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</i>, 536 U.S. 639 <span title="494" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-494">p. 494</span>(2002) (educational voucher program that allowed recipients to attend religiously affiliated schools did not violate establishment clause);<i> Mitchell v. Helms</i>, 530 U.S. 793, 836 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (2000) (federal and state school aid programs that applied to parochial schools did not violate the establishment clause). Do disaster relief funds provided to houses of worship that are not tied to specific services those facilities provide violate the establishment clause? What are the best arguments on both sides?</p>

A church seeks to renovate its facility to obtain more space. It plans to construct a seven-story tower to accommodate both its religious services and other activities, including a soup kitchen and a homeless shelter that will accommodate 30 people. Is the church entitled to do this under the terms of RLUIPA?</p>
<p id="c5843943-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> A church allows homeless persons to sleep on its landing and front steps. The city seeks to prevent this on the ground that it provides shelters for the homeless where they will be safer than they would be sleeping outside. Some homeless persons refuse to go to the shelters either because the shelters are dangerous or because they value the freedom of being outside a facility. The church claims that it has a first amendment right to the free exercise of religion that allows it to grant sanctuary to the poor. <i>See Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church v. City of New York</i>, 293 F.3d 570 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that there may be such a right). If the city had an ordinance requiring homeless shelters to obtain permits to operate and denied the church the power to allow people to sleep on its steps in violation of local anti-loitering ordinances, does the church have a right under RLUIPA to continue its practices?</p>

The town denies the permit because it insists on reducing the size of the structure and the number of students attending the school. The church has to shut down its day care center because it does not have enough space for it along with its other activities. Is the denial of the special use permit a “substantial burden” on the church’s religious exercise under RLUIPA?</p>

<p id="c5843948-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The use of real property is regulated not only by local zoning laws but also by a variety of state and federal laws, many of which seek to protect the environment. The interplay between environmental law and land use regulation raises a host of legal and practical issues and real property lawyers are increasingly becoming experts in areas of law that include wetlands regulation, protection for endangered species, air quality standards, clean water, and others. This section addresses three examples of this interplay: liability for hazardous wastes, environmental impact assessment, and planning for climate change.</p>

<p id="c584394b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>CERCLA.</b> In 1980, Congress passed the <i>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act</i> (CERCLA), and in 1986 followed with the <i>Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act</i> (SARA), 42 U.S.C. §§9601-9675. These statutes authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to respond to or to require others to respond to imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment caused by release of a hazardous substance from a facility. CERCLA imposes liability on persons who either owned or operated a facility when hazardous substances were released and on some present owners and operators of such facilities. This liability is strict, meaning that fault is not at issue. Courts have also held that liability under CERCLA is joint and several where harm cannot be accurately apportioned, and the Supreme Court has indicated triggering this apportionment requires only a reasonable estimate of each party’s share. <i>See Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States</i>, 556 U.S. 599 613-619 (2009). Each person found liable may go after other potential defendants to share the cost of the cleanup, but if other responsible parties cannot be found, or their companies have dissolved or are insolvent, and it is not feasible to apportion harms, then any responsible party may be saddled with the entire cost.</p>
<p id="c584605c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defenses under CERCLA are minimal. Parties are not responsible for (1) acts of God; (2) acts of war; and (3) acts or omissions of third parties with whom the defendant had no contractual relationship, if the defendant shows that it exercised due care and took all reasonable precautions against foreseeable acts of the third party. SARA and the <i>Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act,</i> Pub. L. No. 107-118, 115 Stat. 2356 (2002), commonly known as the <i>Brownfields Act</i>, clarified the so-called innocent owner defense. To claim this defense, which is based on the theory that contamination is the result of third-party acts or omissions, an owner must have <span title="496" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-496">p. 496</span>made good faith efforts to determine whether the land was polluted and must not have discovered any preexisting hazardous substances before purchasing the property. As a result, environmental assessment has become a standard aspect of most large-scale land acquisitions. If the owner later discovers that the property is contaminated, the owner may not transfer the property without disclosing this fact to the purchaser. Failure to disclose causes the seller to be liable for the cleanup even if the seller did not cause the contamination.</p>
<p id="c584605d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>State hazardous waste statutes.</b> Most states have adopted legislation designed to encourage or compel property owners to clean up toxic waste sites. Some states require that the presence of hazardous waste be made known to buyers, allowing the sale to be rescinded if notice is not provided. Ind. Code §13-25-3-2. Other states impose strict liability on property owners to clean up their property or to reimburse the state for cleanup costs. To ensure payment for the cleanup, these states impose a “superlien” on the property, which takes priority over all or most other debts. New Jersey’s <i>Industrial Site Recovery Act</i>, the most stringent in the country, prohibits certain owners from transferring their property until they either <i>certify</i> that no hazardous substances remain on the property or execute an approved cleanup plan. N.J. Stat. §13:1k-6 <i>et seq</i>.</p>
<p id="c584605e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Brownfield redevelopment and environmental covenants.</b> CERCLA and related federal and state statutes have focused attention on reclaiming contaminated property, often called <b>brownfields</b>, for productive use. Fear of liability can be a significant deterrent to the redevelopment of sites, particularly in urban areas that have an industrial history but are ripe for productive use. In many instances, it would not be feasible or cost effective to eliminate all hazardous wastes, but it can make sense to perform a limited cleanup as long as the use of the site will be controlled in the future. Thus, a retail store on a former industrial site might require less remediation than a future playground or subdivision. This approach is known as “risk-based” cleanup because the level of remediation is tied to an assessment of the likelihood of harm in the future, rather than absolute safety. <i>See</i> Roger D. Schwenke, <i>Applying and Enforcing Institutional Controls in the Labyrinth of Environmental Requirements — Do We Need More Than the Restatement of Servitudes to Turn Brownfields Green?</i>, 38 Real Prop., Prob. &amp; Trust J. 295 (2003).</p>
<p id="c584605f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Brownfield sites are thus increasingly being reclaimed subject to institutional controls that are meant to limit future uses and put the public on notice of the extent — and limits — of any remediation that has been done on the site. Environmental covenants have become a common technique for these purposes. Such covenants are recorded and intended to bind future owners.</p>
<p id="c5846060-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Questions of the status and enforceability of environmental covenants led the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to adopt the Uniform Environmental Covenants Act (UECA) in 2003. The UECA, which has been adopted in about 25 jurisdictions, is intended to make clear that notwithstanding potential state common law impediments to the contrary, environmental covenants that involve responsible public agencies are enforceable and will not be eliminated through tax <span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-497">p. 497</span>lien foreclosures, adverse possession, or the application of marketable title statutes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F54_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F54_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">15</a></span> (Prior interests will take priority, unless subordinated.) The UECA does not change the substantive standards for liability and remediation, but does provide a tool to allow owners, regulators, purchasers, and the public to record and enforce controls on brownfield sites.</p>

<p id="c584606d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Environmental assessment.</b> Modeled after the <i>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</i>, 42 U.S.C. §4321 (NEPA), a number of states have passed environmental policy acts designed to provide information to allow policymakers to evaluate the environmental impact of policy decisions. These state statutes are generally referred to as <b>little NEPAs</b> or <b>SEPAs</b>. NEPA applies to actions by the federal government but many of the state analogues apply to <i>private</i> development if there are discretionary state or local actions involved in approving such development. <i>See Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors</i>, 502 P.2d 1049 (Cal. 1972) (establishing the application of the <i>California Environmental Quality Act of 1970</i> to private projects).</p>
<p id="c584606e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">SEPAs require proponents of a project to identify the project’s effects, evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative approaches, and consider ways to mitigate the identified environmental impact. These statutes are primarily procedural, rather than substantive, which is to say that they do not dictate the outcome of a given land use decision or policy, but instead seek to improve decision making by making information available that would otherwise get less attention.</p>
<p id="c584877f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The details of the process under SEPAs vary from state to state, but generally involve two stages. In the first, officials have to determine whether a given project is even subject to environmental assessment. Many kinds of routine or small-scale projects are exempt, so that, for example, a homeowner doing a renovation will not have to go through any kind of environmental review when she applies for a building permit. For much larger-scale development, however, an initial <b>environmental assessment</b> (<b>EA</b>) will be required to determine whether the project’s impact will be significant. If it is determined that a project will likely have significant impact on the environment, then a full <b>environmental impact statement</b> or <b>report</b> (<b>EIS</b> or <b>EIR</b>) will be required.</p>
<p id="c5848780-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="498" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-498">p. 498</span>Courts are regularly confronted with cases that challenge compliance with SEPA requirements at each of these stages. For example, many cases involve the question whether a determination that a project will not have a significant impact, and thus will not have to undertake an EIS, was properly made by the relevant agency. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management District</i>, 226 P.3d 985 (Cal. 2010). Opponents of development frequently challenge the sufficiency of the EIS itself, on the ground that particular required elements were left out or that what was included in the EIS was not adequate. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Develop Don’t Destroy (Brooklyn), Inc. v. Empire State Development Corp.</i>, 94 A.D.3d 508 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012) (rejecting the final environmental impact statement for the Atlantic Yards Arena Redevelopment Project, which includes a sports arena and 16 high-rise buildings, because it erroneously assumed a 10-year build-out rather than the 25 years the developer contemplated to complete the project).</p>
<p id="c5848781-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What does the requirement for environmental impact assessment suggest about the potential shortcomings of the process through which real estate development otherwise takes place?</p>
<p id="c5848782-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Physical versus non-physical impacts.</b> Some state environmental policy acts define “environment” very broadly to include the impact of a proposed project on social and economic conditions. In the seminal case <i>Chinese Staff &amp; Workers Association v. City of New York</i>, 502 N.E.2d 176 (N.Y. 1986), New York’s highest court evaluated the sufficiency of a decision that a proposed high-rise luxury condominium in a low-income neighborhood would have no significant effect on the environment. The agencies that reviewed the special permit application had evaluated the project’s impact on the <i>physical environment</i> and indicated that if certain mitigating steps were taken, the developer would not have to undertake a full EIS. New York’s SEPA defined “environment” as “ ‘the physical conditions which will be affected by a proposed action, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance, existing patterns of population concentration, distribution, or growth, and existing community or neighborhood character.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at 179 (quoting ECL 8-0105[6]; CEQR 1[f]). In light of this definition, the court held that “the potential displacement of local residents and businesses is an effect on population patterns and neighborhood character which must be considered in determining whether the requirement for an EIS is triggered.” <i>Id.</i> at 180.</p>
<p id="c5848783-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>NIMBYs, LULUs, and process.</b> One recurring challenge in land use regulation is finding a balance between the need for meaningful public participation and the reality that communities can sometimes oppose unpopular, but necessary, projects under the banner of “not in my backyard” (<b>NIMBY</b>). Environmental review has been a particular flashpoint in controversies over this balance. Proponents highlight environmental review’s ability to force decision makers to consider the ecological and social costs of development and the leverage such review can provide for public input. Critics, on the other hand, voice concerns about approval processes raising the costs of development and replicating dynamics where communities with more resources can avoid locally undesirable land uses (or <b>LULUs</b>), such as affordable housing and <span title="499" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-499">p. 499</span>environmentally hazardous projects, making LULUs more likely to be sited in low-income areas, particularly in communities of color.</p>

<p id="c5848786-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the most significant emerging development in terms of the intersection of land use regulation and environmental law is a growing focus by planners, local government officials, and advocates on climate change. <i>See</i> John R. Nolon, <i>Land Use for Energy Conservation and Sustainable Development: A New Path Toward Climate Change Mitigation</i>, 27 J. Land Use &amp; Envtl. L. 295 (2012). Residential and commercial buildings account for over 40 percent of energy consumption in the United States, <i>id.</i> at 299. A significant portion of remaining greenhouse gas production is influenced by the density and location of development, which influences the need for transportation, particularly with automobiles.</p>
<p id="c5848787-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use regulation relating to climate change falls into two broad categories: mitigation and adaptation. <b>Mitigation</b> involves efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through changes to the built environment. Examples include building codes that seek to limit energy use, reduce water consumption, and the generation of wastes in new developments. Mitigation can also involve planning and land use regulatory approaches that increase density and reduce the need for transportation.</p>
<p id="c5848788-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast,<b> adaptation</b> involves efforts to respond to changes in the environment unleashed by climate change. These can include strengthening building codes to respond to the rise in weather events once considered extreme as well as changes to siting and other land use decisions to take development out of the path of disaster. <i>See</i> Tara Siegel Bernard, <i>Rebuilding After Sandy, but with Costly New Rules</i>, N.Y. Times, May 11, 2013, at B-1; <i>see generally</i> Jacqueline Peel &amp; Hari M. Osofsky, <i>Sue to Adapt?</i>, 99 Minn. L. Rev. 2177 (2015) (tracking the emergence of “adaptation planning suits” that seek redress for climate-related species loss, harms arising from disasters and coastal hazards, and disaster planning).</p>
<p id="c5848789-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority under the <i>Clean Air Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §7521, to regulate greenhouse gases, see<i> Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</i>, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), but much of the regulatory response so far has taken place at the state and local level. For example, California in 2006 passed AB 32, the <i>Global Warming Solutions Act</i>, codified at Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code §38501 <i>et seq</i>. The statute seeks to reduce the state’s emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2020. One element of the regulatory regime it introduced focuses on reducing vehicle miles traveled. A later companion statute, Stats. 2008, c.728 (S.B.375), §2, requires regions in California to plan for more compact development in line with regional targets for emissions reductions. Regulations under the act also now provide guidance for evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and formulating feasible mitigation measures to reduce their impacts for purposes of the <i>California Environmental Quality Act</i>.

<p id="c584878e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land is an important resource, but the use and exploitation of a range of other natural resources are regulated as well. “Natural resources” is a capacious concept that can encompass almost any product of nature, <i>In re Tortorelli</i>, 66 P.3d 606, 610 (Wash. 2003), including water, oil, gas, minerals, forests, rangelands, wildlife, wetlands, and other aspects of the natural landscape. Like land, natural resources more broadly are governed by a combination of common law doctrines and federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This body of law for many natural resource conflicts reflects the inherently public aspects of such resources given our common interests in their preservation and wise management. <i>See</i> Joseph Sax,<i> The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention,</i> 68 Mich. L. Rev. 471 (1970); Michael C. Blumm &amp; Aurora Paulsen, <i>The Public Trust in Wildlife</i>, 2013 Utah L. Rev. 1437 (2013). Scale is also an important aspect of natural resources regulation, with natural systems rarely conforming to political jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="c584878f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as property in intangibles reflects certain characteristics that are inherent to ideas and information, see Chapter 3, §1.1, the law of natural resources has been shaped by the nature of the relevant resources it governs. The rules for the ownership and use of water, for example, have a lot to do with the fact that water moves and can be reused by many claimants. By contrast, the rules for trees and many kinds of hard-rock minerals reflect the fact that they begin fixed in a certain place and tend to be exhausted when used. For every natural resource, however, some common questions arise: How should the law balance productive use and conservation, protect investment and expectations while preventing monopoly, and distribute rights fairly between multiple owners with competing interests?</p>
<p id="c584aea0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are difficult values to balance, and our legal system has traditionally preferred consumption over sustainability. As Professor Joseph Sax has written:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c584aea1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For two centuries [in the development of the American continent], virtually nothing of the economy of nature was intentionally saved. That is well known. What is perhaps not so well recognized (though it has been extensively documented by legal historians), is that the law was constructed and reconstructed to drive this process forward. The rules of landownership were shaped in order to incentivize transformation to the new economy and to discourage retention of nature’s economy. For example, there was no economic reason to leave water in a river, or to refrain from damming it, nor was there any such reason to leave land unfenced so as to permit the passage of wildlife or to leave land uncultivated as habitat. On the contrary, leaving water in a river was considered waste. Even those who wanted to obtain a right to keep waters flowing in-stream were prevented from doing so. The old preindustrial rules mandating retention of the natural flow of rivers were abolished so that rivers could be dammed to generate hydropower, the open range fenced, and bounties paid to exterminate predators such as wolves. That was the logic of the transformative economy, and the law of property rights was its obedient servant.</p>

This perspective has deep roots in American law as well, and has begun to gain greater recognition in our legal system with the rise of the conservation movement and increasing ecological awareness. Eric T. Freyfogle, <i>The Land We Share</i>: <i>Private Property and the Common Good</i> (2003).

<p id="c584aea4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Natural resources and environmental protection.</b> A number of federal and state statutes regulate specific natural resources in order to limit pollution. Among the most prominent of these regimes are the <i>Clean Air Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §7401 <i>et seq.</i> (CAA), and the <i>Clean Water Act,</i> 33 U.S.C. §1251 <i>et seq.</i> (CWA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is empowered by the CWA and the CAA to restrict pollution in order to improve air and water quality. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §7401(b)-(c); 33 U.S.C. §1251. This authority impacts natural resources by defining air quality criteria and control techniques, <i>e.g.</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§7408-7409, which States must implement in plans submitted to the EPA, 42 U.S.C. §7410, and creating water quality surveillance systems, 33 U.S.C. §1254(a)(5). Despite an express disavowal in the CAA against infringement of local government authority over land use, 42 U.S.C. §7431, controlling pollution necessarily limits the exploitation of natural resources.</p>
<p id="c584aea5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal <i>Endangered Species Act</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1531 <i>et seq.</i> (ESA), protects animals and plants that are either endangered or threatened. “Endangered” means that a species is in danger of extinction, while a “threatened” species is one that is likely to become endangered. <i>Id.</i> §§1532(6), (20). The ESA makes it illegal to “take” endangered species, <i>id.</i> §1538(a)(1)(B), and the meaning of take includes “harm,” <i>id.</i> §1532(19). Harm, in turn, encompasses “significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.” 50 C.F.R. 17.3; <i>see also Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon</i>, 515 U.S. 687 (1995) (upholding the regulatory definition of “take” to include habitat modification). As a result, the ESA can have significant impacts on land use and natural resource regulation, which has generated a great deal of litigation, both challenging federal enforcement of the act as well as challenging federal agencies to do more to protect endangered species, sometimes in the same case. <i>See, e.g., In re Polar Bear Endangered Species Act Listing and Section 4(d) Rule Litig. — MDL No. 1993</i>, 709 F.3d 1 (D.C.

Among the more important of these framework regimes are the <i>Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976</i>, 43 U.S.C. §1701 <i>et seq.</i> (FLPMA), which governs BLM lands; the <i>National Forest Management Act of 1976</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1600 <i>et seq.</i>, which governs USFS land; and, for the NPS, a series of individual park organic statutes, see, e.g., 16 U.S.C. §§221-228j (establishing the Grand Canyon National Park); 16 U.S.C. §21 (establishing Yellowstone National Park). A number of statutes designate particularly sensitive or important public lands for protection, including the <i>Wilderness Act of 1964</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1131 <i>et seq.</i>, which created the National Wilderness Preservation System; the <i>Antiquities Act of 1906</i>, 16 U.S.C. §431 <i>et seq.</i>, which allows the president to designate National Monuments; as well as the <i>National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1271 <i>et seq.</i>, the <i>National Scenic Trails Act</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1244, and National Conservation Areas designated by individual statutes, see, e.g., Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, 16 U.S.C. §460www; Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area, 16 U.S.C. §460xxx.</p>

Some federal lands have a primary purpose, as with wilderness areas and military bases; most public lands, however, are multi-use and federal statutes prescribe the process through which agencies have to plan for balancing those often conflicting uses. For example, FLPMA directs the BLM to manage public lands to:</p>

To meet this mandate, FLPMA requires the BLM to “prepare and maintain . . . an inventory of all public lands and their resource and other values (including, but not limited to, outdoor recreation and scenic values), giving priority to areas of critical environmental concern.” <i>Id.</i> §1711(a).

A single river, as it snakes from high mountains to the ocean, can supply water for fishing, white water rafting, farming, generating hydroelectric power, flushing industrial wastes, and filling the many needs of small towns and big cities. It can also support the biodiversity of the fish that live in it, the plants that border it, and the ecosystems that depend on it. Similarly, aquifers — underground water reservoirs — can hold vast quantities of water beneath the lands of hundreds or thousands of surface owners putting that water to any number of uses. The Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world’s largest, stretches under roughly 174,000 square miles from Texas up to South Dakota, and is estimated to hold nearly three billion acre-feet of water.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11120_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11120_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span> V.L.

Ecology investigated the Marshall Lake basin and the locality served by it and found that the interests of the public and users of the surface and ground waters would be served by an adjudication and determination of the relative rights of all claimants to the use of these waters.</p>
<p id="c584fcdb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Donald W. Moos, Director of Ecology, appointed William R. Smith as referee to take testimony and report his recommendations to the Superior Court. The Grimeses [filed a] claim for the use of waters for domestic supply, irrigation and recreational purposes. The Grimeses requested an instantaneous flow rate of 3 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) for irrigation purposes, and a storage right of 1,520 acre feet of water in the Marshall Lake reservoir. The referee recommended that this claim be confirmed, but limited it to an instantaneous flow of 1.5 c.f.s. during irrigation season, and a storage right of 183 acre feet plus 737 acre feet for evaporative loss, for a total storage right of 920 acre feet.</p>

On January 5, 1990, the Superior Court entered its “Decree Adjudicating Water Rights Pursuant to [Wash. Rev.

An adjudication of water rights is only for the purpose of determining and confirming those rights. The surface water rights of the Grimeses in this case are pre-1917 rights, established 11 years before adoption of the Water Code of 1917 and 65 years before adoption of the Water Resources Act of 1971. To confirm existing rights, the referee must determine two primary elements of a water right: (1) the amount of water that has been put to beneficial use and (2) the priority of water rights relative to each other.</p>

<p id="c58523f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Beneficial use” is a term of art in water law, and encompasses two principal elements of a water right. First, it refers to the purposes, or type of activities, for which water may be used. Use of water for the purposes of irrigated agriculture is a beneficial use. The Grimeses’ use of water to irrigate alfalfa fields is not at issue in this case. Second, beneficial use determines the measure of a water right. The owner of a water right is entitled to the amount of water necessary for the purpose to which it has been put, provided that purpose constitutes a beneficial use. To determine the amount of water necessary for a beneficial use, courts have developed the principle of “reasonable use.” Reasonable use of water is determined by analysis of the factors of water duty and waste.</p>

It is, therefore, recommended that a right be confirmed to these defendants, with a July 13, 1906 priority for the irrigation of 73 acres from Marshall Lake. Quantification of the amount of water to which this right is entitled creates somewhat of a problem in that there has been no direct testimony regarding the amount of water placed to beneficial use other than a reference in the state’s investigatory report that 56 sprinklers are utilized in the system . . . .

<p id="c58523fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The referee based his determination of the volume of water necessary for irrigation in the Marshall Lake basin on a Washington State University Research Bulletin entitled “Irrigation Requirements for Washington — Estimates and Methodology” (Irrigation Report), and on the expert testimony of Jim Lyerla, the District Supervisor for seven Eastern Washington counties, including Pend Oreille County, in the Water Resources Program of the Department of Ecology. Mr. Lyerla testified that as a part of his work in assigning water quantities to new water permittees, he relied on the Irrigation Report to determine the “water duty” for a proposed use of water. The Irrigation Report provides information for water requirements for specific crops, given in inches per acre per irrigation season, in 40 locations around the state, including Newport, Washington, 5 miles south of Marshall Lake.</p>
<p id="c58523fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the testimony of Mr. Lyerla and the Irrigation Report, the referee determined that an irrigated alfalfa crop grown in the Marshall Lake area requires 21 inches or 1.75 acre feet of water per acre during the irrigation season. The referee then applied an efficiency factor and increased this water duty to 2.5 acre feet per acre per year. The referee found this water duty to be “approximately commensurate with the duty utilized by the Department of Ecology in its quantity allocations in this geographic area under the water right permit system.”</p>
<p id="c58523fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because water rights are characterized in both total yearly allowance and instantaneous flow, the referee also established the maximum rate of diversion at 0.0166 c.f.s. per acre under irrigation. The referee first calculated a standard flow of 1 c.f.s. of water per 60 acres as a reasonable instantaneous flow for alfalfa irrigation in the Marshall Lake basin. In considering the Grimeses’ claim, he determined that the Grimeses were entitled to sufficient flow to irrigate 73 acres, or a minimum of 1.21 c.f.s. He then <span title="507" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-507">p. 507</span>calculated in an efficiency factor to increase this flow by 25 percent and awarded the Grimeses an instantaneous flow of 1.5 c.f.s.</p>
<p id="c58523ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The referee observed that a larger water duty could be awarded to any claimant with specific information proving a right to a larger amount. The 2.5 acre feet/0.0166 c.f.s. water duty was applied when “quantitative evidence of the rate and volume of a right was neither submitted nor made clear during testimony.” The referee also observed that “the use of water under all irrigation rights is, however, limited to the amount of water that can be beneficially applied to that number of acres identified in the water right.” The referee did not indiscriminately award this water duty to any claim for an irrigation right, but required claimants to prove the number of acres historically irrigated.</p>

<p id="c5854b12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From an early date, courts announced the rule that no appropriation of water was valid where the water simply went to waste. Those courts held that the appropriator who diverted more than was needed for the appropriator’s actual requirements and allowed the excess to go to waste acquired no right to the excess. A particular use must not only be of benefit to the appropriator, but it must also be a reasonable and economical use of the water in view of other present and future demands upon the source of supply. The difference between absolute waste and economical use has been said to be one of degree only.</p>
<p id="c5854b13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Clarence E. Grimes acknowledged in his testimony that his existing irrigation system required a water flow of up to 3 cubic feet per second in order to deliver 1 cubic foot per second to the field, and that this system was highly inefficient, causing one-half to two-thirds loss of water. Mr. Grimes also testified that uncertainties and ongoing litigation concerning the stability and safety of the irrigation dam had prevented continuous irrigation of his alfalfa acreage.</p>
<p id="c5854b14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While an appropriator’s use of water must be reasonably efficient, absolute efficiency is not required. The referee determined that, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code §90.14.160, the uncertainties concerning the irrigation dam constituted sufficient cause not to find a complete abandonment of the Grimeses’ water right. He resolved the conflicting testimony by limiting the irrigable acreage to the 73 acres recommended by Ecology. Relying on a standard efficiency factor for irrigation sprinkler systems found in the irrigation report, he confirmed in the Grimeses a water right with one-fourth conveyance loss for a total of 1.5 cubic feet per second. There was at least sufficient evidence for the referee to determine the maximum acreage to which the Grimeses’ water right applied, and in limiting the allowable loss for system inefficiency in establishing their instantaneous flow.</p>

This court has consistently held that rights of users of water for irrigation purposes are vested rights in real property. Amici curiae assert that the “local custom” test has been employed historically to determine whether given applications of water are wasteful, within the meaning of beneficial use, and that courts should now apply it in the setting of general adjudications. This is the established law in this state.</p>

<p id="c585722d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In limiting the Grimeses’ water use by a requirement of reasonable efficiency, the referee properly considered the irrigation report, the Grimeses’ actual water use, and their existing irrigation system. The referee alluded to a test incorporating factors that consider impacts to the water source and its flora and fauna. While consideration of these impacts is consonant with the State’s obligations under Wash. Rev. Code [§]§90.03.005 and 90.54.010(1)(a) and (2), these factors cannot operate to impair existing water rights.

<p id="c5857230-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is nothing in the record to support the referee’s statement that he employed the reasonable efficiency test. Nowhere in the record does he discuss application of the elements of the so-called “test.” If he had in fact applied the “test,” it would be necessary for this court to reverse and remand. That test is without statutory authorization in an adjudication proceeding which relates exclusively to confirmation of water rights established or created under “other provisions of state law or under federal laws.” The suggested test would be contrary to the vested rights of water users. Included in the vested rights is the right to diversion, delivery and application “according to the usual methods of artificial irrigation employed in the vicinity where such land is situated.” Wash. Rev. Code §90.03.040.</p>
<p id="c5857231-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we reject use of the specific test suggested by the referee, we affirm because (1) there is no indication in the record that he in fact applied the factors stated in the “test,” and (2) he applied the actual beneficial use made by Grimes, taking into account the actual needs and use and the methods of delivery and application in the vicinity. The adjudication and confirmation of a water right in an amount less than claimed by Grimes does not result from application of the so-called test. Rather, as the referee makes clear:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5857232-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quantification of the amount of water to which this right is entitled creates somewhat of a problem in that there has been no direct testimony regarding the amount of water placed to beneficial use other than a reference in the state’s investigatory report that 56 sprinklers are utilized in the system.</p>

<p id="c5857233-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of such proof, the referee nevertheless confirmed the right by using a normal duty of water for the type of crops raised and specifically added 25 percent for transportation loss.

Water law fundamentals.</b> There have historically been different rules for <b>surface water</b>, such as lakes, rivers, and streams, and <b>groundwater</b>, such as aquifers and percolating water. However, increasing understanding of the connections between these two water sources has led to some merging of the doctrines. Robert Haskell Abrams, <i>Legal Convergence of East and West in Contemporary Water Law</i>, 42 Envtl. L. 65, 69-80 (2012); <i>cf. Kobobel v.

Based in part on the difficulty of predicting the location and movement of groundwater, England followed an <b>absolute ownership</b> or <b>free use</b> rule, permitting all surface estate owners to withdraw as much groundwater as they could from their land, regardless of the harm to other owners above the aquifer. In <i>Acton v. Blundell</i>, 152 Eng. Rep. 1223, 1234 (Exch. 1843), for example, the court rejected the claims of a mill owner against his neighbor, whose excavations for coal depleted the common aquifer, leaving insufficient water to run his mill. The court justified its decision in the following way:</p>

The well may be sunk to supply a cottage, or a drinking-place for cattle; whilst the owner of the adjoining land may be prevented from winning metals and minerals of inestimable value.</p>
</div>
<p id="c585c05a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While a few U.S. states still follow the absolute ownership rule, most have rejected it. In its stead, most states follow the <b>reasonable use</b> rule, considering both the interests of the surface estate owners and the interests of society as a whole, particularly given the risk of depletion and the effect of one owner’s extraction on other owners. 6 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §50.11(f); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §858 (1979) (liability for unreasonable harm to other surface owners). A few states follow the <b>correlative rights</b> doctrine, allowing each surface estate owner to withdraw an equitable (“fair and just”) portion of the groundwater, perhaps in proportion to what percentage of the aquifer underlies their property. Still other states, particularly those in the arid West, have adopted the <b>prior appropriation</b> doctrine for groundwater, effectively allocating rights according to the point in time when property owners begin withdrawing the water.</p>
<p id="c585c05b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all jurisdictions, municipal and state governments increasingly intervene in water allocation to ensure predictable and fair allocation of rights, and conservation and protection of the resource. This regulation began early in the twentieth century, but has grown much more intensive in the face of greater competition for scarce resources, growing knowledge about the interconnectedness of water systems, and faster climatological change. What are the rights of owners in the existing water allocations? The Texas Supreme Court held that state deprivation of <span title="511" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-511">p. 511</span>the right to use some of the groundwater under one’s property could constitute a taking for which the U.S. and Texas constitutions require compensation. <i>Edwards Aquifer Authority v. Day</i>, 369 S.W.3d 814 (Tex. 2012). Texas is one of the few states to still follow the absolute ownership rule for groundwater. Would the issue be resolved differently under a reasonable use or correlative rights test?</p>
<p id="c585c05c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Surface water.</b> In the United States, surface water has historically been allocated according one of two dominant rules. The <b>riparian</b> doctrine, adopted by most American jurisdictions, allocates those owning land bordered the body of water (the “<b>riparian owners</b>”) rights to the water flowing past their land. Disputes between riparian owners are allocated according to a <b>reasonableness test</b> that takes into account the relative costs and benefits of the various uses, harms to competing claimants to the water, and other factors. Most western states, where water was scarce, adopted instead the <b>prior appropriation</b> or <b>appropriation</b> doctrine, prioritizing the rights of those first to make productive beneficial use of the water against later users. <i>See</i> 6 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §§50.08-50.09. Several states have “hybrid” systems that began as riparian but then shifted to appropriation. <i>Id.</i> §50.10. Appropriation was thought more appropriate for a “dry and thirsty land.” <i>Yunker v. Nichols</i>, 1 Colo. 551, 553, 555 (1872).</p>
<p id="c585c05d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both systems propertize water to a certain extent, but do so quite differently, with riparian jurisdictions dividing rights among landowners and appropriation jurisdictions allocating rights based on priority of use. The trend in both jurisdictions, moreover, is to treat water as a common resource to be regulated by public agencies to ensure water is used in the common interest. A number of riparian jurisdictions have turned to <b>regulated riparianism</b>, administrative permit systems allocating time-limited licenses to use specified amounts of water for specified purposes. Abrams, <i>supra</i>, at 68; Joseph W. Dellapenna, <i>The Evolution of Riparianism in the United States</i>, 95 Marq. L. Rev 53 (2011). Similarly, statutes in appropriation jurisdictions explicitly declare water to be a public resource, and administer the priority system by agencies that consider public interest in regulating use, providing some protection for the interests of junior users, and preserving and efficiently using the water system. Abrams, <i>supra</i>, at 91.</p>

<p id="c585c05e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Waste, abandonment, and stress on water rights.</b> Traditionally, water rights in prior appropriation jurisdictions, once established, have been considered vested, but there are limitations to this principle. Two important limitations are <b>waste</b> and <b>abandonment</b>. As <i>Grimes</i> illustrated, a water right in a prior appropriation state is limited to beneficial use, <i>Joyce Livestock Co. v. United States,</i> 156 P.3d 502, 520 (2007) (“A water right does not constitute the ownership of the water; it is simply a right to use the water to apply it to a beneficial use”); this right, in turn, is limited by the requirement that the beneficial user not waste the water. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Application for Water Rights in Rio Grande County</i>, 53 P.3d 1165 (Colo. 2002). Abandonment, by contrast, involves the relinquishment of a water right, see<i> Okanogan Wilderness League, Inc. v. Town of Twisp</i>, 947 P.2d 732, 738 (Wash. 1997), and generally requires both non-use <span title="512" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-512">p. 512</span>and the intent to abandon. Courts have also applied doctrines of non-use, forfeiture, and estoppels to terminate water rights acquired by appropriation.</p>
<p id="c585e76f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Demand for water in the West is highly stressed and facing new demands, such as significantly increasing urban uses. <i>See</i> Marc Reisner, <i>Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water</i> (1993). How would you expect this to change water doctrine?</p>
<p id="c585e770-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Justifying prior appropriation.</b> Some scholars argue that regimes such as prior appropriation developed in the West to privilege the efficient use of water, particularly through privatization and the protection of productive use. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Terry L. Anderson &amp; P.J. Hill, <i>The Evolution of Property Rights: A Study of the American West</i>, 18 J.L. &amp; Econ. 163, 177-178 (1975). By contrast, others argue that appropriation doctrine was primarily concerned with equity and distributive justice. <i>See, e.g.</i>, David Schorr, <i>The Colorado Doctrine: Water Rights, Corporations and Distributive Justice on the American Frontier</i> (2012). Focusing on the Colorado Supreme Court’s landmark case of <i>Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch</i>, 6 Colo. 443 (1882), David Schorr notes that adopting a riparian regime in the western United States could have fostered monopolies and fueled speculation. In this way, appropriation was subsidiary to a “sufficiency” principle that actually limited use through doctrines such as beneficial use and forfeiture for non-use, to ensure the widespread distribution of water rights. Are economic efficiency and distributional accounts of the rejection of riparianism in the American West necessarily mutually exclusive?</p>

Sometimes, however, more flexibility is desired. In some cases, municipalities create <b>planned unit developments</b> in which the zoning board or its planning staff work to establish overall density requirements and then work directly with developers of a particular area to construct a rational scheme that mixes uses (such as commercial and residential) in a desirable way. The plan is then approved by an administrative zoning board, usually after public hearings with public participation.

Corp. v. Belmont</i>, 778 N.E.2d 1016, 1020 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002). There was no evidence, however, that the town bargained away its police power in this case. The town merely acted on an offer by IDC; its power to approve or reject the proposed zoning amendment remained unencumbered, as did its power to rezone the property in the future if circumstances made it necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, or general welfare to do so.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5808f95-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10580_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10580_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span>&nbsp;Promoting economic development is a proper basis for a town’s exercise of its zoning power.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c580b6b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10609_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10609_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span>&nbsp;Owners who disagree with conditions imposed or sought through a discretionary land use regulatory process may challenge such conditions as unconstitutional “exactions.” For the standards that govern such challenges, see Chapter 15, §6.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c581531b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10741_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10741_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span>&nbsp;As we discussed in <i>Stadsvold</i>, “[t]here are two types of variances: use variances and area variances. ‘A use variance permits a use or development of land other than that prescribed by zoning regulations.’ An area variance controls ‘lot restrictions such as area, height, setback, density and parking requirements.’ ” 754 N.W.2d at 329.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c581531d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10753_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10753_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span>&nbsp;“ ‘Hardship’ as used in connection with the granting of a variance means the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under the conditions allowed by the official controls; the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.” Minn.

Such, under various state and federal methods, may take the form of public construction or some sort of governmental assistance or encouragement to private building. Multi-family rental units, at a high density, or, at most, low cost single-family units on very small lots, are economically necessary and in turn require appropriate local land use regulations.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c581ef9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10943_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10943_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span>&nbsp;While, as the trial court found, Mount Laurel’s actions were deliberate, we are of the view that the identical conclusion follows even when municipal conduct is not shown to be intentional, but the effect is substantially the same as if it were.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c583eb0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DCF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10DCF_ceea1c56-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span>&nbsp;RFRA may still be constitutional as applied to federal statutes and administrative actions. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Hankins v.
