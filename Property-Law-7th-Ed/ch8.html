<p id="c58cc546-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How can the law help coordinate use of different parcels of land? Owners can bring nuisance suits against each other. Governments can impose zoning laws to determine how land can be used. But what if owners want to make private agreements to restrict each other’s uses, or to gain limited use or access rights for themselves? For example, neighbors may want to agree that they will only use their property for residential purposes, or one neighbor may want the right to pass over another’s land to access a public road. More idiosyncratically, an owner using solar power may want to prevent her neighbors from developing their land so as to block sun to her solar panels. <i>Cf. Prah v. Maretti</i>, <i>supra</i>, Chapter 6, §3. Owners can of course enter contracts with each other, but how can they bind future possessors of the land? To do this, they need to create a servitude.</p>
<p id="c58cc547-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <b>servitude</b> is a right or an obligation that “runs with the land,” meaning that it automatically passes to subsequent owners or possessors of the land. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §1.1 (2000). Servitudes are often necessary to enjoy and secure expectations with respect to land. Access to utilities, such as telephone, electricity, and cable service, may depend on granting utility companies rights to run lines over your property and the property of your neighbors. The utilities would not invest in those lines if, when you sold your property, the next owner could simply revoke the agreement. Similarly, the explosion of condominiums and other common interest residential communities depends upon numerous determinations as to how the owners will use their property and contribute to the maintenance of common elements like landscaping and recreation facilities.</p>
<p id="c58cc548-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Servitudes may be either affirmative or negative. <b>Affirmative servitudes</b> are rights to use another’s land for a limited purpose. Affirmative servitudes are usually called <b>easements</b>. The most common kind of easement is the <b>right of way</b>, the right to use another’s land for ingress or egress. Examples include the right of a railroad to run <span title="514" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-514">p. 514</span>tracks over land, or the right of a landowner to cross over neighboring land to access a public road, body of water, or other amenity. Another distinctive form of easement, the <b>profit á prendre</b>, or <b>profit</b>, allows non-owners to collect resources from the land, such as coal, water, or timber.</p>
<p id="c58cc549-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Negative servitudes</b> are restrictions with respect to what owners can do with their own land. Residential property may be subject to servitudes not to use the property for commercial or multifamily purposes; commercial property may be subject to servitudes not to use the property for businesses that compete with the servitude’s beneficiary; undeveloped or agricultural land may be subject to servitudes to keep the land in its undeveloped state. Negative servitudes go by many names — <i>e.g.</i>, negative easements, real covenants, and equitable servitudes — but the modern trend is to call all negative servitudes <b>covenants</b>. Courts originally viewed negative servitudes with suspicion, resulting in significant restrictions on their creation and enforcement. As negative servitudes have become more common, and indeed essential to many modern forms of ownership, these restrictions have eased. A number of traditional restrictions still remain, however, and legislatures are creating new restrictions to deal with new problems.</p>
<p id="c58cc54a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The resulting law of servitudes is confusing. Professor Susan French, the Reporter for the American Law Institute’s <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i>, has called it “the most complex and archaic body of American property law remaining in the twentieth century. Others have described it more colorfully ‘as an unspeakable quagmire,’ ‘confounding intellectual experiences,’ and an area of the law full of ‘rigid categories, silly distinctions, and unreconciled conflicts over basic values.’ ” Susan French, <i>Servitudes Reform and the New Restatement of Property: Creation Doctrines</i></p>

<p id="c58cec65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Affirmative and negative servitudes share some common vocabulary. Land subject to the burden of a servitude is called the <b>burdened</b> or <b>servient</b> estate. If the right to benefit from a servitude automatically passes to the owners of a particular parcel of land, that land is called the <b>benefited</b> or <b>dominant</b> estate. If there is a benefited estate, the servitude is known as an <b>appurtenant</b> servitude. Many servitudes are appurtenant; the right to cross over a parcel of land from another parcel of land, for example, is generally appurtenant, as is the right of one neighbor to prevent certain uses of neighboring land. Servitudes may also be <b>in gross</b>, meaning that the benefit of the servitude is held by a particular individual or entity rather than running with a parcel of land. Servitudes to run utility lines on land, for example, are typically in gross. The utility company that owns the benefit of the servitude may move its headquarters and still enjoy the servitude right.</p>
<p id="c58cec66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both traditional and modern servitude doctrines respond to a common set of problems. Servitudes allocate use and governance rights among owners and non-owners. As such, they can coordinate land use, secure expectations and identity interests in land, encourage investment, and encourage alienation of land. But they may also burden land with useless or outdated restrictions, undermine broader policy goals, or unfairly surprise and undermine expectations of new purchasers of the land. Servitudes may also result in new coordination problems, as holders of the benefit and burden of the servitude disagree as to how the land should be used.</p>
<p id="c58cec67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One can evaluate servitude law according to how successfully it balances these conflicting policy concerns. Do <i>formal</i> requirements for creation of servitudes help ensure that the parties creating the servitude truly intend to bind the land and that future owners have notice of the servitude’s existence? Do <i>rules for interpretation</i> of ambiguous servitudes further the presumed intent of the parties, prevent unfair surprise, and ensure that the land serves public interests? Do <i>substantive</i> restrictions on servitudes ensure that they increase land value and do not undermine other important policy goals? Finally, do rules for <i>termination</i> end servitudes that no longer serve party intent or other interests or that unduly burden the land? As you learn the rules that govern servitudes, consider whether the rules do serve these goals, and whether they do so effectively.</p>

<p id="c58d137c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Easements</b>, or affirmative servitudes, are nonpossessory rights to use another’s land that run with the land. Easements are likely as old as property law itself. Aspects of the English law of easements were borrowed from the laws of ancient Rome. Medieval English agriculture depended on a system of easements through which individuals had rights to grow crops on particular strips of land, but village residents as a whole <span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>had rights to graze their flock on the lands when not under cultivation.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100E7_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100E7_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> Although enclosure of agricultural lands between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries ended this open-field system, the idea of common access rights remained engrained in England, perhaps leading to the extensive public access rights to private lands still seen throughout Great Britain.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F5_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100F5_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span></p>
<p id="c58d137f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early English immigrants to North America brought the system of common pasturage with them; its remnants may be seen in town commons throughout New England. Although common pasturage is not a meaningful feature of modern law, easements for utilities burden virtually all property, and much other land is subject to rights of way allowing others to cross over it, and profits allowing easement holders to collect resources from the land.</p>
<p id="c58d1380-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Easements must be distinguished from <b>leases</b> and <b>licenses</b>. <b>Leases</b>, discussed further in Chapter 11, are possessory rights to use a defined space for all uses not explicitly or implicitly prohibited in the lease. Easements, however, are nonpossessory, meaning that they give the holder only the right to use the land for limited purposes, and the right need not be for a defined space.</p>
<p id="c58d1381-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Licenses</b> are limited rights to enter or use land that do not run with the land and are usually revocable at will by the grantor. Possessors of real property constantly grant non-owners permission to enter their property; you do so every time you invite someone over for dinner. No writing is required to create a license, and many licenses are implied by the circumstances. For example, a store open to the public conveys a clear message that members of the public are invited to enter the property for the purpose of browsing or shopping. Entering a store during business hours would not be deemed a trespass because entry onto the property is based on implied consent. The entry becomes a trespass only when the licensee refuses to leave after being asked to do so. Revocable licenses are not transferable, they cannot be inherited or left by will, and they are not property interests protected by the takings clause of the U.S. Constitution or subject to the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p id="c58d1382-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although licenses may be created without a writing, while easements are subject to the Statute of Frauds, licenses are frequently formalized in writing and courts will recognize oral easements under certain circumstances. And while licenses are generally not transferrable, some licenses, such as movie or theater tickets, may be transferred to others. Finally, although licenses are frequently said to be revocable at will, revocation is limited in a number of circumstances. First, a license granted in return for consideration may become a contract, so that revocation is subject to damages and other contract remedies. Second, a license to enter land and remove personal property purchased by the license holder is a <b>license coupled with an interest</b>, and cannot be revoked for a reasonable time to permit the property to be removed. State and <span title="517" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-517">p. 517</span>federal civil rights law may prohibit revocation of a license to enter property open to the public on the basis of a customer’s race or other prohibited purposes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1011F_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1011F_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> In addition, as discussed in §2.3[A] when a license is granted under circumstances that would make it unfair to revoke it, courts may find it has become an <b>easement by estoppel</b>.</p>
<p id="c58d1384-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other words, the features that are said to distinguish easements from licenses — penalties for revocation, transferability, creation in writing — are often present in licenses as well. The modern trend is to focus on whether the parties intended to create a temporary or permanent right and whether other policy considerations support or forbid creation of the easement; formal differences are important evidence in answering these questions. <i>Paul v. Blakeley</i>, 51 N.W.2d 405, 407 (Iowa 1952); <i>see also</i> Alfred F. Conard, <i>An Analysis of Licenses in Land</i>, 42 Colum. L. Rev. 809, 827-829 (1942).</p>

<p id="c58d3997-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most easements are created by express agreement between the owners of the burdened and benefited land. Sometimes an easement is created by a deed that conveys the easement by itself; an owner, for example, may sell to his neighbor a right of way across the owner’s own land. At other times, the easement is created at the same time a parcel of property burdened or benefited by the easement is sold; for example, the grantor may sell part of her land by a deed reciting that, in addition to granting ownership of the parcel to the grantee, the grantor also conveys to the grantee an easement of passage over the land remaining with the grantor.</p>

<p id="c58d60b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Restrictions held by another on what an owner can do with her land are sometimes called <b>negative easements</b>. Courts traditionally limited the negative easements that could be created by contract to three kinds: (1) the right to lateral support of one’s building, (2) rights to prevent both light and air from being blocked by construction on neighboring land, and (3) the right to prevent interference with the flow of an artificial stream such as an aqueduct. The law of covenants, covered later in this chapter, developed to get around the limitations on negative easements. Negative easement language still appears in modern law, however, particularly in discussions of <b>conservation easements</b> (preventing development of land for environmental purposes), <b>historic preservation easements</b> (preventing destruction or alteration of buildings that have historical or architectural importance), and <b>solar easements</b> (to protect access to sunlight for solar energy). Most of these new easements have been created or recognized by statute. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Alaska Stat. §§34.17.010-34.17.060 (conservation easements). The Uniform Laws Commission chose to label conservation easements “easements” largely because lawyers were comfortable with easements, but a little scared of covenants. Prefatory Note, Uniform Conservation Easement Act of 1981. Because these servitudes are usually authorized by statute, they have properties that differ from both covenants and easements.</p>

Must a future owner of the land allow the easement owner continued access to or control over her land under the terms of the original easement? The second question is whether the <i>benefit</i> runs with the dominant estate. Is the easement owned by the person to whom it was originally granted or by whoever happens to own the parcel of land it was intended to benefit?

<p id="c58d60c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Writing.</b> The required writing is the <i>original</i> writing creating the easement. The writing must be one complying with the Statute of Frauds. Sales literature, for example, will not satisfy this requirement, although it may, as we will see, provide evidence for an easement by implication or estoppel. <i>The easement does not have to be mentioned in subsequent deeds</i>. It is good legal practice, however, to include a specific reference to existing easements when either the dominant or servient estate is transferred.</p>
<p id="c58d60c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Notice.</b> Easements are binding on subsequent owners of the servient estate only if they have notice of them. Three kinds of notice exist. First, if the subsequent owners in fact know about the existence of the easement, they have <b>actual</b> notice. Second, if there are visible signs of use by non-owners, such as telephone poles, above-ground utility lines, or a path across the property, the owner may be put on <b>inquiry</b> notice. This means that a reasonable buyer would do further investigation to discover whether an easement exists. Third, if the deed conveying the easement is recorded in the proper registry of deeds in the proper place, and if a reasonable search of the registry would lead to discovery of the deed, then subsequent owners are deemed to be on <b>constructive</b> notice. This means that, whether they actually knew or did not know about the easement, they <i>should have known</i>.</p>

Intent.</b> Easements bind future owners of the servient estate (or benefit future owners of the dominant estate) only if the grantor intends them to be bound (or benefited). Intent may be clearly stated, as when the deed creating the easement states that the easement “is intended to run with the [benefited and/or burdened] land,” or that the easement passes to the owner’s “heirs and assigns.” If the conveyance is ambiguous as to the grantor’s intent, intent may be inferred from the circumstances. If, for example, the easement is one that is likely to have been intended to be limited to <span title="520" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-520">p. 520</span>the two parties, such as a right given by a landowner to a friend to swim in a pond on her property, courts will typically hold that the benefit is limited to the friend and that it was not intended to bind future owners of the burdened parcel.</p>

The plaintiffs, once the owners of the entire tract, now retain several acres located south of the defendants’ property. The defendants purchased their parcel (the north tract) from the plaintiffs by real estate contract. While they were still paying on that contract, the defendants requested a deed release to a small section of the north tract to allow financing for the construction of a home. The plaintiffs agreed in return for the promise of an easement along the southern 30 feet of the north tract when the defendants eventually obtained title. The express terms of the promised easement were contained in a written agreement which was executed in the form required for the conveyance of an interest in real property. Wash. Rev. Code §64.04.</p>
<p id="c58d87e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs’ development of their land for mobile home occupancy caused tension between the landowners. Apparently some of the occupants of plaintiffs’ mobile home development used the easement as a practice runway for their motorcycles. When the defendants obtained title to the north tract they refused to formally grant the easement as promised. They also placed logs along the southern boundary of the easement to restrict access from the plaintiffs’ property. The plaintiffs brought this action to obtain specific performance of the promise to grant an easement and to enjoin any interference with their use of the easement.</p>

They claimed the easement was not intended to serve the plaintiffs’ entire tract, part of which had been developed as a mobile home site, and which had access by other existing roads.</p>

<p id="c58d87ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was the duty of the court in construing the instrument which created the easement to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. The intention of the parties is determined by a proper construction of the language of the instrument. Where the language is unambiguous other matters may not be considered; but where the language is ambiguous the court may consider the situation of the property and of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances at the time the instrument was executed, and the practical construction of the instrument given by the parties by their conduct or admissions. Simply stated parol evidence may always be used to explain ambiguities in written instruments and to ascertain the intent of the parties.</p>
<p id="c58d87eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pivotal issue in deciding the propriety of admitting parol evidence is whether the written instrument is ambiguous. A written instrument is ambiguous when its terms are uncertain or capable of being understood as having more than one meaning.</p>
<p id="c58d87ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The written instrument promised the easement specifically to the plaintiffs, to “Don Green and Florence B. Green,” and described the easement as “for ingress and egress for road and utilities [purposes].” The designation of named individuals as dominant owners evidences an intent that the easement be personal to the named parties. The grant of an easement for ingress, egress and utilities to the owners of adjacent land is evidence of an intent that the easement benefit the grantees’ adjacent land. We find that the instrument was ambiguous as to whether the easement granted was personal to the plaintiffs or appurtenant to their land. We therefore conclude that parol evidence was properly admitted.</p>
<p id="c58daefd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence and are not assigned as error; they must be considered as verities on appeal. The court’s findings do not, however, support the conclusion that the easement was personal. The court found that the easement was granted for ingress, egress, for road and utilities purposes. As we have noted, the grant of such an easement supports the conclusion that the easement was intended to be an easement appurtenant. In addition, the trial court found “the use of the easement by the plaintiff was <i>to obtain access to the land</i>, retained by plaintiff, for the construction and habitation by plaintiff in a cabin.” (Italics ours.) This finding also supports the conclusion that the easement was intended to benefit plaintiffs’ land.</p>
<p id="c58daefe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s conclusion that the easement was personal to the plaintiffs was erroneous. There is a strong presumption in Washington that easements are appurtenant to some particular tract of land; personal easements, easements in gross, are not <span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-522">p. 522</span>favored. An easement is not in gross when there is anything in the deed or the situation of the property which indicates that it was intended to be appurtenant to land retained or conveyed by the grantor. Viewed in this light, the court’s factual findings mandate the conclusion that the easement was intended to be appurtenant to plaintiffs’ property.</p>
<p id="c58daeff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Easements appurtenant become part of the realty which they benefit. Unless limited by the terms of creation or transfer, appurtenant easements follow possession of the dominant estate through successive transfers. The rule applies even when the dominant estate is subdivided into parcels, with each parcel continuing to enjoy the use of the servient tenement. The terms of the easement promised do not limit its transfer. The easement promised the plaintiffs is appurtenant to their property and assignable to future owners of that property.</p>

<p id="c58daf01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Testimony presented at trial showed that youngsters who now live on the dominant estate use their motorcycles on the easement in a fashion that constitutes a dangerous nuisance which was not considered when the easement was created. This evidence supports the imposition of equitable restrictions on the dominant owners’ use, restrictions which will not unreasonably interfere with that use.</p>
<p id="c58daf02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court enjoined the use of motorcycles on the easement. There is insufficient evidence on the record to assess the impact of a complete ban on motorcycle use on the dominant estate’s owners. Motorcycles are a common means of transportation. On its face, the ban appears to unreasonably interfere with the dominant owners’ use of the easement. Although an equitable solution to the motorcycle problem is necessary, the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a ban on motorcycles without proper consideration of the ban’s effect on the dominant owners’ use of the easement.</p>

<p id="c58daf06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Running of the benefit.</b> Because the court finds the easement to be appurtenant, it can be used by anyone with a legal right to possess any part of the dominant estate — not just the Greens, but the youths with motorcycles residing in the mobile home park the Greens created. Do you think that was the Lupos’ expectation when they agreed to transfer the easement? Why then does the court find that the easement is appurtenant?</p>
<p id="c58daf07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Distinguishing in gross from appurtenant easements.</b> How can you tell whether an easement is in gross or appurtenant? The primary criterion is the <i>intent <span title="523" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-523">p. 523</span>of the grantor</i>. Clear language in the deed conveying the easement that describes it as in gross or appurtenant will ordinarily answer the question — unless surrounding circumstances admissible under the parol evidence rule show that the grantee was misled or otherwise treated unfairly. What in the express language of the agreement between the Greens and the Lupos creates ambiguity about whether the easement was personal or appurtenant?</p>
<p id="c58daf08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the language in the deed is ambiguous, the court must look to surrounding circumstances and to policy considerations. If the easement is one that would be <i>useful</i> separate from ownership of neighboring land, such as a utility easement, the courts are likely to hold that it was intended to be in gross. Since utility easements, such as a right of way for telephone lines, would be useful to the utility company apart from ownership of neighboring property, they are likely to be deemed in gross. If the easement has little or no utility separate from ownership of neighboring land, and is useful to anyone who owns the parcel of land benefited by the easement — such as the right of way in <i>Green v. Lupo</i> — courts are likely to hold that the easement is appurtenant.</p>
<p id="c58daf09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts voice a constructional preference for appurtenant easements. <i>French v. Estate of Gutzan</i>, 128 A.3d 657, 660 (Me. 2015) (discussing Maine’s “strong preference for construing easements as appurtenant”); <i>Kinder v. Wescott</i>, 107 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2015) (“presumption” that easements are appurtenant).<i> But see Deane v. Kahn</i>, 317 Conn. 157, 171-172 (2015) (discussing rebuttable presumption in Connecticut that easements referring only to the grantee and not heirs and assigns are personal not appurtenant). Courts have argued that appurtenant easements are preferable because they limit the number of persons with easements over the land to the number of neighboring parcels. They also argue that because appurtenant easements are limited to owners of neighboring or nearby property while easements in gross can be owned by anyone, easements in gross create more uncertainty about land use rights than appurtenant easements. One can check with the neighbors to see if any appurtenant rights exist, but it is harder to check with the general public to find owners of easements in gross. Can you think of a counterargument to this reasoning?</p>
<p id="c58dd61a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Severability from the land.</b> The courts generally hold that an appurtenant easement cannot be <i>severed</i> from the land. An owner of the dominant estate who sells the land cannot retain the benefit of the servitude while giving up the land; nor can the beneficiary of the easement transfer the benefit of the easement to another while retaining ownership of the dominant estate. Appurtenant easements pass automatically to whomever owns the dominant estate and cannot be severed from ownership of that estate. <i>Cricklewood on the Bellamy Condominium Association v. Cricklewood on the Bellamy Trust,</i> 805 A.2d 427 (N.H. 2002).</p>
<p id="c58dd61b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Transferability of easements.</b> Appurtenant easements are transferable by definition; when the dominant estate is sold or given away, the new owner also owns the appurtenant easement attached to the land. Easements in gross were traditionally not transferable but are generally held to be transferable now, especially if they are commercial in nature, such as utility easements. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §5.8 (2000); <i>Grady v. Narragansett Electric</i> Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. <span title="524" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-524">p. 524</span>2009) (discussing “now-widely-recognized” view that commercial easements are assignable). Profits (rights to enter land to remove material such as minerals or timber) were always presumed to be alienable. If an easement in gross is for personal convenience or enjoyment — for example, a right to swim in a private lake — courts may rule that the grantor did not intend the easement to be transferable to others. Some states retain the older rule, holding that easements in gross are not transferable. <i>King v. Lang</i>, 42 P.3d 698, 702 (Idaho 2002) (easement for fishing to “grantors and their immediate families” was in gross and not transferrable).</p>

The conveying instrument reads:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

To have and to hold said right-of-way and easement unto the said grantee, his heirs and assigns forever.</p>
</div>
<p id="c58dfd3a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>1. The Facts</i></p>
<p id="c58dfd3b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relevant facts are not disputed. The Quill property contains 80 acres. Henry Quill died in 1943. In 1945 the administratrix of his estate sold the property, with <span title="525" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-525">p. 525</span>appurtenances, to Kenneth F. Johnson for $8,600. In 1960 Johnson sold the property to Cox and Detrick for $250,000, $50,000 down, with the balance secured by trust deed and payable over an extended period.</p>
<p id="c58dfd3c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cox and Detrick propose to subdivide their property into parcels of one acre or more, resulting in a minimum of 40 or a maximum of 60 separate parcels. The building on each parcel is to be limited to a residence and a guesthouse. Permanent, as distinguished from seasonal, homes are planned. A commercial development of the property is not contemplated. Zoning will permit the proposed development. An advertising program to sell the individual parcels was commenced. Cox and Detrick anticipate a fully developed subdivision in ten years. The 80 acres are said to be surrounded on two sides by property owned by George Whittel, and on two sides by the property of Glenbrook Company. The Quill Easement is the only existing ingress to and egress from that tract.</p>
<p id="c58dfd3d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The property of Glenbrook Company fronts on Glenbrook Bay, Lake Tahoe. For more than 25 years it has operated a resort business. Its facilities consist of a beach, approximately 30 guest cottages, a tennis court, riding stables, foot paths for hiking, horse trails for riding, a golf course, a post office, a rodeo area, a service station, a bar, and a dining room and lounge at the Glenbrook Inn. The golf course may be used by nonguests upon paying a higher green fee. The bar is open to the public, as is the dining room when not completely reserved by guests. There is no gambling. Glenbrook is operated on a seasonal basis from mid-June through September and is widely known as a beautiful summer vacation resort for families, many of whom return year after year. The atmosphere sought to be maintained is that of peace, seclusion and quiet. The roads through the property are generally unpaved except for the main road from U.S. Highway 50 to the golf course. At the entrance to the main road is a sign stating that permission to pass over is revocable at any time. The main road is the only way in or out from the Glenbrook properties. In years past, from time to time, Glenbrook Company has sold small parcels of its property to individuals. In each instance it has granted the purchaser a right-of-way for ingress and egress.</p>
<p id="c58dfd3e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following rough sketch will, perhaps, be of some assistance.</p>
<p id="c58dfd3f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To get to the Cox and Detrick property one may take either the “golf course road” or the “back road.” Before this action started, the “golf course road” was fenced off. A portion of the “back road” was built in 1936 to provide a way to water tanks which supplied water for the golf course. In the late 1930s it was extended to the Quill (now Cox and Detrick) properties. Glenbrook Company, because of friendship with Quill, supplied the tractor and blade used in so extending the road. The road was, and is, narrow and unpaved. In most places it is wide enough for only one car. Trees, rocks and manzanita generally border it. There is an occasional “turn out.” A worker, who extended the road to the Quill property in the late 1930s, stated that Quill just wanted “a rough road, so that he could go on up with a car.” Cox frankly stated that he would like to use the “back road” if it “were passable,” and that he definitely wanted to widen the road. That road has seldom been used by anyone except the four or five families having homes along its course, and their guests.</p>

<p id="c58e245b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After trial before the court without a jury, judgment was entered declaring that the Quill Easement is limited in three respects: (a) “to such uses as are and will be reasonably consistent with the use to which the servient property is employed, that is, a conservative, family, mountain resort operation, and is further limited, as to reasonable use, to the use contemplated in the original grant to Quill, that is, access to and egress from the entire dominant parcel by a single family in occupancy, and their guests”; (b) “to use of the Glenbrook roads as those roads are presently constructed and maintained, or as the Glenbrook Company by its own action or by mutual agreement with interested parties, may hereafter locate and construct roads in the Glenbrook estate”; and (c) that “The proposed use of the so-called Quill Easement by the defendants herein, that is, the use of the Glenbrook roads by purchasers of subdivided parcels of the former Quill property, would constitute an illegal and unjustified burden and surcharge upon the servient estate.”</p>
<p id="c58e245c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>5. Unwarranted Restrictions</i></p>
<p id="c58e245d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(A) We shall first discuss that portion of the judgment restricting the use to ingress to and egress from the entire dominant parcel “by a single family in occupancy and their guests.” Such a restriction, in our view, destroys the appurtenant character of the easement. Yet, there can be no question but that the Quill Easement was appurtenant to the 80 acre tract then owned by him. The terms of the conveyance, “to have and to hold said right-of-way and easement unto the said grantee, his heirs and assigns <span title="527" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-527">p. 527</span>forever,” make it clear that one who succeeds to the possession of the dominant tenement, succeeds as well to the privileges of use of the servient tenement authorized by the conveyance. Furthermore, those who succeed to the possession of each of the parts into which the dominant tenement may be subdivided, also succeed to such privileges of use, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the conveyance. The Quill conveyance does not contain a restriction that the easement granted is to be appurtenant to the dominant estate only while such estate remains in single possession, and none may be imposed by judicial declaration.</p>
<p id="c58e245e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(B) The judgment further restricts the use of the easement to “use of the Glenbrook roads as those roads are presently constructed and maintained.” We are uncertain as to the precise meaning of this restriction. If such language prohibits the owner of the dominant estate from making any improvements or repairs of the way, it is too restrictive. As a general rule, the owner of an easement may prepare, maintain, improve or repair the way in a manner and to an extent reasonably calculated to promote the purposes for which it was created. The owner may not, however, by such action, cause an undue burden upon the servient estate, nor an unwarranted interference with the independent rights of others who have a similar right of use. The action of Cox and Detrick in leveling or “rough grading” the “back road,” to the extent that it was confined to the area within the exterior borders of the road as they existed when the easement was originally granted, was an improvement reasonably calculated to promote the purposes for which the easement was created. Such leveling or rough grading as so confined, would not, in itself, cause an undue burden upon the servient estate, nor constitute an unwarranted interference with the easement rights of other private property owners.</p>
<p id="c58e245f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, their conduct in attempting to widen the way is another matter. A careful study of the record makes it clear that the ultimate intention of the subdividers is to widen the “back road” in order that two cars going in opposite directions may pass comfortably at all points along its course. The conveying instrument does not specify the width of the way expressly; it does, however, refer to the “roads as now located.” The “back road” as it existed at the time of the grant of easement, was described as a “small road,” and wide enough for just one car. The record does not disclose that the predecessors of Cox and Detrick ever sought or attempted to widen the “back road.” There is no evidence tending to indicate that either Glenbrook Company or Henry Quill contemplated or intended a wider road than existed when the grant was made. When the width is not specified, the conveying instrument must be construed in the light of the facts and circumstances existing at its date and affecting the property, the intention of the parties being the object of inquiry. Indeed, it is sometimes held, as a matter of law, that where the width of a right-of-way is not specified in the grant, it is limited to the width as it existed at the time of the grant. We need not go that far. We believe that the intention of the parties at the time of the grant, when there is evidence to indicate such intention, controls as to width.</p>
<p id="c58e2460-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As already stated, the only evidence in the record with reference to the “back road” indicates that Henry Quill desired a way wide enough for one car; that such was the character of the “back road” at that time, with occasional “turn outs.” We must conclude, <span title="528" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-528">p. 528</span>therefore, that such was the parties’ intention in 1938 when the grant was made. If the width of the way is what the lower court had in mind when it restricted the easement to “use of the Glenbrook roads as those roads are presently constructed and maintained” (the record revealing no substantial change from 1938 to time of trial, except for the work of Cox and Detrick before mentioned), then we find ourselves in accord.</p>
<p id="c58e2461-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>7. Area Wherein Judgment Is Premature</i></p>
<p id="c58e2462-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment entered also declared that the proposed use of the Quill Easement would constitute an illegal burden and surcharge upon the servient estate. The announced intention by the owners of the dominant estate as to their proposed future use of the easement does not, of itself, constitute an unreasonable burden upon the servient estate. When the facts concerning that use become known, an unreasonable burden upon the servient estate may, or may not result. That determination must await the presentation of evidence then in existence.</p>
<p id="c58e2463-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our judgment the lower court erred in declaring that the proposed use of the Quill Easement would constitute an unreasonable burden upon the servient estate, in the absence of existing evidence. It should have done no more than to announce, in general terms, the applicable legal principle within which a subsequent factual determination could be made if occasion therefore arises.</p>
<p id="c58e2464-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>10. Conclusions</i></p>
<p id="c58e2465-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the foregoing it is apparent that the parties seek a declaration of rights in the following respects:</p>
<p id="c58e2466-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>First:</i> The privilege of use of the Glenbrook roads as located on January 7, 1938 (the date of the grant of easement) is not restricted by the terms of the grant, and is appurtenant to the dominant estate, and may be enjoyed by those who succeed to the possession of the dominant estate in its entirety or by those who succeed to the possession of the parts into which such estate may be subdivided.</p>
<p id="c58e2467-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Second:</i> The owners of the easement may maintain, repair and improve the way in a manner reasonably calculated to promote the purposes for which the easement was created, provided, however, (a) such maintenance, repair or improvement is confined to the area within the exterior borders of the way as it existed on January 7, 1938 (the date of the grant of easement); (b) that such maintenance, repair, or improvement will not cause an undue burden upon the servient estate; (c) that such maintenance, repair or improvement will not cause an unwarranted interference with the independent rights of others who have a similar right of use.</p>
<p id="c58e2468-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Third:</i> The owners of the easement may not widen the way, its width being limited, by reason of the evidence introduced, to the width of the way on January 7, 1938 (the date of the grant of easement); and, insofar as the portion of the way herein referred to as the “back road” is concerned, that width is sufficient only for one car with occasioned “turn outs.”</p>
<p id="c58e2469-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fourth:</i> The owner of the servient estate has the right to relocate the way at its own expense, which right includes the right to barricade that portion of the existing way herein referred to as the “golf course road.”</p>
<p id="c58e4b7a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="529" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-529">p. 529</span><i>Fifth:</i> The owners of the easement may not, by reason of their proposed subdivision development, or otherwise, cause an undue burden upon the servient estate, or an unwarranted interference with the independent rights of others who have a similar right of use. Whether such a burden or interference will occur cannot be conclusively declared upon existing evidence. In the event the owners of the easement proceed with their announced plan, their use of the way is limited to the extent herein noted. We believe it proper, however, at this time, to note that, should they proceed with their proposed plan, the trier of the facts in subsequent litigation, if it occurs, might or might not determine upon evidence then existing, that their use of the way causes an unreasonable burden upon the servient estate or an unwarranted interference with the independent rights of others who have a similar right of use; hence, any further action on their part to develop their property in the manner proposed is subject to such contingency.</p>

In July, 1922 and August, 1922, respectively, the trustees conveyed an easement to Southwestern Bell Telephone Company to “construct, reconstruct, repair, operate and maintain its lines for telephone and electric light purposes” and similarly to Union Electric to “keep, operate and maintain its lines consisting of cables, manholes, wires, fixtures and appurtenances thereto.” Subsequently, in 1981 and 1982, defendant [Continental Cablevision of St. Louis County, Inc.] exercised licenses acquired from both utilities to enter upon these easements, and erected cables, wires and conduits for the purpose of transmitting television programs.</p>

<p id="c58e4b82-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties agree that the subject easements are easements in gross, <i>i.e</i>., easements which belong to the owner independently of his ownership or possession of other land, and thus lacking a dominant tenement.

Conversely, if the rights granted are exclusive of the servient owners’ participation therein, divided utilization of the rights granted are presumptively allowable. This principle stems from the concept that one who grants to another the right to use the grantor’s land in a particular manner for a specified purpose but who retains no interest in exercising a similar right himself, sustains no loss if, within the specifications expressed in the grant, the use is shared by the grantee with others. On the other hand, if the grantor intends to participate in the use or privilege granted, then his retained right may be diminished if the grantee shares his right with others. Thus, insofar as it relates to the apportionability of an easement in gross, the term “exclusive” refers to the exclusion of the owner and possessor of the servient tenement from participation in the rights granted, not to the number of different easements in and over the same land.</p>
<p id="c58e4b84-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, there is no claim that plaintiffs’ predecessors had at the time the easements were granted, any intention to seek authority for, or any interest whatsoever in using the five foot strips for the construction and maintenance of either an electric power system or telephone and telegraphic service. Moreover, at no time during the ensuing sixty-three years have the trustees been authorized to furnish such services by any certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Public Service Commission pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. §§392.260 and 393.170 (1978). Accordingly, the easements granted to Southwestern Bell and Union Electric were exclusive as to the grantors thereof and therefore apportionable.</p>
<p id="c58e4b85-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs also argue defendant could acquire no rights from the utilities since their easements did not mention television cables, and that the cable attachments themselves constituted an extra burden on the property. We disagree. The owner of an easement may license or authorize third persons to use its right of way for purposes not inconsistent with the principal use granted. The 1922 easements granted to Union Electric expressly provided the right of ingress and egress by Union Electric, its successors and assigns, to “add to the number of and relocate all wires, cables, conduits, manholes, adding thereto from time-to-time.” Similarly, the easement conveyed to Southwestern Bell expressly contemplated the construction and maintenance of “all poles, cables, wires, conduits, lateral pipes, anchor guys and all other fixtures and appurtenances deemed necessary at anytime by [Southwestern Bell], its successors and assigns.” It can hardly be said that the addition of a single coaxial cable to the existing poles for the purpose of transmitting television images and sound by electric impulse increases the burden on the servient tenement beyond the scope of the intended and authorized use.</p>
<p id="c58e4b86-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this is a case of first impression in Missouri, courts in other jurisdictions have addressed the legal effect of adding coaxial cables for television transmission to existing electric and telephone poles erected on easements without the consent of the owners of the fees. These courts have uniformly rejected arguments identical to those made by plaintiffs herein and have reached a conclusion similar to ours.</p>
<p id="c58e4b87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Jolliff v. Hardin Cable Television Co</i>., 269 N.E.2d 588 (Ohio 1971), an easement granted to a power company for the transmission of electric power, including telegraph or telephone wires, was held to be an apportionable easement in gross by reason <span title="531" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-531">p. 531</span>of the express language of the conveyance authorizing the grantee to lease some portion of its interest to third parties. In addressing the question of an additional burden on the servient tenements, the court noted that the attachment of a television coaxial cable to existing poles constituted no more of a burden than would installation of telephone wires, a burden clearly contemplated at the time of the grants.</p>
<p id="c58e4b88-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Crowley v. New York Telephone Company</i>, 363 N.Y.S.2d 292 (Dist. Ct. 1975) it was held that the failure to make specific mention of cable television in a 1949 easement to locate telephone poles and wires on plaintiff’s property could not be so narrowly interpreted as to prohibit the addition of television cables to the telephone poles. “Just as we must accept scientific advances, we must translate the rights of parties to an agreement in the light of such developments.” 363 N.Y.S.2d at 294.</p>
<p id="c58e7299-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hoffman v. Capitol Cablevision System, Inc.</i>, 383 N.Y.S.2d 674 (App. Div. 1976), the court concluded that the rights granted to two utilities were exclusive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the landowner, and were, therefore apportionable by the grantees. The addition of cable and equipment to already existing poles was held to constitute no additional burden since the defendant was doing only what the utilities were enabled to do. The court noted the general rule that easements in gross for commercial purposes are particularly alienable and transferable. For these reasons, the court held the failure to foresee and specifically refer to cable television in the grant was of no consequence.</p>
<p id="c58e729a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasoning of the <i>Hoffman</i> court has recently been found persuasive by the California court in <i>Salvaty v. Falcon Cable Television</i>, 212 Cal. Rptr. 31 (Ct. App. 1985). The court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c58e729b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bench, the addition of cable television equipment on surplus space on the telephone pole was within the scope of the easement. Although the cable television industry did not exist at the time the easement was granted, it is part of the natural evolution of communications technology. Installation of the equipment was consistent with the primary goal of the easement, to provide for wire transmission of power and communication. We fail to see how the addition of cable equipment to a pre-existing utility pole materially increased the burden on appellant’s property. 212 Cal. Rptr. at 34-35.</p>
</div>
<p id="c58e729c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unsurprising fact that the drafters of the 1922 easements did not envision cable television does not mandate the narrow interpretation of the purposes of the conveyance of rights and privileges urged by plaintiffs. The expressed intention of the predecessors of plaintiff trustees was to obtain for the homeowners in the subdivision the benefits of electric power and telephonic communications. Scientific and technological progress over the ensuing years have added an unforeseen dimension to such contemplated benefits, the transmission by electric impulse of visual and audio communication over coaxial cable. It is an inescapable conclusion that the intention of plaintiffs’ predecessors was the acquisition and continued maintenance of available means of bringing electrical power and communication into the homes of the subdivision. Clearly, it is in the public interest to use the facilities already installed for the purpose of carrying out this intention to provide the most economically feasible and least environmentally damaging vehicle for installing cable systems.</p>

<p id="c58e729f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Scope.</b> Three issues arise in determining whether the owner of an easement is misusing it by going beyond the scope of activities contemplated by the grantor: (a) whether the use is of a <i>kind</i> contemplated by the grantor, (b) whether the use is so heavy that it constitutes an <i>unreasonable burden</i> on the servient estate not contemplated by the grantor, and (c) whether the easement can be <i>subdivided</i>.</p>
<p id="c58e72a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Kinds of uses encompassed by the easement.</b> Conflicts over use may concern what kinds of activities are encompassed by the easement. For example, can a general right of way initially used for road purposes be used to place utility lines? Many courts hold that a general right of way may be used for any reasonable purpose. <i>Weeks v. Wolf Creek Industries, Inc.</i>, 941 So. 2d 263, 270 (Ala. 2006); <i>Cannata v. Berkshires Natural Resources Council</i>, 901 N.E.2d 1250, 1255 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009).</p>
<p id="c58e72a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, as in <i>Henley</i>, the easement is for a particular purpose, the question is whether the use is reasonably included within that purpose. Absent clear evidence of the parties’ intent, most courts will find that the manner of use of an easement may “change over time to take advantage of developments in technology and to accommodate normal development of the dominant estate or enterprise benefited by the servitude,” so long as it does not unreasonably burden the servient estate. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §4.10. Thus most courts will agree with <i>Henley</i> that an easement for electric and telephone purposes can be used for cable transmission. More recent decisions have reached similar results with respect to use of telephone and electricity easements for wireless telephone equipment and fiber optic cable. <i>See Zhang v. Omnipoint Communication Enterprises</i>, 866 A.2d 588 (Conn. 2005); <i>Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia v. Gold-Arrow Farms, Inc.</i>, 625 S.E.2d 57 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005). The Texas Supreme Court in <i>Marcus Cable Associates v. Krohn</i>, 90 S.W.3d 697, 699 (Tex. 2002), however, found that an easement for “an electric transmission or distribution line or system” did not allow the holder to install cable television lines. Courts have also differed on whether a utility easement acquired by prescription, which is fixed by the prescriptive use, may be used for cable purposes. <i>Compare Heydon v. MediaOne</i>, 739 N.W.2d 373 (Mich. Ct. App. 2007) (yes) <i>with Jackson v. City of Auburn</i>, 971 So. 2d 696 (Ala. Civ. App. 2006) (no).</p>
<p id="c58e72a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Grantors retain whatever rights they do not give away, but the question is <i>what</i> rights the grantor gave away when it granted the initial easement. Should easements be interpreted broadly or narrowly? Should the owner of a general right of way who acquired the easement initially for road purposes be allowed to use the road for other purposes such as phone or electric utility lines? What result is most likely to effectuate the intent of the parties? What result is more likely to promote the alienability of property? Should alienability of property be the preeminent goal? If not, what should be? Note that had the easement not been found to include cable with <i>Henley</i>, Cablevision would have to negotiate with and compensate University Park rather than the utility companies in order to run its cable lines. Is anything wrong with that result?</p>

<p id="c58e99b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Rails to Trails Litigation</b></p>
<p id="c58e99b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, railroads built tracks across the country with rights of way from state and federal grants and eminent domain. As rail traffic decreased after the 1960s, railroads began to shut down their lines. To protect the federal interest in the rights of way, the <i>Rails-to-Trails Act</i> authorized the rights of way to be converted into public trails. Thousands of miles of trails have been created under the program. But many owners of the land around the tracks have claimed that the conversion takes their interests in the property. These cases involve several questions of interpretation. First, is the right of way a grant of land itself or just of an easement to use the land? If the grant creating the right of way conveyed the land itself, there is no basis for neighboring landowners to challenge the conversion. But if it is an easement, a second question arises: has the railroad abandoned the right of way, so that it reverts to the servient landowner? Third, if the easement is not abandoned, can it be used as a recreational trail, or only for railroad purposes? Finally, even if a trail is within the scope of the easement, does its use unduly burden the servient estate? The resolution of these questions often turns on the specific language and history of the right of way at issue. <i>See, e.g., Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States</i>, 134 S. Ct. 1257 (2014) (right of way was easement and was terminated by abandonment); <i>Chevy Chase Land Co. v. United States</i>, 733 A.2d 1055 (Md. 1999) (right of way was an easement, but it could be converted to trail, and would not unduly burden servient estate); <i>Lawson v. State</i>, 730 P.3d 1308 (Wash. 1986) (easement was for railroad purposes only; conversion to trail constituted abandonment).</p>

Unreasonable additional burden.</b> The owner of an easement may be clearly engaged in the kind of activity contemplated by the easement but the degree or intensity of use may still constitute an unreasonable burden. For example, the court in <i>Green v. Lupo</i>, although allowing motorcycle use over the road, stated that such use could be limited and regulated to protect the legitimate interests of the owner of the servient estate. Similarly, the court in <i>Cox</i> required the trial court to determine whether subdivision of the dominant estate would impose an unreasonable additional burden on the servient estate.</p>
<p id="c58e99b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the grantor’s intent is ambiguous with respect to the changed use, courts must balance the interests of the easement owner in freedom to develop his property against the interests of the servient estate owners in security from having their property overly burdened in a way they should not have had to anticipate. <i>Compare Peterson v. Town of Oxford</i>, 459 A.2d 100 (Conn. 1983) (use of drainage easement for subdivision so that water from brook overflowed and eroded servient estate was unreasonable burden), <i>and Bassett v. Harrison</i>, 807 A.2d 695 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2002) (use of general right of way to haul sand and gravel was unreasonable burden),<i> and Davis v. Bruk</i>, 411 A.2d 660 (Me. 1980) (paving a country road would cause unreasonable burden by increasing speed and safety issue with cars near defendant’s home), <i>with Hayes v. Aquia Marina, Inc.</i>, 414 S.E.2d 820 (Va. 1992) (expanding marina on dominant estate from 84 to 230 boat slips and paving road to the marina would not unreasonably burden servient estate).</p>
<p id="c58e99b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Divisibility.</b> The question of divisibility of appurtenant easements generally arises when the owner of the dominant estate subdivides the property and attempts to transfer to new owners rights to use the easement to obtain access to their property. Most courts hold that “the benefits of an appurtenant easement move to each portion of the dominant parcel upon its subdivision and transfer of the various pieces.” Gerald Korngold, <i>Private Land Use Arrangements: Easements, Real Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes</i> §5.05, at 213 (2d ed. 2004).

<p id="c58e99be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Restatement of Property</i> §488 cmt. c (1944). The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> maintains this rule, §§4.6 &amp; 5.9, but elsewhere suggests that using an easement over a 20-foot dirt road initially established between two farms for a 100-unit subdivision later built on the dominant estate would constitute an unreasonable burden on the servient estate. §4.10, illus. 26. Are these positions consistent?</p>
<p id="c58e99bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Apportionability.</b> With easements in gross, the question of divisibility of the easement is referred to as the issue of <b>apportionability</b>. When an easement in gross is <b>nonexclusive</b> — meaning the grantor, or owner of the servient estate, has reserved for herself the right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee — the easement is generally held to be nonapportionable; the grantor herself could sell further rights to others so long as those new easements did not interfere with the use of the existing easement by the first grantee. The courts presume that under these circumstances, the <span title="535" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-535">p. 535</span>grantor would want to retain the right to obtain the economic benefits of any future easements. When, however, the easement is <b>exclusive</b> — meaning the grantor has no right to use the easement in conjunction with the grantee — the easement is generally held to be apportionable. Since the grantor has no right to grant other easements, the grantee is not interfering with any rights the grantor might have to sell or lease use of the easement to others.</p>
<p id="c58e99c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> provides instead that easements in gross can be divided unless this is contrary to the intent of the parties who created the easement or “unless the division unreasonably increases the burden on the servient estate.” <i>Id.</i> §5.9. This appears to be consistent with the trend in the law, which is to answer the question by reference to the intent of the grantor. William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §8.11, at 465 (3d ed. 2000).</p>
<p id="c58e99c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Width of the road.</b> The court in <i>Cox</i> concludes that the grantor intended to allow the dominant estate to be subdivided but that the road was intended to be limited to a one-car width with existing “turn-abouts.” Is this consistent? It is unlikely to be practicable to subdivide the dominant estate <i>unless</i> the easement is widened to at least two lanes. If the owner of the dominant estate has the right to subdivide his land, and each of his grantees will have a right to use the easement (so long as this collective use does not constitute an unreasonable additional burden on the servient estate), how can it be that the dominant estate owner has no right to a wider road? If the grantor could contemplate that the dominant estate would be subdivided, wouldn’t the grantor also be able to foresee and contemplate the need for a wider road? How would Justice Thompson answer this question?</p>
<p id="c58ec0d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. Changing location of the easement.</b> Can the owner of the servient estate change the location of the easement? The traditional rule prevents this; the owner of the servient estate must obtain the consent of the easement holder to relocate it. <i>Herren v. Pettengill,</i> 538 S.E.2d 735 (Ga. 2000); <i>Koeppen v. Bolich,</i> 79 P.3d 1100 (Mont. 2003). However, some recent cases and the <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §4.8(3) (2000), allow the owner of the servient “reasonable changes in the location or dimensions of an easement, at the servient owner’s expense, to permit normal use or development of the servient estate, but only if the changes do not (a) significantly lessen the utility of the easement, (b) increase the burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and enjoyment, or (c) frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created,” <i>id.</i> §4.8(3); <i>see M.P.M. Builders, LLC v. Dwyer</i>, 809 N.E.2d 1053 (Mass. 2004). Several courts have adopted middle positions. One court allowed the servient estate owner to relocate the easement so long as damages were paid to the dominant estate owner, <i>Umphres v. J.R. Mayer Enterprises, Inc.</i>, 889 S.W.2d 86 (Mo. Ct. App. 1994), while another allowed relocation only after finding that relocation would not harm the easement owner, <i>Roaring Fork Club L.P. v. St. Jude’s Co.</i>, 36 P.3d 1229 (Colo. 2001). Other courts have rejected the <i>Restatement (Third)</i>’s position, calling it “a threat to the certainty of property rights and real estate transactions, as a catalyst for increased litigation, and as a means for purchasers of servient estates to reap a windfall at the expense of owners of dominant estates.” <i>AKG Real Estate, LLC v. <span title="536" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-536">p. 536</span>Kosterman</i>, 717 N.W.2d 835, 842 (Wis. 2006); <i>see Cottonwood Duplexes, LLC v. Barlow</i>, 149 Cal. Rptr. 3d 235 (Ct. App. 2012) (court could not reduce scope of easement from 60 feet to 15 feet although size of existing easement was not necessary for its purposes and inhibited development). What do you think?</p>
<p id="c58ec0d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>8. Extension of the use.</b> What if the easement holder wants to use the easement to obtain access to the dominant estate but also to reach a subsequently acquired lot on the other side of the dominant estate? The rule in most jurisdictions prohibits this extension of the use absent contrary evidence of the intent of the parties. <i>See Christensen v. City of Pocatello</i>, 124 P.3d 1008 (Idaho 2005); <i>Bateman v. Board of Appeals of Georgetown</i>, 775 N.E.2d 1276 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002). In adopting this rule, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> comments that it “reflects the likely intent of the parties by setting an outer limit on the potential increase in use of an easement brought about by normal development of the dominant estate,” and “avoids otherwise difficult litigation over the question whether increased use unreasonably increases the burden on the servient estate.” <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §4.11 cmt. b. Should the rule be waived if the easement holder can prove it will cause no additional burden? <i>Cf. Brown v. Voss</i>, 715 P.2d 514 (Wash. 1986) (denying an injunction where the defendant sought to use the easement for a single-family house on the combined parcel).</p>

<p id="c58ee7f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purposes of Statutes of Frauds are to protect individuals from fraudulent claims that they made oral promises, or false claims about the essentials of those <span title="537" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-537">p. 537</span>promises. As applied to property, Statutes of Frauds also help protect later purchasers from unexpected claims regarding their land. When an oral promise has been made, however, the refusal to enforce it because it was not in writing effectively allows the promisor to perpetrate a fraud. Insisting on a writing may also violate expectations created in other ways. Courts have therefore recognized at least four ways in which easements may be created without being described in a writing complying with the Statute of Frauds.</p>

<p id="c58f0f0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of this property rights controversy began before Colorado’s statehood, at a time when southern Colorado was part of Mexico; at a time when all of the parties’ lands were part of the one million acre Sangre de Cristo grant, an 1844 Mexican land grant. Here, we determine access rights of the owners of farmlands in Costilla County to a mountainous parcel of land now known as the Taylor Ranch. As successors in title to the original settlers in the region, the landowners exercised rights to enter and use the Taylor Ranch property for over one hundred years until Jack Taylor fenced the land in 1960 and forcibly excluded them. These rights, they assert, derive from Mexican law . . . and an express or implied grant, and were impermissibly denied when the mountain land was fenced.</p>
<p id="c58f0f0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1844, the governor of New Mexico granted two Mexican nationals a one million-acre land grant, located mainly in present-day southern Colorado (Sangre de Cristo <span title="538" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-538">p. 538</span>grant), for the purpose of settlement. The original grantees died during the war between the United States and Mexico. The land was not settled in earnest until after the cessation of the war, and Charles (Carlos) Beaubien then owned the grant.</p>
<p id="c58f0f0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1848, the United States and Mexico entered into the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the war between the two countries. <i>Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Limits, and Settlement (Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo)</i>, February 2, 1848, U.S.-Mex., 9 Stat. 922. Pursuant to the treaty, Mexico ceded land to the United States, including all of California, Nevada, and Utah; most of New Mexico and Arizona; and a portion of Colorado. The United States agreed to honor the existing property rights in the ceded territory. Congress confirmed Carlos Beaubien’s claim to the Sangre de Cristo grant in the 1860 Act of Confirmation. 12 Stat. 71 (1860).</p>
<p id="c58f0f10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the early 1850s, Beaubien successfully recruited farm families to settle the Colorado portion of the Sangre de Cristo grant. He leased a portion of his land to the United States government to be used to establish Fort Massachusetts and recruited farmers to settle other areas. The settlement system he employed was common to Spain and Mexico: strips of arable land called vara strips were allotted to families for farming, and areas not open for cultivation were available for common use. These common areas were used for grazing and recreation and as a source for timber, firewood, fish, and game.</p>
<p id="c58f0f11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1863, Beaubien gave established settlers deeds to their vara strips. That same year, Beaubien executed and recorded a Spanish language document that purports to grant rights of access to common lands to settlers on the Sangre de Cristo grant (Beaubien Document). In relevant part, this document guarantees that “all the inhabitants will have enjoyment of benefits of pastures, water, firewood and timber, always taking care that one does not injure another.”</p>
<p id="c58f0f12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A year later, Beaubien died. Pursuant to a prior oral agreement, his heirs sold his interest in the Sangre de Cristo grant to William Gilpin, who was Colorado’s first territorial governor. The sales agreement (Gilpin agreement) stated that Gilpin agreed to provide vara strip deeds to settlers who had not yet received them. The agreement further stated that Gilpin took the land on condition that certain “settlement rights before then conceded . . . to the residents of the settlements . . . shall be confirmed by said William Gilpin as made by him.”</p>
<p id="c58f0f13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1960, Jack Taylor, a North Carolina lumberman, purchased roughly 77,000 acres of the Sangre de Cristo grant (mountain tract) from a successor in interest to William Gilpin. Taylor’s deed indicated that he took the land subject to “claims of the local people by prescription or otherwise to right to pasture, wood, and lumber and so-called settlement rights in, to, and upon said land.”</p>
<p id="c58f0f14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the language in Taylor’s deed, he denied the local landowners access to his land and began to fence the property. The current case began in 1981. In that year a number of local landowners filed suit in Costilla County District Court. The landowners asserted that they had settlement rights to the Taylor Ranch and that Taylor had impermissibly denied those rights.</p>
<p id="c58f0f15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the trial, the court made a finding of fact that the landowners or their predecessors in title had “grazed cattle and sheep, harvested timber, gathered firewood, <span title="539" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-539">p. 539</span>fished, hunted and recreated on the land of the defendant from the 1800s to the date the land was acquired by the defendant, in 1960.” The trial court further found that the community referred to Taylor Ranch as “open range,” and that prior to 1960, the landowners “were never denied access to the land.” The court also stated that it did “not dispute” that the settlers could not have survived without use of the mountain area of the grant. Despite these findings, the court determined that the landowners had [no rights in the Taylor Ranch.] The court of appeals affirmed.</p>
<p id="c58f0f16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties, at various points in the voluminous briefing of this twenty-one year-old litigation, agree that the rights at issue are most appropriately characterized as profits á prendre. A profit á prendre — in modern parlance, a profit — “is an easement that confers the right to enter and remove timber, minerals, oil, gas, game, or other substances from land in the possession of another.” <i>Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes</i> §1.2(2) (1998) [hereinafter Restatement]. Thus, a profit is a type of easement.</p>
<p id="c58f0f17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An easement can be in gross or appurtenant. An easement in gross does not belong to an individual by virtue of her ownership of land, but rather is a personal right to use another’s property. An easement appurtenant, on the other hand, runs with the land. It is meant to benefit the property, or an owner by virtue of her property ownership. An easement is presumed to be appurtenant, rather than in gross.</p>
<p id="c58f0f18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the landowners allege that the settlement rights were to be used in connection with their land. They argue that the firewood was used to heat their homes, the timber to frame their adobe houses, and the grazing necessary to the viability of their farms. The landowners also assert that the settlement rights were granted to their predecessors in title by virtue of their interest in their vara strips and were in fact a necessary incentive for settlement in the area.</p>
<p id="c58f3629-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the rights the landowners are claiming are best characterized as easements appurtenant to the land. We reach this conclusion from the evidence that under Mexican custom access to common land was given to surrounding landowners, the evidence that this access was used to benefit the use of the land, and the presumption in favor of appurtenant easements.</p>
<p id="c58f362a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B. Sources of the Rights</i></p>
<p id="c58f362b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landowners argue that their settlement rights stem from three sources: Mexican law, prescription, and an express or implied grant from Beaubien.</p>
<p id="c58f362c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regarding the Mexican law claim, the landowners claim that community rights to common lands not only are recognized by Mexican law, but also are integral to the settlement of an area. The landowners further point out that in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States government agreed that the land rights of the residents of the ceded territories would be “inviolably respected.”</p>
<p id="c58f362d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> [T]he landowners cannot claim rights under Mexican law. Their predecessors in title did not settle on the Sangre de Cristo grant until after the land was ceded to the United States and thus their use rights developed under United States law. Mexican land use and property law are highly relevant in this case in ascertaining the intentions of the parties involved, see <i>infra.</i> However, because the settlement of the grant <span title="540" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-540">p. 540</span>occurred after the land was ceded to the United States, we conclude that Mexican law cannot be a source of the landowners’ claims.</p>
<p id="c58f362e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As evidence of a grant of rights from Carlos Beaubien, the landowners rely primarily on the Beaubien Document. The document was written by Beaubien in 1863, one year before his death.</p>

However, we find that the document, when taken together with the other unique facts of this case, establishes a prescriptive easement, an easement by estoppel, and an easement from prior use.</p>
<p id="c58f3634-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court can imply an easement created by estoppel when 1) the owner of the servient estate “permitted another to use that land under circumstances in which it was reasonable to foresee that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked,” 2) the user substantially changed position in reasonable reliance on that belief, and 3) injustice can be avoided only by establishment of a servitude. Whether reliance is justified depends upon the nature of the transaction, including the sophistication of the parties.</p>
<p id="c58f3635-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An easement implied from prior use is created when 1) the servient and dominant estates were once under common ownership, 2) the rights alleged were exercised prior to the severance of the estate, 3) the use was not merely temporary, 4) the continuation of this use was reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the parcel, and 5) a contrary intention is neither expressed nor implied. The rationale for this servitude is as follows:</p>

<p id="c58f3636-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule stated in this section is not based solely on the presumed actual intent of the parties. It furthers the policy of protecting reasonable expectations, as well as actual intent, of parties to land transactions. Restatement, <i>supra,</i> §2.12 cmt. a.</p>
</div>
<p id="c58f3637-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he court of appeals in this case rejected the land-owners’ claims of an implied easement [finding] that, although easements in the form of access rights could be implied, easements in the form of profits could not. Although this court has not <span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-541">p. 541</span>addressed implied profits for over thirty-five years, there is a modern trend to apply the same rules to easements of access and to profits.</p>
<p id="c58f5d48-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Restatement explains that, although some profits such as mineral and water rights have specific rules, generally as between easements in the form of access rights and easements in the form of profits, “there are no doctrinal differences between them.” Restatement, <i>supra</i>, §1.2 reporter’s note. Easements and profits are treated equally because the same public policy and practical considerations that underlie implied rights of access also underlie implied profits. A recognition that parties do not always comply with strict rules of express conveyance, a desire to effectuate the intent of the parties, and the aim of fairness apply equally to easements and profits.</p>
<p id="c58f5d49-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>i. Prescriptive Easement</i></p>
<p id="c58f5d4a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because Taylor’s deed indicates that Taylor’s ownership of the land is subject to the landowners’ prescriptive rights, we begin with an application of the law of prescriptive easements. [The court found that the plaintiffs had established a prescriptive easement under the theory that a continuous use under an intended but ineffective grant is adverse. Easements by prescription are discussed more fully in Chapter 5, §3.]</p>
<p id="c58f5d4b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>ii. Easement by Estoppel</i></p>
<p id="c58f5d4c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landowners have . . . established every element of an easement by estoppel. First, Taylor’s predecessors in title “permitted [the settlers] to use [the] land under circumstances in which it was reasonable to foresee that the [settlers] would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked.” <i>Restatement</i>, <i>supra</i>, §2.10. The settlers’ reliance was reasonable because rights were expected, intended, and necessary. It was expected because of the Mexican settlement system discussed above. Also discussed above, this settlement system, combined with the actual practices and the deeds associated with the Taylor Ranch, show that rights were intended.</p>
<p id="c58f5d4d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rights were also necessary. The plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Marianne Stoller, testified that access to wood was necessary to heat homes, access to timber was necessary to build homes, and access to grazing was necessary for maintaining livestock.</p>
<p id="c58f5d4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second element, that the user substantially change position in reasonable reliance on the belief, is easily found. The landowners’ predecessors in title settled Beaubien’s grant for him. They moved onto the land and established permanent farms.</p>
<p id="c58f5d4f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third element, the avoidance of injustice, is also undeniably present. The original Sangre de Cristo grant was given on the condition that it be settled. Indeed, under Mexican law, the grant would have been revoked if settlement did not succeed. The settlers, then, fulfilled the condition of the grant that made Beaubien fee owner of one million acres of land.</p>
<p id="c58f5d50-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beaubien attracted settlers to the area by convincing them that he would provide them with the rights they needed for survival. Beaubien knew that families would rely on his promises and leave their homes to travel hundreds of miles on foot or horseback to establish new homes.</p>
<p id="c58f5d51-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-542">p. 542</span>A condition of the conveyance of Beaubien’s land, from Gilpin down to Taylor, was that the owner honor these rights. Although these promised rights were exercised for over one hundred years, although these rights were necessary to the settlers’ very existence, and although Taylor had ample notice of these rights, Taylor fenced his land over forty years ago. It is an understatement to say that this is an injustice.</p>
<p id="c58f5d52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landowners have established each element of an easement by estoppel.</p>

<p id="c58f8464-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, every element of an easement from prior use has been shown. First, both Taylor’s and the landowners’ lands were originally under the common ownership of Beaubien who owned the entire Sangre de Cristo grant before settlement.</p>
<p id="c58f8465-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the rights were exercised prior to the severance of the estate. As discussed above, many of the rights the landowners claim were needed and expected for life in the San Luis Valley. This necessity existed from the first days of settlement — indicating that these rights were exercised prior to severance of title.</p>
<p id="c58f8466-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third and fourth prongs — that the use was not merely temporary and is reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the land — are also easily established. The trial court’s findings of fact establish that the rights were exercised from the time of settlement until Taylor came on the scene. Moreover, as discussed above, the rights were reasonably necessary.</p>
<p id="c58f8467-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lastly, no contrary intention is expressed or implied; thus, the fifth element is present. Custom, expectation, practice, and language in the documents and deeds surrounding the Taylor ranch property indicate not only that a contrary intention did not exist, but that the parties affirmatively intended for these rights to exist.</p>
<p id="c58f8468-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All five elements of an easement from prior use have been established.</p>

We imply the rights memorialized in the Beaubien Document. Accordingly, we hold that the landowners have implied rights in Taylor’s land for the access detailed in the Beaubien Document — pasture, firewood, and timber. These easements should be limited to reasonable use — the grazing access is limited to a reasonable number of livestock given the size of the vara strips; the firewood limited to that needed for each residence; and the timber limited to that needed to construct and maintain residence and farm buildings located on the vara strips. We reject the landowners’ claims for hunting, fishing, and recreation.</p>

There is little dispute that the settlers enjoyed extensive rights in the lands that comprise the Taylor Ranch for about one hundred years. Rather, the dispute concerns the extent of the rights, if any, that survive when we construe settlement rights conceived in a different era pursuant to contemporary standards. In short, the difficulty of this case is that we <span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-543">p. 543</span>must address the grave injustices imposed upon the settlers’ successors in interest by interpreting documents from a different era, intended to reflect Beaubien’s intent, through the perspective of modern property law.

First, it is my view that in 1863 Charles Beaubien attempted to make a community grant for the benefit of the inhabitants of the plazas of San Luis, San Pablo, and Los Ballejos. The law in effect at the time did not recognize such a grant and instead required individual identification of grantees. Hence, the Beaubien Document had no legal effect.</p>

There has been no showing in this case that Beaubien or Gilpin either misrepresented material facts or intended the landowners to rely to their detriment upon a parol agreement. Indeed, to my knowledge, the only context in which such a doctrine has been applied to the acquisition of easements has involved ditches and ditch rights, an area in which rights are so firmly entrenched as to be included within the Colorado Constitution.</p>

<p id="c58fab8c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Background and aftermath.</b> <i>Lobato v. Taylor</i> illustrates the power of running with the land. Here, rights allegedly acquired in the 1800s are found to pass down through several owners of the servient estate, the Mountain Tract and generations of owners of the dominant estate, the Costilla County residents, to still exist in 2002. The immediate conflict leading to <i>Lobato v. Taylor</i> began in 1960, when a North Carolina lumberman, Jack Taylor, purchased the 77,000-acre Mountain Tract for what he considered the bargain price of $500,000. Although the sellers warned him of the practices of the Costilla County residents, he enclosed it in barbed wire, hired guards to patrol the area, and confiscated rifles and other equipment from those he found on the land. Taylor also immediately filed a lawsuit seeking a judicial declaration that he had title to the land free from any other claims. Relying on diversity jurisdiction, he filed the action in federal district court some 200 miles away from the county. The federal court found for Taylor, holding that any rights that the county residents might have had under Mexican law were extinguished. <i>Sanchez v. Taylor</i>, 377 F.2d 733 (10th Cir. 1967).</p>

</div>
<p id="c58fab93-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispute continued, fueled in part by resentment of Taylor’s “attitude,” evidenced by television interviews in which Taylor dismissed the Latino county residents’ opposition as the result of “an inferiority complex. They know they’re not equal, mentally or <span title="545" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-545">p. 545</span>physically to a white man, and that’s why they stick together so.” Calvin Trillin, <i>U.S. Journal, Costilla County: A Little Cloud on the Title</i>, The New Yorker 122, 128, Apr. 26, 1976. The federal judgment would usually have barred the later state action, but the Colorado Supreme Court found that Taylor failed to provide the Costilla residents with adequate notice, as he had served them only by publication of the federal action. <i>Lobato v. Taylor</i>, 70 P.3d 1152 (Colo. 2003). After remand, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the easement rights belonged to any resident who could trace title to the land of the original settlers under Beaubien.</p>
<p id="c58fd1a4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.  Communal land grants.</b> Although the majority holds that the Beaubien Grant was not legally effective in itself, it relies on the grant in finding that the plaintiffs had easements by estoppel. Justice Kourlis argues in dissent that the grant did not simply fail to comply with formalities; instead, it attempted to create a communal property right, something recognized under Mexican law but deliberately prohibited by the new Colorado Territory. Why might Colorado have forbidden the communal land grant system? If Justice Kourlis was correct that the territory did forbid communal land grants, what effect should that have on the recognition of informally created easements today?</p>
<p id="c58fd1a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Easements by estoppel.</b> Easements by estoppel may be found in three different kinds of circumstances. Some courts may apply the doctrine to only some of these circumstances; some may even reject the doctrine entirely, rigidly enforcing the Statute of Frauds in this context. <i>See Kitchen v. Kitchen</i>, 641 N.W.2d 245 (Mich. 2002).</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c58fd1a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Noncompliance with the Statute of Frauds.</b> In the first circumstance, the parties intended to create an easement but failed to comply with the requisite formalities, such as a writing, seal, or adequate description of the property. If the claimant substantially invested in reasonable reliance on the agreement, courts may find an easement by estoppel. <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §2.09; <i>see, e.g.</i>, <i>Kluger v. Kubick</i>, 954 A.2d 262 (Conn. App. Ct. 2008) (plaintiff and defendant walked property line and agreed on location of new driveway before defendant built driveway running over plaintiff’s property). This is consistent with the general equitable exception to the Statute of Frauds. In the absence of a writing, however, it is often difficult to determine whether the parties intended to create a permanent easement or a temporary license, so cases often turn on one of the other grounds for estoppel.</p>
<p id="c58fd1a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Reasonable reliance on continuation of consent.</b> Courts also sometimes find estoppel even in the absence of proof of the grantor’s intent to create an easement when “the owner or occupier permitted another to use that land under circumstances in which it was reasonable to foresee that the user would substantially change position believing that the permission would not be revoked, and the user did substantially change position in reasonable reliance on that belief.” <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §2.10(1). The permission may either be express or implicit from acquiescence in the continued use.</p>
<p id="c58fd1a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Holbrook v. Taylor</i>, 532 S.W.2d 763 (Ky. 1976), for example, the alleged easement, an old mine road, was the only existing road to the appellees’ property. The appellees re-graded the road, transported construction materials along it, and <span title="546" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-546">p. 546</span>built their home in reliance on permission to use the road. Although there was no proof of express consent by the owner of the servient estate, the court found that an irrevocable easement by estoppel had been created. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also Cleaver v. Kundiff</i>, 203 S.W.3d 373 (Tex. App. 2006) (finding “the jury could reasonably infer that the Armstrongs would not have built their house without some reliable means of access and would not have expended time and money maintaining a road over which they had no claim”). In contrast, the Maine Supreme Court found that a claimant simply had a temporary license to allow transportation of construction materials, even though the claimant paid to pave the turnaround, and building a driveway to the public road over the claimant’s own property would be very difficult. <i>Woods v. Libby</i>, 635 A.2d 960 (Me. 1993).</p>
<p id="c58fd1a9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Fraud or misrepresentation.</b> Some courts will only find an easement by estoppel when there has been fraud or misrepresentation about the existence of or intent to grant an easement. <i>See Flaig v. Gramm</i>, 983 P.2d 396 (Mont. 1999) (no easement by estoppel where parties jointly invested in building and maintaining well based upon mistaken belief that it was on their common boundary); <i>Jones v. Stamper</i>, 297 S.W.3d 73, 77 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009) (no easement by estoppel after landowner’s death although neighbors paid landowner $500 for agreement that they could access the highway over his land and then paid to construct a road over the land). This was the position Justice Kourlis advocated in dissent in <i>Lobato v. Taylor.</i> Even in jurisdictions where fraud is not a necessary element of the claim, fraud plus investment in reliance on the fraud is an alternate ground for finding an easement by estoppel. <i>See Restatement (Third)</i> §2.10(2).</p>
<p id="c58fd1aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts find that letting an individual substantially invest in reliance on a reasonable belief that the permission to enter the land will be permanent is itself a kind of fraud. In <i>Stoner v. Zucker</i>, 83 P. 808 (Cal. 1906), for example, plaintiff granted defendant a revocable license to enter plaintiff’s property to construct a ditch for carrying water. Defendant constructed the ditch at the expense of $7,000 (about $180,000 in today’s dollars). The court found that “it would countenance a fraud to allow the plaintiff to revoke permission to use the ditch.” <i>Id</i>. at 809-810. In contrast, <i>Harber v. Jensen</i>, 97 P.3d 57 (Wyo. 2004), held that expenditures in reliance on unwritten permission extending over 70 years was not evidence of fraud where the owners (the children of the original licensees) did not seek express permission and the defendants did not know that the expenditures were being made. Can you distinguish these cases?</p>
</div>
<p id="c58fd1ab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Constructive trust.</b> Rights to use land titled in another may also be created through a constructive trust. An express trust is an arrangement in which one person or entity, the <b>trustee</b>, has title to some property for the express benefit of another, the <b>beneficiary</b>. A constructive trust, in contrast, is an equitable exception to the Statute of Frauds. It may be found when “legal title to property has been obtained through actual fraud, misrepresentations, concealments, taking advantage of one’s necessities, or under circumstances otherwise rendering it unconscionable for the holder of legal title to retain beneficial interest in property.” <i>Snider v. Arnold</i>, 289 P.3d 43 (Idaho 2012) (finding constructive trust on cabin permitted in brother’s name in favor of sister); <i>Goggin v. Goggin</i>, 267 P.3d 885, 892 (Utah 2011) (imposing constructive trust on horse <span title="547" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-547">p. 547</span>farm titled in ex-husband’s name that ex-wife had helped to develop under understanding of partnership). In <i>Rase v. Castle Mountain Ranch, Inc.</i>, 631 P.2d 680 (Mont. 1981), for example, the court imposed a constructive trust in favor of individuals who had built cabins and summer cottages and used them for over 50 years with the written license from the ranch owner, who wanted company and extra security but did not want to sell title to the land because of concerns about water rights. When the ranch was sold, the purchaser asked the rancher to terminate the licenses, and he refused. The new owner then immediately notified the cabin owners that their licenses were terminated. The court found that the new owner, given its knowledge of the semi-permanent nature of the cabin owner’s license, engaged in fraud in buying the land then terminating the cabin owner’s rights. It imposed a constructive trust on the land in favor of the cabin owners, but only for 15 years after the sale.</p>

<p id="c58fd1ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1860, Peter Feeley purchased a family burial plot in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under existing law, the purchase of a burial plot in a cemetery owned by another was an easement for burial of one’s dead. The purchase agreement was not impressed with a seal, which was necessary to create a formal easement under the Statute of Frauds at the time. Peter Feeley buried a child in the plot in 1860, and his wife there in 1898. After Mr. Feeley’s death in 1904, the superintendent of the cemetery opened Mrs. Feeley’s grave to ascertain who was in there, and then, finding that the grave was not deep enough to bury Mr. Feeley as well, “flattened down” Mrs. Feeley’s casket and bones to make room. The Feeleys’ surviving children learned about this after they found a plate that the superintendent had removed from their mother’s grave and left lying on the ground. They brought a trespass action against the superintendent of the cemetery. Because licenses cannot give rise to an action for trespass and cannot usually be inherited, to succeed they had to show that Mr. Feeley had a burial easement in the plot. What exceptions to the Statute of Frauds for easements could they assert? Should they succeed? (Facts, but not solution, taken from <i>Feeley v. Andrews</i>, 77 N.E. 766 (Mass. 1906).)</p>

The distance between the back of the shopping center and the property line of parcel C is 50 feet. The shopping center’s underground utility facilities are located in this area. An apartment complex, known as the Chateau des Fleurs Apartments, is located on the parcel labeled “E.” Both of the plaintiff’s properties were developed prior to the time parcel B was sold to the defendants. Parcel B remains undeveloped.</p>

The center, which was built in 1967, contains several businesses, including a grocery store, a pharmacy, and doctors’ offices. The rear of the center is used for deliveries, trash storage and removal, and utilities repair. To gain access to the rear of the shopping center for these purposes, trucks use a gravel driveway which runs along the lot line between parcel A and parcel B. A second driveway, located to the east of the shopping center on parcel D, enables the trucks to circle the shopping center without having to turn around in the limited space behind the stores.</p>
<p id="c59046f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Robert Mehann, the owner of the Save-A-Lot grocery store located in the shopping center, testified on direct examination that groceries, which are delivered to the rear of the store, are loaded by forklift on a concrete pad poured for that purpose. Mehann indicated that there are large, double steel doors in the back of the store to accommodate items which will not fit through the front door. Mehann testified that semitrailer trucks make deliveries to the rear of the grocery store four days a week, with as many as two or three such trucks arriving daily. An average of 10 to 12 trucks a day, including semitrailer trucks, make deliveries to the grocery store. Mehann further explained on direct examination that because the area behind the Save-A-Lot building extends only 50 feet to the rear property line, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a semitrailer truck to turn around in the back and exit the same way it came in. In response to a question as to whether it would be feasible to have trucks make front-door deliveries, Mehann suggested that such deliveries would be very disruptive; pallets that would not fit through the front door would have to be broken down into parts, requiring extra work, and there would not be adequate space in the front of the store to do such work during business hours. Mehann admitted on cross-examination that he had not investigated the cost of installing a front door which would be big enough for pallets of groceries to be brought in by forklift. Further cross-examination revealed that there would not be enough space to manipulate the forklift around the front of the store, although it could be run between the shelves of food to the back of the store.</p>
<p id="c59046f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also called as a witness for Granite Properties Limited Partnership was Darrell Layman, a limited partner. Layman noted that the shopping center had been in continuous operation since 1967 and that the pattern for deliveries had always been to the rear of the individual stores. When asked whether he had “ever seen a semi back up in the rear of the shopping center and go out the way it came in,” Layman responded, “That would be impossible.” On cross-examination, however, Layman admitted that, although it was very difficult, he had seen semitrailer trucks exit the same way they came in. Layman also acknowledged on cross-examination that he had not investigated the cost of expanding the size of the front doors of the building. He also claimed that it “would seem impossible” to him to put in any kind of a hallway or passageway which would allow equipment to bring supplies into the stores from the front. On redirect examination, Layman explained that the delivery trucks follow no set schedule and, therefore, their presence may overlap at times. He stated that he had seen as many as four or five delivery trucks backed up. Layman opined that there was “no way” the trucks could back up and turn around when there were multiple trucks present.</p>

The complex, which was erected in the 1960s prior to the conveyance of parcel B to the defendants, consists of three buildings containing 36 units. The parking lot, which is situated to the rear of the buildings, provides 72 parking spaces. The only access to the parking lot is by a driveway from Rou des Chateaux, a public street located to the south of the properties. The driveway, which cuts across a small panhandle on the southwestern corner of parcel B, has been in existence since the apartment complex was constructed. The terrain around the apartment complex is flat, including the area in front of the buildings along Prairie Street to the west.</p>
<p id="c59046f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Limited partner Darrell Layman testified at trial that if the area in front of the apartment complex, measuring 300 feet along Prairie Street and 30 feet deep, were to be converted into a parking lot, then there would be room for only 30 parking spaces. He admitted on direct examination that he had not investigated the cost of rocking or asphalting this area for that purpose. Although there was a distance of 20 feet between the apartment buildings, Layman opined that it would not be enough “usable space” to accommodate a driveway from Prairie Street to the existing parking lot because such driveway would interfere with stairways which lead to the basement apartments. Although he admitted that he did not investigate the cost of installing a driveway either between the buildings or adjacent to the end building on the north, Layman concluded that, based on his experience in the layout and design of apartment buildings, “it would be a dangerous situation” for the tenants of the apartments if a driveway were to be run between the buildings or next to their sides. Layman concluded his testimony by claiming that the plaintiff was unaware of any easement problems as to the driveways in question at the time parcel B was deeded to the defendants; otherwise, he asserted, “it would not have been deeded.”</p>
<p id="c59046fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant, Larry Manns, stated that he purchased parcel B from the plaintiff in the summer of 1982. Shortly afterwards, he had a survey made of the property. The survey indicated possible encroachments by the plaintiff as to the driveways in question. Finding no recorded easements following a title search, Manns stated that he notified the plaintiff to discontinue its use of the driveways. On cross-examination, Manns admitted that he saw the two driveways before he bought the subject property.</p>
<p id="c59046fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff contends in this court that it acquired, by implied reservation, easements over the driveways which provide access to the rear of the shopping center located on parcel A and to the parking lot of the apartment complex situated on parcel E. Plaintiff alleges that parcels A, B and E were held in common ownership by the plaintiff and its predecessors in title until 1982, at which time the defendants received a warranty deed to parcel B, that the driveways in question were apparent and obvious, permanent, and subject to continuous, uninterrupted, and actual use by the plaintiff and its predecessors in title until the time of severance of unity of ownership, and that the driveways are highly convenient and reasonably necessary for the beneficial use and enjoyment of the shopping center and the apartment complex. Therefore, the plaintiff maintains that, upon severance of unity of title, the defendants took <span title="551" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-551">p. 551</span>parcel B subject to the servitudes then existing, as the parties are presumed to convey with reference to the existing conditions of the property.</p>
<p id="c59046fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the merits, the crucial issue is whether, in conveying that portion of its property now owned by the defendants (parcel B), the plaintiff retained easements by implication over the driveways in question.</p>
<p id="c59046fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are two types of implied easements — the easement by necessity and the easement implied from a preexisting use. The easement by necessity usually arises when an owner of land conveys to another an inner portion thereof, which is entirely surrounded by lands owned either by the grantor or the grantor plus strangers. Unless a contrary intent is manifested, the grantee is found to have a right-of-way across the retained land of the grantor for ingress to, and egress from, the landlocked parcel. Similarly, an easement is implied by way of necessity in the deed when the owner of lands retains the inner portion, conveying to another the balance.</p>
<p id="c59046fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The easement implied from a prior existing use, often characterized as a “quasi-easement,” arises when an owner of an entire tract of land or of two or more adjoining parcels, after employing a part thereof so that one part of the tract or one parcel derives from another a benefit or advantage of an apparent, continuous, and permanent nature, conveys or transfers part of the property without mention being made of these incidental uses. In the absence of an expressed agreement to the contrary, the conveyance or transfer imparts a grant of property with all the benefits and burdens which existed at the time of the conveyance of the transfer, even though such grant is not reserved or specified in the deed. This court has stated on numerous occasions that an easement implied from a preexisting use is established by proof of three elements: first, common ownership of the claimed dominant and servient parcels and a subsequent conveyance or transfer separating that ownership; second, before the conveyance or transfer severing the unity of title, the common owner used part of the united parcel for the benefit of another part, and this use was apparent and obvious, continuous, and permanent; and third, the claimed easement is necessary and beneficial to the enjoyment of the parcel conveyed or retained by the grantor or transferor.</p>
<p id="c59046ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the above discussion indicates, easements created by implication arise as an inference of the intention of the parties to a conveyance of land. This inference, which is drawn from the circumstances surrounding the conveyance alone, represents an attempt to ascribe an intention to parties who had not thought or had not bothered to put the intention into words, or to parties who actually had formed no intention conscious to themselves. To fill these common gaps resulting in incomplete thought, courts find particular facts suggestive of intent on the part of the parties to a conveyance. In the case of an easement implied from a preexisting use, proof of the prior use is evidence that the parties probably intended an easement, on the presumption that the grantor and the grantee would have intended to continue an important or necessary use of the land known to them that was apparently continuous and permanent in its nature. Where an easement by necessity is claimed, however, there is no requirement of proof of a known existing use from which to draw the inference of intention. This leaves proof of necessity alone to furnish the probable inference of intention, on <span title="552" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-552">p. 552</span>the presumption that the grantor and the grantee do not intend to render the land unfit for occupancy.</p>
<p id="c5904700-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This essentially is the position taken by the <i>Restatement of Property</i> §474 (1944). The <i>Restatement</i> operates on the basis of eight “important circumstances” from which the inference of intention [to create or reserve an easement] may be drawn: whether the claimant is the conveyor or the conveyee; the terms of the conveyance; the consideration given for it; whether the claim is made against a simultaneous conveyee; the extent of necessity of the easement to the claimant; whether reciprocal benefits result to the conveyor and the conveyee; the manner in which the land was used prior to its conveyance; and the extent to which the manner of prior use was or might have been known to the parties. <i>Restatement of Property</i> §476 (1944). These eight factors vary in their importance and relevance according to whether the claimed easement originates out of necessity or for another reason.</p>
<p id="c5904701-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying the <i>Restatement</i>’s eight important circumstances to the present case, the fact that the driveways in question had been used by the plaintiff or its predecessors in title since the 1960s, when the respective properties were developed, that the driveways were permanent in character, being either rock or gravel covered, and that the defendants were aware of the driveways’ prior uses before they purchased parcel B would tend to support an inference that the parties intended easements upon severance of the parcels in question. Although the prior uses which the plaintiff seeks to continue existed during the common ownership of the parcels in question, under circumstances where the defendants were fully informed by physical appearance of their existence, the defendants, nevertheless, argue that there are two factors which overwhelmingly detract from the implication of an easement: that the claimant is the conveyor and that the claimed easement can hardly be described as “necessary” to the beneficial use of the plaintiff’s properties. Relying on the principle that a grantor should not be permitted to derogate from his own grant, the defendants urge this court to refuse to imply an easement in favor of a grantor unless the claimed easement is absolutely necessary to the beneficial use and enjoyment of the land retained by the grantor. The defendants further urge this court not to cast an unreasonable burden over their land through imposition of easements by implication where, as here, available alternatives affording reasonable means of ingress to and egress from the shopping center and the apartment complex allegedly exist.</p>
<p id="c5904702-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the degree of necessity required to reserve an easement by implication in favor of the conveyor is greater than that required in the case of the conveyee, even in the case of the conveyor, the implication from necessity will be aided by a previous use made apparent by the physical adaptation of the premises to it. Moreover, the necessity requirement will have a different meaning and significance in the case involving proof of prior use than it will in a case in which necessity alone supports the implication; otherwise, proof of prior use would be unnecessary. Thus, when circumstances such as an apparent prior use of the land support the inference of the parties’ intention, the required extent of the claimed easement’s necessity will be less than when necessity is the only circumstance from which the inference of intention will be drawn. While some showing of necessity for the continuance of the use must be <span title="553" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-553">p. 553</span>shown where a prior use has been made, to the extent that the prior use strengthens the implication, the degree or extent of necessity requisite for implication is reduced.

<p id="c5906e13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a previous use is continuous and apparent, an easement may be created by implication even though the need for the use to be made is not sufficiently great to meet the test of necessity as applied in the absence of such a previous use. Hence, the test is phrased in terms of <i>reasonable necessity</i> rather than in terms of unqualified necessity. A use is necessary, it is often said, when without it no effective use could be made of the land to be benefited by it. <i>Where, because of a continuous and apparent previous use, the test of necessity becomes that of reasonable necessity, it is said that a use is reasonably necessary when it is reasonably convenient to the use of the land benefited</i>. In fact, however, reasonable necessity too is a flexible test. <i>The more pronounced a continuous and apparent use is, the less the degree of convenience of use necessary to the creation of an easement by implication</i>.

<p id="c5906e15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he authorities agree that the degree or extent of necessity required to create an easement by implication differs in both meaning and significance depending on the existence of proof of prior use. Hence, given the strong evidence of the plaintiff’s prior use of the driveways in question and the defendants’ knowledge thereof, we must agree with the appellate court majority that the evidence in this case was sufficient to fulfill the elastic necessity requirement.</p>
<p id="c5906e16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the above reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>

Easements implied from prior use</b>, also called <b>quasi-easements</b> or <b>easements by implication</b>, permit a use to continue after severance of one parcel into two if the prior use was apparent before severance, and reasonably necessary or convenient for the enjoyment of the severed estate. <i>NAMN, LLC v. Morello</i>, 867 N.W.2d 545 (Neb. 2015); <i>see Restatement (Third)</i> §2.12. The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> also provides that a use for underground utility or sewer lines may qualify for an easement by implication even when it is not visible to the parties. <i>Id.</i>;<i> see Villancourt v. Motta</i>, 986 A.2d 985 (R.I. 2009) (finding easement by implication for sewer lines under neighboring condominium). The general test is whether the parties had reason to expect that the use would continue despite severance of the parcel. In <i>Lobato v.

<p id="c5909537-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">February 16, 1895, Charles H. Williams owned a tract of land in Salisburg township, in Sangamon county, consisting of approximately 140 acres. On the day named, Williams conveyed 39.47 acres to Thomas J. Bacon. In 1937, the plaintiffs, Eugene E. Finn and Curtis Estallar Finn, acquired the title to this tract. The defendant, Zilphia Jane Williams, inherited the remaining 100 acres. By their complaint filed in the circuit court of Sangamon county, plaintiffs charge that the nearest and only available means of egress from and ingress to their land to a highway and to any market for their livestock and crops is by means of a right of way over defendant’s tract immediately to the north; that their tract is not located or situated on any public highway and is entirely surrounded by land of strangers and the defendant’s tract; that prior to and during all the time the 40 acres and the 100 acres constituted one tract and were owned by defendant’s husband, the only means of ingress and egress to and from the single tract to a highway was by right of way in a northerly direction through a third tract of land north and adjacent to the present tract of defendant, and that this open road is still used by defendant as her only means of egress and ingress from and to the highway. The relief sought was the declaration of a right of way easement of necessity from the north line of plaintiffs’ tract through the defendant’s tract, to the beginning of the right of way road through the third tract mentioned. Answering, the defendant admitted that plaintiffs’ land is not located or situated on <span title="555" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-555">p. 555</span>any public highway but averred that since its severance from her land it is and has been located on a private road leading to the south to a public highway. This averment, plaintiffs denied.</p>

<p id="c590953a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Between 1895 and 1939, the plaintiffs and their predecessors had accessed the road via other surrounding land. Could they claim an easement by prescription over the land? Why didn’t they claim an easement by necessity over that land?</p>
</div>
<p id="c590953b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Private permissive ways of ingress and egress over the land of strangers both to the east and to the south have been available to the successive owners, including plaintiffs, of the 40-acre tract since its severance from the 100-acre tract of the defendant in 1895, but each of the private ways over the lands of the adjoining strangers has been closed and, as defendant concedes, these permissive means of ingress and egress do not now exist. Two witnesses for defendant who had lived near the property in controversy for about sixty years testified to roads leading to the south and to the east from the 40-acre tract over the land of strangers. These roads were private roads over the property of strangers, and are now closed. Nathan Woodrum, defendant’s son-in-law, testified that he had until recently lived on the 100-acre tract, and that a road through defendant’s land connects with the road through the tract at the north, and that the road through this third tract is the only mode of access to the highway unless permission be obtained to go through the land of strangers. Since May, 1939, defendant has refused to permit plaintiff to travel further over the right of way through her tract. As a result of defendant’s action, the plaintiffs have been unable to take their livestock and farm products to market, have had no means of egress from or ingress to their 40 acres on which they live, and have had to walk to the township highway, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile carrying such produce as they could.</p>
<p id="c590953c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence does not sustain defendant’s averment that plaintiffs have the use of a private road leading to the south to a public highway and defendant, by her concession that a present necessity exists, has apparently abandoned this claim. She maintains, however, that the necessity has arisen by reason of changed circumstances since the severance of the two tracts. Firmly established principles control. Where an owner of land conveys a parcel thereof which has no outlet to a highway except over the remaining lands of the grantor or over the land of strangers, a way by necessity exists over the remaining lands of the grantor. If, at one time, there has been unity of title, as here, the right to a way by necessity may lay dormant through several transfers of title and yet pass with each transfer as appurtenant to the dominant estate and be exercised at any time by the holder of the title thereto. Plaintiffs’ land is entirely surrounded by property of strangers and the land of the defendant from which it was originally severed. A right of way easement of necessity was necessarily implied in the conveyance severing the two tracts in 1895, and passed by <i>mesne</i> conveyances to plaintiffs in 1937. The fact that the original grantee and his successors in interest have been permitted ingress to and egress from the 40 acres over the land owned by surrounding strangers is immaterial. When such permission is denied, as in the present case, the subsequent grantees may avail themselves of the dormant easement implied in the deed severing the dominant and servient estates.</p>

<p id="c590bc52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Easements by necessity.</b> The policies underlying the doctrine of easement by necessity are (a) to effectuate the intent of the parties and (b) to promote the efficient utilization of property. Sometimes these policies go together. Ordinarily, we can expect buyers not to agree to buy landlocked property unless they have guaranteed access to it by an easement over neighboring land. Thus granting a right of access both promotes land utilization and the intent of the parties. As the Idaho Supreme Court explained in <i>Burley Brick and Sand Company v. Cofer</i>, 629 P.2d 1166, 1168 (Idaho 1981):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c590bc53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A way of necessity is an easement arising from an implied grant or implied reservation; it is of common-law origin and is supported by the rule of sound public policy that lands should not be rendered unfit for occupancy or successful cultivation. Such a way is the result of the application of the presumption that whenever a party conveys <span title="557" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-557">p. 557</span>property, he conveys whatever is necessary for the beneficial use of that property and retains whatever is necessary for the beneficial use of land he still possesses. Thus, the legal basis of a way of necessity is the presumption of a grant arising from the circumstances of the case.</p>
</div>
<p id="c590bc54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts split, however, on what to do when these policies conflict. Many courts (perhaps most courts today) hold that the ultimate purpose of the rule is to effectuate the intent of the grantor. Thus no easement of necessity will be recognized if it is clear that the grantor intended to sell, and the grantee knew she was buying, a landlocked parcel. The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> takes this view<i>. Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §2.15 (2000); <i>see also Kitras v. Town of Aquinnah</i>, 49 N.E.3d 198 (Mass. 2016) (no easement by necessity because Wampanoag custom of access when lots were divided suggested no intent to create easement); <i>Yellowstone River, LLC v. Meriwether Land Fund, LLC</i>, 264 P.3d 1065, 1079 (Mont. 2011) (public policy justification only supports easement by necessity where intent to create one can be inferred from the circumstances).</p>

Because of the strict necessity of having access to the landlocked parcel, an easement over the grantor’s remaining land benefitting the landlocked lot is implied as a matter of law irrespective of the true intent of the common grantor.</p>

Bartholomew</i>, 459 A.2d 974, 978 (Vt. 1983), that easements by necessity “often thwart[] the intent of the original grantor or grantee,” because “the demands of our society prevent any man-made efforts to hold land in perpetual idleness as would result if it were cut off from all access by being completely surrounded by lands privately owned.” <i>Accord, Swan v.

Statutory regulation of landlocked parcels.</b> Some states have enacted statutes empowering the owner of a landlocked parcel to obtain an easement over neighboring land for access to a public road by application to a public official and payment of compensation to the landowner whose property is burdened by the easement. Washington State’s statute reads as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

Along the river is a one-lane public street. Adam divides the property into northern and southern parcels, selling the northern parcel to Barbara. After some years, increasingly violent storms begin causing regular flooding and destruction of the one-lane street. The government decides to stop maintaining and rebuilding it, and soon the street is no more. Barbara’s parcel is now landlocked. Can she assert an easement by necessity over Adam’s land?</p>
<p id="c590e373-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> The doctrine of easement by necessity applies when land has no access to a public road. Should it apply when property is physically located along a public road but the cost of creating useable access to that road is prohibitively expensive? <i>Compare Schwab v. Timmons</i>, 589 N.W.2d 1 (Wis. 1999) (no easement by necessity granted merely because the cost of building a road over a bluff to a public road was $700,000); <i>Harkness v. Butterworth Hunting Club</i>, 58 So. 3d 703 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011) (no easement by necessity where alternative access was available by building a road over several deep ravines) <i>abrogating Mississippi Power Co. v. Fairchild,</i> 791 So. 2d 262 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001) (power company entitled to easement by necessity if the only access to a public road was over a river because the cost of bridge construction would be prohibitive) <i>with Thompson v. Whinnery</i>, 895 P.2d 537 (Colo. 1995) (“great necessity” rather than absolute necessity, was the standard in Colorado, but standard was not met when part of parcel across canyon used for recreational and grazing purposes could be accessed by horseback).</p>
<p id="c590e374-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3.</b> Relatedly, what if the only access to the land is by water? In <i>Berge v. State</i>, 915 A.2d 189 (Vt. 2006), the court held that the fact that plaintiff could access a public road via boat from his property did not defeat an easement by necessity. Although the test in Vermont was that there must be “strict necessity,” the majority found that “since the easement is based on social considerations encouraging land use, its scope ought to be sufficient for the dominant owner to have the reasonable enjoyment of his land for all lawful purposes.” 915 A.2d at 192. Access by water did not allow a modern owner “reasonable enjoyment” of his land. The dissent argued that water access was reasonable for property such as the plaintiff’s, which was used for seasonal outdoor <span title="559" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-559">p. 559</span>recreation, and that the majority had forgotten that “[t]he public’s interest in access to landlocked property must be balanced against the serious consequences inherent in granting one landowner an uncompensated interest in the property of a neighbor.” 915 A.2d at 196 (Reinhardt, J. dissenting).

<p id="c590e377-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Easements last forever unless they are terminated (1) by <b>agreement</b> in writing (release of the easement by the holder); (2) by their own terms — for example, if the deed conveying the easement expressly states that it is to last for ten years; (3) by <b>merger</b>, when the holder of the servient estate becomes the owner of the dominant estate; (4) by <b>abandonment</b>, if it can be shown that the owner of the easement, by her conduct, indicated an intent to abandon the easement; or (5) by <b>adverse possession</b> or <b>prescription</b> by the owner of the servient estate or by a third party.</p>
<p id="c590e378-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometimes courts terminate easements (6) because of <b>frustration of purpose</b><i>.</i> “Traditional doctrine terminates obsolete easements either by a liberal application of the abandonment principle, or by finding that the purpose of the easement has become impossible to accomplish, or that the easement no longer serves its intended purpose . . . .” <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §7.10 (2000). <i>See Boissy v. Chevron</i>, 33 A.3d 1109, 1114 (N.H. 2011) (easement to get water from well terminated once well could no longer be located). The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> proposes changing this doctrine by permitting modification rather than termination when modification would permit accomplishment of the purpose of the easement, <i>id.</i>, but few courts have as yet adopted this position.</p>
<p id="c590e379-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states have enacted “marketable title acts,” which may require that easements, along with other encumbrances on property interests, be re-recorded periodically (generally every 30 to 50 years) to be binding on future purchasers. The purpose of these statutes is to limit how far back a buyer must look in the chain of title to determine the validity of the seller’s title and the existence of encumbrances on the land. However, they also have the effect of making unenforceable those interests that were put in place a long time ago and were of insufficient importance to anyone to be re-recorded in compliance with the statute. Failure to comply with the marketable title act by re-recording the easement may leave the easement owner unprotected from a subsequent purchaser of the servient estate who, depending on the language in the statute, may be entitled to buy the property free of the burden of the easement.</p>

<p id="c590e37e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Negative servitudes, commonly called <b>covenants</b>, are restrictions on use of land or obligations regarding land held by one who does not own the land. For example, a neighbor may have the right to prevent you from building over a certain height on your <span title="560" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-560">p. 560</span>land, or the right to require you to mow your grass regularly. Common law originally placed many restrictions on covenants running with the land; modern law generally eases these restrictions, but may create other restrictions to further public policy goals.</p>
<p id="c5910a8f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At early common law, restrictions on land held by others were called <b>negative easements</b>. But because a restriction on land use is not visible to a purchaser in the way an affirmative easement, like a driveway, might be, courts were concerned about notice to subsequent owners. In addition, because English law permitted negative easements to be acquired by prescription, there was concern that prescriptive rights in the status quo would prevent useful development of land. Therefore courts limited negative easements to three categories: (1) rights to lateral support of one’s buildings; (2) rights to free flow of light and air; and (3) rights to water from an artificial stream.</p>
<p id="c5910a90-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Landowners entered into contractual arrangements to get around these limitations.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AFF_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10AFF_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> Contract rights, however, generally did not bind or benefit subsequent purchasers of the benefited or burdened parcels. Individuals had to be in <b>privity of contract</b>, or parties to the original contract, to be either bound by the contract or entitled to enforce its benefits. How could agreements regarding land benefit or burden future possessors of the land?</p>
<p id="c5910a92-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of<b> real covenants</b> developed to address this problem. In <i>Spencer’s Case,</i> 77 Eng. Rep. 72 (1583), the court held that an agreement would bind successors in interest to the land if it was (1) in <b>writing</b><i>,</i> (2) <b>intended</b> to be binding on future tenants, (3) <b>touched and concerned</b> the land, meaning that it affected the use of the land itself, and (4) if there was <b>privity of estate</b>, or mutual ownership of land, between the covenanting parties. For the English courts, “privity of estate” meant <b>simultaneous privity</b>, that the parties had simultaneous interests in the same parcel of land. Landlords and tenants were in simultaneous privity because they had rights in the same parcel at the same time. But buyers and sellers of land were not; once the land was sold, the seller would not share a simultaneous interest in the land with the buyer.</p>
<p id="c5910a93-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, England had two court systems: the law courts, which awarded damages, and the equity courts, which provided equitable injunctive or declaratory relief in cases in which the harsh common law rule would create injustice. In <i>Tulk v. Moxhay,</i> 41 Eng. Rep. 1143 (1848), the chancellor of the equity courts created the concept of <b>equitable servitudes</b>, covenants that could be enforced by injunction despite the lack of privity. If the covenant met the writing, intent, and touch and concern requirements, <i>and</i> the current owner had purchased with <b>notice</b> of the restriction, the owner of the burdened estate could be enjoined from violating the covenant. “Of course,” the court opined, “the price would be affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more inequitable than that the original purchaser should be able to sell the property the next day for a greater price, in consideration of the assignee being allowed to escape from the liability which he himself had undertaken.” <i>Id.</i> Real covenants and equitable servitudes thus differed both in the requirements for running with the land and in the remedies available to enforce them. A real covenant (requiring privity) was <span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-561">p. 561</span>necessary to get damages, while an equitable servitude (requiring notice) was necessary for an injunction.</p>
<p id="c5910a94-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts in the United States adopted both real covenants and equitable servitudes law. The law of real covenants expanded the definition of privity. Some states did this by expanding the concept of simultaneous privity from the landlord-tenant relationship to situations in which one owner owns an easement in the property of the other and/or both owners have mutual easements in each other’s property. Most courts expanded the privity concept by adopting the doctrine of <b>instantaneous privity</b>, finding privity if a covenant was created during the legal transfer of land. Thus a covenant included in a deed of sale restricting use of the parcel might bind future owners of the property conveyed. The fiction was that at the moment the deed passes from seller to buyer, the parties have a fleeting simultaneous interest in the property.</p>
<p id="c5910a95-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over the twentieth century, developers initiated vast expansions of the use of the covenant form. Large residential developments in which unit owners had common restrictions and privileges were a key part of the rise of suburbs in the wake of World War II. The proliferation of shopping plazas and shopping malls, in which numerous retail businesses share facilities bound by common rules, followed soon after. Private agreements regarding land use that ran with the land were no longer viewed as idiosyncratic obstacles to development, but as necessary aids to increasingly dense and interconnected land use. In addition, concerns about notice to subsequent buyers were never as significant in the United States, where registries of deeds had recorded restrictions on land since colonial times. Many courts relaxed restrictions on the covenant form, merging the law of real covenants and equitable servitudes, and modifying or even abolishing touch and concern and privity requirements.</p>

Emigrant Savings Bank bought the Deyers’ land at a foreclosure sale in 1935. After selling the parcels, the Neponsit Realty Company assigned its rights under the covenant to the Neponsit Property Owners’ Association. The deed to the Deyers included the following covenant:]</p>

<p id="c591a6f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no doubt that Neponsit Realty Company intended that the covenant should run with the land and should be enforceable by a property owners association against every owner of property in the residential tract which the realty company was then developing. The language of the covenant admits of no other construction. <span title="564" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-564">p. 564</span>Regardless of the intention of the parties, a covenant will run with the land and will be enforceable against a subsequent purchaser of the land at the suit of one who claims the benefit of the covenant, only if the covenant complies with certain legal requirements. These requirements rest upon ancient rules and precedents. The age-old essentials of a real covenant, aside from the form of the covenant, may be summarily formulated as follows: (1) It must appear that grantor and grantee intended that the covenant should run with the land; (2) it must appear that the covenant is one “touching” or “concerning” the land with which it runs; (3) it must appear that there is “privity of estate” between the promisee or party claiming the benefit of the covenant and the right to enforce it, and the promisor or party who rests under the burden of the covenant.</p>
<p id="c591a6f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The covenant in this case is intended to create a charge or obligation to pay a fixed sum of money to be “devoted to the maintenance of the roads, paths, parks, beach, sewers and such other public purposes as shall from time to time be determined by the party of the first part [the grantor], its successors or assigns.” It is an affirmative covenant to pay money for use in connection with, but not upon, the land which it is said is subject to the burden of the covenant. Does such a covenant “touch” or “concern” the land? These terms are not part of a statutory definition, a limitation placed by the State upon the power of the courts to enforce covenants intended to run with the land by the parties who entered into the covenants. Rather they are words used by courts in England in old cases to describe a limitation which the courts themselves created or to formulate a test which the courts have devised and which the courts voluntarily apply. Cf. <i>Spencer’s Case</i>, Coke, vol. 3, part 5, 16a; <i>Mayor of Congleton v. Pattison</i>, 10 East 130. In truth such a description or test so formulated is too vague to be of much assistance and judges and academic scholars alike have struggled, not with entire success, to formulate a test at once more satisfactory and more accurate. “It has been found impossible to state any absolute tests to determine what covenants touch and concern land and what do not. The question is one for the court to determine in the exercise of its best judgment upon the facts of each case.” <i>Clark on Covenants and Interests Running with Land</i>, p. 76.</p>
<p id="c591a6fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been suggested that a covenant which runs with the land must affect the legal relations — the advantages and the burdens — of the parties to the covenant, as owners of particular parcels of land and not merely as members of the community in general, such as taxpayers or owners of other land. That method of approach has the merit of realism. The test is based on the effect of the covenant rather than on technical distinctions. Does the covenant impose, on the one hand, a burden upon an interest in land, which on the other hand increases the value of a different interest in the same or related land?</p>
<p id="c591a6fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A promise to pay for something to be done in connection with the promisor’s land does not differ essentially from a promise by the promisor to do the thing himself, and both promises constitute, in a substantial sense, a restriction upon the owner’s right to use the land, and a burden upon the legal interest of the owner. On the other hand, a covenant to perform or pay for the performance of an affirmative act disconnected with the use of the land cannot ordinarily touch or concern the land in any substantial <span title="565" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-565">p. 565</span>degree. Thus, unless we exalt technical form over substance, the distinction between covenants which run with land and covenants which are personal, must depend upon the effect of the covenant on the legal rights which otherwise would flow from ownership of land and which are connected with the land. The problem then is: Does the covenant in purpose and effect substantially alter these rights?</p>
<p id="c591a6fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Looking at the problem presented in this case, it seems clear that the covenant may properly be said to touch and concern the land of the defendant and its burden should run with the land. True, it calls for payment of a sum of money to be expended for “public purposes” upon land other than the land conveyed by Neponsit Realty Company to plaintiff’s predecessor in title. By that conveyance the grantee, however, obtained not only title to particular lots, but an easement or right of common enjoyment with other property owners in roads, beaches, public parks or spaces and improvements in the same tract. For full enjoyment in common by the defendant and other property owners of these easements or rights, the roads and public places must be maintained. In order that the burden of maintaining public improvements should rest upon the land benefited by the improvements, the grantor exacted from the grantee of the land with its appurtenant easement or right of enjoyment a covenant that the burden of paying the cost should be inseparably attached to the land which enjoys the benefit. It is plain that any distinction or definition which would exclude such a covenant from the classification of covenants which “touch” or “concern” the land would be based on form and not on substance.</p>
<p id="c591a6fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another difficulty remains. Though between the grantor and the grantee there was privity of estate, the covenant provides that its benefit shall run to the assigns of the grantor who “may include a Property Owners’ Association which may hereafter be organized for the purposes referred to in this paragraph.” The plaintiff has been organized to receive the sums payable by the property owners and to expend them for the benefit of such owners. Various definitions have been formulated of “privity of estate” in connection with covenants that run with the land, but none of such definitions seems to cover the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant in this case. The plaintiff has not succeeded to the ownership of any property of the grantor. It does not appear that it ever had title to the streets or public places upon which charges which are payable to it must be expended. It does not appear that it owns any other property in the residential tract to which any easement or right of enjoyment in such property is appurtenant. It is created solely to act as the assignee of the benefit of the covenant, and it has no interest of its own in the enforcement of the covenant.</p>
<p id="c591a6fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The arguments that under such circumstances the plaintiff has no right of action to enforce a covenant running with the land are all based upon a distinction between the corporate property owners association and the property owners for whose benefit the association has been formed. If that distinction may be ignored, then the basis of the arguments is destroyed.</p>
<p id="c591a6ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The corporate plaintiff has been formed as a convenient instrument by which the property owners may advance their common interests. We do not ignore the corporate form when we recognize that the Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., is acting as the agent or representative of the Neponsit property owners. As we have <span title="566" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-566">p. 566</span>said in another case: when Neponsit Property Owners’ Association, Inc., “was formed, the property owners were expected to, and have looked to that organization as the medium through which enjoyment of their common right might be preserved equally for all.” <i>Matter of City of New York, Public Beach, Borough of Queens</i>, 269 N.Y. 64, 75, 199 N.E. 5, 9. Only blind adherence to an ancient formula devised to meet entirely different conditions could constrain the court to hold that a corporation formed as a medium for the enjoyment of common rights of property owners owns no property which would benefit by enforcement of common rights and has no cause of action in equity to enforce the covenant upon which such common rights depend. In substance if not in form the covenant is a restrictive covenant which touches and concerns the defendant’s land, and in substance, if not in form, there is privity of estate between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>

<p id="c591ce13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Defining the issue.</b> <i>Neponsit Property Owners Association</i>, decided in 1938 just before the explosion of residential common interest developments, considered whether the Neponsit Property Owners Association could enforce a covenant to pay four dollars per lot annually for the maintenance of roads, parks, beach, and other public amenities of the Neponsit development against the Emigrant Savings Bank. Because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant was an original signatory to the covenant, the question is whether the covenant ran with the land to bind or benefit succeeding owners of the property. In holding that the covenant could be enforced, the court decided two enormously important questions for residential developments: first, whether affirmative covenants to pay fees for the benefit of common amenities in the development touched and concerned the land; and second, whether property owners associations (rather than individual owners themselves) were in privity of estate and could enforce the restrictions.</p>
<p id="c591ce14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let’s first lay out the history of the covenants and the land. The Neponsit Realty Association owned and developed the area on Rockaway Peninsula as a 38-block, 1,600-home high-end residential community between 1910 and 1920. <i>See</i> Stewart E. Sterk, Neponsit Property Owners Association v. Emigrant Savings Bank, Property Stories 384 (2009). Robert and Charlotte Deyer purchased their home from the Realty Association in 1917. Their deed, like all others in the community, included numerous covenants, including the one at issue in the case. The Realty Association assigned its ability to enforce the covenants to the Neponsit Property Owners Association, to which all property owners in Neponsit automatically became members. In 1935, in the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Deyers lost their home to foreclosure, and Emigrant Savings Bank purchased it at a foreclosure sale.</p>

<p id="c591ce17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The residents of Neponsit have included well-known figures such as New York Mayor Abe Beame and, for a time, Judy Garland.</p>

<p id="c591ce18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What would have happened if Deyer had stopped paying the maintenance fees before the transfer <span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>from Neponsit Realty to the Neponsit Property Owners? The answer is simple: Deyer is bound by normal contract law to Neponsit Realty. However, both owners transferred their interests. Two issues appear. First, are the original covenanting parties still bound and benefited by the promise? Second, are their successors bound and benefitted by the promise?</p>
<p id="c591ce19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.  Rights and obligations of original covenanting parties.</b> In general, the original parties to a covenant will no longer have rights or obligations under a covenant after they have sold the land the covenant concerns.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c591ce1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Benefit of covenants held in gross.</b> First, does Neponsit Realty have the power to enforce the covenant once it sells all its land in the development? The answer is probably no for two reasons. First, a court will likely interpret the covenant to benefit the current owner of the land and not prior possessors, unless the agreement contains explicit language to the contrary. <i>Waikiki Malia Hotel, Inc. v. Kinkai Properties Limited Partnership</i>, 862 P.2d 1048, 1057-1059 (Haw. 1993).</p>
<p id="c591ce1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, even when the language of the covenant is clear, courts have traditionally refused to impose the burden of a covenant on future owners of the servient estate if the benefit of the covenant is held in gross, meaning that it benefits an individual or entity rather than land. An important exception is that many jurisdictions, by common law or statute, permit enforcement of covenants in gross when the covenant is held by a government entity or by a charity, like a land conservation trust or a historic preservation trust. <i>See Uniform Conservation Easement Act</i> (adopted in more than 20 states); <i>Bennett v. Commissioner of Food &amp; Agriculture,</i> 576 N.E.2d 1365 (Mass. 1991).</p>
<p id="c591ce1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Enforceability against original covenantor after the land is transferred.</b> Are the Deyers, the original promisors, still bound to ensure by the present performance of the covenant? The answer is almost certainly no. A prior owner is not legally responsible for the actions of the subsequent owners of the burdened land.</p>
<p id="c591ce1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Had the Deyers simply leased the land to Emigrant Savings Bank, the answer would probably be yes. Leases are treated differently from sales because landlords may include the covenant in any lease and end the leasehold and evict the tenant if the tenant violates the lease. The landlord’s failure to include such a covenant or to exercise the right to enforce such a covenant constitutes an independent breach of the covenant.</p>
</div>
<p id="c591ce1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Obligations of successors in interest.</b> Can the successor owners of the dominant estate (the owners of the other parcels in the Neponsit development) obtain relief against Emigrant Savings Bank, the subsequent possessor of the servient estate? The answer will be yes only if both the benefit and the burden run with the land. In addition, to determine what kind of relief is available, we must apply both the law of real covenants and the law of equitable servitudes. If the court follows traditional distinctions, damages are only available for real covenants, while injunctive relief is only available for equitable servitudes.</p>
<p id="c591ce1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the law of <b>real covenants</b>, land use restrictions run with the land when (1) the covenant is in <b>writing</b>; (2) the grantor <b>intended</b> the restriction to run with the <span title="568" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-568">p. 568</span>land on both sides, binding future owners of the servient estate and benefiting future owners of the dominant estate; (3) the restriction <b>touches and concerns</b> both the dominant and servient estates; and (4) <b>privity of estate</b> exists between the original covenanting parties (<b>horizontal privity</b>) and between those parties and succeeding owners (<b>vertical privity</b>). <b>Equitable servitudes</b> law contains most of these elements, but replaces privity of estate with <b>notice</b> of the covenant to the owner of servient estate. Notice was not originally required to enforce a real covenant, but almost all courts today require notice for enforcement of a real covenant as well. The <i>Restatement (Third),</i> which substantially modifies the privity and touch and concern requirements, is discussed separately in §3.2.B.</p>
<p id="c591f530-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four of the five requirements are <i>formalities</i>, while only one (the touch and concern test) is <i>substantive</i>. Formal requirements regulate the manner in which a right or obligation is created; individuals who wish to create the right or obligation may do so as long as they adhere to the formalities. They are not designed to prevent or discourage particular behavior; rather, they are rules designed to ensure that actors communicate their intentions clearly, both to each other and to the judges who are empowered to enforce their agreements. Duncan Kennedy, <i>Form and Substance in Private Law Adjudication</i>, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1685, 1691 (1976). Substantive requirements, on the other hand, limit the ability of individuals to create certain rights. They “prevent people from engaging in particular activities because those activities are morally wrong or otherwise flatly undesirable.” <i>Id.</i> No amount of careful planning will enable an owner to avoid such a requirement. We will start with the formal requirements (writing, notice, intent, and privity) and then discuss the substantive touch and concern test.</p>
<p id="c591f531-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Writing complying with the Statute of Frauds.</b> Like all transfers of property interests lasting more than a year, the covenant must be created in a writing signed by the grantor and otherwise complying with the Statute of Frauds to be valid. Once the covenant is created, the writing need not be repeated in subsequent transfers of the land. Here, the written covenant in the deed transferring the land from Neponsit Realty to the Deyers clearly satisfies the writing requirement.</p>

Some states may require that the restriction be specifically mentioned in the deed or lease when individual lots are sold, even if only by reference to the earlier recorded declaration or plat. Most states, however, find that a covenant in a prior-recorded declaration or plat meets the writing requirement. <i>Conway v.

Inquiry notice of covenants is less likely than inquiry notice of easements, such as rights of way, which a buyer can often visually observe. Some courts have found, however, that a uniform pattern of residential development places a reasonable buyer on notice of the potential presence of restrictive covenants. <i>See, e.g., Sanborn v. McLean</i>, 206 N.W. 496 (Mich. 1925). In <i>Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Dolgencorp, Inc.</i>, 964 So. 2d 261 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007), the court found that a corporation with 7,800 stores in shopping plazas across America was on inquiry notice that the anchor tenant likely had a covenant preventing competing grocery stores in the plaza. Is this finding justified? In most cases, however, the primary inquiry is likely to be conducted by researching the registry of deeds to find any relevant recorded restrictions. That brings us to constructive notice.</p>

A reasonable purchaser is expected to search the title to find out whether the property is burdened by any land use restrictions. The facts of <i>Neponsit</i> state that every deed in Emigrant Savings Bank’s chain of title provided that the conveyances were “subject to covenants and restrictions of former deeds of record,” implying that the Deyer deed was recorded, so Emigrant Savings Bank was on constructive notice.</p>

Neponsit Realty might have, for example, pledged to a prior purchaser to restrict all its remaining land in the development to single-family residences, but only recorded the covenant with that purchaser’s deed. States disagree on whether a subsequent purchaser is on notice of the covenant. The majority of courts hold that a reasonable record search includes all grants made by the original owner regarding nearby or contiguous land while the grantor owned the property. Because title searches in the United States are typically made by looking under the name of the grantor, rather than the specific location of the property, these courts hold that purchasers are on constructive notice of restrictions by the grantor recorded regarding other property. A substantial minority of courts, however, hold that the purchaser is only bound by those restrictions appearing in the chain of title for the burdened property itself.</p>

Intent to run with the land.</b> Intent to run with the land may be made explicit, as it is in the Neponsit deed, with language declaring that it is on behalf of the owner’s “successors or assigns” or that the covenant “runs with the land.” What happens if the deed or lease does not include such language? Courts generally hold that appurtenant covenants — those benefitting some land — are presumptively intended to run with the benefited and burdened land. <i>See Sun Oil Co. v. Trent Auto Wash, Inc.,</i> 150 N.W.2d 818 (Mich. 1967) (holding that a covenant prohibiting use of land to operate a gas station was intended to run with the land); <i>Runyon v.

However, some courts require clear evidence of intent to run. <i>Charping v. J.P. Scurry &amp; Co</i>., 372 S.E.2d 120 (S.C. 1988); <i>Tennsco Corp. v. Attea,</i> 2002 WL 1298808 (Tenn. Ct.

Privity of estate.</b> The concept of privity of estate contains the core principle of servitudes law: one piece of property is burdened for the benefit of another (so-called <b>horizontal privity</b>) and these benefits and burdens run to succeeding owners of both parcels (<b>vertical privity</b>). At the same time, the law of privity developed maddeningly complicated technical limitations that were unrelated to any legitimate policy concerns. The modern trend is to relax or do away with the privity requirement, but a number of states still retain it. <i>See Beeren &amp; Barry Investments, L.L.C. v. AHC, Inc.</i>, 671 S.E.2d 147 (Va. 2009); <i>Cunningham v. City of Greensboro</i>, 711 S.E.2d 477 (N.C. Ct. App. 2011). Although privity was not traditionally required to obtain injunctive relief for a covenant as an equitable servitude, courts that maintain the requirement may not make this distinction, or may require privity to enforce obligations to pay assessments, as in <i>Neponsit</i>.</p>

Because land use restrictions both limit the free use of land and may make it less alienable, they were traditionally thought to be unjustified unless the burden on land was outweighed by a compensating benefit to some other property owner. The horizontal privity requirement served to promote this purpose.</p>

Similarly, a covenant in a lease (transferring a leasehold) or a mortgage (transferring a lien or right to foreclose) will satisfy the horizontal privity requirement.</p>

Because the neighbors already own their land, they are not in privity of estate. An example of the second problem is a covenant made one week after the sale of a parcel; this does not satisfy the privity requirement because at that moment the grantor no longer owns the property of the grantee.</p>

Vertical privity.</b> Vertical privity means that the original covenanting parties transferred their interests to the subsequent possessors of the parcel. It would include, for example, sale, lease, inheritance, and foreclosure, but not adverse possession, because the prior owner did not formally transfer her interest. Some states follow a<b> strict vertical privity</b> standard, requiring that the grantor does not retain any future interests in the land. Thus vertical privity would be present when an owner sells her property but not when she leases it. <i>See Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Dolgencorp, LLC</i>, 746 F.3d 1008 (11th Cir. 2014) (finding that Missouri law required strict vertical privity, so Winn-Dixie could not enforce its covenant with shopping center against lessees in shopping center).

In the deed, the Kostseas covenanted not to use their remaining parcel for a “discount store,” but only for certain purposes, which included a “drug store.” 122 Trust then sold its parcel to Whitinsville Plaza, and Whitinsville established a discount store on the land. The Kotseas subsequently leased part of their abutting land to a CVS. Whitinsville claimed the CVS was a discount store, not just a drug store, violating the covenant. Under a relaxed vertical privity standard, Whitinsville could demand damages from both the Kotseas and CVS, but under a strict standard, it could demand damages only from the Kosteas, and not their lessee.</p>

Substantive requirements: the “touch and concern” test.</b> Courts have traditionally allowed covenants to run with the land only if they “touch and concern” the land, meaning that they affect the use or value of the land itself. The test is intended to identify the kinds of obligations that should attach to the land rather than the individuals making the agreement. “Where the burdens and benefits created by the covenant may exist independently from the parties’ ownership interests in land, the covenant does not touch and concern the land and will not run with the land.” <i>Runyon v. Paley</i>, 416 S.E.2d 177, 183 (N.C. 1992); <i>see Vulcan Materials Co. v. Miller</i>, 691 So. 2d 908, 914 (Miss. 1997) (“A covenant that imposes a burden on real property for the benefit of the grantor personally does not follow the land into the possession of an assignee”); 7 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions,</i> §61.04; <i>Restatement of Property</i> §537 (1944).</p>
<p id="c5924367-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the burden side, an obligation touches and concerns the burdened estate if it affects the use and enjoyment of the land. On the benefit side, an obligation touches and concerns a dominant estate if it improves enjoyment of that land or increases its market value. Restrictive covenants that limit land use, such as covenants limiting the land to residential purposes or prohibiting the sale of liquor on the land will generally touch and concern both the dominant and servient estates. They touch and concern the servient estate because they restrict the use of the land; they touch and concern the dominant estate because the restriction is intended to benefit the owners of the dominant estates whoever they happen to be and because most purchasers of the dominant estates would consider the right to enforce the covenant as increasing the value or attractiveness of the benefited land.</p>
<p id="c5924368-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional refusal to enforce covenants when the benefit is held in gross (note 2.a, <i>supra</i>) is an application of the touch and concern test.

This cost is thought to be justified if there is a sufficient compensating benefit to other land. But when no land is benefited this presumption falls away, and the autonomy interests of current owners trumps the power of the “dead hand” of prior owners to control the property. <i>See Garland v. Rosenshein</i>, 649 N.E.2d 756 (Mass. 1995); <i>Lakewood Racquet Club, Inc. v. Jensen</i>, 232 P.3d 1147 (Wash. App. 2010).</p>
<p id="c5924369-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Affirmative obligations to pay fees, like that in <i>Neponsit</i>, have often caused problems for the courts. Payment of money may appear to be more in the realm of contract law than an obligation that should attach to the land itself. As the court recognized in <i>Neponsit,</i> however, when the fees are used to maintain the common elements of a community, it does touch and concern the land by preserving the value of the properties in a community.</p>
<p id="c592436a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the obligation to pay property owners association dues is now well established, other cases are more controversial. For example, in <i>Castlebrook, Limited v. Dayton Properties Limited Partnership,</i> 604 N.E.2d 808 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992), the court held that a covenant to return a tenant’s security deposit did not touch and concern the land and hence was not binding on a successor landlord. In <i>Chesapeake Ranch Club, Inc. v. C.R.C. United Members, Inc</i>., 483 A.2d 1334 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1984), the court held that a covenant to pay dues to belong to a recreational facility did not touch and concern the land. The current trend, however, is to enforce such obligations. <i>See Nickerson v. Green Valley Recreation, Inc.</i>, 265 P.3d 1108, 1115-1116 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011) (enforcing covenant to pay membership fees and collecting similar cases). Should a homeowner in a subdivision be bound by a covenant that requires the owner to pay dues to a health club? Would your answer change if the club admits anyone as a member (not just homeowners in the neighborhood), is profitable, and charges $1,000 a year while the owner has no interest in using the facilities?</p>

Recognizing that covenants are now indispensable tools of land use development, it seeks to merge and simplify the law of covenants and easements and further the trend of easing restrictions on covenants running with the land. Restatements are not authoritative sources of law, but they are often cited in court opinions as persuasive indications of the direction in which courts are or should be moving. No jurisdiction has adopted the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> in its entirety, although several courts have relied on aspects of it.</p>
<p id="c592436e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> proposes to abolish the distinction between real covenants and equitable servitudes; abolish the privity requirement; permit enforcement of covenants in gross; and replace the touch and concern test with a review for reasonableness that more explicitly incorporates policy concerns. As you will see, however, the substance of these factors still plays a limited role in the <i>Restatement (Third)</i>, and many courts continue to rely on traditional requirements.</p>

Abolishing the distinction between negative easements, real covenants, and equitable servitudes.</b> The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> drops the terms “real covenant” and “equitable servitudes” and “negative easement,” encompassing all within the category of “covenants running with the land.” §§1.2-1.4. Although some courts have embraced this change, see<i> Dunning v. Buending</i>, 247 P.3d 1145 (N.M. Ct. App. 2010), other courts still commonly use the terms “negative easement” and “equitable servitude.” <i>See </i><i>Nordbye v. BRCP/GM Ellington</i>, 266 P.3d 92, 102 (Or. Ct.

The drafters argue that although the requirement may have helped to ensure intent and notice of the restriction, the intent and notice requirements serve these interests more directly. <i>Id.</i> The abolishment of the horizontal privity requirement followed several jurisdictions that were critical of the rule. Nevertheless, some courts continue to demand horizontal privity before finding an enforceable covenant. <i>See, e.g., Cunningham v. Greensboro</i>, 711 S.E.2d 477, 485-486 (N.C. Ct.

Abolishing the touch and concern requirement.</b> The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> seeks to “permit innovative land-development practices using servitudes without the sometimes irrational impediments imposed by the touch and concern doctrine.” <i>Supra</i> §3.2. The <i>Restatement</i> proposes abolishing the touch and concern requirement, and shifting the burden to those challenging enforcement to prove that the requirement violates public policy for reasons that include, but are not limited to, that the servitude (1) is arbitrary, spiteful, or capricious; (2) unreasonably burdens a fundamental constitutional right; (3) imposes an unreasonable restraint on alienation under §3.4 or §3.5; (4) imposes an unreasonable restraint on trade or competition under §3.6; or (5) is unconscionable under §3.7. <i>Id.</i> §3.1. In some places, however, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> seems to reintroduce the touch and concern element through the back door by providing that burdens having “nothing to do with ownership, occupancy, or use of the land” may be invalidated as arbitrary or capricious, <i>id.</i> §3.2 cmt. e, or unreasonable indirect restraints on alienation of land. <i>Id.</i> §3.5. Similarly, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> specifically provides that the benefit of covenants need not touch and concern the land, <i>id.</i> §2.6, but requires that the beneficiary of the covenant is reasonably identifiable, <i>id.</i> §7.13, and has a “legitimate interest” in enforcing it. <i>Id.</i> §8.1.</p>
<p id="c5924372-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the <i>Restatement (Third)</i>, many courts still retain some version of the touch and concern requirement. <i>Dunning v.

Fairfield Harbourside Condominium Association</i>, 652 S.E.2d 378 (S.C. 2007) (recreation fees were invalid because they did not touch and concern the land); <i>Deep Water Brewing, LLC v.

App. 2015) (applying strict construction rule to find home day care business did not violate covenant). There is a longstanding trend, however, of recognizing that covenants may in fact enhance land value, and abandoning strict construction to interpret covenants to fulfill the intent of the parties. <i>See Powell v.

The developer sells some of the lots, but is unable to sell more to people interested in them for residential purposes, and sells the remainder to a buyer who plans to build a big box store.

The map included three parcels labeled “Prospect Park,” “Webster Park,” and “Plaza.” These parcels were about five times the size of the proposed residential lots, and were irregularly shaped. The rest of the parcels in the subdivision were sold to individual homeowners; the deeds did not mention any rights with respect to the park parcels specifically, but all referred to the recorded subdivision map. More than a hundred years later, the owners of the lots, the heirs of the original developer, sought to sell the undeveloped park parcels to buyers who wanted to build residences on them. Owners of other homes in the subdivision claim that the parcels are subject to an equitable servitude prohibiting development. Is there a sufficient writing to create a covenant preventing development? <i>Compare Reagan v. Brissey,</i> 844 N.E.2d 672 (Mass. 2006) (yes) <i>and Agua Fria Save the Open Space Association v.

<p id="c592b8bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should covenants normally be enforced by damages or injunctive relief? Traditional contract law holds that damages are the usual remedy for breach of contract while injunctions are awarded only when damages are inadequate. Property law, however, represents one of the most important areas in which damages are often thought inadequate because of the unique value attached to the <i>location</i> of land and the desire to use particular unique structures. The granting of an injunction, however, has always been discretionary.</p>
<p id="c592b8bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider Judge Richard Posner’s explanation for the predilection for injunctions in a case involving breach of an anticompetitive covenant. In <i>Walgreen Co. v. Sara Creek Property Co.</i>, 966 F.2d 273 (7th Cir. 1992), a shopping center landlord (Sara Creek) <span title="578" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-578">p. 578</span>breached an anticompetitive covenant in a lease with a tenant pharmacy (Walgreens) by arranging for a department store containing a pharmacy (Phar-Mor) to replace an anchor tenant whose business was doing badly. The issue was whether the covenant could be enforced by an injunction ordering the landlord not to allow a competitor to operate in the center or whether an injunction would be denied and the plaintiff relegated to damages. The Seventh Circuit upheld the trial court’s decision to issue an injunction.</p>
<p id="c592b8bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Posner explained that damages are normally the remedy for breach of contract because the promisee receives damages to compensate for losing the benefit of the bargain, making the promisee indifferent as between performance and breach, while the promisor who is relieved from the promise can obtain the benefit of a more profitable bargain with another party, thereby shifting resources to a more valuable use without harming the promisee. If “the value of Phar-Mor’s occupancy of the anchor premises may exceed the cost to Walgreen of facing increased competition[, . . . ] society will be better off if Walgreen is paid its damages, equal to that cost, and Phar-Mor is allowed to move in rather than being kept out by an injunction.” <i>Id.</i> at 274. However, Judge Posner concluded that in this case, an injunction was more likely to achieve the efficient result than damages. First, he noted that injunctive relief ordering compliance with the covenant would not necessarily end the matter; the parties could bargain for a contrary result. In contrast, damages are set by the court or by a jury rather than by the parties through private bargaining. Unless transaction costs block private bargaining, a number reached by the parties is more likely to represent the actual value of the entitlements in question than a number reached by a third party. If the parties can reach an agreement at an amount chosen by them, both will be better off. “A battle of experts is a less reliable method of determining the actual cost to Walgreen of facing new competition than negotiations between Walgreen and Sara Creek over the price at which Walgreen would feel adequately compensated for having to face that competition.” <i>Id.</i> at 276.</p>
<p id="c592b8be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, Judge Posner noted that transaction costs might block negotiation between the parties since they were in a situation of “bilateral monopoly” in which “two parties can deal only with each other: the situation that an injunction creates. . . . Walgreen can ‘sell’ its injunctive right only to Sara Creek, and Sara Creek can ‘buy’ Walgreen’s surrender of its right to enjoin the leasing of the anchor tenant’s space to Phar-Mor only from Walgreen.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c592b8bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lack of alternatives in bilateral monopoly creates a bargaining range, and the costs of negotiating to a point within that range may be high. Suppose the cost to Walgreen of facing the competition of Phar-Mor at the Southgate Mall would be $1 million, and the benefit to Sara Creek of leasing to Phar-Mor would be $2 million. Then at any price between those figures for a waiver of Walgreen’s injunctive right both parties would be better off, and we expect parties to bargain around a judicial assignment of legal rights if the assignment is inefficient. R.H. Coase, <i>The Problem of Social Cost</i>, 3 J.L. &amp; Econ. 1 (1960). But each of the parties would like to engross as much of the bargaining range as possible — Walgreen to press the price toward $2 million, Sara Creek to depress it toward $1 million. With so much at stake, both parties will have an incentive to devote substantial resources of time and money to the negotiation process. The process may <span title="579" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-579">p. 579</span>even break down, if one or both parties want to create for future use a reputation as a hard bargainer; and if it does break down, the injunction will have brought about an inefficient result. All these are in one form or another costs of the injunctive process that can be avoided by substituting damages.</p>
</div>
<p id="c592b8c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 276. Thus, both damages and injunctions have both costs and benefits. The benefits of an injunction are that the parties get to bargain to determine who values the entitlement the most and to set the appropriate price; they also avoid the time and expense of litigation and the inaccuracy of damage awards set by a third party who is less knowledgeable about the benefits of anticompetitive covenants and their value to the parties than the parties themselves. The benefits of damages are that litigation can produce a result where transaction costs might prevent the parties from bargaining to a mutually beneficial result; indeed, the possibility that a jury would determine the appropriate level of damages might be an incentive to get the parties to agree to an appropriate resolution, thereby promoting rather than discouraging bargaining. In any event, Judge Posner concluded that the trial judge appropriately determined that “the costs (including forgone benefits) of the damages remedy would exceed the costs (including forgone benefits) of an injunction.” <i>Id.</i> at 278.</p>
<p id="c592b8c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Ward Farnsworth criticizes the kind of reasoning presented by Judge Posner by noting that in nuisance cases he examined, the parties never bargained to rearrange the results reached by the court both because the winning party believed it deserved to win and because of hard feelings generated by the dispute, making the parties unwilling to compromise and transfer property rights even if this would otherwise have been in their mutual best interest. Ward Farnsworth, <i>Do Parties to Nuisance Cases Bargain After Judgment? A Glimpse Inside the Cathedral,</i> 66 U. Chi. L. Rev. 373 (1999). This may suggest that significant transaction costs may bar bargaining between the owners of the servient and dominant estates.</p>
<p id="c592b8c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have also had trouble with affirmative covenants that require owners to continue particular uses, although some courts have enforced such covenants. <i>Compare Shalimar Association v. D.O.C. Enterprises, Inc</i>., 688 P.2d 682 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1984) (requiring an owner to continue operating a golf course to comply with an affirmative covenant) <i>with Oceanside Community Associates v. Oceanside Land Co.,</i> 195 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Ct. App. 1983) (refusing to grant an injunction ordering an owner to renovate and operate a golf club but imposing a lien on the property for lost value to the dominant estates resulting from the failure to comply with the covenant).</p>

This expansion of the covenant form raises many new questions. What is necessary to bind unit owners to common covenants? What are the rights of unit owners to enforce the covenants against each other? What are the rights of the unit owners against the developer? Finally, what are the boundaries on what either developers or unit owners can demand of an owner? The doctrine of implied reciprocal negative servitudes responds to some of these questions, while the statutes and common law that govern common interest developments respond to others. Finally, substantive limitations on the enforcement of covenants in general, discussed in §5, have had to adapt to the growth of common interest developments.</p>

<p id="c59306ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An owner of a large tract of land wants to subdivide it and sell 100 lots. She wants to ensure that the lots are restricted to residential use and each lot to a single-family home. To accomplish this, she places covenants in each deed by which the purchaser agrees for herself, her heirs and assigns, to restrict the property to use as a single-family home. Does this accomplish her purpose under either the law of real covenants or equitable servitudes? For perhaps surprising reasons, the answer is no.</p>
<p id="c59306f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To illustrate this, imagine the following situation. <i>O</i> subdivides a parcel, and sells lots to Buyers 1, then Buyer 2, then Buyer 3, then Buyer 4. In the deeds with lots 1, 2, and 3, the buyers covenant to <i>O</i> to only use the land for residential purposes. The covenants are presumed to benefit <i>O</i>’s remaining land. Each buyer who purchases <i>O</i>’s land after the covenant is made, therefore, gets the benefit of the covenants already made benefitting O’s land, and can enforce them against the earlier buyers. But earlier purchasers could not: <i>O</i> simply received a promise, but did not make a promise to restrict its remaining land. Buyer 3, for example, could prevent Buyer 1 from using the land for nonresidential purposes, but Buyer 1 could not restrain Buyer 3. Nobody, moreover, could stop Buyer 4 from using that parcel as she wished, because the parcel was sold without a covenant.</p>
<p id="c59306f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of <b>implied reciprocal negative servitudes</b> (also called implied reciprocal negative easements) solves both problems by implying that when a owner sells a number of parcels with evidence of intent to create a <b>common plan</b> or <b>scheme</b> of development then (1) covenants made to the seller benefit all parcels within the plan; and (2) all parcels within the plan are bound by the covenants. The courts reasoned that owners of other parcels within the common plan area were intended third-party beneficiaries of the agreements made with the developer, and that it would be unjust to permit owners to violate the covenants despite the lack of restrictions in their chain of title. As the cases below illustrate, the question then becomes what is sufficient evidence of intent to create a common plan, and what land comes within the plan.</p>

The declaration also constitutes a promise by the developer to restrict the remaining lots when they are sold; this constitutes a grantor covenant<i>.</i> If a declaration is filed, an earlier buyer who sues a later buyer for violating a covenant can base her claim on both the grantor covenant and the grantee covenant.</p>

The central issue is usually the existence of a general plan of development. The lots retained by the owner, or lots sold by the owner from the development without express restrictions to a grantee with notice of the restrictions in the other deeds, are burdened with what is variously called an implied reciprocal negative easement, or an implied equitable servitude, or negative implied restrictive covenant, that they may not be used in violation of the restrictive covenants burdening the lots sold with the express restrictions.

<p id="c5932d0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September of 1947 Stanley and Sarah Agnes Hornsby (the Hornsbys), together with Charles and Bernice McCormick (McCormicks) platted a subdivision around Lake Travis from their commonly owned property in Travis County. They named the <span title="582" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-582">p. 582</span>subdivision “Beby’s Ranch Subdivision No. 1.” The plat itself did not state any restrictions on land-use. The plat divided the property into seven blocks designated alphabetically “A” through “G.” The plat did not further subdivide blocks C, D, E, and F, but blocks A, B, and G were divided into thirty-one lots. The subdivision is on a peninsula-like tract that extends into the lake, so that much of it has lake frontage. All of the platted lots are lakefront lots. Block G is located on the point of the peninsula. Block F is located on a hill and is surrounded by lakefront lots.</p>
<p id="c5932d0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Block F is also referred to as the “hilltop.”</p>

By partition deed the McCormicks received title to all of Blocks A, B, and C, and the Hornsbys got Blocks D, E, F, and G. Over the next several years, the Hornsbys and the McCormicks conveyed twenty-nine parcels of land from Beby’s No. 1 to third parties or one another. Stanley Hornsby, a real estate attorney, and his law partner Louise Kirk, handled most of the legal work relating to the sale of lots, and the McCormicks made most of the sales. A real estate agent advertised some of the lakefront lots for sale in 1955, describing them as in “a restricted subdivision.” Each deed from the Hornsbys and the McCormicks contained substantially the same restrictive covenants, including, among others, covenants: (1) prohibiting business or commercial use of the land conveyed; (2) restricting the land to residential use with only one dwelling per lot; and (3) providing that the restrictions could be changed by ³⁄₄ of the property owners within the subdivision “voting according to front footage holdings on the 715 contour line” of the lake. In 1946 the McCormicks had conveyed two of the lakefront lots unburdened by any deed restrictions. When the original grantee conveyed the two lots to third parties in 1954, he had Hornsby draft the deeds. The deeds contained the restrictions that the property could not be used for any business or commercial purposes and that the restrictions could be altered by the “³⁄₄ vote” along the 715 contour. Thus all lots conveyed ended up with substantially similar restrictions. All were lakefront lots, and voting rights under the restrictive covenants apparently were limited to lots with lake frontage.</p>
<p id="c5932d13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hornsbys retained ownership of lots 4 through 8 in Block G and all of Block F. Both Hornsbys are now deceased, and the retained property passed to their devisees. The present dispute arose when the Hornsby devisees contracted to sell Thomas R. Pollock all of Block F and lots 4 and 5 in Block G for the purpose of building a marina, private club, and condominium development. Charles Evans and other owners whose deeds contained the restrictive covenants sued for equitable relief under the implied reciprocal negative easement doctrine. They sought declaration that the restrictive covenants enumerated above expressly imposed by deed upon their property were implied upon the Hornsby retained property. They further sought an injunction to prevent the Hornsby devisees from conveying the property without such deed restrictions.</p>
<p id="c5932d14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trial was to the court. The testimony sharply conflicted as to Stanley Hornsby’s oral representations of his intentions for the retained property. The evidence ranged from testimony that could reasonably be interpreted to mean that Hornsby intended all the subdivision property to be restricted, to testimony lending itself to the conclusion that Hornsby intended the retained property to be unrestricted in all respects.</p>
<p id="c5932d15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The trial court held that the original subdividers, Stanley and Sarah Agnes Hornsby and Charles and Bernice McCormick, intended the restrictions to apply to all the lakefront lots but not to the hilltop. The court of appeals reversed, holding that none of the retained lots were restricted, on the ground that for the implied reciprocal negative easement doctrine to apply, the original grantors must have intended that the entire subdivision be similarly restricted.]</p>

<p id="c5932d17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Provisions in restrictive covenants that the restrictions may be waived or modified by the consent of three-fourths of the lot owners constitute strong evidence that there is a general scheme or plan of development furthered by the restrictive covenants. The voting rights in the present case clearly attached only to lakefront lots. It was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that the restrictions were meant to apply only to the lakefront lots. The legal question is whether all the tracts in the development must be intended to be subject to the restrictions for the implied reciprocal negative easement doctrine to apply to any of the retained lots. We find it immaterial whether the question is phrased as whether the plan may be that some tracts are unrestricted while others are restricted, or whether the plan need only apply to certain similarly situated lots. We hold that the general plan or scheme may be that the restrictions only apply to certain well-defined similarly situated lots for the doctrine of implied reciprocal negative easements to apply as to such lots. Logical extensions of Texas decisions, as well as decisions from sister states, support our conclusion.</p>
<p id="c5932d18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Particularly] in point is the Kentucky case of <i>Bellemeade Co. v. Priddle</i>, 503 S.W.2d 734 (Ky. Ct. App. 1974). There the owners had platted and recorded sections I, II, III, IV and V of the Bellemeade subdivision. Sections I, II, III and IV had been marketed as restricted to one-family residential uses, but section V was a tract of approximately 12 acres adjacent to a major United States highway, different in character from the other sections. When the plat of section I went to record, there was a contract with the real estate firm marketing the subdivision which gave it the exclusive right to sell residential lots, but there was a separate provision giving those agents the exclusive right to sell, lease or develop section V as multi-family duplex housing, a shopping center and parking area. There was evidence of negotiations about section V with prospective buyers or developers for commercial enterprises both before and after the platting of the subdivision. After reviewing the marketing evidence, the court concluded there was no evidence that any lots in section V were offered for sale for residential purposes or evidence of confusion as to the developers’ intent. The court held that the implied reciprocal negative easement doctrine applied as to retained lots in sections I through IV, but that section V was not part of the restricted area and could be sold for construction of a proposed Holiday Inn motel.</p>
<p id="c5932d19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have reviewed the record and find there is some evidence to support all trial court findings that were attacked in the court of appeals. Because there were factual sufficiency points raised in the court of appeals upon which that court has not ruled, we remand this cause to the court of appeals for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="c5932d1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Sanborn v. McLean, 206 N.W. 496 (Mich. 1925).</b> Defendant Christina McLean owned land on which she and her husband sought to build a gas station. It would be located behind their house in a “high grade neighborhood” on Collingwood Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. All of the lots fronting on that portion of the road had once been owned by a single owner who imposed restrictive covenants on 53 of the 91 lots, limiting them to residential purposes. No restrictions appear in the chain of title to <span title="585" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-585">p. 585</span>the McLean lot. The court held that the McLeans were on constructive notice of the restrictions in the deeds to neighboring properties and that the uniform residential character of the surrounding properties also put the McLeans on inquiry notice to determine whether there were restrictive covenants on neighboring lots that might be interpreted to create a plan to restrict the entire neighborhood to residential uses. Since a majority of the lots were restricted, the court inferred an intent to create a common plan even though a great number of the properties did not have restrictions in their line of title. Given evidence of an intent to create a common plan and constructive or inquiry notice on purchasers like the McLeans, the court imposed an implied reciprocal negative servitude restricting the McLean lot to residential purposes.</p>
<p id="c5932d1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Riley v. Bear Creek Planning Committee, 551 P.2d 1213 (Cal. 1976).</b> Ernest and Jewel Riley built a “snow tunnel” or “covered walkway” on their lot without first obtaining approval of the architectural control committee empowered by a recorded declaration to regulate land use in the area. The Rileys had purchased the first lot in the residential subdivision upon the representation of the seller that the properties would be subject to the recorded restrictions that they were given before buying the lot. However, the declaration containing the restrictions was not recorded until after they had purchased their lot; moreover, because of a mistake by the title company, their deed did not mention the restrictions. Although it appeared clear that buyers who purchased lots after the declaration was recorded were subject to the restrictions, the California Supreme Court ruled that the Rileys were not subject to the restrictions because there was no writing in their deed limiting the use of their land and the intent of the owner to impose those restrictions was not binding on them. Evidence of their knowledge of the grantor’s intent to impose restrictions was not admissible under the parol evidence rule (which excluded admission of oral evidence that contradicts a writing in certain cases) and the Statute of Frauds (which required interests in land to be in writing to be enforceable), <i>id.</i> at 1221-1222:</p>

<p id="c5932d1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[There] is a practical consideration favoring the rule. The grantee of property subject to mutually enforceable restrictions takes not just a servient tenement but, as owner of a dominant tenement, acquires a property interest in all other lots similarly burdened for the benefit of his property. That fact significantly affects the expectations of the parties and inevitably enters into the exchange of consideration between grantor and grantee. Even though the grantor omits to include the mutual restrictions in deeds to parcels thereafter severed from the servient tenement, those who take such property with notice, actual or constructive, of the restrictions are bound thereby. Thus, the recording statutes operate to protect the expectations of the grantee and secure to him the full benefit of the exchange for which he bargained. Where, however, mutually enforceable equitable servitudes are sought to be created outside the recording statutes, the vindication of the expectations of the original grantee, and for that matter succeeding grantees, is hostage not only to the good faith of the grantor, but, even assuming good faith, to the vagaries of proof by extrinsic evidence of actual notice on the part of grantees who thereafter take a part of the servient tenement either from the common grantor or as successors in interest to his grantees. The uncertainty thus introduced into subdivision development would in many cases circumvent any plan for the orderly and harmonious <span title="586" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-586">p. 586</span>development of such properties and result in a crazy-quilt pattern of uses frustrating the bargained-for expectations of lot owners in the tract.</p>

<p id="c5932d1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Matthew Tobriner dissented, <i>id.</i> at 1222:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5932d1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I cannot subscribe to the majority’s conclusion that a buyer of a subdivision lot, who takes his deed with actual knowledge of a general plan of mutual restrictions applicable to the entire subdivision and who conducts himself for many years in a manner which demonstrates his belief that such restrictions apply to his property, thereafter violate all such restrictions with impunity simply because the restrictions were inadvertently omitted from his individual deed. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, we need not decree this inequitable result in order to prevent fraud to maintain security in land titles; the very antithesis — a ruling that a buyer with <i>actual knowledge</i> of restrictions is thereby bound — ensures fairness and promotes security in land transactions; it implements the intention of both the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p id="c5932d1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s holding will permit plaintiffs in this case to ignore restrictions designed to preserve natural beauty and property values in a carefully planned residential community. Although the use of all other lots in the community will continue to be restricted, plaintiffs will be free to subdivide their land into any number of small building sites, construct apartments or rent commercial space, ignore building lines and obstruct views from neighboring lots, raise livestock, and strip the land by removing trees and shrubs.</p>
<p id="c5935430-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common sense and substantive justice dictates that the plaintiffs should not be free to violate such restrictions. At the time of purchase plaintiffs had actual knowledge of those restrictions; the restrictions formed a part of the consideration exchanged by the parties. The restrictions continue to enhance the value of plaintiffs’ individual lot because all other property owners in the subdivision are bound thereby.</p>
<p id="c5935431-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, I would hold that the evidence offered by defendant committee is admissible to establish the existence of building restrictions binding upon plaintiffs.</p>

<p id="c5935434-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Implied reciprocal negative servitudes.</b> The doctrine of implied reciprocal negative servitudes, or reciprocal negative easements, was invented to deal with the intent, notice, and privity of estate issues that arise when a developer imposes grantee covenants on all lots in a residential subdivision and when the developer intentionally or inadvertently leaves those restrictions off some of the lots.</p>
<p id="c5935435-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A common plan can be shown by various factors, such as the presence of restrictions in all or most deeds to property in the area, a recorded plat (map) showing the restrictions; the presence of restrictions in the last deed (since the grantor retains no land left to be benefited, the suggestion is that the intended beneficiaries of the promise are the other lots in the neighborhood); observance by owners of similar development of their land and conformity to the written restrictions; language stating that the covenants are intended to run with the land; and the recording of a declaration stating that the covenants are intended to be mutually enforceable. Gerald Korngold, <i>Private Land Use Arrangements: Easements, Real Covenants, and Equitable Servitudes</i> §9.09, at 301-302 (1990). Evidence tending to show the absence of a common plan is that some deeds are unrestricted and that the restrictions are nonuniform.</p>
<p id="c5935436-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>Some courts, however, reject the doctrine of implied reciprocal negative servitudes applied in <i>Evans v. Pollock</i>, holding instead that reciprocal covenants will be enforced only if deeds in the chain of title themselves refer to the covenants or the developer records a declaration containing the restrictions prior to the sale of the properties sought to be burdened and benefited by them. <i>Citizens for Covenant Compliance v. Anderson,</i> 906 P.2d 1314, 1326 (Cal. 1995).</p>
<p id="c5935437-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. The problem of unrestricted lots.</b> What happens if the developer fails to record a declaration or plat and imposes restrictive grantee covenants in most, but not all, of the deeds to property in the subdivision, and the grantor makes no promise to restrict the remaining lots? Can the owners of lots restricted by grantee covenants enforce them against buyers of the unrestricted lots? If the buyers of the remaining lots knew of the restriction and orally promised to comply with it, one might apply equitable estoppel doctrine in conjunction with third-party beneficiary doctrine to allow enforcement by prior and later buyers. But what if no oral statements are made by the buyers of the unrestricted lots promising to abide by the covenants?</p>
<p id="c5935438-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts hold that buyers of unrestricted lots are on constructive notice of covenants in other deeds in the vicinity sold by the same grantor. <i>Roper v. Camuso</i>, 829 A.2d 589, 595 (Md. 2003). <i>Sanborn v. McLean</i> went so far as to argue that a buyer in a residential neighborhood should be on inquiry notice if there is a uniform pattern of development that might suggest the existence of a common plan.</p>
<p id="c5935439-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What evidence is sufficient to show a common plan? If too many of the lots in the subdivision are sold without restrictions, the court may find that no common scheme was in fact established, thus freeing all the unrestricted lots from the duty to comply with the covenants in their neighbors’ deeds. <i>Petersen v. Beekmere, Inc</i>., 283 A.2d 911 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1971). <i>Sanborn v. McLean</i> imposed restrictive covenants on an entire neighborhood even though the covenants were included in only 53 of 91 deeds. Was this justified? <i>Compare Forster v. Hall,</i> 576 S.E.2d 746 (Va. 2003) (implied reciprocal negative servitude prohibiting mobile homes was enforced against unrestricted lots when 93 percent of lots were restricted).</p>
<p id="c593543a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What justifies limiting a property owner’s right to develop his land when the deed he received from the seller neither had any restrictions in it nor referred to the restrictions in deeds previously granted to others in the subdivision? In <i>Riley,</i> the California Supreme Court rejected the ruling in <i>Sanborn</i> by holding a lot cannot be restricted unless those restrictions appear in the chain of title to that particular lot. Thus, the first buyers were not restricted because they purchased prior to the recordation of the declaration, even though they were on notice of the restrictions at the time they purchased. Do you agree with the court’s ruling or with the dissenting opinion of Justice Tobriner?</p>
<p id="c593543b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1995, the California Supreme Court clarified <i>Riley</i> by holding that any buyer of a lot covered by a recorded declaration is bound by the restrictions in the declaration even if his deed nowhere mentions the declaration or the restrictions. <i>Citizens for Covenant Compliance v. Anderson</i>, 906 P.2d 1314 (Cal. 1995). The terms of a recorded declaration are impliedly included in the deeds to lots covered by the declaration. <span title="588" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-588">p. 588</span>This leaves standing the ruling in <i>Riley</i> that exempts lots purchased before the declaration was recorded.</p>
<p id="c593543c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Lots retained by the grantor.</b> Suppose all the covenants in the neighborhood contain grantee covenants restricting the property to single-family use. Moreover, the developer files a declaration to that effect describing all the property in the subdivision as restricted. The developer owns property across the street from this subdivision; the property is left undeveloped for several years after the subdivision is completed. The developer then seeks to build on this property in a manner inconsistent with the restrictions imposed on the subdivision. Can the developer do this? The question arises whether the neighboring tract should be treated as part of the common plan. If it was noted on the original plat, the courts are likely to hold that it was part of the common plan. But suppose it was never described on the plat or the declaration or orally as part of the development. May the developer sell to commercial users in a manner that does not constitute a common law nuisance but nonetheless interferes with the common residential scheme by substantially changing the environment? No promises of any kind were made to the buyers in the subdivision that the developer would not do this. Most courts hold that only parcels within the common scheme are restricted and that the grantor’s intent to leave a tract or parcel out of the common scheme is determinative.</p>
<p id="c5937b4d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Duvall v. Ford Leasing Development Corp.</i>, 255 S.E.2d 470 (Va. 1979), a developer subdivided and built homes on a large tract in stages over a 25-year period. Each of the subdivisions was restricted to residential use. The developer then sold its remaining land, expressly providing in the deed that a portion of it would remain free of restrictions of any kind. The buyer of that land sold the unrestricted parcel to an owner who sought to establish a car sales and service business. Relying on the piecemeal development and the fact that it occurred over a long period of time, the court held that the development consisted of separate subdivisions and that the entire property was not subject to a single common plan. In contrast, the court in <i>Snow v. Van Dam</i>, 197 N.E. 224 (Mass. 1935), concluded that a lot across the street from the rest of a subdivision was intended to be in the same common plan, although it was sold more than 15 years after the first lot, because it was included in the description of the entire tract when it was registered and the delay in sale was caused by the inability to sell the property rather than an intent to exclude it from the restricted area. <i>See also Country Community Timberlake Village v. HMW Special Utility District of Harris</i>, 438 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. Ct. App. 2014) (holding that a neighboring tract was not part of a common scheme with Timberlake Village, so restrictions on tract could not be enforced by Timberlake owners).</p>
<p id="c5937b4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a developer that deliberately leaves some of its contiguous land out of the common scheme attempts to develop the retained land in a manner inconsistent with the common scheme, is there any argument for constraining the developer’s ability to do this? Does it matter if the unrestricted lots are located outside but adjacent to the subdivision or inside it?</p></div>

A buyer offers to purchase three of the lots if they can be combined and an apartment building constructed with 25 apartments. The price is lower than the developer hoped to get for the three properties, but no other buyers seem ready to purchase the lots for use as single-family homes at prices that would allow the developer to make a profit. Then another buyer comes along who offers an extremely high price for the last two lots so long as no covenant is included in the deed; this buyer wants to build a gas station.

<p id="c593a267-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As of 2011, some 62 million Americans lived in settings in which multiple dwellings are joined by servitudes providing them with shared rights in common elements such as roads and recreational facilities, or shared obligations to contribute fees to an owners association that maintains the common elements, enforces the covenants, and (in some cases) enacts rules for the community. The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> and the Uniform Laws Commission have called such residential settings “common interest communities.” <i>See Restatement (Third)</i> §6.2; U.L.A., <i>Uniform Common Interest Owners Bill of Rights</i> §2.6. The California Supreme Court calls them “common interest developments” and “community associations.” <i>Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Association, Inc.</i>, 878 P.2d 1275 (Cal. 1994). Do these terms strike you as appropriate descriptions?</p>
<p id="c593a268-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Part of the explosion of common interest developments in the 1970s was tied to federal tax changes that made ownership of rental properties less profitable, and gave <span title="590" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-590">p. 590</span>unit owners tax credits similar to those for single-family housing. <i>See</i> Henry Hansmann, <i>Condominium and Cooperative Housing: Transactional Efficiency, Tax Subsidies, and Tenure Choice</i>, 20 J. Leg. Studies 25 (1991). Federal law still creates some differences between common interest developments and single-family homes. Hurricane Sandy drew attention to one: Common elements are generally not eligible for FEMA disaster assistance given to single-family homes, because property owners associations are considered businesses under the law.</p>
<p id="c593a269-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This section discusses some of the kinds of residential common interest developments, and distinct legal and policy questions they pose.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c593a26a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c593a26b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">A.&nbsp;Residential Subdivisions and Condominiums</p></div>
<p id="c593a26c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most common interest developments are either composed of separate houses in a planned subdivision or are <b>condominiums</b> — attached dwellings or units in an apartment building. The developer typically drafts the initial covenants or <b>CC&amp;Rs</b> (conditions, covenants, and restrictions) for these communities and records them as a <b>declaration</b> or <b>master deed</b> with the local recording office or register of deeds prior to sale of the first unit. In buying their units, owners agree to abide by these covenants. Owners individually own and obtain financing for their own units, but they share ownership of the common elements of the community. Owners may vote to amend the initial covenants, although a supermajority vote of between 60 to 75 percent is usually required.</p>
<p id="c593a26d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The declaration will typically create a <b>homeowners association</b> or <b>condominium association</b>. Each of the owners is a member of the association. Owners are empowered to vote for the members of a board, called the board of trustees or board of managers, to manage the association’s common interests. In addition to enforcing covenants, homeowners associations may be empowered to collect dues and fees from the owners to maintain common areas such as roads and recreational facilities and rooftops and hallways of condominiums. They are also often empowered to promulgate bylaws or rules governing use of common areas and perhaps even the appearance and use of individual lots or units. Unpaid dues or fines for rule violations often constitute liens on the property empowering the owners association to foreclose.</p>
<p id="c593a26e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In effect, these associations function like local governments, except that votes are not based on “one person-one vote” but are based on property ownership. Only owners have voting rights; tenants and other family members are not entitled to vote in board elections; and owners of more property in the community may have more votes. Just as shareholders of corporations generally have votes based on the number of shares they own, votes in homeowners associations may be unequal because they may be based on lot sizes (or, as seen in <i>Evans v. Pollock</i>, <i>supra</i>, lake frontage). Developers may also give themselves more than one vote for each unit they own. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Hughes v. New Life Development Corporation</i>, 387 S.W.3d 453 (Tenn. 2012) (upholding scheme in which developer had five votes per lot owned); Evan McKenzie, <i>Beyond Privatopia: Rethinking Residential Private Government</i> 11 (2011) (three votes per unsold lot is typical). Unlike governments, owners associations are generally not subject <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>to federal or state constitutional restrictions. <i>But cf. Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, <i>infra</i> (holding that enforcement of a racially discriminatory covenant violated the fourteenth amendment).</p>
<p id="c593a26f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State statutes regulate common interest developments by providing basic ground rules for their organization. These statutes may define the basic structure of the common interest development, requiring a declaration, bylaws, and supermajority votes for amendment of covenants and certain other decisions of the association.</p>

<p id="c593c982-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Condominiums must be distinguished from <b>cooperatives</b>. In a cooperative arrangement, the entire building is owned by a single nonprofit cooperative corporation. Individual owners buy shares in the corporation and then lease their individual units from the corporation. Since ownership is vested in the corporation, the costs of operating the cooperative, including payments for the building’s mortgage (if there is one), will be financed by the corporation itself. The monthly payment by each owner (in the form of rent) covers that owner’s share of the mortgage payment, as well as fees for upkeep and management. If an individual owner fails to make her monthly payment to the corporation, other owners must make up the difference in order to prevent foreclosure. Defaulting tenants can be evicted by the corporation and lose their stock. The greater financial interdependence of cooperative owners makes this a more fragile structure than the condominium structure; it is therefore much less common. Because of the financial interdependence of cooperative owners, cooperatives often assume the power to approve or veto sales of particular units to protect other cooperative members’ collective financial stake in the building.</p>

<p id="c593c985-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Advocates for the poor have been creative in inventing new forms of landholding tailored to low-income persons. Two widely used forms are limited equity cooperatives and community land trusts. Although structured differently, the purpose of these ownership forms is “to remove land from the speculative market, create housing for low income people, and keep that housing affordable.” Christopher Seeger, <i>The Fixed Price Preemptive Right in the Community Land Trust Lease: A Valid Response to the Housing Crisis or an Invalid Restraint on Alienation?,</i> 11 Cardozo L. Rev. 471 (1989); <i>see</i> James J. Kelly, <i>Land Trusts That Conserve Communities</i>, 59 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (2009).</p>
<p id="c593c986-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Community land trusts.</b> A community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that buys and holds title to property, ordinarily by acquiring inexpensive land located in a depressed area or land whose purchase is subsidized by government loans, loan guarantees, or subsidies. The trust retains title to the land, but sells residences on the land, whether as single-family homes or condominiums, to lower-income purchasers at below market rates. Although the purchasers own their units, they receive a <b>ground lease</b> for the land. Such ground leases separate land and unit ownership, and are <span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-592">p. 592</span>common in commercial transactions involving large office buildings. The ground lease ordinarily lasts for a long time — often 99 years — and may be renewable.</p>
<p id="c593c987-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A crucial aspect of the arrangement is that the lessee-unit owners agree to sell to either the community land trust, or another low-income purchaser, at a below-market price that splits the equity in the property between the landowner and the unit owner. This arrangement ensures that the property will remain low cost and therefore available to other low-income buyers. Community land trusts got their start in the 1960s as part of the Civil Rights Movement, but have multiplied in recent decades in response to rising property costs and federal and state recognition and support. <i>See</i> Sarah Iline Stein, <i>Wake Up, Fannie Mae, I Think I Got Something to Say to You: Financing Community Land Trust Homeowners Without Stripping Affordability Provisions</i>, 60 Emory L.J. 209 (2010); 42 U.S.C. §12773 (authorizing federal support for community land trusts).</p>
<p id="c593c988-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Limited equity cooperatives.</b> A limited equity cooperative has a purpose similar to a community land trust but is organized like a regular cooperative. The purchaser buys shares in the cooperative and obtains a lease to a particular unit. The contracts involved in this arrangement allow sale of the owner’s shares at a fixed price, thus preventing the owner from benefiting from increases in the market value of the unit.

<p id="c593c98b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rise of the common interest development is a “quiet revolution in the structure of community organization, local government, land-use control, and neighbor relations.” Stephen E. Barton &amp; Carol J. Silverman, <i>Preface</i>, <i>Common Interest Communities</i> at xi (S. Barton &amp; C. Silverman eds. 1994). Common interest developments are no longer simply a U.S. phenomenon, but have spread to every continent; in China, an estimated 250 million people live in privately governed communities. Evan McKenzie, <i>Beyond Privatopia: Rethinking Residential Private Government</i> x (2011). Developers often prefer them, because they can use less space by providing common recreational facilities rather than a yard for each home. But the phenomenon is no longer driven solely by the market. Many municipalities either explicitly or in practice require new construction to be bound by a property owners association in order to offload the costs of providing public goods. McKenzie, <i>supra</i>, at 6-7; Paula A. Franzese &amp; Steven Siegel, <i>The Common Interest Community as Metaphor and Paradox</i>, 72 Mo. L. Rev. 1111, 1119-1121 (2004). In many of these developments, streets, infrastructure, parks, and recreation, are all privately paid for and controlled by CC&amp;Rs and the owners associations that administer them. These developments also often perform police functions, employing private security officers. They may also close off their interior streets and erect walls or gates, becoming “gated communities.” Governing associations, however, are not held to constitutional norms and their directors are volunteers who often have little training or support.</p>

Proponents cite the explosion of this housing form as evidence that Americans desire its benefits, see Robert H. Nelson, <i>Private Neighborhoods and the Transformation of Local Government</i> 7-8 (2005), and emphasize the “perfectly voluntary nature of membership in a homeowners association.” Robert C. Ellickson, <i>Cities and Homeowners Associations</i>, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1519, 1520 (1982). Common interest developments, they argue, offer a voluntary, market-based alternative to coercive governments, putting “[p]rivate profit . . . at the service of devising a better system of local governance — at least from the viewpoint of the homebuyers themselves.” Nelson, <i>supra</i>, at 14. Others praise the potential of the common interest development to create communities that counter the atomization of modern life. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mark Fenster, <i>Community by Covenant, Process, and Design: Cohousing and the Contemporary Common Interest Community</i>, 15 J. Land Use &amp; Envtl. L. 3 (1999) (critiquing the co-housing movement).</p>

<p id="c593f0a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Disney-built development of Celebration, Florida seeks to replicate a small town Main Street feel, paying employees to facilitate group activities, and making fake snow (“snoap”) at Christmas. The development has won awards from the Urban Land Institute and seen property values skyrocket, although they’ve dipped significantly since the recession. Critics also abound, and they were morbidly gleeful at news of the first murder, followed soon after by an unrelated suicide, and stories of high divorce rates in the community.</p>
</div>
    <p id="c593f0a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others challenge the assertions of voluntariness and flexibility. They point out that common interest developments are the only housing available in many markets, claiming that their rise has been driven not by owner demand but by developers and municipal zoning requirements. Purchasers have no power to negotiate the restrictions on their homes, and may not read or understand the many pages of legal language that describes them. Critics also argue that the hoped-for diversity in housing options has not appeared. Despite developments like Celebration and “co-housing” communities that include cooperative elements, most CC&amp;Rs are largely boilerplate, copied from one community to another. This boilerplate may be more restrictive than most purchasers would desire, as developers seek to reassure early purchasers and avoid adverse selection into the community by less desirable residents. Lee Anne Fennell, <i>Contracting Communities</i>, 2004 U. Ill. L. Rev. 829. Many scholars express concern about exclusionary conduct, oppressive micromanagement, and the privatization of governmental functions by homeowners associations. <i>See</i> Gerald E. Frug, <i>Cities and Homeowners Associations: A Reply</i>, 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1589 (1982); Ellickson, <i>supra</i>, at 1533 (proposing a takings clause for common interest developments); Stewart Sterk, <i>Minority Protection in Residential Private Governments</i>, 77 B.U. L. Rev. 273 (1997). Newspapers regularly publish horror stories about owners associations foreclosing on homes worth hundreds of thousands for unpaid dues of a few hundred dollars; filing lawsuits against owners who paint their mailboxes the wrong color, hang mezzuzahs on their doors, or park their pickup trucks in the driveway; and putting senior citizens in jail for failing to re-sod a brown lawn.</p>

<p id="c593f0a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So what do owners think? The Community Associations Institute, an industry group representing owners associations, regularly conducts a survey that finds that the overwhelming majority of owners like living in their common interest development <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>and would choose to live in one again. Others critique the methodology of these surveys and point to an earlier survey conducted in California finding that 84 percent of residents would not choose to live a common interest development again. Barton &amp; Silverman, <i>supra</i>, at 137. Groups of disgruntled owners have secured legislation in several states imposing state oversight and regulation over owners associations. Nevertheless, these developments continue to spread and people continue to buy into them. What do you think?</p>

<p id="c59417bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 3, 1979, Presley recorded with the Bernalillo County Clerk a replat for the Vista Del Sandia subdivision. On October 8, 1982, Presley recorded a set of restrictive covenants covering all the property shown on the replat, including a tract in the subdivision arroyo. The covenants regulated the land use, building type, quality, and size of the residential single-family dwellings that were to be placed on the subdivision property. In November 1982, the Appels met with Presley and its agents regarding the possible purchase of a lot in the subdivision. The Appels allege certain representations were made concerning lots in the subdivision and the purpose of the restrictive covenants. The Appels further allege that the restrictive covenants were used as a sales tool which they relied on in purchasing a lot and constructing their home. On April 25, 1984, the subdivision’s Architectural Control Committee, consisting of three members who were all employees or officers of Presley, executed an amendment of the restrictive covenants. This amendment deleted nine lots from the effect of the restrictive covenants, including Lots 28-A and 30 which are involved in this appeal. Since the covenants were amended, some of the lots have been subdivided into smaller lots and townhouses have been constructed on them. Presley sold Lot 28-A to Wolfe in April <span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span>1988.

</div>
<p id="c5943ed5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In particular, the trial court emphasized the “amendments and/or exceptions to these restrictions” language of paragraph 20 in the restrictive covenants. The trial court found that the language was unambiguous and that the covenant permitted the Architectural Control Committee to make exceptions and remove individual lots from the covenants. This court has recognized the importance of enforcing protective covenants where the clear language of the covenants, as well as the surrounding circumstances, indicates an intent to restrict use of land. In <i>Montoya v. Barreras</i>, 473 P.2d 363 (N.M. 1970), we refused to allow an individual lot to be removed from the effect of a restrictive covenant in spite of a provision in the covenant allowing change by majority approval. We held: “To permit individual lots within an area to be relieved of the burden of such covenants, in the absence of a clear expression in the instrument so providing, would destroy the right to rely on restrictive covenants which has traditionally been upheld by our law of real property.” <i>Id.</i> at 365. Here, the trial court found the “amendments and/or exceptions to these restrictions” language to be the clear expression required by <i>Montoya</i>.</p>
<p id="c5943ed6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree that the language permitted the Architectural Control Committee to make amendments or exceptions to the restrictive covenant. However, courts have determined that provisions allowing amendment of subdivision restrictions are subject to a requirement of reasonableness. As stated in 7 G. Thompson, <i>Real Property</i>, §3171 (repl. 1962), “A court of equity will not enforce restrictions where there are circumstances that render their enforcement inequitable.”</p>

App. 1974), the court addressed a similar clause reserving to the land <span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-596">p. 596</span>developer the right to alter, amend, repeal, or modify restrictions at any time in his sole discretion. The court noted the inherent inconsistency between an elaborate set of restrictive covenants, designed to provide for a general scheme or plan of development, and a clause reserving in the grantor the power to change or abandon any part of it. The court reconciled the inconsistency by reading into the restrictive clause a requirement of reasonableness. Thus, the clause allowing the owners the right to alter, amend, repeal, or modify these restrictions at any time in its sole discretion is a valid clause so long as it is exercised in a reasonable manner so as not to destroy the general scheme or plan of development.</p>
<p id="c5943ed8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Alabama also imposed a test of reasonableness when a developer exercised his reserved right to cancel or modify any of the restrictive covenants. <i>Moore v. Megginson</i>, 461 So. 2d 993 (Ala. 1982). The court affirmed the trial court’s finding that the developer’s “exercise of his right to cancel or modify the restrictive covenants ‘must be reasonable, with due regard for the property rights and investments of the persons who relied upon the residential covenants which were in full force at the time of their purchase.’ ” <i>Id.</i></p>

Additionally, if it is found that the exceptions were applied in an unreasonable manner, thereby breaching the covenants, the trial court should apply the doctrine of relative hardships.</p>

<p id="c59465f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Developer control.</b> The developer of a condominium initially owns all the units and therefore controls the condominium association. Declarations also frequently give developers multiple votes per unsold unit or the right to appoint a majority of board members, permitting them to maintain control even after most of the units are sold. The <i>Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act</i> §3-103, as well as the laws of a number of states that have not adopted the act, provide that developers must turn over control to unit owners once 75 percent of the units are sold or two years after units stop being sold in the ordinary course of business. <i>See also Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §6.19. Even these protections, however, may leave a substantial period where the developer can dominate the property owners association and govern the interests of unit owners.</p>

Developer power to amend the declaration.</b> The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §6.21 provides: “A developer may not exercise a power to amend or modify the declaration in a way that would materially change the character of the development or the burdens on the existing community members unless the declaration fairly apprises purchasers that the power could be used for the kind of change proposed.” In a case similar to <i>Appel,</i> a Kansas court adopted this <i>Restatement</i> rule, holding that a developer’s power to “amend” the covenants limiting land to single-family or duplex homes did not include the power to “revoke” them entirely and build four-unit housing. <i>North Country Villas Homeowners Association v. Kokenge,</i> 163 P.3d 1247 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007). The court noted that it was not applying a “reasonableness test,” but holding that such an amendment “would violate notice principles by materially changing the general development plan of the subdivision without fair warning to purchasers.” <i>Id.</i> at 1254.</p>

<p id="c59465f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recession highlighted the issue of developer control in the event of developer bankruptcy — a particularly significant problem when the unit owners want to sue the developer through their (developer controlled) owners association. Some jurisdictions respond to this issue by interpreting filing for bankruptcy as a de facto turnover of control. Larry Woodard, <i>Representing a Homeowners Association Facing Developer Bankruptcy,</i> 24-AUG Prob. &amp; Prop. 36 (2010).</p>
</div>
<p id="c59465f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Hughes v. New Life Development Corp.</i>, 387 S.W.3d 453 (Tenn. 2012), reached the opposite result. As in <i>Appel</i> and <i>North Country Villas</i>, the power to change the master plan was included in the original declaration, which also provided developer with five votes for each unsold unit it owned. Replacing the original developer after half of the platted units had been sold, the new developer used its supermajority of votes to amend the declaration <span title="598" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-598">p. 598</span>to change a planned 80-residence community with wilderness preserves and hiking into a 650-residence golf resort. The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld these actions: “Contract law in Tennessee plainly reflects the public policy allowing competent parties to strike their own bargains. These contract principles, applied in the context of a private residential development with covenants that are expressly subject to amendment without substantive limitation, yield the conclusion that a homeowner should not be heard to complain when, as anticipated by the recorded declaration of covenants, the homeowners’ association amends the declaration.” <i>Id.</i> at 475-476.</p>
<p id="c59465f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Management contracts.</b> Developers may use their period of control to arrange for management or other contracts in which the condominium hires the developer to provide services in exchange for management fees. Owners often have found these contracts are unfair either because the fees charged by the developer-manager are exorbitant or because the contracts last for so long that they prevent the unit owners from hiring someone else if they become dissatisfied with the way the place is being run.</p>
<p id="c59465f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Condominium and Cooperative Conversion Protection and Abuse Relief Act,</i> 15 U.S.C. §§3601-3616, authorizes condominiums and cooperatives, by a two-thirds vote, to terminate without penalty management contracts of more than three years entered into while the developer had majority control of the condominium or cooperative. <i>Id.</i> §3607(a). Many states have also passed statutes regulating developer-created contracts, often providing that they can be rejected by a supermajority vote. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Comcast of Florida v. L’Ambiance Beach Condominium Association, Inc.</i>, 17 So. 3d 839 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009) (applying a Florida statute that allowed 75 percent or more of the unit ownership rights to repudiate a contract permitting Comcast to provide and manage cable services to the units).</p>
<p id="c59465fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Developer’s power to enforce covenants after sale of all units.</b> Recall the rule restricting the enforceability of covenants when the benefit is held in gross. The declaration may give the developer the power to enforce the covenants by bringing a lawsuit to compel compliance. When the developer of a subdivision attempts to continue to enforce the covenant after the last parcel is sold, the courts may deny the developer standing to bring a suit to enforce the covenants because of the policies underlying the rule prohibiting the benefit of covenants to be held in gross. The developer’s legitimate interest in retaining control over development in the subdivision is to increase the marketability of the lots; assuring prospective buyers that the subdivision is restricted to residential use, or even single-family homes, may increase the market value of the property and attract buyers. Once the developer leaves, however, she is an outsider whose legitimate interests have already been satisfied; continued control by the developer is seen as meddling. There is therefore a strong, although not universal, presumption against continued enforcement by absentee developers who no longer own property in the neighborhood. <i>Garland v. Rosenshein</i>, 649 N.E.2d 756 (Mass. 1995) (benefit of covenant held in gross cannot be enforced); <i>Smith v. First Savings of Louisiana</i>, 575 So. 2d 1033 (Ala. 1991) (holding that a developer could not retain control of the architectural review commission that approved building changes <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>once the last parcel was sold); <i>Armstrong v. Roberts</i>, 325 S.E.2d 769 (Ga. 1985) (developer cannot waive a covenant after all parcels are sold and it has no economic interest in the subdivision).</p>
<p id="c59465fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have allowed developers to continue to enforce covenants when the declaration allows this, at least where the owners have the power to amend the declaration and there is no showing that the developer “retained unreasonable or imperious control over . . . decisions of homeowners long after having completed the subdivision.” <i>B.C.E. Development, Inc. v. Smith</i>, 264 Cal. Rptr. 55, 61 (Ct. App. 1989). <i>Accord, Christiansen v. Casey</i>, 613 S.W.2d 906 (Mo. Ct. App. 1981). Although the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> makes covenants enforceable when the benefit is held in gross, <i>id.</i> §2.6(b), it still requires a legitimate interest in the party who seeks enforcement, <i>id.</i> §2.6 cmt. d. What legitimate reasons, if any, could a developer have for retaining the power to enforce the covenants once the last unit is sold?</p>
<p id="c59465fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Private transfer fees.</b> In recent years, a growing number of developers and homeowners associations have inserted covenants requiring owners to pay them a private transfer fee when the property is sold. The fee may encumber the property for as long as 99 years and is typically set at about 1 percent of the sale price. Developers claim that these fees create an alternative source of financing, allowing them to create developments less expensively, and that the savings are passed on to purchasers. Because these fees are often not assessed against the original purchaser, owners may not realize that they are in place. More than half of the states now ban private transfer fees by statute and a 2012 federal regulation prohibits Fannie Mae from purchasing loans on properties burdened by such fees. 12 C.F.R. Part 1228. These laws exempt private transfer fees to homeowners association if the fee is dedicated to homeowners association activities, and they do not generally apply to private transfer fees recorded before the laws were promulgated.</p>

The design is popular, and the properties are sold for high prices. Before the first home was sold, the developer recorded a declaration that contained restrictive covenants preventing any external changes to the structures or landscaping without consent of the architectural review commission. The developer was identified by name in the declaration as the sole member of the architectural review commission. Every deed refers to the declaration.</p>

The architect refuses to allow the changes, although none of the neighbors objects to them. The owner sues the architect, claiming that the covenant granting the architect continued control of the architectural review commission after the last unit was sold is unenforceable. The architect claims that the design of the houses is akin to a work of art, that she has a right to artistic control of the houses, and that the plaintiff voluntarily consented to <span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-600">p. 600</span>this arrangement.

<p id="c5948d12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> On September 23, 2012, New York became the 37th state to ban private transfer fees. The law finds that private transfer fees violate the public policy of the state by “impairing the marketability and transferability of real property and by constituting an unreasonable restraint on alienation.” N.Y. Real Prop. Law §471. However, the law declares that the ban on enforcement of such fees “shall not apply to a private transfer fee obligation recorded or entered into prior to the effective date of this section. This section shall not be deemed to require that a private transfer fee obligation recorded, filed or entered into in this state before the effective date of this section is presumed valid and enforceable. It is the public policy of this state that no private transfer fee obligation shall be valid or enforceable whenever entered into, recorded or filed.” <i>Id.</i> §473.</p>
<p id="c5948d13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law resonates with an early New York case, <i>De Peyster v. Michael</i>, 6 N.Y. 467 (1852), which invalidated a requirement that the owner provide the original lessor of the land one quarter of the purchase price upon every sale. The court held that the requirement was an invalid restraint on alienation prohibited by New York’s rejection of feudalism:</p>

<p id="c5948d14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the continuance of the estate can be made to depend on the payment of a tenth, or a sixth, or a fourth part of the value of the land at every sale, it may be made to depend on the payment of nine-tenths, or the whole of the sale money. It would be a bold assertion to say that the adoption of such a principle would not operate as a fatal restraint upon alienation.</p>

A feoffment in fee did not originally pass an estate in the sense in which we now understand it. The purchaser took only an usufructuary interest, without the power of alienation in prejudice of the heir or of the lord. In default of heirs the tenure became extinct and the land reverted to the lord. This restraint on alienation was a violent and unnatural state of things, contrary to the nature and value of property, and the inherent and universal love of independence.</p>

But enforcement of covenants may undermine other societal or individual interests.

<p id="c594b42f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public policy concerns have always been a part of covenant law, particularly for injunctive relief, which is an equitable remedy. Although the overriding policy concern was that covenants violated a policy favoring free use of land, more specific concerns also came into play. The touch and concern test was often used as the way to invalidate covenants, even those like restrictions on competing uses by a neighboring business that clearly touched and concerned the land. In 1988, Susan French noted, “When a court invalidates a covenant obligation on the ground that it does not touch and concern the land, it makes a substantive judgment that the obligation should not be permitted to run with the land. The real reasons for the invalidation are seldom, if ever given.” Susan French, <i>Servitudes Reform and the New Restatement of Property: Creation Doctrines and Structural Simplification,</i> 73 Cornell L. Rev. 928, 939-940 (1988).</p>
<p id="c594b430-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern law tends to address public policy concerns more directly, invalidating covenants that are “unreasonable.” Rules and bylaws enacted by common interest development associations may also be reviewed for reasonableness. Reasonableness is a deliberately flexible standard, taking into account and balancing many factors. Will a reasonableness standard be more likely to find covenants valid or invalid than the traditional touch and concern test?

(Davidson) appeals from a trial court judgment entered after a bench trial held on remand from the Supreme Court. <i>Davidson Bros., Inc. v. D. Katz &amp; Sons, Inc.</i>, 579 A.2d 288 (N.J. 1990). Applying the reasonableness test formulated by the Supreme Court, the trial court determined that a covenant prohibiting the use as a supermarket of a property in downtown New Brunswick, New Jersey, was unenforceable. We now affirm.</p>
<p id="c594b43a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson operated a number of supermarkets in New Jersey. In 1952, it opened a supermarket of 10,000 square feet on George Street in downtown New Brunswick. In June 1978, Davidson took over an existing supermarket located at Elizabeth Street, also in New Brunswick but approximately two miles from the George Street store (hereinafter George Street), near the border with North Brunswick. Davidson paid $315,000 for the assets of the Elizabeth Street store (hereinafter Elizabeth Street), not including inventory, and made a substantial additional investment for improvements. Davidson leased the Elizabeth Street real property.</p>
<p id="c594b43b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson closed George Street in February 1979 because its volume had decreased after Davidson acquired Elizabeth Street. It sold George Street in September 1980 to defendant D. Katz &amp; Sons, Inc. (Katz), a rug merchant. The deed to Katz contained the covenant in issue:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c594b43c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lands and premises described herein and conveyed hereby are conveyed subject to the restriction that said lands and premises shall not be used as and for a supermarket or grocery store of a supermarket type, however designated, for a period of forty (40) years from the date of this deed. This restriction shall be a covenant attached to and running with the lands.</p>
</div>
<p id="c594b43d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The closing of George Street as a supermarket created a hardship for downtown residents, most of whom did not own or have ready access to motor vehicles. In response to their plight, the city government sought to attract another supermarket operator to the downtown area. The city’s efforts culminated in the acquisition of George Street from Katz by the defendant New Brunswick Housing Authority, and the leasing of the property, for one dollar a year, to defendant C-Town, on condition that C-Town invest at least $10,000 for improvements and operate George Street as a supermarket.</p>
<p id="c594b43e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson commenced this action to enforce the covenant. Davidson appealed from an adverse summary judgment and we affirmed in an unreported opinion, utilizing traditional “touch and concern” analysis applicable to covenants alleged to run with the land.</p>

In doing so, the Court determined that “rigid adherence” to the “touch and concern” requirement was no longer warranted. It held that enforceability of a covenant would depend on its reasonableness, and that the principle of “touch and concern” is “but one of the factors.” The Court then described eight factors to be considered in resolving the reasonableness issue:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c594db50-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intention of the parties when the covenant was executed, and whether the parties had a viable purpose which did not at the time interfere with existing commercial laws, such as antitrust laws, or public policy.</p></li>

<li class=""><p id="c594db54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the covenant is reasonable concerning area, time or duration. Covenants that extend for perpetuity or beyond the terms of a lease may often be unreasonable.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c594db55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the covenant imposes an unreasonable restraint on trade or secures a monopoly for the covenantor.

<li class=""><p id="c594db56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the covenant interferes with the public interest.</p></li>

<p id="c594db58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On remand, Davidson no longer sought injunctive relief. [Davidson sold its] Elizabeth Street store to another supermarket operator in 1989 for $687,500. Davidson limited its claim to damages consisting of lost sales and profits during the two year period it competed with C-Town, and the reduced value of its Elizabeth Street store due to C-Town’s competition.</p>

</div>
<p id="c594db5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson’s accountant testified that sales at Elizabeth Street for 1988 and 1989 were $1,452,000 less than they would have been had the George Street store not reopened. He calculated the lost profit on those sales to be $350,000. He also opined that due to the lower sales volume, Davidson sold the Elizabeth Street store for $567,000 less than it should have sold for. Defendants’ accountant disagreed. He testified that although Elizabeth Street may have lost sales due to C-Town’s operation of George Street, those lost sales would not have been profitable. Defendants’ accountant also testified that the Elizabeth Street store did not lose value as a result of C-Town’s competition.</p>
<p id="c594db5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a lengthy trial, the trial court rendered an oral opinion. Applying the eight factors announced by the Supreme Court, the court found <span title="604" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-604">p. 604</span>that the 40-year term was unreasonably long (factor 5); that the covenant imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade (factor 6); and that it was contrary to the public interest (factor 7). Regarding factor seven, the court ruled that the covenant adversely impacted the public interest because “there is a substantial public need for the supermarket under the circumstances of this case.”</p>
<p id="c594db5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court deemed the damages issue to be moot because of its determination that the covenant was unreasonable and unenforceable. However, the court announced that it was unable to determine from the evidence that Davidson had sustained damages due to C-Town’s competition.</p>
<p id="c594db5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now affirm on the ground that the covenant was so contrary to public policy that it should not be recognized as a valid, enforceable obligation.</p>
<p id="c594db60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proofs established that New Brunswick is a small city which continues to suffer from many of the maladies affecting the larger cities of New Jersey and the nation, especially in its core downtown area. This area, where George Street is located, has been the focus of a large scale redevelopment and revitalization effort measured in decades. Although this effort’s emphasis has been on commercial projects primarily, the downtown area is also the site of many low to moderate income housing projects of the New Brunswick Housing Authority. These were federally funded projects, and many of their residents depended on George Street for their shopping requirements before Davidson closed the store. George Street is within two blocks of four of those housing projects with a total of 726 units.</p>
<p id="c594db61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony of New Brunswick’s Director of Policy, Planning and Economic Development, and his report which was introduced into evidence, provided a demographic profile of the city. There are a total of 3,148 households in the downtown area. Twenty-six percent of those households are below the poverty level, compared with seventeen percent in the balance of the city. Of the “family households” downtown, twenty-eight percent are female householders with children, compared with fourteen percent in the balance of the city. Of the female headed households, fifty-four percent are below the poverty level, which is consistent with the balance of the city. Thirty-seven percent of the downtown housing units have no vehicle, almost twice as many as the balance of the city. Seven hundred and forty-three downtown units are occupied by persons sixty-five years and older; twenty-one percent of those seniors are below the poverty level, almost double the proportion in the rest of the city. The downtown area, therefore, contains the city’s greatest concentration of disadvantaged persons.</p>
<p id="c594db62-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson’s closing of George Street further disadvantaged them. No other supermarket was within walking distance. For those who lacked access to motor vehicles, buses, taxis and dependence on others replaced a walk to the supermarket. The problem was especially difficult for female heads of household who used to send their children to the store or have their children accompany them. With the elimination of George Street, getting to the supermarket was a particularly difficult exercise in logistics and child care.</p>
<p id="c594db63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But inconvenience was not the only cost. Dr. James J. O’Connor testified for defendants as an expert in food marketing and distribution. Dr. O’Connor’s experience <span title="605" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-605">p. 605</span>involved hands-on management of his family’s wholesale and retail food businesses, followed by academic and government experience in food distribution issues. Shortly before his testimony in this case, Dr. O’Connor had completed a study for the United States Department of Agriculture regarding supermarkets in United States cities. According to Dr. O’Connor, the absence of a supermarket in a low-income city neighborhood makes food more expensive and has a negative impact on diet and, therefore, on the inner city population’s health.</p>
<p id="c5950274-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. O’Connor also stated that the absence of a supermarket contributes to inner city decay, because a supermarket is a retail anchor that attracts other retail operations. Withdrawal of a supermarket tends to force other merchants to leave the same neighborhood. The resulting vacuum is filled by convenience stores or “ma and pa” groceries. They are more expensive and lack variety. They rarely have produce and, if they do have it, it is of poor quality. Moreover, selection of poultry and fish is very limited and very expensive. Dr. O’Connor opined that there is a general lack of inner city supermarkets in the nation, which poses a significant social policy problem.</p>
<p id="c5950275-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. O’Connor’s uncontradicted testimony is consistent with the conclusions reached by a congressional committee. House Select Comm. on Hunger, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., <i>Obtaining Food: Shopping Constraints on the Poor</i> (Comm. Print 1987) (hereinafter <i>Report</i>). The committee concluded that “low-income consumers are unable to maximize their limited expendable resources for a basic need — food — because of the barriers of the [sic] location and transportation. Hence, the grip of hunger and poverty tightens around the low-income consumer.” <i>Id.</i> at 1.</p>
<p id="c5950276-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The committee recognized the exacerbating impact of “supermarket migration” on this problem, <i>id.</i> at 4:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5950277-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the late 1970’s and early 1980’s major supermarkets migrated away from the inner cities and low-income areas, toward the suburbs. Major reasons cited for the migration by the food industry include: high insurance rates, employment and security problems, and outmoded and understocked inner-city stores — conditions which keep profits low. The exodus to the suburbs provided cheaper land, better control over operational hazards and, in general, greater profits. According to the Food Marketing Institute, in 1981, 90 percent of the conventional grocery stores, located in low-income neighborhoods, [that] either closed voluntarily or went out of business, did so to relocate into the suburbs. These were the stores that had traditionally served low-income areas. During the same year, over one-half the new stores that opened were super stores locating in the suburbs and other higher-income areas.</p>
<p id="c5950278-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As these trends continue, low-income urban and rural consumers are faced with fewer food markets in the immediate vicinity of their homes and the greater expense in accessing reasonably priced foods. This migration has increased the economic drain on the urban and rural low-income consumer’s already limited food budget, reducing, and in some cases, removing the opportunity for low-income households to shop competitively.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5950279-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The committee also recognized the impact of the inner city consumers’ limited shopping choices: “You have this perverse irony that the poorest have to pay more for a basic necessity of life.” <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>

The committee recommended, among other policy options, that “State and local governments should implement tax breaks and other incentives to . . . small- and medium-sized grocer[ies], and supermarket chains to encourage their expansion and/or relocation in low-income communities.” <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>
<p id="c595027b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Brunswick’s initial efforts to respond to the problem were unsuccessful. It attempted to provide and organize transportation, an option that proved to be ineffective. It also sought to find a downtown property easily adaptable to supermarket use and to attract another supermarket operator to run it. Other than the George Street store, however, there was none available.</p>

According to Senator Lynch the “problem was making the bottom line work because of assembling the property, providing relocation costs, dealing with [environmental] laws, all of those things that add cost to the bottom line.” Moreover, many properties that had conversion potential were unavailable or had other problems.</p>
<p id="c595027d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, George Street, the former supermarket, was capable of being easily reconverted to supermarket use.</p>
<p id="c595027e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Jersey courts have refused to enforce contracts that violate public policy. See <i>Vasquez v. Glassboro Service Ass’n, Inc.,</i> 415 A.2d 1156 (N.J. 1980) (contract requiring migrant farmworker to leave barracks immediately upon discharge violates public policy). “No contract can be sustained if it is inconsistent with the public interest or detrimental to the common good.” <i>Id.</i> at 98.</p>

The Legislature also noted that revitalization of those areas required “application of the skills and entrepreneurial vigor of private enterprise; and it is the responsibility of government to provide a framework within which <i>encouragement be given to private capital investment in these areas, disincentives to investment be removed or abated,</i> and mechanisms be provided for the coordination and cooperation of private and public agencies in restoring the economic viability and prosperity of these areas.” N.J.S.A. 52:27H-61 (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="c5952994-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In support of these objectives, the Legislature offered a rich variety of subsidies and incentives to businesses operating in a designated enterprise zone.

<p id="c5952996-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davidson’s withdrawal from George Street caused difficulties and hardships of the nature mentioned earlier and made the downtown area a less hospitable and desirable place. Davidson had the right to terminate its George Street operation. In doing so, however, it imposed a restriction on the use of its former property designed to impede the relocation of another supermarket operation to the downtown area. The evidence supports the conclusion that the George Street store was peculiarly suited for supermarket use, and that there were no economically viable substitute locations. Consequently, the covenant, if enforced through injunctive relief or exposure to a judgment for damages, presented a formidable obstacle to remediation of the harm caused by Davidson’s withdrawal. By harm, we mean the personal hardship caused by the withdrawal of a supermarket as well as the damage to the ongoing efforts of government and private enterprise to revitalize the city. We are persuaded, therefore, that, in the absence of any equivalent reciprocal benefit to the city, Davidson’s scorched earth policy is so contrary to the public interest in these circumstances that the covenant is unreasonable and unenforceable.</p>

<p id="c595299d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A homeowner in a 530-unit condominium complex sued to prevent the homeowners association from enforcing a restriction against keeping cats, dogs, and other animals in the condominium development. The owner asserted that the restriction, which was contained in the project’s declaration recorded by the condominium project’s developer, was “unreasonable” as applied to her because she kept her three cats <span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-608">p. 608</span>indoors and because her cats were “noiseless” and “created no nuisance.” Agreeing with the premise underlying the owner’s complaint, the Court of Appeal concluded that the homeowners association could enforce the restriction only upon proof that plaintiff’s cats would be likely to interfere with the right of other homeowners “to the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their property.”</p>
<p id="c595299e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those of us who have cats or dogs can attest to their wonderful companionship and affection. Not surprisingly, studies have confirmed this effect. But the issue before us is not whether in the abstract pets can have a beneficial effect on humans. Rather, the narrow issue here is whether a pet restriction that is contained in the recorded declaration of a condominium complex is enforceable against the challenge of a homeowner. As we shall explain, the Legislature, in Civil Code section 1354, has required that courts enforce the covenants, conditions and restrictions contained in the recorded declaration of a common interest development “unless unreasonable.”</p>
<p id="c59550af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this standard established by the Legislature, enforcement of a restriction does not depend upon the conduct of a particular condominium owner. Rather, the restriction must be uniformly enforced in the condominium development to which it was intended to apply unless the plaintiff owner can show that the burdens it imposes on affected properties so substantially outweigh the benefits of the restriction that it should not be enforced against any owner. Here, the Court of Appeal did not apply this standard in deciding that plaintiff had stated a claim for declaratory relief.

<p id="c59550b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lakeside Village is a large condominium development in Culver City, Los Angeles County. It consists of 530 units spread throughout 12 separate 3-story buildings. The residents share common lobbies and hallways, in addition to laundry and trash facilities.</p>
<p id="c59550b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Lakeside Village project is subject to certain covenants, conditions and restrictions (hereafter CC &amp; R’s) that were included in the developer’s declaration recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder on April 17, 1978, at the inception of the development project. Ownership of a unit includes membership in the project’s homeowners association, the Lakeside Village Condominium Association (hereafter Association), the body that enforces the project’s CC &amp; R’s, including the pet restriction, which provides in relevant part: “No animals (which shall mean dogs and cats), livestock, reptiles or poultry shall be kept in any unit.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11656_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11656_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span></p>
<p id="c59550b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1988, plaintiff Natore Nahrstedt purchased a Lakeside Village condominium and moved in with her three cats. When the Association learned of the cats’ presence, it demanded their removal and assessed fines against Nahrstedt for each successive month that she remained in violation of the condominium project’s pet restriction.</p>

Nahrstedt also alleged she did not know of the pet restriction when she bought her condominium. [The Association demurred, and the trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed Nahrstedt’s complaint. A divided Court of Appeal reversed, finding that whether the restriction was “unreasonable” depended on the facts of her particular case.]</p>

<p id="c59550b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, condominiums, cooperatives, and planned-unit developments with homeowners associations have become a widely accepted form of real property ownership. These ownership arrangements are known as “common interest” developments. The owner not only enjoys many of the traditional advantages associated with individual ownership of real property, but also acquires an interest in common with others in the amenities and facilities included in the project. It is this hybrid nature of property rights that largely accounts for the popularity of these new and innovative forms of ownership in the 20th century.</p>
<p id="c59550b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ubordination of individual property rights to the collective judgment of the owners association together with restrictions on the use of real property comprise the chief attributes of owning property in a common interest development. Notwithstanding the limitations on personal autonomy that are inherent in the concept of shared ownership of residential property, common interest developments have increased in popularity in recent years, in part because they generally provide a more affordable alternative to ownership of a single-family home. One significant factor in the continued popularity of the common interest form of property ownership is the ability of homeowners to enforce restrictive CC &amp; R’s against other owners (including future purchasers) of project units.</p>
<p id="c59550b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When restrictions limiting the use of property within a common interest development satisfy the requirements of covenants running with the land or of equitable servitudes, what standard or test governs their enforceability? In California, as we explained at the outset, our Legislature has made common interest development use restrictions contained in a project’s recorded declaration “enforceable . . . <i>unless unreasonable</i>.” (§1354, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>
<p id="c59550ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In states lacking such legislative guidance, some courts have adopted a standard under which a common interest development’s recorded use restrictions will be enforced so long as they are “reasonable.”</p>
<p id="c59550bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hidden Harbour Estates v. Basso</i> (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) 393 So. 2d 637, the Florida court distinguished two categories of use restrictions: use restrictions set forth in the declaration or master deed of the condominium project itself, and rules promulgated by the governing board of the condominium owners association or the board’s interpretation of a rule. (<i>Id.</i> at p. 639.) The latter category of use restrictions, <span title="610" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-610">p. 610</span>the court said, should be subject to a “reasonableness” test, so as to “somewhat fetter the discretion of the board of directors.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 640.) Such a standard, the court explained, best assures that governing boards will “enact rules and make decisions that are reasonably related to the promotion of the health, happiness and peace of mind” of the project owners, considered collectively. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
<p id="c59550bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, restrictions contained in the declaration or master deed of the condominium complex, the Florida court concluded, should not be evaluated under a “reasonableness” standard. (<i>Hidden Harbour Estates v. Basso</i>, <i>supra</i>, 393 So. 2d at pp. 639-640.) Rather, such use restrictions are “clothed with a very strong presumption of validity” and should be upheld even if they exhibit some degree of unreasonableness. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 639, 640.) Nonenforcement would be proper only if such restrictions were arbitrary or in violation of public policy or some fundamental constitutional right. (<i>Id.</i> at pp. 639-640.)</p>
<p id="c59550bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, giving deference to use restrictions contained in a condominium project’s originating documents protects the general expectations of condominium owners “that restrictions in place at the time they purchase their units will be enforceable.” (Note, <i>Judicial Review of Condominium Rulemaking</i>, <i>supra</i>, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 647, 653); Ellickson, <i>Cities and Homeowners’ Associations</i> (1982) 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1519, 1526-1527. This in turn encourages the development of shared ownership housing — generally a less costly alternative to single-dwelling ownership — by attracting buyers who prefer a stable, planned environment. It also protects buyers who have paid a premium for condominium units in reliance on a particular restrictive scheme.</p>
<p id="c59550be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c59550bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In California, common interest developments are subject to the provisions of the <i>Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act</i> (hereafter Davis-Stirling Act or Act). (§1350 et seq.) The Act, passed into law in 1985, consolidated in one part of the Civil Code certain definitions and other substantive provisions pertaining to condominiums and other types of common interest developments.</p>
<p id="c59577d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pertinent here is the Act’s provision for the enforcement of use restrictions contained in the project’s recorded declaration. That provision, subdivision (a) of section 1354, states in relevant part: “The covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes, <i>unless unreasonable</i>, and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development.” (Italics added.)</p>
<p id="c59577d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provision’s express reference to “equitable servitudes” evidences the Legislature’s intent that recorded use restrictions falling within section 1354 are to be treated as equitable servitudes. [W]hen enforcing equitable servitudes, courts are generally disinclined to question the wisdom of agreed-to restrictions. This rule does not apply, however, when the restriction does not comport with public policy. Equity will not enforce any restrictive covenant that violates public policy. (See <i>Shelley v. Kramer</i>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948).) Nor will courts enforce as equitable servitudes those restrictions that are arbitrary, that is, bearing no rational relationship to the protection, preservation, operation or purpose of the affected land.</p>
<p id="c59577d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="611" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-611">p. 611</span>With these principles of equitable servitude law to guide us, we now turn to section 1354. [U]nder subdivision (a) of section 1354 the use restrictions for a common interest development that are set forth in the recorded declaration are “enforceable equitable servitudes, unless unreasonable.” In other words, such restrictions should be enforced unless they are wholly arbitrary, violate a fundamental public policy, or impose a burden on the use of affected land that far outweighs any benefit.</p>
<p id="c59577d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When courts accord a presumption of validity to all such recorded use restrictions and measure them against deferential standards of equitable servitude law, it discourages lawsuits by owners of individual units seeking personal exemptions from the restrictions. This also promotes stability and predictability in two ways. It provides substantial assurance to prospective condominium purchasers that they may rely with confidence on the promises embodied in the project’s recorded CC &amp; R’s. And it protects all owners in the planned development from unanticipated increases in association fees to fund the defense of legal challenges to recorded restrictions.</p>
<p id="c59577d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the dissent’s accusations that the majority’s decision “fray[s]” the “social fabric,” we are of the view that our social fabric is best preserved if courts uphold and enforce solemn written instruments that embody the expectations of the parties rather than treat them as “worthless paper” as the dissent would. Our social fabric is founded on the stability of expectation and obligation that arises from the consistent enforcement of the terms of deeds, contracts, wills, statutes, and other writings. To allow one person to escape obligations under a written instrument upsets the expectations of all the other parties governed by that instrument (here, the owners of the other 529 units) that the instrument will be uniformly and predictably enforced.</p>

<p id="c59577d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the holding we adopt today, the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a condominium use restriction that the Legislature has made subject to section 1354 is to be determined <i>not</i> by reference to facts that are specific to the objecting homeowner, but by reference to the common interest development as a whole. As we have explained, when, as here, a restriction is contained in the declaration of the common interest development and is recorded with the county recorder, the restriction is presumed to be reasonable and will be enforced uniformly against all residents of the common interest development <i>unless</i> the restriction is arbitrary, imposes burdens on the use of lands it affects that substantially outweigh the restriction’s benefits to the development’s residents, or violates a fundamental public policy.</p>
<p id="c59577d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, as a matter of law, that the recorded pet restriction of the Lakeside Village condominium development prohibiting cats or dogs but allowing some other pets is not arbitrary, but is rationally related to health, sanitation and noise concerns legitimately held by residents of a high-density condominium project such as Lakeside Village, which includes 530 units in 12 separate 3-story buildings.</p>
<p id="c59577d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nahrstedt’s complaint alleges no facts that could possibly support a finding that the burden of the restriction on the affected property is so disproportionate to its benefit that the restriction is unreasonable and should not be enforced. Also, the complaint’s allegations center on Nahrstedt and her cats (that she keeps them inside her <span title="612" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-612">p. 612</span>condominium unit and that they do not bother her neighbors), without any reference to the effect on the condominium development as a whole, thus rendering the allegations legally insufficient to overcome section 1354’s presumption of the restriction’s validity.</p>

While technical merit may commend the majority’s analysis, its application to the facts presented reflects a narrow, indeed chary, view of the law that eschews the human spirit in favor of arbitrary efficiency.

<p id="c59577de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As explained below, I find the provision known as the “pet restriction” contained in the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC &amp; R’s) governing the Lakeside Village project patently arbitrary and unreasonable within the meaning of section 1354. Given the substantial benefits derived from pet ownership, the undue burden on the use of property imposed on condominium owners who can maintain pets within the confines of their units without creating a nuisance or disturbing the quiet enjoyment of others substantially outweighs whatever meager utility the restriction may serve in the abstract.</p>
<p id="c59577df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both recorded and unrecorded history bear witness to the domestication of animals as household pets.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11714_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11714_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span> In addition to these historical and cultural references, the value of pets in daily life is a matter of common knowledge and understanding as well as extensive documentation. People of all ages, but particularly the elderly and the young, enjoy their companionship. Those who suffer from serious disease or injury and are confined to their home or bed experience a therapeutic, even spiritual, benefit from their presence. Animals provide comfort at the death of a family member or dear friend, and for the lonely can offer a reason for living when life seems to have lost its meaning. While pet ownership may not be a fundamental right as such, unquestionably it is an integral aspect of our daily existence, which cannot be lightly dismissed and should not suffer unwarranted intrusion into its circle of privacy.</p>

<p id="c5959ef5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he majority accept uncritically the proffered justification of preserving “health and happiness” and essentially consider only one criterion to determine enforceability: was the restriction recorded in the original declaration?

More than simply embodying the notion of having “one’s castle,” it represents the sense of freedom and self-determination emblematic of our national character. Granted, those who live in multi-unit developments cannot exercise this freedom to the same extent possible on a large estate. But owning pets that do not disturb the quiet enjoyment of others does not reasonably come within this compromise. Nevertheless, with no demonstrated or discernible benefit, the majority arbitrarily sacrifice the dream to the tyranny of the “commonality.”</p>

Reasonableness and public policy.</b> In <i>Davidson</i> and <i>Nahrstedt</i>, state courts adopt a reasonableness test rather than more traditional tests for evaluating covenants. But the test operates very differently in the hands of the two courts. The reasonableness test as described by the New Jersey Supreme Court adds additional tests on top of the traditional criteria: “We do not abandon the ‘touch and concern’ test,” the New Jersey Supreme Court stated, “but rather hold that the test is but one of the factors a court should consider in determining the reasonableness of the covenant.” <i>Davidson</i>, 579 A.2d at 295. As the court described, courts had previously engaged in “illogical and contorted applications of the ‘touch and concern’ rules . . . because courts have been pressed to twist the rules of ‘touch and concern’ in order to achieve a result that comports with public policy and a free market.” <i>Id.</i> The New Jersey test seeks to make those public policy concerns explicit.</p>
<p id="c5959efa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, the California test cloaks all covenants with a strong presumption of validity. Although the opinion construed a California statute, as the <i>Nahrstedt</i> court noted, a number of other courts adopted a similar test as a matter of common law.</p>
<p id="c5959efb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which test is better? Which better guarantees the stability and enforceability of agreements? Which better serves the public interest? Are there differences between commercial covenants and covenants governing common interest developments that justify the differences? How would the covenant in <i>Davidson</i> fare under the <i>Nahrstedt</i> test?</p>
<p id="c5959efc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Restatement (Third).</i> </b>The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> adopts the position that servitudes are presumptively valid unless they are “illegal or unconstitutional or violate[] <span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>public policy.” <i>Id.</i> §3.1. The comments note that this “applies the modern principle of freedom of contract to creation of servitudes. Rooted in the notion that it is in the public interest to recognize that individuals have broad powers to order their own affairs,’ ” the principle is that parties are generally free to “ ‘contract as they wish, and courts will enforce their agreements without passing on their substance.’ ” <i>Id.</i> §3.1 cmt. a.</p>
<p id="c5959efd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> retains a substantial role for the courts in regulating and invalidating covenants. In addition to covenants that constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation and competition, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> provides that “[s]ervitudes that are invalid because they violate public policy include, but are not limited to” those that are “arbitrary, spiteful, or capricious” or “that unreasonably burden[] a fundamental constitutional right” or are “unconscionable.” <i>Id.</i> §3.1. Determining when a covenant violates public policy requires consideration of a host of values.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5959efe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Resolving public policy claims requires balancing interests. Resolving claims that a servitude violates public policy requires assessing the impact of the servitude, identifying the public interests that would be adversely affected by leaving the servitude in force, and weighing the predictable harm against the interests in enforcing the servitude. Only if the risks of social harm outweigh the benefits of enforcing the servitude is the servitude likely to be held invalid. The policies favoring freedom of contract, freedom to dispose of one’s property, and protection of legitimate expectation interests nearly always weigh in favor of the validity of voluntarily created servitudes. A host of other policies, too numerous to catalog, may be adversely impacted by servitudes. Policies favoring privacy and liberty in choice of lifestyle, freedom of religion, freedom of speech and expression, access to the legal system, discouraging bad faith and unfair dealing, encouraging free competition, and socially productive uses of land have been implicated by servitudes. Other policies that become involved may include those protecting family relationships from coercive attempts to disrupt them, and protecting weaker groups in society from servitudes that exclude them from opportunities enjoyed by more fortunate groups to acquire desirable property for housing or access to necessary services.</p>

<p id="c595c513-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, some developers impose covenants requiring owners to obtain approval of an architectural review committee chosen by the homeowners association when they seek to make structural changes to their homes or even when they paint their shutters.

James</i>, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 580 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that it would be unreasonable for a homeowners association to ban a satellite dish when the dish would be located in the backyard and would not be visible to the neighbors); <i>Smith v. Butler Mountain Estates Property Owners Association</i>, 367 S.E.2d 401 (N.C. Ct. App. 1988) (holding refusal to allow an owner to build a geodesic dome in a community of otherwise flat plane roofs was reasonable); <i>Riss v. Angel</i>, 934 P.2d 669, 677-679 (Wash. 1997) (holding that power to approve plans for new construction must be exercised “reasonably and in good faith”). In contrast, the Supreme Court of Oregon held that an architectural committee’s decisions were subject only to review for fraud, bad faith, or lack of honest judgment when the covenants gave it “discretion” to make such decisions and specifically provided that it be the “sole judge of the suitability” of the height of improvements. <i>Valenti v. Hopkins</i>, 926 P.2d 813 (Or. 1996).</p>

Department of Veterans Affairs</i>, 79 Cal. Rptr. 2d 248, 251 (1998). (Would your bed or closet meet these requirements?) Although the applicable covenants required owners to maintain their properties in a “clean, sanitary, and attractive condition,” the court found “it is virtually impossible to say the association acted reasonably,” as the fire department had inspected the premises and found that they did not pose a health or fire hazard. <i>Id.</i> at 256. “If it is indeed true that homeowner’s associations can often function ‘as a second municipal government’; then we have a clear cut case of a ‘nanny state’ — nanny in almost a literal sense — going too far.” <i>Id.</i> at 256.</p>

<p id="c5961344-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">John and Janie O’Buck, plaintiffs and appellants in this case, purchased a unit in the Cottonwood Village Condominiums in June 1981. At that time, the unit was pre-wired for a central television antenna and for Visions, an antenna-based cable system. It is impossible to watch television in the unit without an outdoor antenna or cable because of bad reception. The availability of an antenna was an important consideration for the O’Bucks in deciding to purchase their unit because they have four televisions and frequently watch different programs.</p>
<p id="c5963a55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1984, the Board of Directors of the Cottonwood Village Association (“the Board” or “the Association”) had to address a serious problem of roof leakage in the condominiums. Among the several causes of leakage were badly mounted antennae and foot traffic on the roof related to the antennae. The Association paid $155,000 to have the roofs repaired. In order to do the work, the contractors removed all the antennae from the roofs. Before any of the antennae were reinstalled, the Board adopted a rule prohibiting the mounting of television antennae anywhere on the buildings. The purposes of this rule were to protect the roof and to enhance the marketability of the condominium units. The Board further decided to make the MultiVisions cable system available as an alternative to antennae. The Board rejected other alternatives such as a satellite dish or antennae mounted on the sides of the buildings. The Board offered to pay the fifteen dollar hookup fee to MultiVisions and to pay for the depreciated value of the old antennae. The O’Bucks were paid $284.20 for their antenna, which had been damaged when contractors removed it from the roof. The O’Bucks now have one television hooked up to MultiVisions. Their other sets have no reception, and it would cost ten dollars per month per set to hook them up.</p>
<p id="c5963a56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The O’Bucks subsequently filed a complaint against the Association seeking damages and an injunction against enforcement of the rule.</p>
<p id="c5963a57-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The O’Bucks challenge the Board’s authority to adopt the rule. We conclude that the Board had authority to enact a rule banning television antennae from buildings under either of two provisions in the Declaration of Condominium, the “constitution” of the Association. <i>See</i> Alaska Stat. §§34.07.010-.070.</p>
<p id="c5963a58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, article IX, section 4 of the Declaration authorizes the Board to adopt rules and regulations governing the use of the common areas, which include the roofs and walls of the buildings. That section provides:</p>

<p id="c5963a59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Rules and Regulations</i>.

That section provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5963a5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to preserve a uniform exterior appearance to the building, the Board may require the painting of the building, decks and balconies, and prescribe the type and color of paint, and <i>may prohibit</i>, require, or regulate <i>any modification</i> or decoration of the building, decks and balconies undertaken or proposed by any owner. This power of the Board extends to screens, doors, awnings, rails <i>or other visible portions of each condominium unit and condominium building</i>. The Board may also require use of a uniform color of draperies or drapery lining for all units. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
</div>
<p id="c5963a5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given these two provisions, the Board had authority to ban antennae either on roof-protection grounds (under article IX, section 4) or on aesthetic grounds (under either section), both of which were given as reasons for the antennae rule.</p>
<p id="c5963a5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The O’Bucks also cite several provisions of the Declaration and Bylaws which explicitly prohibit or authorize the prohibition of other things, such as pets, modification of buildings, and posting of bills. They reason that since there is no explicit authorization to prohibit antennae, and since the Declaration and Bylaws contemplate the existence of antennae, a right to have an antenna is reasonably inferred and cannot be taken away without amending the Declaration or Bylaws. They rely on <i>Beachwood Villas Condominium v. Poor,</i> 448 So. 2d 1143, 1145 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984), which held: “provided that a board-enacted rule does not contravene either an express provision of the declaration <i>or a right reasonably inferable therefrom</i>, it will be found valid, within the scope of the board’s authority.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p id="c5963a5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not find the O’Bucks’ arguments persuasive.</p>
<p id="c5963a5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The absence of any provision explicitly authorizing the Board to ban antennae is not fatal to the Board’s right to do so. As noted in <i>Beachwood Villas</i>, “[i]t would be impossible to list all restrictive uses in a declaration of condominium.” 448 So. 2d at 1145. Thus, in that case the court upheld board-enacted rules regulating unit rentals and the occupancy of units by guests during the owner’s absence. The court refused to find a reasonably inferable right and upheld the rules even in the absence of an express provision authorizing them.</p>
<p id="c5963a60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we hold that the Declaration and Bylaws granted the Board the authority to enact the subject rule banning television antennae on buildings.</p>
<p id="c5963a61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties agree that a condominium association rule will not withstand judicial scrutiny if it is not reasonable. This standard of review is supported by case law and legal commentary.</p>
<p id="c5963a62-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The superior court found that roof-mounted television antennae were one of a number of causes of leaking roofs. This finding has ample support in the record. The architect engaged by the Association to make recommendations as to what to do about the problem testified that television antennae caused problems on each of the twenty-two roofs in the condominium project. Other problems causing the leaking were age of the condominiums, their poor design, and problems of poor workmanship which went into the construction of the condominium buildings. He also testified that it was <span title="619" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-619">p. 619</span>important to limit foot traffic on the roofs, as many owners were apparently causing damage to the roofs when walking there to adjust their antennae. The repairs to the roof cost the Association $155,000. These facts clearly justified the Board’s action to limit or prohibit television antennae and foot traffic on the roofs.</p>
<p id="c5966173-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the roof problems were the only justification for the rule, the O’Bucks would have a stronger argument that the rule was unreasonable. This is because they hired an architect who designed a method of installing antennae on the sides of the buildings rather than the roofs. This method would involve only brief work on the roof to connect the coaxial cable, and the rest of the work could be done from a ladder or hydraulically operated bucket. The availability of this relatively inexpensive alternative would cast some doubt on the reasonableness of a blanket prohibition on antennae if the only purpose of the rule was to protect the roofs.</p>
<p id="c5966174-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, it is clear that other legitimate considerations also motivated the antenna ban. As discussed above, the Declaration specifically authorized the prohibition of modifications or decorations to preserve a uniform exterior appearance to the buildings. Numerous witnesses testified that the Board was influenced by the unsightliness of the antennae. It was estimated that each of the 104 units in the twenty-two buildings had an antenna protruding from the roof. Witnesses testified that the Board felt that the elimination of the forest of antennae combined with the availability of a state-of-the-art cable system would enhance the marketability of the units. This evidence is adequate to support the superior court’s conclusion that aesthetics and improved marketability were grounds for the antenna ban.</p>
<p id="c5966175-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that the O’Bucks do not agree that the antenna ban improved the exterior appearance of the buildings. They describe this goal as “[nothing] more than a sop to personal prejudice or unarticulated personal values.” However, this is a facet of the freedom they sacrificed when they bought into a condominium association.</p>

In a case where a rule seriously curtails an important civil liberty — such as, for example, freedom of expression — we will look with suspicion on the rule and require a compelling justification. The antenna ban in the instant case curtails no significant interests. The only loss suffered is that the O’Bucks and the other owners must now pay a small monthly fee to receive television, and even this cost is offset to a degree by the savings from the lack of need to install <span title="620" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-620">p. 620</span>and maintain an antenna.

<p id="c5968894-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue presented in this case is whether a condominium association rule banning the holding of religious services in the auditorium of the condominium constitutes a violation of Fla. Stat. §718.123, which precludes condominium rules from unreasonably restricting a unit owner’s right to peaceably assemble. We hold that the rule does not violate the statute and affirm.</p>
<p id="c5968895-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellee Grandview is a condominium association with 442 members, appellants being two of the members. Appellants reside at Grandview condominium during the winter months. The common elements of the condominium include an auditorium that members can reserve for social gatherings and meetings. Grandview enacted a rule governing the use of the auditorium in 1982, which provided that the auditorium could be used for meetings or functions of groups, including religious groups, when at least eighty percent of the members were residents of Grandview condominium. Generally, the only reservations made for the auditorium on Saturdays were by individual members for birthday or anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p id="c5968896-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 2001, several unit owners reserved the auditorium between 8:30 and noon on Saturday mornings. While they indicated they were reserving it for a party, they actually conducted religious services. Approximately forty condominium members gathered for the services.</p>
<p id="c5968897-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon discovering that religious services were being conducted on Saturdays in the auditorium, several other members complained to the Board of Directors (“Board”). The Board met in February to discuss restrictions on the use of the auditorium and common elements for religious services and activities. The meeting became very confrontational between those members supporting the use of the auditorium for religious services and those opposing such use. Based upon the controversial nature of the issue, the Board’s desire not to have a common element tied up for the exclusive use of a minority of the members on a regular basis, and to avoid conflicts between <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>different religious groups competing for the space, the Board first submitted the issue to a vote of the owners. Seventy percent of the owners voted in favor of prohibiting the holding of religious services in the auditorium. The Board then voted unanimously to amend the rule governing the use of the auditorium. The new rule provided that “no religious services or activities of any kind are allowed in the auditorium or any other common elements.”</p>
<p id="c5968898-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants filed suit against Grandview seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to determine whether the rule violated their constitutional rights or was in violation of §718.123, and whether the rule was arbitrarily and capriciously enacted by the Board. Grandview answered, denying that the rule was arbitrary or violated appellants’ statutory or constitutional rights. Appellants moved for a temporary injunction alleging that Grandview was not only preventing the owners from holding religious services, it was also prohibiting the use of the auditorium for holiday parties, including Christmas and Chanukah, based upon its prohibition against using the common elements “for religious activities of any kind.” The court granted the motion as to the use of the auditorium for religious activities of any kind but denied it as it applied to the holding of religious services. Based upon the temporary injunction as to religious activities, Grandview amended its rule to limit the prohibition to the holding of religious services in the auditorium.</p>
<p id="c5968899-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a hearing on appellants’ motion for a permanent injunction against the rule, the appellants relied primarily on §718.123, which prohibits condominium associations from unreasonably restricting the unit owners’ rights to peaceable assembly. They argued that religious services fell into the category of a “peaceable assembly,” and a categorical ban on the holding of religious services was per se unreasonable. Grandview maintained that it had the right to restrict the use of its common elements. Because the right of peaceable assembly did not mandate a right to conduct religious services, it had the right to poll its members and restrict the use based upon the majority’s desires. As such, Grandview maintained the exercise of this right was reasonable.</p>
<p id="c596889a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its final order denying the injunction, the court determined that because no state action was involved, the unit owners’ constitutional rights of freedom of speech and religion were not implicated by Grandview’s rule. The court determined that the rule did not violate §718.123, as the condominium association had the authority to enact this reasonable restriction on the use of the auditorium. Appellants challenge that ruling.</p>
<p id="c596afab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chapter 718, Florida’s “<i>Condominium Act</i>,” recognizes the condominium form of property ownership and “establishes a detailed scheme for the creation, sale, and operation of condominiums.” <i>Woodside Vill. Condo. Ass’n v. Jahren,</i> 806 So. 2d 452, 455 (Fla. 2002). Thus, condominiums are strictly creatures of statute. The declaration of condominium, which is the condominium’s “constitution,” creates the condominium and “strictly governs the relationships among the condominium units owners and the condominium association.” <i>Id.</i> at 456. Under the declaration, the Board of the condominium association has broad authority to enact rules for the benefit of the community.</p>

Norman</i>, 309 So. 2d 180, 181-82 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975), this court explained the unique character of condominium living which, for the good of the majority, restricts rights residents would otherwise have were they living in a private separate residence:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c596afad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears to us that inherent in the condominium concept is the principle that to promote the health, happiness, and peace of mind of the majority of the unit owners since they are living in such close proximity and using facilities in common, each unit owner must give up a certain degree of freedom of choice which he might otherwise enjoy in separate, privately owned property. Condominium unit owners comprise a little democratic sub society of necessity more restrictive as it pertains to use of condominium property than may be existent outside the condominium organization.</p>
</div>
<p id="c596afae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 718.123(<i>1</i>) recognizes the right of the condominium association to regulate the use of the common elements of the condominium (emphasis added):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c596afaf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All common elements, common areas, and recreational facilities serving any condominium shall be available to unit owners in the condominium or condominiums served thereby and their invited guests for the use intended for such common elements, common areas, and recreational facilities, subject to the provisions of §718.106(4). <i>The entity or entities responsible for the operation of the common elements, common areas, and recreational facilities may adopt reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to the use of such common elements, common areas, and recreational facilities. No entity or entities shall unreasonably restrict any unit owner’s right to peaceably assemble</i> or right to invite public officers or candidates for public office to appear and speak in common elements, common areas, and recreational facilities.</p>
</div>
<p id="c596afb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statutory test for rules regarding the operation of the common elements of the condominium is reasonableness. The trial court found the rule preventing use of the auditorium for religious services was reasonable in light of the Board’s concern for a serious potential for conflict of use which could arise among competing religious groups. Having polled the members and determined that a majority of the members approved the ban, the Board’s rule assured that the auditorium was “available to unit owners in the condominium or condominiums served thereby and their invited guests for the use intended” in accordance with the statute. §718.123(<i>1</i>).</p>
<p id="c596afb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The appellants’ main argument both at trial and on appeal suggests that because the statute mandates that the Board may not “unreasonably restrict any unit owner’s right to peaceably assemble,” §718.123(<i>1</i>), a categorical prohibition of all religious services exceeds the Board’s powers, as the right to meet in religious worship would constitute the right to peaceably assemble. However, the right to peaceably assemble has traditionally been interpreted to apply to the right of the citizens to meet to discuss public or governmental affairs. <i>See United States v. Cruikshank</i>, 92 U.S. 542, 551-555 (1875). Assuming for purposes of this argument that the right to gather for religious worship is a form of peaceable assembly, the rule in question bans this particular form of assembly, but not all right to assemble. Certainly, a categorical ban on the right of members to use the auditorium for any gathering would be contrary to statute. However, the statute itself permits the reasonable regulation of that right. <span title="623" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-623">p. 623</span>Prohibiting those types of assembly which will have a particularly divisive effect on the condominium community is a reasonable restriction. The Board found that permitting the holding of regular worship services and the competition among various religious groups for use of the auditorium would pose such conflict. Where the condominium association’s regulations regarding common elements are reasonable and not violative of specific statutory limitations, the regulations should be upheld. The trial court found the restriction reasonable under the facts. No abuse of discretion has been shown.</p>
<p id="c596afb2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>

<p id="c596afb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Within the scope of board authority.</b> To withstand review, bylaws and other board actions must not only be reasonable, but must be within the scope of the authority reasonably created by the declaration. As <i>O’Buck</i> shows, the authority need not explicitly speak to the particular rule. The determination of whether the restriction is within the scope of the authority created by the covenants is affected by whether the jurisdiction still interprets covenants strictly in favor of the free use of land or whether it interprets them broadly to achieve the intent of the parties, and whether court finds the bylaw affects an important right or reasonable reliance of the owner. <i>Compare Apple Valley Gardens Association v. MacHutta</i>, 763 N.W.2d 126 (Wis. 2009) (holding that because covenants mentioned but did not affirmatively permit renting of units, bylaw preventing leasing was permissible) <i>with Kiekel v. Four Colonies Homes Association</i>, 162 P.3d 57 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007) (finding that rental restriction had to be enacted by amendment to declaration rather than bylaw where declaration mentioned even if it did not affirmatively permit leasing), <i>and Apple Valley</i>, 763 N.W.2d at 134-139 (Prosser, J., dissenting) (given importance of and practice of leasing and rule that restrictions on property should be construed strictly, prohibition on leasing should not be accomplished via an amendment to the bylaws).</p>
<p id="c596afb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Standard of review.</b> Once they have deemed a board’s actions to be authorized, most courts review them for reasonableness. Others, however, review board actions under the business judgment rule. <i>Compare Lamden v. La Jolla Shores Club-dominium Homeowners Association</i>, 980 P.2d 940, 950 (Cal. 1999) (review for whether judgment is reasonable and in good faith deferring to the board’s “authority and presumed expertise”) <i>with Committee for a Better Twin Rivers v. Twin Rivers Homeowners Association</i>, 929 A.2d 1060, 1074 (N.J. 2007) (business judgment rule). This business judgment rule was created in the context of actions against corporate boards and officers, and immunizes them from liability “so long as the court determines that the process employed was either rational or employed in a good faith effort to advance corporate interests.” <i>In re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation</i>, 698 A.2d 959, 967 (Del. Ch. 1996); <i>see</i> Chapter 10, §4. The leading case adopting the business judgment rule is <i>Levandusky v. One Fifth Avenue Apartment Corp</i>., 553 N.E.2d 1317, 1321 (N.Y. 1990). In <i>Levandusky</i>, Chief Justice Judith Kaye acknowledged that “the broad powers of a cooperative board hold potential for abuse through arbitrary and <span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span>malicious decision-making, favoritism, discrimination and the like,” but that generalized review for reasonableness was inappropriate:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c596d6c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As this case exemplifies, board decisions concerning what residents may or may not do with their living space may be highly charged and emotional. A cooperative or condominium is by nature a myriad of often competing views regarding personal living space, and decisions taken to benefit the collective interest may be unpalatable to one resident or another, creating the prospect that board decisions will be subjected to undue court involvement and judicial second-guessing. Allowing an owner who is simply dissatisfied with particular board action a second opportunity to reopen the matter completely before a court, which — generally without knowing the property — may or may not agree with the reasonableness of the board’s determination, threatens the stability of the common living arrangement.</p>
<p id="c596d6c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the prospect that each board decision may be subjected to full judicial review hampers the effectiveness of the board’s managing authority. The business judgment rule protects the board’s business decisions and managerial authority from indiscriminate attack. At the same time, it permits review of improper decisions, as when the challenger demonstrates that the board’s action has no legitimate relationship to the welfare of the cooperative, deliberately singles out individuals for harmful treatment, is taken without notice or consideration of the relevant facts, or is beyond the scope of the board’s authority.</p>

<p id="c596d6ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. American flag.</b> Justice Clarence Thomas’s father-in-law, Donald Lamp, hung an American flag outside the balcony of his condominium unit. The condominium association had passed a rule prohibiting any banners or flags outside units, including the American flag. It did so, it seems, for aesthetic reasons and to preserve a uniform appearance of the units. Lamp was asked to abide by the rule, but he refused. After nationwide publicity, the association amended its policy to make an exception for the American flag. In 2006, Congress passed the <i>Freedom to Display the American Flag Act</i>, 4 U.S.C. §5 note (Pub. L. No. 109-243, 120 Stat. 572 (2006)), which guarantees the right to fly the American flag on one’s property, regardless of any condominium or homeowners association rule or covenant to the contrary. The statute appears to respond directly to the <b><i>Lamp</i></b> case and oddly does not confer a similar entitlement on tenants. <i>Cf.</i> Ark. Code §14-1-203 (granting a right to fly the American flag, but this right does not extend to residential tenants in buildings with fewer than 12 units). Imagine that a unit owner is prevented from flying the Puerto Rican flag — may she challenge the statute as impermissible content discrimination?</p>
<p id="c596d6cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Political signs.</b> Many association regulations restrict the signs owners can post outside their units. Such restrictions have almost universally been held not to constitute state action in violation of the U.S. Constitution. <i>See Committee for a Better Twin Rivers v. Twin Rivers Homeowners Association</i>, 929 A.2d 1060 (N.J. 2007). In <i>Twin Rivers</i>, dissident members of a homeowners association sought to engage in various kinds of speech activity to change the policies of the association. They sued for relief <span title="625" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-625">p. 625</span>from a rule that prohibited the placement of more than one sign in a window and one sign in the front yard no more than three feet from the home. Although the Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled that the homeowners association was not a “state actor,” the New Jersey constitution forbids private actions that unreasonably restrict speech. The court found, however, that as the owners could still post some signs, their rights were not unreasonably restricted. In a subsequent case, however, the court held that a similar prohibition on all signs other than for sale signs did violate the New Jersey constitution. <i>Mazdabrook Commons Homeowners’ Association v. Khan</i>, 46 A.3d 507 (N.J. 2012). Would a similar blanket restriction be invalid in a state that did not have such a constitution?</p>

<p id="c5972510-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well, at the outset, to scrutinize the terms of the restrictive agreements involved in these cases. In the Missouri case, the covenant declares that no part of the affected property shall be “occupied by any person not of the Caucasian race, it being intended hereby to restrict the use of said property . . . against the occupancy as owners or tenants of any portion of said property for resident or other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.” Not only does the restriction seek to proscribe use and occupancy of the affected properties by members of the excluded class, but as construed by the Missouri courts, the agreement requires that title of any person who uses his property in violation of the restriction shall be divested. The restriction of the covenant in the Michigan case seeks to bar occupancy by persons of the excluded class. It provides that “This property shall not be used or occupied by any person or persons except those of the Caucasian race.”</p>
<p id="c5972511-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be observed that these covenants do not seek to proscribe any particular use of the affected properties. Use of the properties for residential occupancy, as such, is not forbidden. The restrictions of these agreements, rather, are directed toward a designated class of persons and seek to determine who may and who may not own <span title="629" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-629">p. 629</span>or make use of the properties for residential purposes. The excluded class is defined wholly in terms of race or color; “simply that and nothing more.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11AD8_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11AD8_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span></p>
<p id="c5972513-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be doubted that among the civil rights intended to be protected from discriminatory state action by the Fourteenth Amendment are the rights to acquire, enjoy, own and dispose of property. Equality in the enjoyment of property rights was regarded by the framers of that Amendment as an essential pre-condition to the realization of other basic civil rights and liberties which the Amendment was intended to guarantee. Thus, §1978 of the Revised Statutes, derived from §1 of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1866</i> [now codified at 42 U.S.C. §1982] which was enacted by Congress while the Fourteenth Amendment was also under consideration, provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5972514-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5972515-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is likewise clear that restrictions on the right of occupancy of the sort sought to be created by the private agreements in these cases could not be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment if imposed by state statute or local ordinance. We do not understand respondents to urge the contrary.</p>
<p id="c5972516-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the present cases, unlike those just discussed, do not involve action by state legislatures or city councils. Here the particular patterns of discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are to operate, are determined, in the first instance, by the terms of agreements among private individuals. Participation of the State consists in the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we are here confronted is whether this distinction removes these cases from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5972517-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the decision of this Court in the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.</p>
<p id="c5974c28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude, therefore, that the restrictive agreements standing alone cannot be regarded as a violation of any rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been no action by the State and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated.</p>
<p id="c5974c29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the agreements. The respondents urge that judicial enforcement of private agreements does not amount to state action; or, in any event, the participation of the State is so attenuated in character as not to amount to state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, it is suggested, even if the States in these cases may be deemed to have acted in the constitutional sense, their action did not deprive <span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-630">p. 630</span>petitioners of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We move to a consideration of these matters.</p>
<p id="c5974c2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5974c2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the action of state courts and of judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, is a proposition which has long been established by decisions of this Court.</p>
<p id="c5974c2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the earliest applications of the prohibitions contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to action of state judicial officials occurred in cases in which Negroes had been excluded from jury service in criminal prosecutions by reason of their race or color. These cases demonstrate, also, the early recognition by this Court that state action in violation of the Amendment’s provisions is equally repugnant to the constitutional commands whether directed by state statute or taken by a judicial official in the absence of statute. Thus, in <i>Strauder v. West Virginia</i>, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), this Court declared invalid a state statute restricting jury service to white persons as amounting to a denial of the equal protection of the laws to the colored defendant in that case.</p>
<p id="c5974c2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The action of state courts in imposing penalties or depriving parties of other substantive rights without providing adequate notice and opportunity to defend, has, of course, long been regarded as a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust &amp; Savings Co. v. Hill</i>, 281 U.S. 673 (1930); <i>Pennoyer v. Neff</i>, 95 U.S. 714 (1878).</p>
<p id="c5974c2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In numerous cases, this Court has reversed criminal convictions in state courts for failure of those courts to provide the essential ingredients of a fair hearing. [<i>Moore v. Dempsey</i>, 261 U.S. 86 (1923); <i>Frank v. Mangum</i>, 237 U.S. 309 (1915).]</p>
<p id="c5974c2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the examples of state judicial action which have been held by this Court to violate the Amendment’s commands are not restricted to situations in which the judicial proceedings were found in some manner to be procedurally unfair. It has been recognized that the action of state courts in enforcing a substantive common-law rule formulated by those courts, may result in the denial of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even though the judicial proceedings in such cases may have been in complete accord with the most rigorous conceptions of procedural due process. Thus, in <i>American Federation of Labor v. Swing</i>, 312 U.S. 321 (1941), enforcement by state courts of the common-law policy of the State, which resulted in the restraining of peaceful picketing, was held to be state action of the sort prohibited by the Amendment’s guaranties of freedom of discussion.</p>
<p id="c5974c30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The short of the matter is that from the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment until the present, it has been the consistent ruling of this Court that the action of the States to which the Amendment has reference, includes action of state courts and state judicial officials. Although, in construing the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, differences have from time to time been expressed as to whether particular types of state action may be said to offend the Amendment’s prohibitory provisions, it has never been suggested that state court action is immunized from the operation of those provisions simply because the act is that of the judicial branch of the state government.</p>
<p id="c5974c31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5974c32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Against this background of judicial construction, extending over a period of some three-quarters of a century, we are called upon to consider whether enforcement by state courts of the restrictive agreements in these cases may be deemed to be the acts of those States; and, if so, whether that action has denied these petitioners the equal protection of the laws which the Amendment was intended to insure.</p>
<p id="c5977343-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have no doubt that there has been state action in these cases in the full and complete sense of the phrase. The undisputed facts disclose that petitioners were willing purchasers of properties upon which they desired to establish homes. The owners of the properties were willing sellers; and contracts of sale were accordingly consummated. It is clear that but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of state power, petitioners would have been free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.</p>
<p id="c5977344-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These are not cases, as has been suggested, in which the States have merely abstained from action, leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as they see fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full coercive power of government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of race or color, the enjoyment of property rights in premises which petitioners are willing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors are willing to sell. The difference between judicial enforcement and nonenforcement of the restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners between being denied rights of property available to other members of the community and being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing.</p>
<p id="c5977345-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enforcement of the restrictive agreements by the state courts in these cases was directed pursuant to the common-law policy of the States as formulated by those courts in earlier decisions. In the Missouri case, enforcement of the covenant was directed in the first instance by the highest court of the State after the trial court had determined the agreement to be invalid for want of the requisite number of signatures. In the Michigan case, the order of enforcement by the trial court was affirmed by the highest state court. The judicial action in each case bears the clear and unmistakable imprimatur of the State. We have noted that previous decisions of this Court have established the proposition that judicial action is not immunized from the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment simply because it is taken pursuant to the state’s common-law policy. Nor is the Amendment ineffective simply because the particular pattern of discrimination, which the State has enforced, was defined initially by the terms of a private agreement. State action, as that phrase is understood for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, refers to exertions of state power in all forms. And when the effect of that action is to deny rights subject to the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is the obligation of this Court to enforce the constitutional commands.</p>
<p id="c5977346-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents urge, however, that since the state courts stand ready to enforce restrictive covenants excluding white persons from the ownership or occupancy of property covered by such agreements, enforcement of covenants excluding colored persons may not be deemed a denial of equal protection of the laws to the colored persons who are thereby affected. This contention does not bear scrutiny. The parties <span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-632">p. 632</span>have directed our attention to no case in which a court, state or federal, has been called upon to enforce a covenant excluding members of the white majority from ownership or occupancy of real property on grounds of race or color. But there are more fundamental considerations. The rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights. It is, therefore, no answer to these petitioners to say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on grounds of race or color. Equal protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.</p>
<p id="c5977347-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor do we find merit in the suggestion that property owners who are parties to these agreements are denied equal protection of the laws if denied access to the courts to enforce the terms of restrictive covenants and to assert property rights which the state courts have held to be created by such agreements. The Constitution confers upon no individual the right to demand action by the State which results in the denial of equal protection of the laws to other individuals. And it would appear beyond question that the power of the State to create and enforce property interests must be exercised within the boundaries defined by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5977348-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical context in which the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution should not be forgotten. Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern was the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the States based on considerations of race or color. Seventy-five years ago this Court announced that the provisions of the Amendment are to be construed with this fundamental purpose in mind. Upon full consideration, we have concluded that in these cases the States have acted to deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Having so decided, we find it unnecessary to consider whether petitioners have also been deprived of property without due process of law or denied privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.</p>
<p id="c5977349-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan must be reversed.</p>

Background on racially restrictive covenants.</b> Racially restrictive covenants were widely used to exclude African Americans from residential communities for much of the twentieth century. Covenants also prohibited sales or rentals to American Indians, Jews, Asian Americans, and Latinos. (Note that the covenant here excluded “people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.” “Mongolian” was a term for Asians often used in discriminatory laws in this period. Missouri added a prohibition on marriages with Mongolians to its anti-miscegenation law in 1919, although Asians were only .02 percent of the state’s population. Hrishi Karthikey &amp; Gabriel J. Chin, <i>Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910-1950</i>, 9 Asian L.J. 1 (2002).)</p>

Warley</i>, 245 U.S. 60 (1917). The United States, however, greatly encouraged their spread. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), created by the National Housing Act of 1934, strongly encouraged such covenants. The FHA Underwriting Manual, describing the kinds of properties it would insure, declared, “If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes.” The FHA would not guarantee mortgages in integrated neighborhoods, and insisted on racially restrictive covenants in housing developments it financed. Because FHA guarantees transformed the mortgage market, these standards had tremendous influence on the availability of financing. Although the FHA stopped refusing to insure developments without such covenants after <i>Shelley</i> in 1948, it was not until 1962 that President Kennedy prohibited FHA guarantees for properties with such covenants. <i>See</i> Adam Gordon, Note, <i>The Creation of Homeownership: How New Deal Changes in Banking Regulation Simultaneously Made Homeownership Accessible to Whites and Out of Reach for Blacks</i>, 115 Yale L.J. 186 (2005).</p>
<p id="c597734e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Racially restrictive covenants helped to continue segregation long after they became legally unenforceable because such restrictions signaled racial exclusivity to potential buyers. <i>See</i> Richard Brooks &amp; Carol Rose, <i>Saving the Neighborhood: Racially Restrictive Covenants, Law and Social Norms</i> (2013).</p>
<p id="c5979a5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, covenants that prohibit sale or lease of dwellings to, or occupancy by, persons on the basis of race violate federal civil rights statutes, including the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i> of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §3601 <i>et seq</i>., and the <i>Civil Rights Act</i> of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §§1981, 1982. Before <i>Shelley,</i> however, only a minority of states, by common law or statute, declared such covenants unenforceable. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Gandolfo v. Hartman,</i> 49 F. 181 (S.D. Cal. 1892) (finding covenant restricting Chinese occupancy violated fourteenth amendment and Burlingame Treaty with China); <i>Corin v. Glenwood Cemetery</i>, 69 A. 1083 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch.

Kraemer.</i> </b>The fourteenth amendment provides: “[Nor] shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amdt. XIV. In the <i>Civil Rights Cases</i>, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the Supreme Court held that the fourteenth amendment regulates the conduct of state government and state officials but not the conduct of private or nongovernmental actors. Since then, courts have attempted to draw the line between public and private conduct — between those states of affairs legitimately attributable to the state and those for which the state cannot legitimately be held legally responsible.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11BB3_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11BB3_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span></p>

Does the decision mean that every judicial enforcement of a private agreement results in state action permitting constitutional scrutiny of its terms? Many legal scholars have criticized the opinion for failing to adequately distinguish a private sphere that is immune from control by the law. <i>See</i> Mark D. Rosen, <i>Was</i> Shelley v. Kraemer<i> Correctly Decided? Some New Answers</i>, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 451, 453-454 (2007).</p>
<p id="c5979a63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others respond that <i>Shelley</i> demonstrates the artificiality of the state action doctrine. The state is always involved in shaping, sanctioning, and facilitating private choices. This is particularly true with respect to property, in which recognizing a property right in one usually means denying it for another. In this case, for example, a decision that Kraemer’s covenant is enforceable is also a decision that the Shelleys’ deed is invalid because of their race. Because the state usually has the power to prevent discrimination, moreover, state inaction is also a decision to permit discrimination. Many scholars, therefore, have advocated scrapping the doctrine. <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Rethinking State Action,</i> 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 503 (1985); Stephen Gardbaum, <i>The “Horizontal Effect” of Constitutional Rights,</i> 102 Mich. L. Rev. 387 (2003).</p>
<p id="c5979a64-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scholars have also argued that <i>Shelley</i> is a case of state action in a more limited sense, focusing on governmental support for racially restrictive covenants, the distinctive judicial role in approval of covenants running with the land, or the resemblance between enforcement of private covenants and state zoning power. <i>See</i> Carol Rose, <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, in <i>Property Stories</i> 169, 195 (Gerald Korngold &amp; Andrew P. Morriss eds. 2004); Thomas P. Lewis, <i>The Meaning of State Action</i>, 60 Colum. L. Rev. 1083, 1115 (1960).

<p id="c5979a65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Rise and fall of state action.</b> <i>Shelley</i> was one of several cases finding state action in the actions of private parties between the 1940s and 1960s. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Terry v. Adams</i>, 345 U.S. 461 (1953) (holding fifteenth amendment prohibited pre-primary election procedures of private Democratic club); <i>Marsh v. Alabama</i>, 326 U.S. 501 (1946) (holding first amendment required private company town to permit leafleting by Jehovah’s Witnesses); <i>Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc.</i>, 391 U.S. 308 (1968) (holding first amendment required private shopping mall to permit picketing by union workers on its premises). The Court has since retreated from expansive prior readings of the state action doctrine. While <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i> has not been overruled, it is not clear what force it has outside of its facts. In <i>Evans v. Abney</i>, 396 U.S. 435 (1970) (Chapter 10, §4.3), for example, the Court considered Baconsfield Park, which was built by the city of Macon, Georgia on land willed to the city on condition that only white people be permitted to use it. In an earlier case, the Court had held that Baconsfield was effectively a city park, so continued segregation was unconstitutional state action. <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, 382 U.S. 296 (1966). The state courts then determined that because the original discriminatory condition of the will could not be fulfilled, the land reverted to the donor’s heirs as a matter of state law. The Supreme Court held that there was no state action in closing of the park to fulfill the testator’s discriminatory intent. <i>Evans v. Abney</i>, 396 U.S. 435 (1970).</p>

The comments make clear that this does not apply constitutional standards to restrictions whose enforcement would not otherwise constitute state action. Rather, it means that if a servitude would be unconstitutional if enforced by a state court, it is also invalid before enforcement as a matter of public policy. The drafters state, “Although there may seem to be little practical difference between an unenforceable servitude and an invalid one, recognizing the invalidity of a servitude that is not enforceable under any circumstances may facilitate its removal from the title or from the governing documents of a common-interest community.” <i>Id.</i> cmt.

Kramer</i> that restrict sale or rental of dwellings based on race or religion<i>.</i> Some courts, however, have held that covenants that make a residence less livable for particular groups but do not make the property <i>unavailable</i> do not violate the act unless it is shown that they were enacted to target that group. In a particularly egregious case, the Seventh Circuit considered a condominium association that interpreted a restriction prohibiting residents from placing “objects of any sort . . . outside Unit entrance doors” to prohibit residents from hanging mezuzot, rectangular boxes a few inches long containing a passage from the Torah, which Jews are commanded to hang on their lintels. The condo repeatedly removed the Blochs’ mezuzot, including during Mr. Bloch’s funeral (even though they left the coat rack the Blochs had rented in the hall). A panel of the Seventh Circuit rejected the FHA claim entirely; en banc, the court agreed that the condo had never made the property “unavailable” to the Blochs because they had never moved out, but remanded for determination of whether the condo intentionally discriminated against them. <i>Bloch v. Frischholz</i>, 587 F.3d 771 (7th Cir. 2009) (en banc). Is this the correct interpretation of the statute?</p>
<p id="c597e89a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Conflict with religious practices.</b> Neutral rules in common interest developments often conflict with the religious practices of residents. Restrictions on changes to exterior elements may prohibit not only mezuzot, but also Hindu jhandi flags, South Asian kolam drawings, Virgin Mary statues, and Jewish sukkot. <i>See</i> Angela C. Carmela, <i>Religion Free Environments in Common Interest Communities,</i> 38 Pepp. L. Rev. 57, 67-71 (2010). Prohibitions on using common areas for religious worship are also common. <i>Id.</i> at 71-72. While discriminating against a particular religion in enacting or enforcing such laws would violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, courts uphold otherwise neutral laws, even those that discriminate against religion generally, finding that they do not make housing unavailable because of religion. <i>See Savanna Club Worship Service, Inc. v. Savanna Club Homeowners Association, Inc.</i>, 456 F. Supp. 2d 1223 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (upholding condo rule that prohibited use of common areas for worship); <i>Tien Tao Association Inc. v.

Reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.</b> In 1988, the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> was amended to prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. §3604(f). Although intentional discrimination is clearly prohibited, so are practices that make it more difficult for individuals with disabilities to enjoy the property. Among other things, discrimination includes refusals to make “reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” §3604(f)(3)(B). This provision has been interpreted to prohibit enforcement of covenants restricting property to single-family residential housing where those covenants were interpreted to prohibit group homes of people with disabilities living in a family-like setting. <i>Hill v. Community of Damien Malokai</i>, 121 N.M. 353 (N.M. 1994) (covenant could not be interpreted to prohibit group home for four unrelated adults with AIDS), to require amendments to rules and covenants to provide accessible parking, <i>Gittleman v.

<p id="c5980fae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law has long contained a strong presumption that property owners should be able to transfer their interests. This presumption may conflict with efforts by owners and developers to control ownership and occupancy of neighboring communities. Promoting alienability may allow property to shift easily to a more valued use, enhance freedom and flexibility for current owners, encourage dispersal of property to new owners, and prevent discriminatory exclusion. At the same time, restraints on alienation may enhance the value of units to be marketed and allow owners to create cohesive and congenial communities. Determining when restraints on alienation are and are not reasonable is therefore a core task of property law.</p>

In <i>Clark v. Clark</i>, 99 Md. 356, 58 A. 24, where this court had under construction a will which, after a devise of an absolute estate to the seven children of the testator, provided that the property should not be sold within ten years for partition purposes without their unanimous consent, it was said in the opinion: “This provision of the will if effective would practically amount to a restraint for ten years of all alienation by any child of its share of the estate. We have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that this attempted imposition of restrictions upon the method of alienation and enjoyment of the absolute estate given to the testatrix’ children was contrary to the policy of the law and therefore inoperative and void.”</p>

<p id="c5980fba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In practical effect the reservation in the deed before us would give the grantor company unqualified control for a term of years over the disposition of the property by sale or lease. The recital that the purpose of the restriction is to maintain “a desirable high class residential section,” and to enable the grantor “to pass upon the character desirability and other qualifications of the proposed purchaser or occupant,” was evidently designed to explain rather than to limit the reservation of the power to forbid a transfer of the property by the grantees to any purchaser or lessee who failed to conform, in the opinion of the grantor’s officers, to those indefinite standards. The existence of such a discretionary control would be plainly incompatible with the freedom of alienation, which is one of the characteristic incidents of a fee-simple title.</p>

<p id="c59836d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Serio</i> arose in a period of intense racial and ethnic segregation as builders developed the outskirts of Baltimore. Charles Serio, who owned a fruit stand near the development, was Italian American, although his complaint noted that his wife “was of purest Nordic stock.” George Morris, the developer of the 170-acre subdivision at issue in <i>Serio</i>, was later widely criticized for excluding Jews from his development, and defended himself by saying he was not himself anti-Semitic, but only excluded Jews for “business reasons.” Eric M. Daniel, <i>Northwest Real Estate Company v. Serio: The Invasion of a Northwest Baltimore Suburb</i> (unpublished paper, 2010). Should developers be able to exclude individuals consistent with their senses of the prospective buyer’s “aversions”?</p>
</div>
<p id="c59836d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restraint upon alienation included in the deed seems clearly enough to be one intended merely to give the developer of a suburban area of land power to control the character of the development for a time long enough to secure a return of his capital outlay, and to give early purchasers of lots and buildings some security in their own outlay. In those objects there is nothing against the public interest. The venture of capital for this purpose appears to be distinctly a public benefit rather than a detriment, one which it is to the public advantage to encourage and promote rather than to hinder. But we know that there are real, substantial dangers to be feared in such ventures, and that, under the modern conditions of rapid city growth and rapid shifts of city populations, one of the most important risks is probably that which comes from the chance of invasion into the new neighborhood of an element of the population which the people to whom the developer must look for the return of his outlay will regard as out of harmony with them. However fanciful may be the aversions which give rise to it, and however deplorable they may be, to the developer they and their consequences must be as real as destructive physical forces. And, if it is to the public interest that this method of development be encouraged rather than hindered, then practically there must be a public gain in removal or diminution of this deterring danger. And the temporary restraint on alienation which the parties here involved have adopted to that end must, I think, be viewed as in point of fact reasonable, and from the standpoint of the public interest actually desirable. And, if this is true, then I venture to think there is no substantial reason why the law should interfere with it, denying the parties the right to agree as they have agreed, or denying their agreement full validity.</p>

<p id="c5985dea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At issue is the validity of amendments to the Declaration of Condominium adopted by the condominium owners which restrict the leasing of units in Woodside Village. Woodside Village is a condominium development located in Clearwater, Florida, consisting of 288 units. It was established in 1979 pursuant to Florida’s “Condominium <span title="641" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-641">p. 641</span>Act,” chapter 718, Florida Statutes. Petitioner, Woodside Village Condominium Association, Inc. (“Association”), is the condominium association that was formed pursuant to the Declaration of Condominium of Woodside Village (“Declaration”), recorded in the public records of Pinellas County. Respondents, Adolph S. Jahren and Gary M. McClernan, each own residential condominium units in Woodside Village.</p>
<p id="c5985deb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Section 10.3 of the] original Declaration of Condominium for Woodside Village [permitted leasing of condominium units but required Board of Directors approval for initial leases lasting more than one year]. In addition, §10.3 was amended in 1995 to require that all leases and renewals receive prior approval from the Board of Directors.</p>
<p id="c5985dec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1997 some owners became concerned that units were increasingly becoming non-owner occupied, and that such a condition would have a negative impact on the quality of life in Woodside Village and on the market value of units. Accordingly, [while keeping the requirement of Board approval for leases,] §10.3 was amended in March of 1997 to limit the leasing of units to a term of no more than nine months in any twelve-month period. A provision was also added prohibiting owners from leasing their units during the first twelve months of ownership. [Another provision prohibited owners from renting more than three of their units at any one time.] These amendments were adopted by a vote of at least two-thirds of the unit owners as required by the Declaration. The following year the Association notified respondents in writing that two of their respective units were not in compliance with the nine-month lease restriction set out in §10.3 as amended.</p>
<p id="c5985ded-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the respondents failed to come into compliance with the leasing restrictions, the Association filed complaints in circuit court seeking injunctions to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Declaration. Respondents [denied] that compliance could be mandated under Florida law. In addition, respondents filed counterclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief asserting that the lease restriction was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious, and had no purpose other than to effectively ban all leasing of units. Respondents also asserted the lease restriction was confiscatory and deprived them of lawful uses which were permissible at the time of purchase. Accordingly, respondents sought an injunction prohibiting the Association from enforcing the lease restriction or, alternatively, requiring the Association to compensate respondents for the fair market value of their units.</p>
<p id="c5985dee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Condominiums and the forms of ownership interests therein are strictly creatures of statute. <i>See</i> Flat. Stat. §§718.101-718.622. In Florida, Chapter 718, Florida Statutes, known as Florida’s “Condominium Act,” gives statutory recognition to the condominium form of ownership of real property and establishes a detailed scheme for the creation, sale, and operation of condominiums. Pursuant to §718.104(2), a condominium is created by recording a declaration of condominium in the public records of the county where the land is located.</p>
<p id="c5985def-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The declaration, which some courts have referred to as the condominium’s “constitution,” strictly governs the relationships among the condominium unit owners and the condominium association. [B]ecause condominiums are a creature of statute courts must look to the statutory scheme as well as the condominium declaration and other documents to determine the legal rights of owners and the association.</p>
<p id="c5985df0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="642" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-642">p. 642</span>From the outset, courts have recognized that condominium living is unique and involves a greater degree of restrictions upon the rights of the individual unit owners when compared to other property owners. For instance, in <i>White Egret Condominium, Inc. v. Franklin,</i> 379 So. 2d 346, 350 (Fla. 1979), we recognized that “reasonable restrictions concerning use, occupancy and transfer of condominium units are necessary for the operation and protection of the owners in the condominium concept.” In <i>White Egret,</i> we quoted favorably from <i>Hidden Harbour Estates, Inc. v. Norman</i>, 309 So. 2d 180 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975), to further explain the restrictive nature of condominium ownership and living:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5985df1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inherent in the condominium concept is the principle that to promote the health, happiness, and peace of mind of the majority of the unit owners since they are living in such close proximity and using facilities in common, each unit owner must give up a certain degree of freedom of choice which he might otherwise enjoy in separate, privately owned property. Condominium unit owners comprise a little democratic sub society of necessity more restrictive as it pertains to use of condominium property than may be existent outside the condominium organization.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5985df2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consistent with this analysis of condominium ownership, courts have acknowledged that “increased controls and limitations upon the rights of unit owners to transfer their property are necessary concomitants of condominium living.” <i>Aquarian Foundation, Inc. v. Sholom House, Inc.,</i> 448 So. 2d 1166, 1167 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984). Indeed, section 718.104(5), Florida Statutes, expressly recognizes that a declaration of condominium may contain restrictions concerning the use, occupancy, and transfer of units. <i>See</i> §718.104(5).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E2E_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11E2E_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">20</a></span></p>
<p id="c5985df4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have also consistently recognized that restrictions contained within a declaration of condominium should be clothed with a very strong presumption of validity when challenged. The logic behind this presumption was explained in <i>Hidden Harbour Estates, Inc. v. Basso,</i> 393 So. 2d 637, 639-640 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981), wherein the court reasoned:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5985df5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are essentially two categories of cases in which a condominium association attempts to enforce rules of restrictive uses. The first category is that dealing with the validity of restrictions found in the declaration of condominium itself. The second category of cases involves the validity of rules promulgated by the association’s board of directors or the refusal of the board of directors to allow a particular use when the board is invested with the power to grant or deny a particular use.</p>
<p id="c5985df6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the first category, the restrictions are clothed with a very strong presumption of validity which arises from the fact that each individual unit owner purchases his unit knowing of and accepting the restrictions to be imposed. Such restrictions are very <span title="643" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-643">p. 643</span>much in the nature of covenants running with the land and they will not be invalidated absent a showing that they are wholly arbitrary in their application, in violation of public policy, or that they abrogate some fundamental constitutional right.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5988507-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Significantly, Fla. Stat. §718.110 also provides broad authority for amending a declaration of condominium. In particular, section 718.110(1)(a) provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5988508-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the declaration fails to provide a method of amendment, the declaration <i>may be amended as to all matters</i> except those listed in subsection (4) or subsection (8) if the amendment is approved by the owners of not less than two-thirds of the units. (emphasis added)</p>
</div>
<p id="c5988509-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based upon this broad statutory authority and the provisions for amendment set out in the declaration of condominium, courts have recognized the authority of condominium unit owners to amend the declaration on a wide variety of issues, including restrictions on leasing. Of course, §718.110(1)(a) itself contains some restrictions on the amendment process. For example, pursuant to subsections (4) and (8), all unit owners must consent to amendments which materially alter or modify the size, configuration or appurtenances to the unit, change the percentage by which the unit owner shares the common expenses and owns the common surplus of the condominium, or permit timeshare estates to be created in any unit of the condominium, unless otherwise provided in the declaration as originally recorded. <i>See</i> Fla. Stat. §718.110(4), (8). These provisions are not at issue here.</p>
<p id="c598850a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Seagate Condo. Ass’n, Inc. v. Duffy</i>, 330 So. 2d 484 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976), the court upheld an amendment to the declaration of condominium prohibiting leasing of any units, except for limited periods in cases of hardship. The trial court held that the amendment was both an unreasonable restriction and an unlawful restraint on alienation and awarded damages for lost rents to the unit owners who challenged the amendment. On appeal, the Fourth District reversed, and explained, <i>id.</i> at 486-487:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c598850b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The restriction . . . is reasonable. Given the unique problems of condominium living in general and the special problems endemic to a tourist oriented community in South Florida in particular, appellant’s avowed objective — to inhibit transciency and to impart a certain degree of continuity of residence and a residential character to their community — is, we believe, a reasonable one, achieved in a not unreasonable manner by means of the restrictive provision in question. The attainment of this community goal outweighs the social value of retaining for the individual unit owner the absolutely unqualified right to dispose of his property in any way and for such duration or purpose as he alone so desires.</p>
</div>
<p id="c598850c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court upheld the amendment even as it was applied to unit owners who acquired their units prior to the amendments.</p>
<p id="c598850d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that the majority of courts in other jurisdictions have held that a duly adopted amendment restricting either occupancy or leasing is binding upon unit owners who purchased their units before the amendment was effective. <i>See Ritchey v. Villa Nueva Condo. Ass’n</i>, 146 Cal. Rptr. 695, 700 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978); <i>Apple II Condo. Ass’n v. Worth Bank &amp; Trust Co</i>., 659 N.E.2d 93 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995); <i>Breezy Point Holiday Harbor <span title="644" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-644">p. 644</span>Lodge-Beachside Apartment Owners’ Ass’n v. B.P. P’ship</i>, 531 N.W.2d 917, 920 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995); <i>McElveen-Hunter v. Fountain Manor Ass’n, Inc.</i>, 399 S.E.2d 112 (N.C. 1991); <i>Shorewood West Condo. Ass’n v. Sadri</i>, 992 P.2d 1008, 1012 (Wash. 2000); <i>but see 560 Ocean Club, L.P. v. Ocean Club Condo. Ass’n (In re 560 Ocean Club, L.P.)</i>, 133 B.R. 310, 320 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1991); <i>Breene v. Plaza Tower Ass’n</i>, 310 N.W.2d 730, 734 (N.D. 1981).</p>
<p id="c598850e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hold otherwise, we would have to conclude that the right to amend a declaration of condominium is substantially limited, well beyond those limitations imposed by the Legislature in section 718.110(4) and (8). We would also be faced with the difficult task of deciding what subjects could be addressed by the amendment process, a task much better suited for the Legislature, as can be seen by its imposition of restrictions in section 718.110.</p>
<p id="c598850f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondents in this case purchased their units subject to the Declaration which expressly provides that it can be amended and sets forth the procedure for doing so. Section 14 of the Declaration generally provides that an amendment may be adopted by a supermajority of two-thirds of the owners.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E97_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11E97_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">21</a></span> Further, section 13 expressly states that each owner shall be governed by the Declaration as amended from time to time. In addition, the legal description for each of respondents’ units that were allegedly being used in violation of the lease restriction provides that the units are subject to the restrictions contained in the Declaration and subsequent amendments thereto.</p>
<p id="c5988511-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, we find that respondents were on notice that the unique form of ownership they acquired when they purchased their units in the Woodside Village Condominium was subject to change through the amendment process, and that they would be bound by properly adopted amendments.</p>
<p id="c5988512-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also conclude that the respondents have failed to demonstrate that the restriction, in and of itself, violates public policy or respondents’ constitutional rights, at least as asserted herein. As discussed above, most such restrictions simply come with the unique territory of condominium ownership. Indeed, it is restrictions such as these that distinguish condominium living from rental apartments or single-family residences. Hence, persons acquiring units in condominiums are on constructive notice of the extensive restrictions that go with this unique, and some would say, restrictive, form of residential property ownership and living. Accordingly, we conclude the amendment is valid and enforceable against respondents.</p>
<p id="c5988513-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize the concerns that owners, such as respondents, who purchased their individual condominium units for investments have regarding the imposition of lease restrictions through subsequent declaration amendments without the consent of all unit owners. The question is, of course, how far can two-thirds of the condominium owners go in restricting leasing rights in the condominium units. The answer will <span title="645" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-645">p. 645</span>usually be found in the legislative scheme creating and governing condominiums. Although we believe such concerns are not without merit, we are constrained to the view that they are better addressed by the Legislature. If condominium owners are to be restrained in their enactment of such lease restrictions, it is appropriate that such restraint be set out in the legislative scheme that created and regulates condominiums and condominium living. As noted above, the Legislature has demonstrated its awareness of the need for limitations on the authority of unit owners to amend a declaration by its enactment of section 718.110(1)(a), (4), and (8). However, as noted, in this instance no provision in the Condominium Act prohibits the adoption of an amendment imposing a lease restriction, nor does any provision require the consent of all unit owners to adopt such an amendment. To the contrary, the Condominium Act provides broad authority for amending a declaration of condominium. <i>See</i> Fla. Stat. §718.110(1)(a).</p>
<p id="c598ac24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">P<span class="epub-small-caps">EGGY</span> A. Q<span class="epub-small-caps">UINCE</span>, J., specially concurring.</p>
<p id="c598ac25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I concur in the majority’s decision which quashes the decision by the Second District Court of Appeal. I write simply to urge the Legislature to seriously consider placing some restrictions on present and/or future condominium owners’ ability to alter the rights of existing condominium owners. At the time the units in question here were purchased, the owners had the right to lease their property with relatively few restrictions. This valuable right may well have been the determinative factor for their decisions to buy these properties. As the district court suggested, there should at least be some type of “escape” provision for those “unit owners whose substantial property rights are altered by amendments to declarations adopted after they acquire their property.”</p>

<p id="c598ac28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Direct and indirect restraints on alienation.</b> Total restraints on alienation of fee simple interests are uniformly held void and unenforceable. <i>Statham v. Kelly</i>, 584 S.E.2d 246 (Ga. 2003) (invalidating requirement that devisees use property as their personal residences); <i>R.H. Macy &amp; Co. v. May Department Stores Co</i>., 653 A.2d 461 (Md. 1995). Courts traditionally have held that an absolute restraint on alienation is “repugnant” to the nature of a “fee simple” interest in real property. <i>Statham</i>, 584 S.E.2d at 246. The argument seems to be that a fee simple is a property interest that is by definition alienable so a restraint on alienation cannot attach to it. This argument is formalistic and circular; it gives no <i>reason</i> for refusing to allow the property to be inalienable. The argument is not wholly without content, however; it appeals to the idea that owners should presumptively have full control over the property they own, and one of the central powers that owners want and need is the power to transfer the property on terms chosen by them. Absolute prohibitions on alienation thus seem to contradict the very notion of ownership. <i>See De Peyster v. Michael</i>, 6 N.Y. 467, 506 (1852).</p>
<p id="c598ac29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Short of an absolute prohibition on alienation, however, most courts today hold that reasonable restraints or preconditions on alienation are valid, even if they attach <span title="646" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-646">p. 646</span>to fee interests. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §3.4 (2000). Reasonableness is determined by “weighing the utility of the restraint against the injurious consequences of enforcing the restraint.” <i>Id.</i>; <i>see, e.g., Alby v. Banc One Financial</i>, 128 P.3d 81 (Wash. 2006) (upholding restriction on mortgaging or encumbering land during life of grantor, where land was sold by grantors to their daughter and son-in-law at far below market price).</p>
<p id="c598ac2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Private controls on land use may also make property less alienable by eliminating buyers who do not want the land with the restrictions. Such restrictions may be challenged as <b>indirect restraints on alienation</b>, but these claims are very difficult to win if the restriction was voluntarily entered into and has some justification. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Wykeham Rise, LLC v. Federer</i>, 52 A.3d 702 (Conn. 2012) (reversing and remanding for factual development summary judgment finding of invalidity of covenant prohibiting any development on restricted land); <i>Lamar Advertising v. Larry &amp; Vicki Nicholls, LLC</i>, 213 P.3d 641 (Wyo. 2009) (finding 15-year renewal on billboard lease was valid although the billboard prevented development of the property and rent on the billboard had been fixed at $400 since 1990); <i>Restatement (Third)</i> for example, invalidates indirect restraints only if they “lack[] a rational justification.” <i>Id.</i> §3.5(2).</p>
<p id="c598ac2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Consent to sell clauses.</b> As <i>Serio</i> shows, covenants that require owners to obtain the consent of the grantor or developer of the subdivision or condominium are often struck down by the courts as unreasonable direct restraints on alienation. <i>See Camino Gardens Association, Inc. v. McKim</i>, 612 So. 2d 636 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993); <i>Kenney v. Morgan</i>, 325 A.2d 419 (Md. 1974). If the developer no longer owns any land in the development, the covenant will violate the traditional rule prohibiting the enforcement of a covenant when the benefit is held in gross. Even under the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> rule that benefits may be held in gross to achieve a legitimate interest, it is unclear what legitimate interest a developer who no longer owns land would retain in consenting to future sales. The dissenting opinion in <i>Serio</i> provides a policy argument in favor of enforcing covenants that give developers the power to consent to future sales while the developer still owns units, and perhaps for a short period afterward. The analysis in the majority opinion is based on the formalistic repugnancy thesis. Assume that the court would not imply a duty to act reasonably but would interpret the covenant to give the grantor full discretion to grant or withhold consent to any sale. Can you provide a better, policy-based justification for invalidating such a provision than that given by the majority opinion in <i>Serio</i> of Justice Urner? How would the dissenting judge respond to these new arguments?</p>
<p id="c598ac2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to grantor/developer consent requirements, covenants that grant such powers to a homeowners or condominium association are ordinarily upheld either if they (a) require the association to act reasonably, see<i> Laguna Royale Owners Association v. Darger</i>, 174 Cal. Rptr. 136 (Ct. App. 1981) or (b) are in the form of <i>preemptive rights</i> that ensure that the owner can transfer the unit for its fair market value to the association or its members or that require the holder of the preemptive right to match any bona fide offers made by a third party. <i>Smith v. Mitchell,</i> 269 S.E.2d 608 (N.C. 1980). Discretionary powers over transfer are particularly likely to be upheld in <span title="647" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-647">p. 647</span>the special case of <i>cooperatives</i> because of the greater financial interdependence of the owners. Mariah Carey, Barbra Streisand, Madonna, Rush Limbaugh, and Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar and owner of Harrod’s, are all among the rich and famous rejected by co-op boards.</p>
<p id="c598d33d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Limitations on leasing.</b> As <i>Woodside Village</i> notes, most courts agree that leasing restrictions in condominium declarations can be retroactively imposed on owners who purchased units before those restrictions were adopted. Courts differ, however, on whether such restrictions can be imposed by bylaw rather than amendments to the declaration. <i>Compare Apple Valley Gardens Association v. MacHutta</i>, 763 N.W.2d 126 (Wis. 2009) (upholding bylaw) <i>with Kiekel v. Four Colonies Homes Association</i>, 162 P.3d 57 (Kan. App. 2007) (invalidating bylaw). The Florida legislature effectively overruled <i>Woodside</i> in 2004 by enacting Fla. Stat. §718.110(13), which prohibits imposing retroactive lease restrictions on nonconsenting owners. Is this fact relevant in determining whether the Florida Supreme Court correctly interpreted the Florida statute? If so, how?</p>

<p id="c598d342-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rise of Airbnb and similar platforms has driven battles over short-term rentals into high gear. <i>See Adams v. Kimberley One Townhouse Owner’s Association, Inc.</i>, 352 P.3d 492 (Idaho 2015) (covenant amendment prohibiting rentals of under six months was valid and did not unduly restrain alienation); <i>Wilkinson v. Chiwawa Communities Association</i>, 327 P.3d 614 (Wash. 2014) (covenants could not be amended to prohibit short-term rentals without unanimous consent); <i>Watts v. Oak Shores Community Association</i>, 185 Cal. Rptr. 3d 376 (Ct. App. 2015) (upholding rules imposing $325 fee for owners who rent their homes and limiting parking and boat docking by renters). Should short-term leases be treated differently from longer ones? Why or why not?</p>

<p id="c598d343-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Charities.</b> Restraints on alienation are generally allowed when the holder of the property interest is a charity. <i>See Atlanta Development Authority v. Clark Atlanta University, Inc.</i>, 784 S.E.2d 353, 357 (Ga. 2016). Can you imagine what policies underlie this exception to the rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation?</p>
<p id="c598d344-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Low-income housing.</b> In recent years, charitable organizations called <i>community development corporations</i> (CDCs) have established housing for low-income families. To ensure that the housing remains available for such families, it is often subject to restraints on alienation that prohibit leasing the property or sale to a family that is not a low-income family. In <i>City of Oceanside v. McKenna</i>, 264 Cal. Rptr. 275 (Ct. App. 1990), Michael Shawn McKenna purchased a condominium in a development that had been sold by the city for less than its fair market value to a developer for the express purpose of creating housing affordable by low- and <span title="648" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-648">p. 648</span>moderate-income persons. The units were subject to covenants that prohibited owners from renting their units out and from “failing to occupy the dwelling as the owner’s principal place of residence for any period.” McKenna got a new job in San Francisco and sought to rent his unit. The city sued him to enforce the covenant. The court noted that “[o]n determining whether a restraint on alienation is unreasonable, the court must balance the justification for the restriction against the quantum of the restraint. The greater the restraint, the stronger the justification must be to support it.” <i>Id.</i> at 279. It held that the restriction on leasing was a reasonable restraint on alienation because “the provision of housing for low and moderate income persons is in keeping with the public policy of this state. Thus, the restrictions support rather than offend the policies of this state.” <i>Id.</i> at 280.</p>

<p id="c598d347-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anticompetitive covenants are enforceable under the common law only if they are “reasonable.” In <i>Whitinsville Plaza v. Kotseas</i>, 390 N.E.2d 243 (Mass. 1979), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court defined reasonable anticompetitive covenants as ones that are “reasonably limited in time and space [and product line] and consonant with the public interest” and that “serve a purpose of facilitating orderly and harmonious development for commercial use.” This approach has been adopted by other courts as well. <i>See BP Products North America, Inc. v. Stanley</i>, 669 F.3d 184, 188-189 (4th Cir. 2012) (upholding deed to three gas stations requiring them to sell only BP gas); <i>Davidson Brothers, Inc. v. D. Katz &amp; Sons, Inc</i>., 579 A.2d 288 (N.J. 1990).</p>
<p id="c598fa58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases concerning anticompetitive covenants occur in the context of shopping center leases. Further, most claims proceed not on the basis of the common law reasonableness requirement but on the basis of federal antitrust policy contained in the <i>Sherman Antitrust Act</i>, 15 U.S.C. §1 <i>et seq</i>. This act prohibits all contracts “in restraint of trade.” However, as the court explains in <i>Optivision, Inc. v. Syracuse Shopping Center Associates</i>, 472 F. Supp. 665, 674, 676, 679 (N.D.N.Y. 1979):</p>

<p id="c598fa59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If this provision were to be read literally, all commercial contracts would be regarded as violative of the Act since every agreement binds the contracting parties to its terms, and, accordingly, restrains their commercial dealings to a certain extent. Recognizing that it was not Congress’ intention to prohibit all contracts nor even all contracts that cause an insignificant or attenuated restraint of trade, the Supreme Court adopted the rule of reason as the standard of analysis for scrutinizing most business relations under the <i>Sherman Act</i>. Under this rule, all the circumstances presented by a particular case must be evaluated by the trier of fact to determine whether the complained of conduct imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition.</p>
<p id="c598fa5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Court is unable to conclude that exclusivity clauses in shopping center leases are unreasonable in all possible circumstances. The competitive impact of such arrangements may vary considerably depending upon the availability of suitable alternate locations in the relevant market, and upon the strength of the remaining competition. In addition, there is a possible economic justification for a provision of this nature. In some situations, it may be necessary to include such a clause in a shopping center <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>lease in order to attract to the center a certain type of store which might be unwilling to commit itself to a lease with high rentals if it knows that a competing store will be present in the center.</p>

<p id="c598fa5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Dunafon v. Delaware McDonald’s Corp</i>., 691 F. Supp. 1232 (W.D. Mo. 1988), an owner promised lessee McDonald’s that it would not grant a lease “to any persons to engage in a carry-out fast food restaurant in which food and beverages are dispensed that is in direct competition with lessee within the mall shopping center.” An owner of a Taco Bell restaurant sued both the lessor and lessee for a declaratory judgment that the covenant violated the <i>Sherman Act</i>. The court held that such covenants were not per se unlawful but would constitute unreasonable restraints on trade only if they violate the “rule of reason.”</p>
<p id="c598fa5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule of reason requires the court to examine the circumstances to determine whether the operation of the covenant actually effectuates an unreasonable restraint on competition. The court will first define the purpose and geographic scope of the covenant, and determine whether the land affected is the only land suitable for the business. <i>See Oliver v. Quynn</i>, 303 P.3d 1119, 1124-1125 (Wyo. 2013) (upholding covenant prohibiting sales of alcohol by a bowling alley next to a restaurant/bar). It will then compare the anticompetitive effect of the covenant with its pro-competitive effect. An anticompetitive covenant may increase competition because it provides security that induces a new competitor to enter the market, thereby generating new business and new competition. In <i>Dunafon</i>, the court determined that the covenant induced McDonald’s to invest in creating a new restaurant and that the presence of this restaurant helped generate business for the shopping center. Because the area previously had little commercial property and few fast-service restaurants, the covenant may have had the effect of inducing new competition to emerge, rather than stifling it. Given the availability of nearby sites where competing fast food restaurants could locate, the court found that the pro-competitive effects of the covenant outweighed its anticompetitive effects and that it was therefore lawful and enforceable.</p>

Seeking to protect her business, the entrepreneur convinces the landlord to include the following language in the lease: “Landlord covenants not to permit any other property in the building to be used for operation of a deli.” The entrepreneur opens and begins operating a profitable deli. Later, a second entrepreneur rents space in the building and opens a sit-down restaurant. The restaurant does not harm the deli’s business because it caters to a different clientele. However, after a year, the restaurant begins subletting some of its space to a cart that sells convenient, deli-style sandwiches at lunchtime. The deli’s business suffers as people start buying from the cart. The deli owner sues the landlord, the restaurant, and the cart owner <span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>seeking to enforce the covenant. She argues that the cart is effectively a “deli” because it sells deli-style sandwiches. She also argues that she never would have invested so much money, time, and labor in the deli if she had known that the landlord was going to allow another tenant to breach the covenant. The defendants respond that there is no breach, since a cart is simply not a deli. They argue in the alternative that even if the cart is effectively a deli, enforcing such an anticompetitive covenant is void as against public policy, because the labor force downtown needs convenient places to eat and competition is desirable.

<p id="c599207b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is an appeal from a permanent injunction granted by the Court of Chancery upon the petition of the plaintiffs, The Town of Bethany Beach, et al., prohibiting the defendant, El Di, Inc. (“El Di”) from selling alcoholic beverages at Holiday House, a restaurant in Bethany Beach owned and operated by El Di.</p>
<p id="c599207c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">El Di purchased the Holiday House in 1969. In December 1981, El Di filed an application with the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (the “Commission”) for a license to sell alcoholic beverages at the Holiday House. On April 15, 1982, finding “public need and convenience,” the Commission granted the Holiday House an on-premises license. The sale of alcoholic beverages at Holiday House began within 10 days of the Commission’s approval. Plaintiffs subsequently filed suit to permanently enjoin the sale of alcoholic beverages under the license.</p>
<p id="c599207d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal it is undisputed that the chain of title for the Holiday House lot included restrictive covenants prohibiting both the sale of alcoholic beverages on the property and nonresidential construction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12029_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N12029_ceea4367-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">23</a></span> The same restriction was placed on property in Bethany Beach as early as 1900 and 1901 when the area was first under development.</p>
<p id="c5994791-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="651" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-651">p. 651</span>As originally conceived, Bethany Beach was to be a quiet beach community. The site was selected at the end of the nineteenth-century by the Christian Missionary Society of Washington, D.C. In 1900, the Bethany Beach Improvement Company (“BBIC”) was formed. The BBIC purchased lands, laid out a development and began selling lots. To insure the quiet character of the community, the BBIC placed restrictive covenants on many plots, prohibiting the sale of alcohol and restricting construction to residential cottages. Of the original 180 acre development, however, approximately 1/3 was unrestricted.</p>
<p id="c5994792-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Town of Bethany Beach was officially incorporated in 1909. The municipal limits consisted of 750 acres including the original BBIC land (hereafter the original or “old-Town”), but expanded far beyond the 180 acre BBIC development. The expanded acreage of the newly incorporated Town, combined with the unrestricted plots in the original Town, left only 15 percent of the new Town subject to the restrictive covenants.</p>
<p id="c5994793-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the restriction prohibiting commercial building (“no other than a dwelling or cottage shall be erected . . .”), commercial development began in the 1920’s on property subject to the covenants. This development included numerous inns, restaurants, drug stores, a bank, motels, a town hall, shops selling various items including food, clothing, gifts and novelties and other commercial businesses. Of the 34 commercial buildings presently within the Town limits, 29 are located in the old-Town originally developed by BBIC. Today, Bethany Beach has a permanent population of some 330 residents. In the summer months the population increases to approximately 10,000 people within the corporate limits and to some 48,000 people within a 4 mile radius. In 1952, the Town enacted a zoning ordinance which established a central commercial district designated C-1 located in the old-Town section. Holiday House is located in this district.</p>
<p id="c5994794-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since El Di purchased Holiday House in 1969, patrons have been permitted to carry their own alcoholic beverages with them into the restaurant to consume with their meals. This “brown-bagging” practice occurred at Holiday House prior to El Di’s ownership and at other restaurants in the Town. El Di applied for a license to sell liquor at Holiday House in response to the increased number of customers who were engaging in “brown-bagging” and in the belief that the license would permit restaurant management to control excessive use of alcohol and use by minors. Prior to the time El Di sought a license, alcoholic beverages had been and continue to be readily available for sale at nearby licensed establishments including: one restaurant ½ mile outside the Town limits, 3 restaurants within a 4 mile radius of the Town, and a package store some 200-300 yards from the Holiday House.</p>
<p id="c5994795-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In granting plaintiffs’ motion for a permanent injunction, the Court of Chancery rejected defendant’s argument that changed conditions in Bethany Beach rendered the restrictive covenants unreasonable and therefore unenforceable. The Chancery Court found that although the evidence showed a considerable growth since 1900 in both population and the number of buildings in Bethany Beach, “the basic nature of Bethany Beach as a quiet, family oriented resort has not changed.” The Court also found that there had been development of commercial activity since 1900, but that this “activity is limited to a small area of Bethany Beach and consists mainly of activities for the convenience and patronage of the residents of Bethany Beach.”</p>
<p id="c5994796-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-652">p. 652</span>The Trial Court also rejected defendant’s contention that plaintiffs’ acquiescence and abandonment rendered the covenants unenforceable. In this connection, the Court concluded that the practice of “brown-bagging” was not a sale of alcoholic beverages and that, therefore, any failure to enforce the restriction as against the practice did not constitute abandonment or waiver of the restriction.</p>
<p id="c5994797-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find that the Trial Court erred in holding that the change of conditions was insufficient to negate the restrictive covenant.</p>
<p id="c5994798-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court will not enforce a restrictive covenant where a fundamental change has occurred in the intended character of the neighborhood that renders the benefits underlying imposition of the restrictions incapable of enjoyment. Review of all the facts and circumstances convinces us that the change, since 1901, in the character of that area of the old-Town section now zoned C-1 is so substantial as to justify modification of the deed restriction. We need not determine a change in character of the entire restricted area in order to assess the continued applicability of the covenant to a portion thereof.</p>
<p id="c5994799-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is uncontradicted that one of the purposes underlying the covenant prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors was to maintain a quiet, residential atmosphere in the restricted area. Each of the additional covenants reinforces this objective, including the covenant restricting construction to residential dwellings. The covenants read as a whole evince an intention on the part of the grantor to maintain the residential, seaside character of the community.</p>
<p id="c599479a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But time has not left Bethany Beach the same community its grantors envisioned in 1901. The Town has changed from a church-affiliated residential community to a summer resort visited annually by thousands of tourists. Nowhere is the resultant change in character more evident than in the C-1 section of the old-Town. Plaintiffs argue that this is a relative change only and that there is sufficient evidence to support the Trial Court’s findings that the residential character of the community has been maintained and that the covenants continue to benefit the other lot owners. We cannot agree.</p>
<p id="c599479b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1909, the 180 acre restricted old-Town section became part of a 750 acre incorporated municipality. Even prior to the Town’s incorporation, the BBIC deeded out lots free of the restrictive covenants. After incorporation and partly due to the unrestricted lots deeded out by the BBIC, 85 percent of the land area within the Town was not subject to the restrictions. Significantly, nonresidential uses quickly appeared in the restricted area and today the old-Town section contains almost all of the commercial businesses within the entire Town. Moreover, these commercial uses have gone unchallenged for 82 years.</p>
<p id="c599479c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The change in conditions is also reflected in the Town’s decision in 1952 to zone restricted property, including the lot on which the Holiday House is located, specifically for commercial use. Although a change in zoning is not dispositive as against a private covenant, it is additional evidence of changed community conditions.</p>
<p id="c599479d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Time has relaxed not only the strictly residential character of the area, but the pattern of alcohol use and consumption as well. The practice of “brown-bagging” has continued unchallenged for at least twenty years at commercial establishments <span title="653" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-653">p. 653</span>located on restricted property in the Town. On appeal, plaintiffs rely on the Trial Court finding that the “brown-bagging” practice is irrelevant as evidence of waiver inasmuch as the practice does not involve the sale of intoxicating liquors prohibited by the covenant. We find the “brown-bagging” practice evidence of a significant change in conditions in the community since its inception at the turn of the century. Such consumption of alcohol in public places is now generally tolerated by owners of similarly restricted lots. The license issued to the Holiday House establishment permits the El Di management to better control the availability and consumption of intoxicating liquors on its premises. In view of both the ready availability of alcoholic beverages in the area surrounding the Holiday House and the long-tolerated and increasing use of “brown-bagging” enforcement of the restrictive covenant at this time would only serve to subvert the public interest in the control of the availability and consumption of alcoholic liquors.</p>
<p id="c599479e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the change in conditions in the C-1 district of Bethany Beach, we find it unreasonable and inequitable now to enforce the restrictive covenant. To permit unlimited “brown-bagging” but to prohibit licensed sales of alcoholic liquor, under the circumstances of this case, is inconsistent with any reasonable application of the restriction and contrary to public policy.</p>
<p id="c599479f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We emphasize that our judgment is confined to the area of the old-Town section zoned C-1. The restrictions in the neighboring residential area are unaffected by the conclusion we reach herein.</p>

<p id="c59947a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I respectfully disagree with the majority.</p>
<p id="c59947a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I think the evidence supports the conclusion of the Chancellor, as finder of fact, that the basic nature of the community of Bethany Beach has not changed in such a way as to invalidate those restrictions which have continued to protect this community through the years as it has grown. Although some of the restrictions have been ignored and a portion of the community is now used for limited commercial purposes, the evidence shows that Bethany Beach remains a quiet, family-oriented resort where no liquor is sold. I think the conditions of the community are still consistent with the enforcement of a restrictive covenant forbidding the sale of intoxicating beverages.</p>
<p id="c59947a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion, the toleration of the practice of “brown bagging” does not constitute the abandonment of a longstanding restriction against the sale of alcoholic beverages. The restriction against sales has, in fact, remained intact for more than eighty years and any violations thereof have been short-lived. The fact that alcoholic beverages may be purchased right outside the town is not inconsistent with my view that the quiet-town atmosphere in this small area has not broken down, and that it can and should be preserved. Those who choose to buy land subject to the restrictions should be required to continue to abide by the restrictions.</p>
<p id="c5996eb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I think the only real beneficiaries of the failure of the courts to enforce the restrictions would be those who plan to benefit commercially.</p>
<p id="c5996eb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I think that restrictive covenants play a vital part in the preservation of neighborhood schemes all over the State, and that a much more complete breakdown of the <span title="654" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-654">p. 654</span>neighborhood scheme should be required before a court declares that a restriction has become unenforceable.</p>

<p id="c5996eb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Changed conditions.</b> Covenants will not be enforced if <i>conditions have changed so drastically</i> inside the neighborhood restricted by the covenants that enforcement will be of <i>no substantial benefit</i> to the dominant estates, <i>Restatement of Property</i> §564 (1944). The change “must be so radical as to defeat the essential purpose of the covenant or render the covenant valueless to the parties.” <i>Dierberg v. Wills</i>, 700 S.W.2d 461, 467 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985). <i>See City of Bowie v. MIE Properties, Inc.</i>, 922 A.2d 509, 526, 527 (Md. 2007) (question is whether, “after the passage of a reasonable period of time,” and because of a “dramatic change in the character of the neighborhood” or some other fact, “the continuing validity of the covenant cannot further the purpose for which it was formed in light of changed relevant circumstances.”). The <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> explains that very few cases result in application of the doctrine. “The test is stringent: Relief is granted only if the purpose of the servitude can no longer be accomplished.” <i>Id.</i> §7.10 cmt. a. Some state statutes also require covenants to be of “actual and substantial benefit” in order to be enforceable. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184, §30; N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law §1951.</p>
<p id="c5996eb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The changed conditions doctrine may also apply when substantial changes have occurred <i>outside</i> the restricted subdivision. Lots located on the fringe of the restricted area, however, may not invoke the changed conditions doctrine, even if the adjacent property is engaged in activity contrary to the covenant, if it is still possible for the restrictions to create benefit within the subdivision. If lots on the border of the restricted area could easily free themselves from the covenant, it would quickly lose its effect over time as succeeding blocks of fringe lots succumbed to external changes. The changed conditions doctrine is likely to apply to changes outside the restricted subdivision only when those changes have so adversely affected so many lots in the subdivision that enforcement is pointless. <i>River Heights Associates L.P. v. Batten</i>, 591 S.E.2d 683 (Va. 2004) (refusing to apply the changed conditions doctrine to allow lots on the edge of a restricted subdivision that had been rezoned for commercial use to develop commercially in violation of the covenant). Traditionally, the changed conditions doctrine has not applied to easements.</p>
<p id="c5996eba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>El Di</i> shows, determining when a covenant is no longer of substantial benefit is not a precise science. In <i>Allemong v. Frendzel</i>, 363 S.E.2d 487 (W. Va. 1987), the property was similarly subject to a restraint on the sale of liquor. The current owners of the servient estate, Donald and Lillian Frendzel, operated a grocery convenience store and began to sell liquor. Within a three-mile radius of the property were located numerous sales outlets for beer, including two establishments located within a quarter of a mile of the Frendzels’ store. Because the area immediately surrounding the restricted parcel was predominantly residential and agricultural, however, the court held that there had not been “a radical change or changes in the neighborhood . . . which would <span title="655" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-655">p. 655</span>effectively destroy the objectives of the covenant and thus render it unenforceable.” The court explained, <i>id.</i> at 492:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5996ebb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not agree with the appellant that these commercial properties in the general vicinity of the restricted parcel significantly change the residential character of the immediate area. Even if we were to accept the appellant’s contention, “every effort must be exerted to protect the unchanged portions of residential neighborhoods when businesses begin to encroach on the fringes.” <i>Morris v. Nease</i>, 238 S.E.2d 844, 847 (W. Va. 1977).</p>
<p id="c5996ebc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the evidence, we believe that the nonresidential use of the property in the vicinity of the appellants’ convenience store [has] not destroyed the essential objects and purposes of the restrictive covenant. We further believe that the benefits of the original plan envisioned by the grantor may be realized for that portion of the neighborhood which remains primarily residential and agricultural.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5996ebd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> alters the changed conditions doctrine in several crucial ways. First, it extends the doctrine to easements. Second, it uses termination rules to substitute for controls that had traditionally been applied through the touch and concern test. <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §7.10 cmt. a. Third, it suggests modification of the covenant in lieu of termination if modification will allow the covenant to serve its original purpose. Traditionally, a finding of changed conditions required invalidation of the covenant. Under the <i>Restatement</i> version of the test, however, termination is only allowed if modification is not feasible. <i>Id.</i> §7.10. Also, if the purpose of the servitude can be accomplished but “because of changed conditions the servient estate is no longer suitable for any use permitted by the servitude, a court may modify the servitude to permit other uses under conditions designed to preserve the benefits of the original servitude.” <i>Id.</i> However, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> cautions that a court should rarely intervene if a mechanism exists for terminating the covenant in a manner that does not require the unanimous consent of the beneficiaries, such as a supermajority vote of the members of a homeowners association. <i>Id.</i> §7.10 cmt. a.</p>
<p id="c59995ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Damages versus injunctive relief.</b> As noted above, damages were traditionally not awarded for breach of a covenant unless privity of estate was present under real covenants law, while injunctive relief was available even in the absence of privity. Because most owners want enforcement by injunctive relief and because it makes little sense to make it harder to obtain damages than injunctive relief (the reverse is usually the case), the courts appear now to be ready to award either an injunction or damages for violation of a covenant running with the land whether or not strict vertical privity is present. Remedies are chosen on the basis of their appropriateness under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="c59995cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it comes to modifying or terminating a covenant, an alternative to complete invalidation of a covenant under the changed conditions doctrine is to allow the violation of the covenant to occur upon the payment of compensatory damages to the owners of the dominant estates. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §8.3 (2000); <i>Restatement of Property</i> §564 (1944). When might damages be an appropriate remedy in lieu of injunctive relief? Would they have been appropriate in <i>El Di</i>?</p>

<p id="c59995d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the changed conditions doctrine, which focuses on whether the covenant remains of substantial benefit to the dominant estate, the <i>relative hardship</i> doctrine focuses on the servient estate. A covenant will not be enforced if the harm caused by enforcement, that is, the hardship to the owner of the servient estate, will be greater by a “considerable magnitude” than the benefit to the owner of the dominant estate, <i>Restatement of Property</i> §563 (1944). If the hardship is great and the benefit small, the courts may refuse to enforce the covenant. <i>Appel v. Presley Cos.</i>, 806 P.2d 1054 (N.M. 1991). If, however, the benefit of the covenant is substantial, the courts are unlikely to apply the doctrine even if the hardship to the servient estate is substantial.</p>
<p id="c59995d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in <i>Lange v. Scofield</i>, 567 So. 2d 1299 (Ala. 1990), the court refused to enforce a covenant requiring that all owners of property adjoining or across the street from a parcel consent to the construction of a house on the parcel. One of the surrounding owners refused to give her consent, arguing that another house in the neighborhood would increase density and lower property values. The court found that construction would have no effect on property values and that any benefit received by the neighbor through enforcing the covenant would be negligible and far outweighed by the hardship that enforcement would cause the landowner who wished to construct the house.</p>
<p id="c59995d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement (Third)</i> treats the relative hardship doctrine not as a basis for terminating or modifying servitudes, but, rather, as a factor to consider in determining the availability and selection of appropriate remedies. <i>Restatement (Third)</i> §8.3. If compliance with a covenant is unreasonable because the burden is great and the benefit small, the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> concludes that nonenforcement may be appropriate, but some amount of damages are probably appropriate to compensate the servitude beneficiary for the loss of the benefit of the covenant, small as it may be. <i>Id.</i> §8.3 cmts. a, h.</p>
<p id="c59995d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Shalimar Association v. D.O.C. Enterprises</i>,<i> Inc.,</i> 688 P.2d 682 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1984), the court enforced an equitable servitude requiring an owner to continue operating a golf course against a complaint by the current owner that such a use was not profitable. It refused to apply either the changed conditions or relative hardship doctrines. “A mere change in economic conditions rendering it unprofitable to continue the restrictive use is not alone sufficient to justify abrogating the restrictive covenant.” <i>Id.</i> at 691. What might justify this result? What is the argument on the other side?</p>

<p id="c599bce8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the changed conditions and relative hardship doctrines, the courts have identified a number of general equitable doctrines that may result in nonenforcement of a servitude.</p>

<p id="c59a0b20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioners, owners of a parcel of land subject to certain restrictions known as the Commonwealth Restrictions, seek a determination and declaration that the restrictions are obsolete and unenforceable.</p>
<p id="c59a0b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commonwealth Restrictions date from the middle of the last century. By 1850 the condition of the tidal flats which composed the area now known as the Back Bay had become a nuisance, largely due to drainage problems. The Commonwealth determined to fill in the area and sell lots for dwellings, subject to restrictions in conformity with a comprehensive land use plan.</p>
<p id="c59a0b22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With some exceptions and minor variations the same stipulations and agreements were inserted into all the deeds to land in the Back Bay district, from the Commonwealth as grantor to various private grantees, beginning in 1857.</p>
<p id="c59a0b23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">General Laws ch. 184, §30, on which the petitioners rely, provides that no restriction shall be enforced or declared to be enforceable unless it is determined that the restriction is, at the time of the proceeding, of actual and substantial benefit to a person claiming rights of enforcement. Further, even if a restriction is found to be of such benefit, it shall not be enforced except by award of money damages if any of several enumerated conditions are found to exist.</p>
<p id="c59a0b24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are as follows. The petitioners are the owners of two parcels of land separated by Public Alley No. 437; the first is known as 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Commonwealth Avenue and the second as 13-15 Arlington Street and 1, 3, and 5 Newbury Street. The former is presently a vacant lot; the latter is the site of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Both are subject to various of the Commonwealth Restrictions. The petitioners plan to build on the former lot a 285 foot high hotel-apartment building, with a twelve-story structure as a bridge over the alley, connecting it with the Ritz-Carlton. Plans call for the new building to contain such restaurant and shopping facilities as are usually incidental to the running of a large hotel, and an underground garage for off-street parking as required by the Boston Zoning Code.</p>
<p id="c59a0b25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The respondents are the owners of 12-14 Commonwealth Avenue, a parcel which is adjacent to the petitioners’ vacant lot and backs on the same alley. This property <span title="659" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-659">p. 659</span>contains an eight-story building with eight apartments on each floor except the first, half facing Commonwealth Avenue and half the alley in back, half (the corner apartments) being of two rooms and half efficiency apartments. The thirty-two rear apartments derive their principal light and air from one window in each apartment on the alley.</p>
<p id="c59a0b26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Among the restrictions contained in the original deeds to the [defendant’s parcels] are the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c59a0b27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) That a passageway, sixteen feet wide, is to be laid out in the rear of the premises, the same to be filled in by the Commonwealth, and to be kept open and maintained by the abutters in common.</p>
</div>
<p id="c59a0b28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that the most difficult aspect of this case concerns the passageway. There will be no obstruction to the movements of persons or vehicles, since the bridge between the Ritz-Carlton building and the new building will start at a point thirteen feet above the ground. Nevertheless, the bridge will occupy most of the space between the two buildings for a height of twelve stories, with consequent effect on light and air. For this reason we have determined, as discussed later in this opinion, that damages are to be awarded for loss of light and air.</p>
<p id="c59a0b29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equity does not invariably and automatically grant specific enforcement of such restrictions on the use of land. While the usual grounds for denying such enforcement in a case involving real property is <i>laches</i>, or other inequitable conduct by the party seeking to enforce the restriction, this need not always be the case. The <i>Restatement of Property</i> §563 (1944) would deny enforcement, apparently without compensation, if the “harm done by granting the injunction will be disproportionate to the benefit secured thereby.” The official comments . . . suggest[] that the standard be a “disproportion . . . of considerable magnitude.”</p>
<p id="c59a0b2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The . . . restriction . . . mandat[es] that the passageway behind the petitioners’ lot, now Public Alley No. 437, shall “be kept open.” The judge found, on evidence which clearly supports his findings, that the respondents have an actual and substantial benefit in the enforcement of this restriction and that the proposed building would violate it. However, his further findings that the restriction is obsolete and that the respondents are entitled to only nominal damages are plainly wrong. We nevertheless hold that, even though it is not obsolete, the restriction shall not be specifically enforced. In lieu of specific enforcement, damages are to be awarded.</p>
<p id="c59a0b2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considerable and conflicting evidence was adduced at trial as to the potential effect that bridging the alley would have on the light and air available to the apartments in the rear of the respondents’ building. It appears that all parties are in agreement that the “bridge” would decrease the direct sunlight available to the apartments; the dispute is as to the magnitude of the decrease. The testimony on ambient light and on available air was conflicting as to whether there would be an increase or a decrease. Clearly there would be some effect on the property. There was testimony to support a finding that the effect would not be <i>de minimis</i> but would be substantial.</p>
<p id="c59a0b2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are several alternatives in [Mass. Gen. Laws] ch. 184, §30, which support the judge’s decision to deny specific enforcement. On the evidence in this case, the <span title="660" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-660">p. 660</span>petitioners have made a compelling case for such denial based on all of the following statutory grounds: “(1) changes in the character of the properties affected or their neighborhood [and] in applicable public controls of land use or construction, or in any other conditions or circumstances, [which] reduce materially the need for the restriction or the likelihood of the restriction accomplishing its original purposes . . . or (4) continuation of the restriction on the parcel against which enforcement is claimed . . . would impede reasonable use of land for purposes for which it is most suitable, and would tend to impair the growth of the neighborhood or municipality in a manner inconsistent with the public interest . . . or (5) enforcement, except by award of money damages, is for any other reason inequitable or not in the public interest.”</p>
<p id="c59a0b2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these criteria, we observe that the evidence shows, <i>inter alia</i>, that the properties and the neighborhood have drastically changed. Single-family residences have been replaced by moderately high-rise buildings for apartments and institutional use. We have found that the passageway restriction is of an actual and substantial benefit in its effect on light and air, but the proposed bridge will have only a modest impact in view of the drastic changes which have already occurred. In particular, an occupant of the respondents’ building, in looking out a rear window of that structure, would see to his immediate left and across the passageway the high-rise Ritz-Carlton building. As to the petitioners’ unused land to that viewer’s immediate left, on the same side of the passageway, it seems inevitable that, even if the bridge were not permitted, a building higher than the respondents’ building would at some time be constructed on it.</p>
<p id="c59a0b2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record also clearly supports a conclusion that continued enforcement of the restriction would tend to impede reasonable use of the land for purposes for which it is most suitable. The uncontradicted evidence was that a free standing tower is economically unfeasible presumably because of the small size of the parcel, and that the plaintiffs’ proposal for an apartment-hotel complex connected to the adjacent Ritz-Carlton is the most suitable use of the land.</p>
<p id="c59a0b2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence supports a conclusion that the proposed bridge is not an arbitrary and unnecessarily large intrusion. The twelve stories of the bridge relate to twelve of the lower floors of the new building which are to be used as a hotel; above those floors there will be apartments. The hotel floors are feasible only if connected to the hotel services of the Ritz Carlton. Therefore, all considerations of equity, and the most suitable use of the property, support the planned bridge construction in size as well as purpose.</p>
<p id="c59a3240-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Weighing and comparing the interests of the parties and the public in accordance with the several provisions of §30 brings us almost inevitably to the conclusion that there should be no specific enforcement. In the words of provision (5) of the statute, which unquestionably confers the broadest discretion on the court, enforcement here would be inequitable and not in the public interest. The magnitude of the harm to the petitioners in specific enforcement of the restriction far exceeds that to the respondents in its denial. Moreover we are mandated by the statute to have due regard for the public interest in determining the manner of enforcement of a restriction. The land in question has been vacant for over a decade. We take judicial notice of the exceedingly high property tax rates current in the city of Boston and the beneficial effect on the tax base of the petitioners’ plan to construct a multimillion dollar project of public <span title="661" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-661">p. 661</span>usefulness on presently unutilized land. In the circumstances both the balance of equities between the parties and a consideration of the public interest require that the respondents accept money damages by way of enforcement of this restriction.</p>

Such further evidence as the judge deems to be necessary shall be heard on the issue of damages.</p>

<p id="c59a3243-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree with today’s holding by the court that the restriction with respect to the passageway “was designed to preserve light and air to the properties it benefited,” and that “[a]s this urban area has grown and become ever more congested in the century since this restriction was first imposed, light and air have become more, not less, valuable. The restriction securing the respondents’ rights to them is certainly not obsolete.”</p>
<p id="c59a3244-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question then becomes what remedy or relief is available to the parties. This court holds that notwithstanding its findings that the passageway restriction is of actual and substantial benefit to the respondents and that it has not become obsolete, the petitioners have the right, under the terms of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184, §30, to compel the respondents to receive money damages in lieu of their right to specific enforcement of the restriction.</p>
<p id="c59a3245-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not agree with the ultimate conclusion that under §30 the respondents’ relief should be limited to money damages rather than specific enforcement of the restriction relating to the open passageway.</p>
<p id="c59a3246-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court relies in part on its conclusion that “the properties and the neighborhood have drastically changed (since the restrictions were imposed). Single family residences have been replaced by moderately high-rise buildings for apartments and institutional use.” I do not consider this change to be drastic. It seems clear to me from the record that Commonwealth Avenue in the block between Arlington and Berkeley streets, with its unique architectural and physical features, is one of the few remaining residential boulevards in the city, providing a welcome oasis amidst the skyward push of Boston’s newer commercial buildings. Contrary to the court’s conclusion, I believe that the erection of a twelve-story bridging structure at the very entrance of this block does constitute “an arbitrary and unnecessarily large intrusion” which is not justified by any change in the character of the area.</p>
