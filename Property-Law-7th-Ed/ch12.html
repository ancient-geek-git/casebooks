<p id="c5d05da3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purchase and sale of real property involves a host of complex issues, whether the transaction involves a single-family house, a condominium unit, a shopping center, an office building, or undeveloped land. At the same time, many aspects of these transactions have become routine, particularly for home sales. In many jurisdictions, such transactions generally involve standardized forms, with responsibility for various issues allocated in relatively set ways among the parties. More complex real estate transactions introduce significant variations, and it is in such transactions that lawyers are now most heavily involved. This chapter introduces the basic structure of real estate transactions, including real estate finance, and highlights several issues that are likely to be important in any transaction.</p>
<div id="c5d05da4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5d05da5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">§1.1 Attorneys’ Transactional Roles</p></h3></div>

<p id="c5d05da6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In real estate transactions, as with “deals” more generally, attorneys can play several different roles that are distinct from resolving disputes. Lawyers, of course, are often responsible for memorializing the terms of the parties’ agreements and counseling their clients to understand exactly what the agreements mean. This function is increasingly less important in residential real estate, where brokers often help the parties fill the blanks on form contracts and attorneys appear to be involved in a minority of transactions. Michael Braunstein, <i>Structural Change and Inter-Professional Competitive Advantage: An Example Drawn from Residential Real Estate Conveyancing</i>, 62 Mo. L. Rev. 241, 262 (1997) (citing evidence that attorneys appear to be involved in only 40 percent of residential transactions).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10038_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10038_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> The increasing marginalization of lawyers in <span title="912" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-912">p. 912</span>residential sales may reduce the cost of such transactions, but it may also leave the parties legally vulnerable. If the parties’ understanding of the meaning and effect of their deal diverges from the provisions contained in form contracts, courts will have to respond. Some argue, however, that litigation has sufficiently clarified the rights of the parties (or will do so in the future) and that ordinary home purchasers do not need the participation of an attorney in the transaction to protect their rights. Braunstein, <i>supra,</i> at 271-279. Lawyers, however, remain central to contracting in most other types of real estate transactions.</p>
<p id="c5d05da8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lawyers in real estate transactions work to identify and allocate risks for both sides. Lawyers, for example, are responsible for regulatory compliance in the transaction. Real estate conveyancing is regulated in a number of ways by federal, state, and local governments. For example, the federal <i>Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act</i> (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. §§2601-2617, requires the disclosure of all settlement costs charged to home borrowers and sellers at closing, among other things.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1004D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> Other common risks include matters related to the parties, such as the capacity of a buyer to obtain sufficient financing; the physical state of the property, such as the condition of a building or the presence of environmental hazards; and questions about title to the property, such as whether the seller has the right to convey or an encumbrance limits the use of the property. Particularly in more complicated transactions, lawyers must also negotiate and structure agreements in ways that can bridge divides between the parties and ideally add value. There are a variety of tools that transactional lawyers can bring to bear to help parties reach agreement, such as contingencies, disclosure requirements, warranties, and indemnification provisions.</p>
<p id="c5d05daa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When you read the Offer to Purchase Real Estate and Standard Form Purchase and Sale Agreement, reproduced below, pay attention to how the agreements allocate and respond to common risks and uncertainties and creates mechanisms that may make it easier for parties to achieve their ultimate goal of closing the deal and transferring the property.</p>

<p id="c5d05dad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the simplest home sale to the most complex multi-phase development, most real estate transactions follow a similar structure, and it is useful to organize <span title="913" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-913">p. 913</span>legal issues along a timeline that reflects that structure. The first phase of most real estate transactions is <b>pre-contracting</b>. Here, sellers typically prepare to market property while buyers engage in the search for property. <b>Brokers</b> are the dominant professionals at this stage of the transaction. If the seller and buyer reach agreement on the basic terms of an agreement, which can sometimes be memorialized in a term sheet or informal letter agreement, they will then enter into a contract called a <b>purchase and sale agreement</b>. It is at this stage that lawyers generally enter the scene.</p>
<p id="c5d05dae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract and background common law doctrines then govern what is known as the <b>executory period</b>. During this phase of the transaction, buyers primarily engage in due diligence, investigating the property and its state of title, and often work to arrange for financing. At the same time, sellers have responsibilities as well, such as preparing to lift encumbrances on the property, such as loans that will be paid off from the proceeds of the transaction, and responding to the buyer’s concerns about the property.</p>
<p id="c5d084bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the parties meet their respective obligations, the fourth phase of the transaction is <b>closing</b>. It is at this crucial moment that the lender will fund the loan, the buyer will pay the purchase price, and the seller will convey the property through a <b>deed</b>. Finally, there may be legal issues between the parties <b>post-closing</b>, including liability for problems that were not known at the time of closing and title-related matters that can emerge years after the property changes hands.</p>
<p id="c5d084c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because most real estate transactions involve borrowing by the purchaser to finance the purchase, there are typically two transactions playing out in parallel. The first is the actual conveyance of the property and the second is the funding of the loan to the purchaser. These parallel tracks typically come together at the closing, but real estate attorneys must pay attention to their intersection throughout the transaction. We will address real estate financing in detail later in the chapter.</p>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c5d084c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">

<p id="c5d084c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some sales are made directly by the owner with the buyer. The owner may sell the property directly to a friend, family member, business associate, or acquaintance. In other cases, the owner advertises the property on-line and shows the place directly to prospective buyers. In most cases, however, sellers hire real estate brokers (also called agents or realtors) to help sell the property. The seller normally signs a contract with the broker by which the broker agrees to look for prospective buyers and show the property to them, perhaps for a set period of time such as six months, in exchange for a commission, which is often 5 percent to 7 percent of the sale price.</p>
<p id="c5d084c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three basic types of broker listing agreements.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c5d084c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Exclusive right to sell.</b> The broker has the right to collect the commission if the property is sold to anyone during the period of the contract, even if the sale is to a buyer that the owner found without the broker’s help.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c5d084c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Exclusive agency.</b> The broker gets the commission, or a share of the commission, if the property is sold by her efforts or the efforts of any other broker, but not if the property is sold by the owner.</p></li>
<li class=""><p id="c5d084c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="914" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-914">p. 914</span><b>Open, or nonexclusive.</b> The broker is entitled to a commission only if she is the first person to procure a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to buy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c5d084c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many communities, brokers use <b>multiple listing services</b> established by the local real estate board. Each broker who is a member of the listing service registers every exclusive listing she receives with the listing service. Other brokers will then have access to that information and can attempt to sell the property as well. If any sale goes through, the commission is shared by the listing service and the broker who arranged for the sale. Any broker who finds a buyer will share the commission with the broker hired by the seller.</p>
<p id="c5d084c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disputes sometimes break out between brokers and sellers when the broker finds a buyer who makes a down payment and signs a purchase and sale agreement but then, for whatever reason, the deal falls through. It is quite clear that the seller has a duty to pay the commission if the seller himself wrongfully backs out of the deal after the broker has found a ready, willing, and able buyer. But what happens if the buyer refuses to complete the transaction by paying the rest of the purchase price?</p>
<p id="c5d084ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the buyer backs out of the deal, brokers sometimes allege that they have the right to their commission because they fulfilled their contractual obligation to find a ready, willing, and able buyer. Until the middle of the twentieth century, the prevailing rule was that the broker’s commission was indeed earned and due at the time the purchase and sale agreement was signed, regardless of whether the sale was actually completed. The rule still holds in a number of jurisdictions and is often reflected in standard form brokerage agreements. <i>See</i> Roger Bernhardt &amp; Dale Whitman, <i>When Is a Commission Due: Problems with Broker Listing Agreements</i>, 27 Prob. &amp; Prop. (Jan.-Feb. 2013). This result does not accord with the expectations of most sellers, who contemplated that the commission would be paid only if the deal went through since the commission is normally taken out of the purchase price paid by the buyer. It can also create a problem for sellers if an offer is made at the full asking price in a market where sellers may be able to command a premium above that price. Bernhardt &amp; Whitman, <i>supra</i> (discussing <i>RealPro, Inc. v. Smith Residual Co.</i>, 138 Cal. Rptr. 3d 255 (Ct. App. 2012)).</p>
<p id="c5d084cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although still in the minority, a substantial number of courts have changed the traditional rule, holding that the broker’s commission is earned and due only if the sale is completed. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> McCully, Inc. v. Baccaro Ranch</i>, 816 N.W.2d 728 (Neb. 2012); <i>Tristram’s Landing, Inc. v. Wait</i>, 327 N.E.2d 727 (Mass. 1975). The seller has a duty to pay the commission if the seller defaults and backs out of the deal without a good reason, but the commission is not due if the buyer refuses to go forward. This emerging rule is based on the fact that the “owner hires the broker with the expectation of becoming liable for a commission only in the event a sale of the property is consummated, unless the title does not pass because of the owner’s improper or frustrating conduct.” <i>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v. Johnson</i>, 236 A.2d 843, 853 (N.J. 1967). Although some courts find this rule to be nondisclaimable, <i>id.</i> at 856, others allow the parties to contract around it. <i>Sparks v. Fiduciary National Title Insurance Co.</i>, 294 F.3d 259, 266 (1st Cir. 2002). Many states, however, retain the traditional rule. 11<i> Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §95.05(b).</p>
<p id="c5d084cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="915" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-915">p. 915</span><b>Unauthorized practice of law.</b> Every state requires lawyers to be licensed to practice law, and brokers who provide legal advice or draft complex legal documents for their clients may be subject to penalties for the unauthorized practice of law. <i>Toledo Bar Association v. Chelsea Title Agency of Dayton, Inc.</i>, 800 N.E.2d 29 (Ohio 2003) (unauthorized practice of law for title agency to prepare deed for client when not written by licensed attorney). Brokers often provide standard purchase and sale agreements for sellers and buyers to use. If they do no more than fill the blanks on such forms, these activities are thought be an “incident to the business” of providing brokerage services, and courts are unlikely to find a violation of the laws prohibiting nonlawyers from “practicing law.”</p>
<p id="c5d084cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, if brokers draft deeds, mortgages, or other documents that transfer interests in real property, express opinions on the status of titles or zoning law and the like, or conduct closings, they may be found to have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. These restrictions on the conduct of brokers are intended to “protect[] the public from the potentially severe economic and emotional consequences which may flow from erroneous advice given by persons untrained in the law.” <i>Matrix Financial Services Corp. v. Frazer</i>, 714 S.E.2d 532, 534 (S.C. 2011). <i>Accord, Doe v. McMaster</i>, 585 S.E.2d 773, 776-777 (S.C. 2003) (unauthorized practice of law to prepare closing documents such as deeds and title opinions); <i>Ex parte Watson</i>, 589 S.E.2d 760 (S.C. 2003) (finding it unauthorized practice of law to examine public records and issue an opinion regarding title in connection with tax foreclosure sale).</p>
<p id="c5d0abde-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have begun to loosen these regulations to allow brokers to perform functions that used to be performed by lawyers on the ground that this serves the public interest by lowering the costs of buying and selling real estate. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, for example, authorized brokers and title companies to conduct closings in an area of the state where it was typical for neither seller nor buyer to be represented by a lawyer at the closing. <i>In re Opinion No. 26 of the Commission on Unauthorized Practice of Law</i>, 654 A.2d 1344 (N.J. 1995). While holding that they were engaged in the practice of law, their activity was not “unauthorized” because it was in the public interest for them to help owners conduct real estate transactions, and there was not sufficient warrant to force every owner and every buyer to hire a lawyer in order to buy or sell real estate. <i>See also Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Kentucky Bar Association</i>, 113 S.W.3d 105 (Ky. 2003) (allowing laypersons to conduct real estate closings as long as they do not give legal advice); <i>Dressell v. Ameribank</i>, 664 N.W.2d 151 (Mich. 2003) (not unauthorized practice of law for title company to prepare leases, mortgages, and deeds).</p>
<p id="c5d0abdf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Broker’s duties to buyer.</b> It has become increasingly common for buyers to hire their own brokers to advise them. Buyer’s brokers can be paid a percentage of the sale price (often splitting the commission with the seller’s broker), a fixed fee, or an hourly rate.</p>
<p id="c5d0abe0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What duties, however, does a <i>seller’s</i> agent have to the <i>buyer</i>? Although the seller’s agent is formally working for the seller, many buyers feel that the broker is also working for them. Although they have no contract with the seller’s broker, courts may <span title="916" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-916">p. 916</span>impose certain fiduciary or other obligations toward the buyer. For example, if the seller’s broker fails to reveal relevant information to the buyer, the buyer may sue the broker for fraud. <i>See Jackowski v. Borchelt</i>, 278 P.3d 1100 (Wash. 2012) (fraudulent concealment claim by purchaser against seller’s broker).</p>
<p id="c5d0abe1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Dual agency.</b> Conflicts may arise when a real estate agency provides broker’s services to both buyers and sellers, since the buyer’s broker will be attempting to minimize the sale price, while the seller’s agent will try to get as much as possible for the property. Unless the law prohibits it, a single person may be in the business of representing both buyers and sellers, and it is possible that the seller will deal with a buyer who has engaged the same agent. While one might argue that such an agent would facilitate the deal, she also might fail to represent one or both sides adequately. <i>See Estate of Eller v. Bartron</i>, 31 A.3d 895 (Del. 2011). Many states have passed statutes that regulate such potential conflicts of interest, mainly by requiring disclosure that a broker is acting as a dual agent. <i>See</i> Ga. Code §§10-6A-10 and 10-6A-12(a).</p>
<p id="c5d0abe2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states now also allow a <b>designated agency</b>, in which one broker in the agency represents the seller, while another represents the buyer in the transaction. Ann Morales Olazábal, <i>Redefining Realtor Relationships and Responsibilities: The Failure of State Regulatory Responses</i>, 40 Harv. J. Legis. 65, 75-76 (2003). Some states are now experimenting with allowing brokers to act as <b>transaction brokers</b>, in which they do not represent either the seller or the buyer; instead, they act as professionals, giving independent advice on the transaction. <i>Id.</i> at 87-91. <i>See</i> Ga. Code §10-6A-3(14). If brokers are not the agent of either the seller or the buyer, they cannot be liable for breach of fiduciary duty. While this may relieve the broker of worry about possible liability, it may also remove incentives to promote the interest of one or both parties to the transaction, and for this reason every state that has adopted this idea has imposed some statutory duties on transaction brokers. Morales Olazábal,<i> supra</i>, at 90-91.</p>
<p id="c5d0abe3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Buyer’s duties to broker.</b> What happens if the buyer attempts to arrange with the seller to buy the property independent of the broker to save the cost of the broker’s commission? Ordinarily, the broker can sue the seller for breach of the listing agreement. But suppose the seller no longer has the money for some reason; can the broker sue the buyer as well? Some courts have held that “when a prospective buyer solicits a broker to find or to show him property which he might be interested in buying, and the broker finds property satisfactory to him which the owner agrees to sell at the price offered, and the buyer knows the broker will earn a commission for the sale from the owner, the law will imply a promise on the part of the buyer to complete the transaction with the owner.” <i>Ellsworth Dobbs</i>, 236 A.2d at 859. This approach has been adopted in California, <i>Donnellan v. Rocks</i>, 99 Cal. Rptr. 692 (Ct. App. 1972), but rejected in Michigan and Virginia, <i>Rich v. Emerson-Dumont Distributing Corp.</i>, 222 N.W.2d 65 (Mich. Ct. App. 1974); <i>Professional Realty Corp. v. Bender</i>, 222 S.E.2d 810 (Va. 1976).</p>
<p id="c5d0abe4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Brokers and consumer protection.</b> The primary function that brokers serve in real estate transactions is to help parties connect and reach mutually satisfactory <span title="917" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-917">p. 917</span>agreements more efficiently than the parties could on their own. Ethics concerns and consumer disputes, however, arise when brokers are dishonest or treat parties unfairly. <i>See</i> Bryan Miller, <i>The Moral: Get It in Writing</i>, N.Y. Times, Sept. 4, 2016, at RE1. State licensing agencies and departments of consumer protection offer avenues for redress when clients have grievances with real estate agents. The trade association for brokers, the National Association of Realtors (NAR), has issued a Code of Ethics, although it has been criticized as “vague and difficult to enforce.” <i>Id.</i> (quoting Richard E. Maloney, director of the Connecticut state division of trade practices).</p>
<p id="c5d0abe5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Internet, moreover, has lowered information costs in searching for properties and potential purchasers and this is increasingly challenging the intermediary role that brokers have traditionally played. As brokers and the NAR have sought to maintain their position, regulators have intervened to protect consumers. In 2005, the U.S. Justice Department sued the NAR for antitrust violations relating to an NAR policy that limited the ability of brokers to put all multiple-listing service listings on-line for their customers. In 2008, the NAR settled the complaint, agreeing not to discriminate against Internet-based brokerage companies. <i>See United States v. National Association of Realtors</i>, Final J., Civil Action No. 05 C 5140 (Nov. 18, 2008). How would you expect brokers to react to the increasing ubiquity of real estate-related search engines?</p>

<p id="c5d0abe8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a buyer finds a place that she likes and can afford, she makes an offer to buy it. The offer may be oral or in writing. The buyer may offer to pay the entire sale price set by the seller. Depending on the market, the buyer may offer some lower amount or, in so-called seller’s markets, may even offer more than the asking price. The seller may accept the offer or make a counteroffer. The buyer and seller may negotiate about other terms of the transaction as well, including when the seller would be able to move out and transfer possession, who will pay back taxes, which side has the burden of repairing any known defects, and the like.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1017D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1017D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> When the parties agree on a price and on the general terms of the transaction, they proceed to the next step in the transaction: the sales contract, often called the <b>purchase and sale agreement</b>.</p>
<p id="c5d0abea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the purchase and sale agreement, the seller agrees to convey title at a date in the future when the <b>closing</b> will take place. The buyer generally makes a deposit (sometimes called <b>earnest money</b>) that can be modest or in some markets as much as 10 percent of the purchase price; the buyer also promises to pay the rest of the purchase price at the closing. Sometimes buyers will make an initial, nominal payment when an offer is made and then a larger down payment later after inspections are done. The <span title="918" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-918">p. 918</span>date of the closing is negotiated by the parties, and, in residential transactions, is often one or two months after the purchase and sale agreement is signed. The contract then governs the mutual obligations of the parties during the executory period as well as the conditions that must be met for the transaction to close. We will consider in detail several issues related to the purchase and sale agreement later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="epub-section epub-anyhead" id="c5d0abeb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">
<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5d0d2fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">C.&nbsp;The Executory Period</p></div>
<p id="c5d0d2fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the purchase and sale agreement, the buyer’s obligations are normally made contingent on (1) the seller’s ability to convey marketable title; (2) the buyer’s ability to get adequate financing for the rest of the purchase price; and (3) inspections of the premises for structural defects, termites, and environmental hazards, such as radon and toxic waste generated by a leaking oil tank. The seller’s performance is usually conditioned only on the buyer’s paying the purchase price at the closing, but it may also be conditioned on the seller’s finding a new place to live. As a result, during the period between the execution of the agreement and closing, the parties must arrange to remove all of these <b>contingencies</b>.</p>
<p id="c5d0d2fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Inspections.</b> Buyers will arrange for the various inspections of the premises. This is generally done by hiring professionals to examine the property and provide opinions on the condition of the property. In a single-family home sale, a simple home inspection may suffice; for commercial real estate transactions, a variety of experts may be engaged for what is called <b>due diligence</b>, such as structural engineers and environmental experts, and the terms and timing of inspection rights can be important aspects of the contract.</p>
<p id="c5d0d2ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Mortgage financing.</b> Buyers will generally also attempt to get financing, usually by seeking a loan from a bank or other lending institution. The bank and the buyer will enter into a <b>loan agreement</b> that will specify how large a down payment the buyer must make, the interest to be paid on the loan, and the time period over which the loan will be repaid. The bank is also likely to insist on a <b>mortgage</b> to accompany the loan. A mortgage constitutes an agreement by the buyer that if the buyer defaults on the loan payments or other material terms of the mortgage agreement (such as maintaining insurance on the property and keeping it in good repair), the bank will be able to <b>foreclose</b> on the property by arranging for it to be sold, with the proceeds of the sale being used to satisfy the buyer’s debt to the bank.</p>
<p id="c5d0d300-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bank will be unwilling to lend the money without assuring itself that the buyer will be able to repay the loan and that the seller actually owns the property, meaning that no other property interests encumber the property (such as other mortgages) that would impair the value of the property as collateral for the loan. The bank will therefore ask the buyer for information about her credit history, job history, and current assets and salary. The bank will also make arrangements to assure itself that the seller has clear title to the house. It will do this by either (1) searching the title itself in the registry of deeds, (2) requiring the buyer to hire a lawyer to do this and provide evidence of a satisfactory result, or (3) requiring the buyer to buy <b>title insurance</b> from <span title="919" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-919">p. 919</span>an insurance company that will research the title and agree to guarantee the seller’s title in return for a fee from the buyer. We will examine title problems in greater depth later in the chapter.</p>
<p id="c5d0d301-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the buyer cannot obtain financing, the inspection reveals serious defects, the seller’s title is not marketable, or some other contingency is not met, the buyer may be excused from the deal, although in many situations, buyers and sellers seek to remedy concerns if that is possible. If all conditions are met or waived, the parties proceed to closing.</p>
<p id="c5d0d302-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Risk of loss during the executory period and equitable conversion.</b> What happens if the house burns down after the purchase and sale agreement has been signed but before the closing? Who bears the <b>risk of loss</b> — the seller or the buyer — if the contract does not answer this question? Must the buyer complete the transaction despite the loss, or may the buyer rescind and get her earnest money deposit back? Many courts hold that the risk of loss is on the buyer, under the doctrine of <b>equitable conversion</b>. If the contract gives the buyer the equitable right to have the contract specifically enforced, and many real estate contracts do, it is appropriate to treat the buyer for certain purposes <i>as if</i> the transaction had already been completed. Thus, some courts treat the buyer as the equitable owner during the executory period, despite the fact that the seller may retain the right to possess the property until the closing. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Trustees of Zion Baptist Church v. Conservators of Estate of Peay</i>, 525 S.E.2d 291 (Va. 2000); <i>see also Jackson v. Scheible</i>, 902 N.E.2d 807, 813 (Ind. 2009) (buyer liable to third parties for conditions on the property after purchase and sale agreement executed).</p>
<p id="c5d0d303-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule that treats buyers as equitable owners has been subject to much criticism. “To say that equity will specifically enforce the contract certainly does not compel one to disregard reality and view the contract as already performed.” William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §10.13 at 787 (3d ed. 2000). This allocation of the risk rarely comports with the parties’ expectations. Moreover, the seller is usually in a better position to exercise care to avoid the loss and to carry insurance on the property. For these reasons, some courts reject the doctrine and place the risk of loss during the executory period on the seller, thereby allowing the buyer to get out of the deal or reduce the amount of the price owed by the amount of the damage suffered. <i>Brush Grocery Kart, Inc. v. Sure Fine Market, Inc.</i>, 47 P.3d 680 (Colo. 2002) (“It is counterintuitive . . . that merely contracting for the sale of real property should not only relieve the vendor of his responsibility to maintain the property until execution but also impose a duty on the vendee to perform despite the intervention of a material, no-fault casualty loss preventing him from ever receiving the benefit of his bargain.”); <i>Skelly Oil Co. v. Ashmore</i>, 365 S.W.2d 582 (Mo. 1963). This is also the approach taken by the <i>Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act</i>, which has been adopted in ten states. Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra</i>, at 795.</p>
<p id="c5d0d304-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In practice, most purchase and sale agreements explicitly place the risk of loss on the vendor during the executory period and most vendors have property insurance. Even in states that force the buyer to complete the contract at the agreed-upon price, <span title="920" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-920">p. 920</span>most courts will not tolerate the seller’s getting both the purchase price and the insurance proceeds, while the buyer pays full market value and gets a burned-out property. Instead, the courts are likely to impose a constructive trust on the insurance proceeds and require that the purchase price be reduced by the amount of those proceeds so that the seller does not receive a windfall.</p>

<p id="c5d0d307-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Closings either take place in person, where the parties gather with their representatives and execute various agreements, or through <b>escrow</b>, where the parties submit executed documents to an escrow agent with instructions to complete the closing if specified conditions are met.</p>
<p id="c5d0d308-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the closing, the buyer pays the remaining amount of the purchase price above the deposit. Simultaneously, the buyer executes the loan and mortgage agreements with the lender and the lender pays the amount it has agreed to fund. The buyer or the lender, or often a title company working for one of the parties, may make a last-minute check of the records in the recording office to make sure that the state of title has not changed between the time the title search was first conducted and the time of the closing.</p>
<p id="c5d0d309-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In exchange for payment of the full purchase price, the seller delivers a <b>deed</b> to the buyer. The deed recites that the grantor (seller) conveys the property to the grantee (buyer). It describes the property and is signed by the grantor. It may contain reference to easements and covenants restricting the use of the property. The deed may also contain various <b>warranties</b> by which the seller covenants that he has good title to the property.

<p id="c5d0fa1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RESPA, 12 U.S.C. §§2601-2617, regulates closings in two primary ways. First, it requires disclosure of all settlement costs. This is intended to help the parties ensure that there are no hidden fees and that the work done in relation to closing can be matched to specific charges. Substantively, RESPA also protects real estate buyers from having to pay kickbacks or other unearned or undisclosed fees by prohibiting acceptance of fees for rendering of real estate settlement services, such as loan processing, title searches, surveys, preparation of documents, in connection with federally related mortgage loans “other than for services actually performed.” 12 U.S.C. §2607(b). In<i> Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc.</i>, 132 S. Ct. 2034 (2012), the Supreme Court considered whether RESPA applies to unearned fees that are not split with other settlement services providers. Rejecting a policy statement from the U.S. Department of Housing <span title="921" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-921">p. 921</span>and Urban Development that interpreted the statute to apply to <i>any</i> unearned fee, the Court held that RESPA only regulates settlement charges that are “divided between two or more persons.” <i>Id</i>. at 2044.</p>
<p id="c5d0fa1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attorneys involved in closing may also be subject to federal anti-money-laundering statutes. For example, parties responsible for real estate closings must report to the Internal Revenue Service any cash payments of $10,000 or more received at a closing or connected with a transaction. 26 U.S.C. §6050I. Further, Title III of the <i>USA P</i><i>atriot</i><i> Act</i>, passed shortly after September 11, 2001, amended the <i>Bank Secrecy </i><i>Act</i>, 31 U.S.C. §§5311-5355, to require every “financial institution” to develop internal anti-money-laundering programs designed to prevent the financing of terrorism. 31 U.S.C. §5318(h). The definition of “financial institution” includes reference to “persons involved in real estate closings and settlements,” 31 U.S.C. §5312(a)(2)(U). <i>See</i> 31 C.F.R. pt. 103.</p>

<p id="c5d0fa1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, the deed replaces the purchase and sale agreement at the closing and is treated as the complete contractual arrangement between the parties. This doctrine is known as <b>merger</b>. If the parties intend the promises in the purchase and sale agreement to be enforceable post-closing, the parties must normally provide explicitly that the purchase and sale agreement (or specific terms in it) will <b>survive the deed</b>. Otherwise, the buyer will be limited to remedies associated with or contained in the deed; in that case, the buyer may sue the seller for <b>breach of warranties</b> in the deed but not for breach of the purchase and sale agreement.</p>
<p id="c5d0fa20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some obligations survive the deed even though they are not explicitly carved out.

<p id="c5d1bcbe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June, 1918, one James A. Halsey, an old man, and a widower, was living, without family or housekeeper, in his house in Hornell, New York. He told the plaintiffs, [who are husband and wife,] so it is said, that if they gave up their home and business in Andover, New York, and boarded and cared for him during his life, the house and lot, with its furniture and equipment, would be theirs upon his death. They did as he asked, selling out an interest in a little draying business in Andover, and boarding and tending him till he died, about five months after their coming. Neither deed nor will, nor memorandum subscribed by the promisor, exists to authenticate the promise. <span title="928" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-928">p. 928</span>The plaintiffs asked specific performance. The defense is the statute of frauds (Real Property Law [Consol. Laws, ch. 50] §259).</p>
<p id="c5d1bcbf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think the defense must be upheld. Not every act of part performance will move a court of equity, though legal remedies are inadequate, to enforce an oral agreement affecting rights in land. There must be performance “unequivocally referable” to the agreement, performance which alone and without the aid of words of promise is unintelligible or at least extraordinary unless as an incident of ownership, assured, if not existing.</p>
<p id="c5d1bcc0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“An act which admits of explanation without reference to the alleged oral contract or a contract of the same general nature and purpose is not, in general, admitted to constitute a part performance.” <i>Woolley v. Stewart</i>, 118 N.E. 847, 848 (N.Y. 1918).</p>
<p id="c5d1bcc1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is done must itself supply the key to what is promised. It is not enough that what is promised may give significance to what is done. The housekeeper who abandons other prospects of establishment in life and renders service without pay upon the oral promise of her employer to give her a life estate in land must find her remedy in an action to recover the value of the service. Her conduct, separated from the promise, is not significant of ownership, either present or prospective. On the other hand, the buyer who not only pays the price, but possesses and improves his acre, may have relief in equity without producing a conveyance. His conduct is itself the symptom of a promise that a conveyance will be made. Laxer tests may prevail in other jurisdictions. We have been consistent here.</p>
<p id="c5d1bcc2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Promise and performance fail when these standards are applied. The plaintiffs make no pretense that during the lifetime of Mr. Halsey they occupied the land as owners or under claim of present right. They did not even have possession. The possession was his; and those whom he invited to live with him were merely his servants or his guests. He might have shown them the door, and the law would not have helped them to return. Whatever rights they had were executory and future. The tokens of their title are not, then, to be discovered in acts of possession or dominion. The tokens must be found elsewhere if discoverable at all. The plaintiffs did, indeed, while occupants of the dwelling, pay the food bills for the owner as well as for themselves, and do the work of housekeepers. One who heard of such service might infer that it would be rewarded in some way. There could be no reasonable inference that it would be rewarded at some indefinite time thereafter by a conveyance of the land. The board might be given in return for lodging. The outlay might be merely an advance to be repaid in whole or part. “Time and care” might have been bestowed “From a vague anticipation that the affection and gratitude so created would, in the long run, insure some indefinite reward.” <i>Maddison v. Alderson</i>, L.R. 8 App. Cas. [467,] 486. This was the more likely since there were ties of kinship between one of the plaintiffs and the owner. Even if there was to be a reward, not merely as of favor, but as of right, no one could infer, from knowledge of the service, without more, what its nature or extent would be. Mr. Halsey paid the taxes. He paid also for the upkeep of the land and building. At least, there is no suggestion that the plaintiffs had undertaken to relieve him of those burdens. He was the owner while he lived. Nothing that he had accepted from the plaintiffs evinces an agreement that they were to be the owners when he died.</p>
<p id="c5d1bcc3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="929" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-929">p. 929</span>We hold, then, that the acts of part performance are not solely and unequivocally referable to a contract for the sale of land. Since that is so, they do not become sufficient because part of the plaintiffs’ loss is without a remedy at law. At law the value of board and services will not be difficult of proof. The loss of the draying business in Andover does not permit us to disregard the statute, though it may go without requital. We do not ignore decisions to the contrary in other jurisdictions. They are not law for us. Inadequacy of legal remedies, without more, does not dispense with the requirement that acts, and not words, shall supply the framework of the promise. That requirement has its origin in something more than an arbitrary preference of one form over others. It is “intended to prevent a recurrence of the mischief” which the statute would suppress. <i>Maddison v. Alderson, supra</i>, L.R. 8 App. Cas. at 478. The peril of perjury and error is latent in the spoken promise. Such, at least, is the warning of the statute, the estimate of policy that finds expression in its mandate. Equity, in assuming what is in substance a dispensing power, does not treat the statute as irrelevant, nor ignore the warning altogether. It declines to act on words, though the legal remedy is imperfect, unless the words are confirmed and illuminated by deeds. A power of dispensation, departing from the letter in supposed adherence to the spirit, involves an assumption of jurisdiction easily abused, and justified only within the limits imposed by history and precedent. The power is not exercised unless the policy of the law is saved.</p>
<p id="c5d1bcc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In conclusion, we observe that this is not a case of fraud. No confidential relation has been abused. No inducement has been offered with the preconceived intention that it would later be ignored. The most that can be said against Mr. Halsey is that he made a promise which the law did not compel him to keep, and that afterwards he failed to keep it. We cannot even say of his failure that it was willful. He had made a will before the promise. Negligence or mere inertia may have postponed the making of another. The plaintiffs left the preservation of their agreement, if they had one, to the fallible memory of witnesses. The law exacts a writing.</p>

<p id="c5d1e3dd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Gladys Green owns a lot (Lot S) in the Manomet section of Plymouth. In July, 1980, she advertised it for sale. On July 11 and 12, Hickey and his wife discussed with Mrs. Green purchasing Lot S and “orally agreed to a sale” for $15,000. Mrs. Green on July 12 accepted a deposit check of $500, marked by Hickey on the back, “Deposit on Lot . . . Massasoit Ave. Manomet . . . Subject to Variance from Town of Plymouth.” Mrs. Green’s brother and agent “was under the impression that a zoning variance was needed and [had] advised Hickey to write” the quoted language on the deposit check. <span title="930" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-930">p. 930</span>It turned out, however, by July 16 that no variance would be required. Hickey had left the payee line of the deposit check blank, because of uncertainty whether Mrs. Green or her brother was to receive the check and asked “Mrs. Green to fill in the appropriate name.” Mrs. Green held the check, did not fill in the payee’s name, and neither cashed nor endorsed it. Hickey “stated to Mrs. Green that his intention was to sell his home and build on Mrs. Green’s lot.”</p>
<p id="c5d1e3de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Relying upon the arrangements with Mrs. Green,” the Hickeys advertised their house on Sachem Road in newspapers on three days in July, 1980, and agreed with a purchaser for its sale and took from him a deposit check for $500 which they deposited in their own account. On July 24, Mrs. Green told Hickey that she “no longer intended to sell her property to him” but had decided to sell to another for $16,000. Hickey told Mrs. Green that he had already sold his house and offered her $16,000 for Lot S. Mrs. Green refused this offer.</p>
<p id="c5d1e3df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hickeys filed this complaint seeking specific performance. Mrs. Green asserts that relief is barred by the Statute of Frauds contained in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, §1. The trial judge granted specific performance. Mrs. Green has appealed.</p>
<p id="c5d1e3e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present rule applicable in most jurisdictions in the United States is succinctly set forth in <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i>, §129 (1981). The section reads, “A contract for the transfer of an interest in land may be specifically enforced notwithstanding failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds if it is established that the party seeking enforcement, <i>in reasonable reliance on the contract</i> and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, <i>has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided only by specific enforcement</i>” (emphasis supplied).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104A1_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104A1_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span> The earlier Massachusetts decisions laid down somewhat strict requirements for an estoppel precluding the assertion of the Statute of Frauds. Frequently there has been an actual change of possession and improvement of the transferred property, as well as full payment of the full purchase price, or one or more of these elements.</p>
<p id="c5d1e3e4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="931" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-931">p. 931</span>It is stated in Park, <i>Real Estate Law</i>, §883, at 334, that the “more recent decisions indicate a trend on the part of the [Supreme Judicial] [C]ourt to find that the circumstances warrant specific performance.” This appears to be a correct perception.</p>
<p id="c5d1e3e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present facts reveal a simple case of a proposed purchase of a residential vacant lot, where the vendor, Mrs. Green, knew that the Hickeys were planning to sell their former home (possibly to obtain funds to pay her) and build on Lot S. The Hickeys, relying on Mrs. Green’s oral promise, moved rapidly to make their sale without obtaining any adequate memorandum of the terms of what appears to have been intended to be a quick cash sale of Lot S. So rapid was action by the Hickeys that, by July 21, less than ten days after giving their deposit to Mrs. Green, they had accepted a deposit check for the sale of their house, endorsed the check, and placed it in their bank account. Above their signatures endorsing the check was a memorandum probably sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. At the very least, the Hickeys had bound themselves in a manner in which, to avoid a transfer of their own house, they might have had to engage in expensive litigation. No attorney has been shown to have been used either in the transaction between Mrs. Green and the Hickeys or in that between the Hickeys and their purchaser.</p>
<p id="c5d20af6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no denial by Mrs. Green of the oral contract between her and the Hickeys. This, under §129 of the <i>Restatement</i>, is of some significance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104C8_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104C8_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span> There can be no doubt (a) that Mrs. Green made the promise on which the Hickeys so promptly relied, and also (b) she, nearly as promptly, but not promptly enough, repudiated it because she had a better opportunity. The stipulated facts require the conclusion that in equity Mrs. Green’s conduct cannot be condoned. This is not a case where either party is shown to have contemplated the negotiation of a purchase and sale agreement. If a written agreement had been expected, even by only one party, or would have been natural (because of the participation by lawyers or otherwise), a different situation might have existed. It is a permissible inference from the agreed facts that the rapid sale of the Hickeys’ house was both appropriate and expected. These are not circumstances where negotiations fairly can be seen as inchoate.</p>
<p id="c5d20af9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No public interest behind Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 259, §1 in the simple circumstances before us, will be violated if Mrs. Green fairly is held to her precise bargain by principles of equitable estoppel.</p></div></div>

<p id="c5d20afc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Gender roles and the construction of social reality.</b> In <i>Burns v. McCormick</i>, Justice Cardozo distinguished the acts of a “housekeeper who abandons other prospects of establishment in life and renders service without pay upon the oral promise of her employer to give her a life estate in land” from “the buyer who not only pays the price, but possesses and improves his acre.” Cardozo explained that “[h]er conduct, separated from the promise, is not significant of ownership, either present or prospective,” while “[h]is conduct is itself the symptom of a promise that a conveyance will be made.” When discussing the housekeeper, Cardozo refers to “her” conduct; but when discussing a hypothetical buyer, he refers to “his” conduct. Why does he make this shift in gender? Plaintiffs were a married couple. Is there any evidence Cardozo considered the circumstances of the husband’s conduct?</p>
<p id="c5d20afd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does Cardozo refer to the person providing personal services as a “housekeeper,” while calling the one who improves the land a “buyer”? Doesn’t the use of this language beg the question? Why is performing personal service less indicative of a contractual arrangement than payment of money? Does Cardozo assume that “housework” is normally performed by women for no compensation? Are housekeepers likely to engage in personal service in exchange for a chance of an indefinite reward, while those who work the land are unlikely to do so?</p>
<p id="c5d20afe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cardozo suggests that the housekeeper’s conduct is compatible with several explanations, while the “buyer’s” conduct is susceptible of only one. According to Cardozo’s understanding of social custom, a housekeeper might go to work for an employer, without wages, and pay for the food bills for both her employer and herself in exchange for lodging and the vague expectation of “some indefinite reward” that might be bestowed “in the long run.” No “buyer,” however, would pay a substantial sum of money and improve real property without having received a promise to convey the property to the buyer. Is it true that no other explanation might fit the set of facts, which includes (a) paying a large sum of money and (b) improving real property? Recall the cases about easements by estoppel and constructive trusts in Chapter 8.</p>

The expression of the will of the contracting parties was supposed to define the terms of the parties’ relations; the state was not to tamper with these terms but was to treat each individual as an abstract equal. At the same time, the state was expected to enforce relations that were considered to be voluntarily defined by individuals through their contracts. In this sense, the arena of the marketplace was fully legalized, and the terms dictated by the will of the parties were enforceable by the power of the state through the courts.</p>
<p id="c5d20b05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within the family, however, privatization meant delegalization. The state refused to give legal effect to any effort by the parties to define the rights, duties, and liabilities of their own marriage. Once a man and a woman were married, they could no longer enter enforceable contracts with each other. Within the family, privatization created a limited “state of nature,” in which the state refused to protect one family member from the harmful acts of any other family member. These refusals were an important part of what it meant for the family to be private and for the state not to intervene in the family relationship. It was generally not considered state intrusion, however, when the state undertook to define the marriage relation and to enforce the roles it decided each family member would fill. The notion that the family was private did not mean that the members should determine their own roles.</p>

The court held that specific performance is warranted only if the proffered services are sufficiently “rare and unusual.” The court concluded that the claimant’s work as “a nurse, chauffeur, companion, gardener, and housekeeper . . . involved no more than doing such things as a housewife often does as a part of the ordinary routine of life.” Professor Mary Joe Frug notes that the court’s dramatic devaluation of the kind of work Ms. Fitzpatrick performed for Mr. Michael ignored the social significance of the kind of work women have traditionally done, thereby indicating that “women’s” work is inferior to “men’s.” In addition to nourishing this idea about gender, however, the court’s distorted treatment of women’s work functions as an analytical shortcut in the opinion: by analogizing Ms. Fitzpatrick’s work to a “housewife’s” work, the court avoids explaining why her services for Mr. Michael were not “rare and unusual.” Mary Joe Frug, <i>Re-reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook</i>, 34 Am.

<p id="c5d23220-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Part performance.</b> The part performance doctrine allows an oral sales contract to be enforced if the buyer has substantially changed her position and taken steps to complete the transaction. <i>Kiernan v. Creech</i>, 268 P.3d 312, 317 (Alaska 2012). Justice Cardozo in <i>Burns</i> applied the traditional rule that the buyer must take steps that are “unequivocally referable” to a land sales contract. Today courts do not require this degree of certainty, instead relying on three factors that ordinarily will suggest that a contract has been made: (1) payment of all or a substantial part of the <b>purchase price</b>; (2) taking <b>possession</b> of the property; and (3) making substantial <b>improvements</b> on the land. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Sullivan v. Porter</i>, 861 A.2d 625 (Me. 2004); <i>Sharp v. Sumner</i>, 528 S.E.2d 791 (Ga. 2000). The states differ on whether all three elements are required or only one or two. Payment of part of the purchase price is generally not enough to trigger the doctrine because the buyer can be made whole by having the money returned (with interest). However, payment of the purchase price in combination with one or both of the other factors is likely to be sufficient because they ordinarily would not occur without a promise to convey. Many cases rely on a combination of payment of part of the purchase price plus the taking of possession as sufficient to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds and allow enforcement.</p>
<p id="c5d23221-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Estoppel.</b> An alternative basis for the part performance doctrine is estoppel. “[I]f one party to the transaction induces the other to make a substantial change of position to his or her detriment in good faith reliance on the first party’s actions, then the first party may be estopped from denying the transaction.” 14-81A <i>Powell on Real Property</i> §81A.02[3][e]. When the seller makes a promise on which the buyer relies substantially, it is not fair to allow the seller to claim that she did not make a promise if this would cause detriment to the buyer who reasonably relied on the promise to convey. <i>Roussalis v. Wyoming Medical Center</i>, 4 P.3d 209 (Wyo. 2000); <i>see also Harvey v. Dow</i>, 11 A.3d 303, 307 (Me. 2011) (parents’ “general promise to give [their daughter] land at some time” coupled with their “acquiescence, support, and encouragement” of their daughter’s “construction of a house on a parcel of their land,” demonstrated the parents’ “intention to make a present conveyance of that property”). The buyer who has taken substantial steps to complete the transaction by taking possession or making improvements will ordinarily suffer hardship if the contract is not enforced. The seller may also seek specific enforcement of the contract if she has changed her position in reliance on the sale occurring, such as investing the proceeds in the purchase of another property.</p>

Constructive trust.</b> A third method of avoiding the Statute of Frauds is the constructive trust doctrine, which may be applied to prevent unjust enrichment when “property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest.” <i>Davis v. Barnfield</i>, 833 So. 2d 58, 64 (Ala. Ct. App. 2002); <i>accord Rawlings v. Rawlings</i>, 240 P.3d 754 (Utah 2010).

Stat. §25:1-13. A claimant may appeal to part performance or reliance to prove the existence of the agreement by clear and convincing evidence but the statute authorizes enforcement even without part performance or reliance by the buyer as long as the evidence of the existence and terms of the agreement is sufficiently strong. <i>See Barron v.

<p id="c5d28050-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the Davises made the additional $26,000 deposit payment, Mrs. Davis noticed some buckling and peeling plaster around the corner of a window frame in the family room and stains on the ceilings in the family room and kitchen of the home. Upon inquiring, Mrs. Davis was told by Mr. Johnson that the window had had a minor problem that had long since been corrected and that the stains were wallpaper glue and the result of ceiling beams being moved. There is disagreement among the parties as to whether Mr. Johnson also told Mrs. Davis at this time that there had never been any problems with the roof or ceilings. The Davises thereafter paid the remainder of their deposit and the Johnsons vacated the home. Several days later, following a heavy rain, Mrs. Davis entered the home and discovered water “gushing” in from around the window frame, the ceiling of the family room, the light fixtures, the glass doors, and the stove in the kitchen.</p>
<p id="c5d28051-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two roofers hired by the Johnsons’ broker concluded that for under $1,000 they could “fix” certain leaks in the roof and by doing so make the roof “watertight.” Three roofers hired by the Davises found that the roof was inherently defective, that any repairs would be temporary because the roof was “slipping,” and that only a new $15,000 roof could be “watertight.”</p>
<p id="c5d28052-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Davises filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, fraud and misrepresentation, and sought rescission of the contract and return of their deposit.

<p id="c5d28053-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the district court’s conclusions under a theory of fraud and find that the Johnsons’ statements to the Davises regarding the condition of the roof constituted a fraudulent misrepresentation entitling respondents to the return of their $26,000 deposit payment. In the state of Florida, relief for a fraudulent misrepresentation may be granted only when the following elements are present: (1) a false statement concerning a material fact; (2) the representor’s knowledge that the representation is false; (3) an intention that the representation induce another to act on it; and (4) consequent injury by the party acting in reliance on the representation.</p>
<p id="c5d28054-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence adduced at trial shows that after the buyer and the seller signed the purchase and sales agreement and after receiving the $5,000 initial deposit payment the Johnsons affirmatively repeated to the Davises that there were no problems with the roof. The Johnsons subsequently received the additional $26,000 deposit payment from the Davises. The record reflects that the statement made by the Johnsons was a false representation of material fact, made with knowledge of its falsity, upon which the Davises relied to their detriment as evidenced by the $26,000 paid to the Johnsons.</p>
<p id="c5d28055-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctrine of <i>caveat emptor</i> does not exempt a seller from responsibility for the statements and representations which he makes to induce the buyer to act, when under the circumstances these amount to fraud in the legal sense. To be grounds for relief, the false representations need not have been made at the time of the signing of the purchase and sales agreement in order for the element of reliance to be present. The fact that the false statements as to the quality of the roof were made after the signing of the purchase and sales agreement does not excuse the seller from liability when the <span title="938" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-938">p. 938</span>misrepresentations were made prior to the execution of the contract by conveyance of the property. It would be contrary to all notions of fairness and justice for this Court to place its stamp of approval on an affirmative misrepresentation by a wrongdoer just because it was made after the signing of the executory contract when all of the necessary elements for actionable fraud are present. Furthermore, the Davises’ reliance on the truth of the Johnsons’ representation was justified and is supported by this Court’s decision in <i>Besett v. Basnett</i>, 389 So. 2d 995 (Fla. 1980), where we held “that a recipient may rely on the truth of a representation, even though its falsity could have been ascertained had he made an investigation, unless he knows the representation to be false or its falsity is obvious to him.”</p>
<p id="c5d28056-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether a seller of a home has a duty to disclose latent material defects to a buyer, the established tort law distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance, action and inaction must carefully be analyzed. The highly individualistic philosophy of the earlier common law consistently imposed liability upon the commission of affirmative acts of harm, but shrank from converting the courts into an institution for forcing men to help one another. This distinction is deeply rooted in our case law. Liability for nonfeasance has therefore been slow to receive recognition in the evolution of tort law.</p>
<p id="c5d28057-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In theory, the difference between misfeasance and nonfeasance, action and inaction is quite simple and obvious; however, in practice it is not always easy to draw the line and determine whether conduct is active or passive. That is, where failure to disclose a material fact is calculated to induce a false belief, the distinction between concealment and affirmative representations is tenuous. Both proceed from the same motives and are attended with the same consequences; both are violative of the principles of fair dealing and good faith; both are calculated to produce the same result; and, in fact, both essentially have the same effect.</p>
<p id="c5d28058-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still there exists in much of our case law the old tort notion that there can be no liability for nonfeasance. The courts in some jurisdictions, including Florida, hold that where the parties are dealing at arms’ length and the facts lie equally open to both parties, with equal opportunity of examination, mere nondisclosure does not constitute a fraudulent concealment. The Fourth District affirmed that rule of law in <i>Banks v. Salina</i>, 413 So. 2d 851 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982), and found that although the sellers had sold a home without disclosing the presence of a defective roof and swimming pool of which the sellers had knowledge, “[i]n Florida,” there is no duty to disclose when parties are dealing at arms length. <i>Id.</i> at 852.</p>
<p id="c5d28059-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These unappetizing cases are not in tune with the times and do not conform with current notions of justice, equity and fair dealing. One should not be able to stand behind the impervious shield of <i>caveat emptor</i> and take advantage of another’s ignorance. Our courts have taken great strides since the days when the judicial emphasis was on rigid rules and ancient precedents. Modern concepts of justice and fair dealing have given our courts the opportunity and latitude to change legal precepts in order to conform to society’s needs. Thus, the tendency of the more recent cases has been to restrict rather than extend the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor</i>. The law appears to be working toward the ultimate conclusion that full disclosure of all material facts must be made whenever elementary fair conduct demands it.</p>

<p id="c5d2805b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is now settled in California that where the seller knows of facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property which are known or accessible only to him and also knows that such facts are not known to or within the reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5d2805c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Posner v. Davis</i>, 395 N.E.2d 133 (Ill. 1979), buyers brought an action alleging that the sellers of a home fraudulently concealed certain defects in the home which included a leaking roof and basement flooding. Relying on <i>Lingsch</i>, the court concluded that the sellers knew of and failed to disclose latent material defects and thus were liable for fraudulent concealment. Numerous other jurisdictions have followed this view in formulating law involving the sale of homes.</p>
<p id="c5d2805d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of the opinion, in view of the reasoning and results in <i>Lingsch</i>, <i>Posner</i> and the aforementioned cases decided in other jurisdictions, that the same philosophy regarding the sale of homes should also be the law in the state of Florida. Accordingly, we hold that where the seller of a home knows of facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer. This duty is equally applicable to all forms of real property, new and used.</p>
<p id="c5d2a76e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bar, the evidence shows that the Johnsons knew of and failed to disclose that there had been problems with the roof of the house. Mr. Johnson admitted during his testimony that the Johnsons were aware of roof problems prior to entering into the contract of sale and receiving the $5,000 deposit payment. Thus, we agree with the district court and find that the Johnsons’ fraudulent concealment also entitles the Davises to the return of the $5,000 deposit payment plus interest.</p>

This ruling will give rise to a flood of litigation and will facilitate unjust outcomes in many cases. If, as a matter of public policy, the well settled law of this state on this question should be changed, the change should come from the legislature.</p>
<p id="c5d2a771-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Homeowners who attempt to sell their houses are typically in no better position to measure the quality, value, or desirability of their houses than are the prospective purchasers with whom such owners come into contact. Based on this and related considerations, the law of Florida has long been that a seller of real property with improvements is under no duty to disclose all material facts, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship, to a buyer who has an equal opportunity to learn all material information and is not prevented by the seller from doing so. This rule provides sufficient protection against overreaching by sellers.</p>
<p id="c5d2a772-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="940" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-940">p. 940</span>I do not agree with the Court’s belief that the distinction between nondisclosure and affirmative statement is weak or nonexistent. It is a distinction that we should take special care to emphasize and preserve. Imposition of liability for seller’s nondisclosure of the condition of improvements to real property is the first step toward making the seller a guarantor of the good condition of the property.</p>
<p id="c5d2a773-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although as described in the majority opinion this change in the law sounds progressive, high-minded, and idealistic, it is in reality completely unnecessary. Prudent purchasers inspect property, with expert advice if necessary, before they agree to buy. Prudent lenders require inspections before agreeing to provide purchase money. Initial deposits of earnest money can be made with the agreement to purchase being conditional upon the favorable results of expert inspections. It is significant that in the present case the major portion of the purchase price was to be financed by the Johnsons who were to hold a mortgage on the property. If they had been knowingly trying to get rid of what they knew to be a defectively constructed house, it is unlikely that they would have been willing to lend $200,000 with the house in question as their only security.</p></div></div>

<p id="c5d2a776-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Misrepresentation.</b> Traditionally, the courts have differentiated misrepresentation, suppression, and nondisclosure as bases for claims of fraud in real estate transactions. An outright lie or misrepresentation of facts has always constituted fraud and may give rise to liability for damages as well as a right to rescind the sale. If the misrepresentation is about a condition of the premises that is apparent to the buyer, a fraud claim may be denied on the ground that a reasonable buyer would have inspected the premises and discovered the evident defect, and thus any reliance on the seller’s statement was unreasonable. Certain statements of material fact, however, can be fraudulent even if a buyer might be able to investigate, if the seller creates a situation where a reasonable buyer would not undertake that investigation. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Bowman v. Presley</i>, 212 P.3d 1210, 1221 (Okla. 2009) (firm statement about a home’s square footage can serve as a “positive assurance upon which a purchaser may rely without being compelled independently to determine the truth or falsity of the fact represented”).</p>

<p id="c5d2ce8e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A recurring issue in misrepresentation cases is whether a statement constitutes a fact or an opinion. For example, the statement that “It’s a great house” is often characterized as an opinion, which can shield the seller from liability for fraud. In <i>Ray v. Montgomery</i>, 399 So. 2d 230 (Ala. 1980), the court held that the statement that a house “was supported by hewn pine timbers, had good support, was a nice house,’ was solid, and was in good condition” was an opinion and could not constitute fraud, even though the seller knew that the house was afflicted with termite damage. Do you agree? <i>Compare Cooper &amp; Co., Inc. <span title="941" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-941">p. 941</span>v. Lester</i>, 832 So. 2d 628, 633 (Ala. 2000) (opinion may be the basis for fraud claim if actual fraudulent intent in making such a representation is proven).</p>
<p id="c5d2ce8f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Caveat emptor</i> or obligation to disclose?</b> Courts traditionally held that sellers are under no obligation to disclose defects in the houses they are selling. Real estate sales were governed by the doctrine of <i>caveat emptor —</i> let the buyer beware. This traditional rule, which generally relieved sellers for liability arising from property defects, is still followed in some states. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Teer v. Johnston</i>, 60 So. 3d 253, 258 (Ala. 2010) (<i>caveat emptor</i> applies to sales of used real property);<i> Urman v. South Boston Savings Bank</i>, 674 N.E.2d 1078 (Mass. 1997) (no common law duty to disclose latent defects; exception if duty is imposed by statute).</p>
<p id="c5d2ce90-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of states continue to apply this rule in the context of <i>apparent defects</i>. As long as the seller does not affirmatively lie to the buyer about the condition of the premises (making a fraudulent misrepresentation), buyers are generally charged with notice of what an inspection of the premises would have revealed. <i>Puget Sound Service Corp. v. Dalarna Management Corp.</i>, 752 P.2d 1353 (Wash. Ct. App. 1988). However, some courts make exceptions to this principle if the seller acts to conceal the defect or other otherwise suppress knowledge of it by a potential buyer. <i>Osterhaus v. Toth</i>, 249 P.3d 888, 905 (Kan. 2011); <i>Kracl v. Loseke</i>, 461 N.W.2d 67 (Neb. 1990); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §550 (1977).</p>
<p id="c5d2ce91-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years, there has been a trend to require sellers and brokers of real estate to disclose information about <i>latent defects known to the seller</i> and not readily discoverable by a buyer. Violation of this <b>duty to disclose</b> constitutes fraud and will entitle the buyer to rescind the sale and/or obtain damages caused by the fraud. <i>Hess v. Chase Manhattan Bank, USA</i>, 220 S.W.2d 758 (Mo. 2007); <i>Shapiro v. Sutherland</i>, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101, 107 (Ct. App. 1998); <i>Timm v. Clement</i>, 574 N.W.2d 368 (Iowa 1997). Some states limit this disclosure obligation to defects that pose a danger to health or safety. <i>Blaylock v. Cary</i>, 709 So. 2d 1128 (Ala. 1997); <i>Conahan v. Fisher</i>, 463 N.W.2d 118 (Mich. Ct. App. 1990); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §353 (1977). Some states go further and require sellers to reveal facts of which they are aware that materially affect the value or desirability of the property. <i>Hermansen v. Tasulis</i>, 48 P.3d 235 (Utah 2002) (for brokers); <i>Assilzadeh v. California Federal Bank</i>, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 176, 182 (Ct. App. 2000).</p>

<p id="c5d2ce98-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. What information must be disclosed?</b> A claim that a defendant fraudulently failed to disclose certain information is premised on the assumption that the defendant had a duty to disclose that information to the plaintiff. This naturally raises the question of what information must be disclosed. In general, states that impose liability for nondisclosure require disclosure of nonobvious information that a reasonable buyer would want to know about and that might affect the terms of the transaction — especially the market value of the property — or induce the buyer to back out of the deal. <i>Logue v. Flanagan</i>, 584 S.E.2d 186, 190 (W. Va. 2003) (holding that “where a vendor is aware of defects or conditions which substantially affect the <span title="942" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-942">p. 942</span>value or habitability of the property and the existence of which are unknown to the purchaser and would not be disclosed by a reasonably diligent inspection, then the vendor has a duty to disclose the same to the purchaser”).</p>
<p id="c5d2ce99-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases imposing liability on sellers or brokers for fraudulent nondisclosure concern information about defective conditions that pose a risk of harm and that would not be apparent to a reasonable observer. For example, defendants have been found liable for fraudulent nondisclosure when they have failed to disclose that the building was infested by termites, <i>Obde v. Schlemeyer</i>, 353 P.2d 672 (Wash. 1960), that the home was built on collapsible soil, <i>Hess v. Canberra Development Co., LC</i>, 254 P.3d 161 (Utah 2011), and that the property was located next to a landfill contaminated with toxic waste and that federal environmental officials had written a report advising against use of the site for human habitation, <i>Strawn v. Canuso</i>, 657 A.2d 420 (N.J. 1995), <i>superseded by</i> N.J. Stat. §§46:3C-1 to 46:3C-12.</p>
<p id="c5d2f5aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Failure to disclose defective conditions may give rise to liability even when they have not been proven to be dangerous but are nonetheless material to the transaction in the sense that most buyers would want to know about them. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Roberts v. Estate of Barbagallo</i>, 531 A.2d 1125 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988) (imposing liability for fraudulent nondisclosure on both the seller and the real estate broker hired by the seller because they failed to reveal that the house was insulated with ureaformaldehyde foam insulation, a substance that had been banned in future house construction by the federal government).</p>
<p id="c5d2f5ab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other kinds of information have also been deemed relevant. For example, in <i>Reed v. King</i>, 193 Cal. Rptr. 130 (Ct. App. 1983), the seller was held liable for failing to disclose that a woman and her four children were murdered in the house ten years prior to the sale. In holding that the disclosure of murder would be relevant to most buyers, the court argued, <i>id.</i> at 133:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5d2f5ac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The murder of innocents is highly unusual in its potential for so disturbing buyers they may be unable to reside in a home where it has occurred. This fact may foreseeably deprive a buyer of the intended use of the purchase. Murder is not such a common occurrence that buyers should be charged with anticipating and discovering this disquieting possibility. Accordingly, the fact is not one for which a duty of inquiry and discovery can sensibly be imposed upon the buyer.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5d2f5ad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court argued that one way to demonstrate that a fact is material is to show that knowledge of the fact would affect the market value of the property.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5d2f5ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reputation and history can have a significant effect on the value of realty. “George Washington slept here” is worth something, however physically inconsequential that consideration may be. Ill-repute or “bad will” conversely may depress the value of property. Failure to disclose such a negative fact where it will have a foreseeably depressing effect on income expected to be generated by a business is tortious.</p>

<p id="c5d2f5af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> Compare<i> Milliken v. Jacono</i>, 60 A.3d 133 (Pa. Super.

Simpson</i>, 164 P.3d 640, <span title="943" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-943">p. 943</span>646 (Alaska 2007) (no duty to disclose that previous owner had died and partially decomposed in house).</p>
<p id="c5d2f5b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Stambovsky v. Ackley</i>, 572 N.Y.S.2d 672 (App. Div. 1991), involved a particularly unusual variation on the obligation to disclose. The seller of an old Victorian-style house in Nyack, New York, had promoted the house as being haunted, going as far as reporting in the local and national press that there were three ghosts on the premises. The seller, however, did not mention this to the out-of-town buyers, a couple from New York City. The court found that “the most meticulous inspection and the search would not reveal the presence of poltergeists at the premises or unearth the property’s ghoulish reputation in the community,” <i>id.</i> at 676, and such a reputation “goes to the very essence of the bargain between the parties, greatly impairing both the value of the property and its potential for resale.” <i>id.</i> at 674. Accordingly, the seller had a duty to disclose the reputation of the house and, as a result of her failure to do so, the buyers could rescind the contract.</p>
<p id="c5d2f5b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The house at issue in <i>Stambovsky</i> eventually sold in 1995 to new buyers, a family who knew about its haunting reputation but still found the house’s “vibe” to be “warm and inviting.” John Patrick Shultz, <i>Nyack’s Legally Haunted House</i>, At Home in Nyack Blog (Oct. 29, 2010), <i>available at http://athomeinnyack.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/nyacks-legally-haunted-house</i>/. The house has since sold multiple times, for $1,725,000 in 2012 and again in 2015 for $1,770,000, see<i> http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1-Laveta-Pl-Nyack-NY-10960/32384985_zpid</i><i>/</i>, despite the home’s well-known history.

<p id="c5d2f5b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Legislation.</b> More than half the states have passed legislation requiring sellers to disclose defects in real property to prospective buyers. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Cal. Civ. Code §§1102-1102.17; N.J. Stat. §§46:3C-1 to 46:3C-12 (<i>interpreted by Nobrega v. Edison Glen Associates</i>, 772 A.2d 368 (N.J. 2001)). However, the obligations vary widely and may not extend to commercial property. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Futura Realty v. Lone Star Building Centers (East) Inc.</i>, 578 So. 2d 363 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991). Some states allow sellers to avoid disclosure by getting the buyer to sign a contract disclaiming reliance on any information by the seller. <i>See</i> Craig W. Dallon, <i>Theories of Real Estate Broker Liability and the Effect of the “As Is” Clause</i>, 54 Fla. L. Rev. 395 (2002). Would you favor passage of disclosure legislation in your state? A number of states regulate the scope of disclosures for certain conditions, such as off-site environmental hazards. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>The New Residential Real Estate Off-Site Conditions Disclosure Act</i>, N.J. Stat. §§46:3C-1 to 46:3C-12. Why might brokers be in favor of statutes regulating disclosures?</p>
<p id="c5d2f5b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that in 1992 Congress passed the <i>Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§4851-4856, requiring sellers and landlords of housing built before 1978 to provide buyers or lessees with a “lead hazard information pamphlet” and to disclose the presence of any known lead-based paint. <i>Id.</i> §4852d. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. §§745.101-745.107.</p>

The duty to disclose and the problem of trust.</b> If contracting parties have no duty to disclose information relevant to a transaction, then they must protect themselves by undertaking an independent investigation.

<p id="c5d2f5b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, <i>Bonnco Petrol, Inc. v. Epstein</i>, 560 A.2d 655 (N.J. 1989), concerned the sale of a home to a commercial entity. After extended negotiations, the “buyer” agreed to lease the property from the owner with an option to purchase that could be exercised at a specified date. The “seller” entrusted the buyer to amend the written contract drafts to accord with their oral agreement. The buyer, however, included a term in the contract that varied from the oral agreement. The seller skimmed the documents before signing them, relying on the buyer’s claim that he amended the documents in accord with the parties’ mutual understanding. The court found that the buyer misrepresented, by his silence, that the agreement signed by the seller conformed with earlier samples. The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded: “Silence in the face of an obligation to disclose amounts to equitable fraud.” Justice Marie Garibaldi explained: “[I]t matters little that [the seller] failed to read the agreement carefully before signing. One who engages in fraud . . . may not urge that one’s victim should have been more circumspect or astute.’ We find, therefore, that equitable fraud has occurred.

The law does not temporize with trickery or duplicity, and this court, after having weighed the advantages of certainty in contractual relations against the harm and injustice which result from fraud, long ago unequivocally declared that “a party who has perpetrated a fraud upon his neighbor may [not] contract with him, in the very instrument by means of which it was perpetrated, for immunity against its consequences, close his mouth from complaining of it, and bind him never to seek redress. Public policy and morality are both ignored if such an agreement can be given effect in a court of justice. The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction would no longer be the rule, but the exception.” <i>Bridger v. Goldsmith</i>, 38 N.E. 458, 459 (N.Y. 1894). “In the realm of fact it is entirely possible for a party knowingly to agree that no representations have been made to him, while at the same time believing and relying upon representations which in fact have been made and in fact are false but for which he would not have made the agreement. To deny this possibility is to ignore the frequent instances in everyday experience where parties accept and act upon agreements containing exculpatory clauses in one form or another, but where they do so, nevertheless, in reliance upon the honesty of supposed friends, the plausible and disarming statements of salesmen, <span title="946" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-946">p. 946</span>or the customary course of business.

<p id="c5d31cd1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The guiding rule [is] that fraud vitiates every agreement which it touches. Contrary to the intimation in the court’s opinion, the nonreliance clause cannot possibly operate as an estoppel against the plaintiff. Essentially equitable in nature, the principle of estoppel is to be invoked to prevent fraud and injustice, not to further them. The statement that the representations in question were not made was, according to the complaint, false to the defendant’s knowledge. Surely, the perpetrator of a fraud cannot close the lips of his victim and deny him the right to state the facts as they actually exist.</p>

At the closing, buyer Sheryl Waggoner refused to go ahead unless seller Z.A. Mulkey promised to give her such a certificate to complete the transaction. The seller’s broker wrote into the sales contract the words: “The sale is as is condition.” After the closing, when Waggoner discovered wood beetle damage and the fact that Mulkey had hired an exterminator two years earlier, she sued Mulkey for fraud. The court rejected defendant’s argument that the “as is” clause in the contract absolutely precluded plaintiff from claiming that defendant had fraudulently induced her to sell. “[W]e are satisfied that an as is’ clause concerns itself with obvious defects or at least those which are reasonably discernible. Had Mrs. Waggoner purchased the house unseen and accepted it with a patent defect easily exposed, the arguments of Mulkey may have had more validity.” The clause could not be used to immunize the seller from liability for false oral statements upon which the buyer reasonably relied. <i>Accord</i>,<i> McClain v.

<p id="c5d343ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A purchase and sale agreement ordinarily requires the seller to be able to deliver “marketable title” at the date set for the closing and if the contract is silent, courts will often imply that obligation. The seller’s inability to provide marketable title will excuse the buyer from the deal. What kinds of defects in the title are sufficiently serious to justify allowing the buyer to rescind the contract or refuse to close? In <i>Conklin v. Davi</i>, 388 A.2d 598 (N.J. 1978), the validity of the title to a portion of the premises was based on the sellers’ claim to have acquired the property by adverse possession. The buyers argued that they were justified in repudiating the agreement in the absence of record title, which the sellers could have acquired either by seeking a deed from the record owner or by bringing suit to quiet title to the property. The court rejected this argument, holding instead that a “marketable title” was one “free from reasonable doubt, but not from every doubt.” Title based on adverse possession, the court concluded, is marketable if the adverse possession can be “clearly established.”</p>
<p id="c5d343eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main defects that make the title unmarketable are <b>encumbrances</b> and <b>chain of title defects</b>. Encumbrances are property interests in persons other than the grantor that seriously affect the value or usability of the property. These include possessory interests, such as conflicting titles and leases, and nonpossessory interests, such as easements, covenants, mortgages, and liens. Because many typical encumbrances have the potential to make title unmarketable, it is common for sales contracts to include explicit exceptions for matters in the public record, as the Standard Form Purchase and Sale Agreement reproduced above in §2 does in clause 4(e). How else does the Form Agreement address questions of encumbrances that might undermine marketable title?</p>
<p id="c5d343ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chain of title defects are mistakes or irregularities in the documents or procedures by which title has been transferred or encumbered over time. For example, a prior deed may turn out to have been forged, or the present deed may misdescribe the property.</p>
<p id="c5d343ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two other standards for title can be found in purchase and sale agreements, although contracts often combine requirements. Some contracts require title to be “insurable,” which shifts the standard to the state of title that a reputable title insurance company would be willing to insure. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>111-38 Management Corp. v. Benitez</i>, 70 <span title="948" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-948">p. 948</span>A.D.3d 911 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010) (distinguishing marketable title from insurable title). Some purchase and sale agreements, by contrast, require that title be valid “of record,” which means that not only must title be good, but also that that fact be reflected in the public records. A requirement of record validity would thus not be met by an adverse possession claim because the public record would indicate an owner other than the seller. Given the possible uncertainties of adverse possession litigation and the fact that buyers may well hesitate to buy property so acquired, should a buyer be forced to conclude the transaction?</p>

The buyer argued that her obligations under the contract were contingent on her getting financing and that since she had not obtained financing she was free to back out of the deal and recover her $13,000 deposit. The seller claimed that the agreement contained an implied good faith term under which the buyer impliedly promised to make good faith efforts to obtain financing. Since the buyer failed to do this, the seller argued that he was entitled to keep the $13,000 deposit and to recover damages from the buyer of the difference between the contract price and the lower price at which the seller could sell the property to a third party. The court held that the buyer must undertake “reasonable efforts” to obtain financing and that the buyer was not contractually justified in simply changing her mind about the house.</p>

A significant number of states, however, follow the English rule of <i>Flureau v. Thornhill</i>, 96 Eng. Rep. 638 (1776), and refuse to give the buyer expectation damages if the seller acted in good faith and believed he had good title at the time he entered the agreement; in these situations, the buyer may recover only the deposit, plus expenses. The buyer is entitled to expectation damages only if the seller did not in good faith believe he had good title, willfully or arbitrarily refused to complete the sale, or failed to perfect title when it was easy to do so. On one hand, the good faith rule has been severely criticized for treating real estate contracts differently from other types of contracts without justification. On the other hand, the different treatment has been justified by the difficulties with the recording system and the fact that reasonable sellers may be mistaken about the state of their title. Does the <i>Flureau</i> rule still make sense, given the generally high quality of public records about title in the United States?</p>

A vendee’s lien can also establish the buyer’s priority of recovery for the deposit in a foreclosure brought by other interests, such as a bank that loans money to the seller. <i>See Benz v. D.L. Evans Bank</i>, 268 P.3d 1167 (Idaho 2012). In some states, legislation has limited the circumstances in which a vendee’s lien can be established. <i>See Goebel v.

<p id="c5d39228-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deed must (1) identify the parties; (2) describe the property being conveyed; (3) state the grantor’s intent to convey the property interest in question; and (4) contain the grantor’s signature. The deed need not be recorded to transfer title; delivery of the deed to the grantee is sufficient. Most deeds are — and should be — recorded to protect the grantee’s rights. To be recorded, most states require the deed to be acknowledged by a public notary or other official and some require one or more witnesses to the transaction. Thus, although acknowledgments are not necessary to transfer title (except in a few states), they usually accompany the transfer of the deed to enable the deed to be recorded.</p>
<p id="c5d39229-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The land being conveyed must be described in the deed. <i>See Firma, Inc. v. Twillman</i>, 126 S.W.3d 790 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004) (deed invalid when it failed to describe the <span title="951" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-951">p. 951</span>property with reasonable certainty). The description must be sufficiently precise to locate the boundaries of the property. Those boundaries may be defined by reference to official surveys, plats, or by “metes and bounds.” Most of the land in the United States has been surveyed under the Government Survey System devised by Thomas Jefferson and first adopted by the Continental Congress in 1785. The system divides the land by a series of north-south and east-west lines and defines so-called townships, which are further subdivided into “sections.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109B6_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N109B6_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> These sections may be further divided into halves and quarters, or even smaller divisions. Property can be located within these quarter sections by reference to these official land parcels.</p>
<p id="c5d3922b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property may also be described by a plat or subdivision map. A <b>plat</b> is a map produced by a private developer (not a government official) that describes the lots being created in a subdivision. These lots are generally the ones that actually will be bought and sold; their borders are often not straight. Often the subdivision is given a name and divided into “Blocks,” with each Block being further subdivided into “lots.” The plat is generally approved by a local agency before being filed in the recording office. Deeds may then describe the lot being sold by reference to the plat. So, for example, a lot being conveyed might be described as Block G, Lot 1 of Gerry’s Landing Subdivision, recorded at Middletown County Registry of Deeds, Plat 46, in Plat Book 114, page 75.</p>
<p id="c5d3922c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property may also be described by <b>metes and bounds</b>. This system starts at a defined point (usually described by a natural or artificial “monument” such as a fence or a street edge) and identifies the direction and distance of the first border, then the second border, and so on, until returning to the original point. In effect, it describes how one would walk around the borders of the property. Direction is notated in degrees (and minutes and seconds) east or west of due north or south. The convention is to state north or south first and then describe the east or west deviation. So a border that runs in a northwesterly direction would be notated as “North 45 degrees West 30 feet.” Subsequent borders take a similar form until one returns to the starting place.</p>

<p id="c5d3e066-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A deed must be delivered to the grantee to effectuate a transfer of ownership. The purpose of the delivery requirement is to ensure that the grantor intends to part with the property and to clarify who owns it. When property is sold, this requirement usually raises no problems since few people will hand over such a large sum of money as the purchase price for real property without getting something in return. When, however, people give real property as a gift, ordinarily to family members, problems of delivery can occur.</p>
<p id="c5d3e067-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, a person sometimes obtains physical possession of a deed, and may even record the deed, when the owner does not intend to transfer ownership. Possession of the deed or recording it, or both, may give rise to a presumption that the grantor intended to transfer ownership of the land. Most courts hold that this presumption can be overcome by extrinsic evidence that the original owner did not intend to transfer ownership, such as oral testimony that the owner intended to transfer ownership only at her death or evidence of an installment land contract, providing that the buyer would obtain title only after all payments are made to the seller. <i>Stockwell v. Stockwell</i>, 790 N.W.2d 52 (S.D. 2010); <i>Salter v. Hamiter</i>, 887 So. 2d 230 (Ala. 2004); <i>Blancett v. Blancett</i>, 102 P.3d 640 (N.M. 2004). <i>See In re Estate of Hardy</i>, 805 So. 2d 515 (Miss. 2002) (recording deed creates presumption of delivery but no delivery was found when grantor retained deeds until her death, they were found in her purse, and there was no other evidence of intent to transfer title).</p>
<p id="c5d3e068-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, someone may make out a deed in front of a notary public granting ownership of her home to her daughter, place the deed in a safety deposit box in her bank, and tell her daughter that she has given her the property on the condition that the daughter allow her to continue living in the house until her death. What happens if the woman then dies leaving a will providing that all of her property be divided equally between her daughter and her son? The son claims a half interest in the house; her daughter claims that she owns it because her mother gave it to her before she died. Has the deed been “delivered”?</p>
<p id="c5d3e069-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts are reluctant to find delivery unless the deed has been physically handed over to the donee or to a third party who has instructions to deliver the deed. <i><span title="954" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-954">p. 954</span>Smith v. Lockridge</i>, 702 S.E.2d 858, 863 (Ga. 2010). Most courts find that “delivery” can occur even if the deed is not physically delivered to the donee under a doctrine of <b>constructive delivery</b><i>.</i> This doctrine holds that writing a deed and engaging in conduct that demonstrates intent to transfer ownership is sufficient to constitute delivery. Intent to transfer ownership is more likely to be established if the deed is physically deposited in a safety deposit box or with a third party. <i>Montgomery v. Callison</i>, 700 S.E.2d 507 (W. Va. 2010). Many courts hold that delivery of a deed to a third party, such as an attorney, with instructions to hand over the deed to the grantee at the grantor’s death constitutes delivery of a vested remainder to the grantee, with a life estate retained by the grantor. <i>In re Craddock</i>, 403 B.R. 355 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2009). Which rule strikes you as the better approach?</p>

<p id="c5d4077e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the most important elements of a real estate transaction are the seller’s ability to convey title to the property to the buyer and the buyer’s ability to rest assured that the buyer’s ownership rights will be secure against other claimants. The buyer (or the mortgage lender’s lawyer) will certainly want to search the seller’s record title. But the title search may not reveal some important defects in the chain of title. For this reason, the buyer may want additional assurances.</p>
<p id="c5d4077f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One form of additional assurance is the <b>title covenant</b> or <b>warranty of title</b> contained in the deed. Six standard covenants have developed and are explained below.</p>

Covenant of seisin.</b> This covenant is the grantor’s promise that he owns the property interest (the estate) he is purporting to convey to the grantee. Thus, an owner of a leasehold would breach this covenant if he purported to convey a fee simple. Similarly, an owner of a one-half interest as a tenant in common would breach the covenant if he purported to convey full ownership of the property as a sole fee simple owner.</p>
<p id="c5d40782-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Covenant of the right to convey.</b> This constitutes the grantor’s promise that he has the power to transfer the interest purportedly conveyed to the grantee. Although in most cases the same as the covenant of seisin, it might differ in several instances. For example, a life estate burdened by an enforceable restraint on alienation would violate this covenant if the owner purported to convey it to the grantee. Similarly, if the property were adversely possessed by someone other than the seller, the seller would have record title (seisin) of the property but not the right to convey it.</p>

</div>
<p id="c5d40788-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deeds are generally classified as general warranty, special warranty, or quitclaim. A <b>general warranty deed</b> covenants against all defects in title. A <b>special warranty deed</b> limits the covenant to defects in title caused by the grantor’s own acts but not by the acts of prior owners. It can also cover defects, such as the allowance of adverse possession, that were the result of the current owner’s failure to act. Finally, a <b>quitclaim deed</b> contains no warranty (or covenant) of title whatsoever. It purports to convey whatever interests in the property are owned by the grantor. It does not, however, promise that the grantor <i>in fact</i> owns the property interest that the grantor claims to own — or, indeed, any interest. It suffices to transfer whatever property interests the grantor has to the grantee, but does not provide the buyer with any real assurance that the grantor has the right to convey the interest the grantor purports to convey.</p>

If it turns out that the seller did not have the right to convey the property interest the deed purported to convey, the buyer can sue the seller for breach of the warranty of title. This covenant runs with the land and can be enforced by subsequent grantees as well. The damages for breach of the covenants of warranty, seisin, right to convey, and quiet enjoyment are generally measured by the <b>price</b> paid for the property that has been lost. This price is generally near the fair market value of the property <b>at the time of the closing</b>.</p>

<p id="c5d42ea3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Very few people can afford to buy property without borrowing money. Homeowners and businesses accordingly turn to lending institutions, such as banks and mortgage companies, to borrow money to finance the purchase of real estate. Traditionally, for home buyers, the lender would check out the credit history of the prospective borrower, his current employment, family assets, and other financial information to decide whether to lend money. The lender will also want information about the value of the home and how much of a down payment the borrower will be making. This is because the property will serve as <b>collateral</b> to secure repayment of the loan. In commercial real estate, this underwriting process is generally more complex, but follows the same basic structure.</p>

<p id="c5d42ea6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A real estate lender is typically called the <b>mortgagee</b><i>.</i> The buyer-homeowner is called the <b>mortgagor</b>. The mortgagor (homeowner) thus grants a mortgage to the mortgagee (lender).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5d42ea7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Borrowing money to finance a real estate purchase usually entails two separate contracts. The first is the <b>note</b>. This constitutes the borrower’s promise to repay the principal amount of the loan with interest, in the amounts and at the times specified in the note. For example, imagine that Béla Bartók borrows $270,000 to buy a $300,000 house, paying the remaining $30,000 owed to the seller of the house from his savings. Bartók would sign a note with the lender that recites the terms and conditions of the loan, for example an obligation to repay the $270,000 at 5 percent interest over 30 years. Traditionally, in a “fully amortized” loan, part of each installment payment represents interest and part represents repayment of the principal. (In the beginning, most of the payment is allocated to interest.) The note creates a personal liability in Bartók to repay the borrowed money, and the lender can sue Bartók for defaulting on Bartók’s promises contained in the note.</p>
<p id="c5d42ea8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second contract is the <b>mortgage</b>. To obtain greater security for the repayment of the note, the lender will require Bartók to execute a mortgage on the property Bartók is buying. The mortgage will contain a series of promises by Bartók, including the promise to pay off the note in accordance with its terms, to maintain insurance on the property, to pay property taxes when due, and to maintain the property so that it does not become dilapidated and <span title="957" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-957">p. 957</span>lose its market value, thereby impairing the lender’s security. The mortgage also gives the lender a security interest in the property. This means that if Bartók defaults on his loan payments or violates any other material term of the mortgage, the lender has the ability to declare the entire amount of the loan due, force the property to be sold, and use the proceeds of the sale to pay off the rest of the note. The sale may be conducted privately or under judicial supervision, depending on the rules in the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The forced sale of the property is called <b>foreclosure</b> or <b>foreclosing the mortgage</b>. We will explore a number of questions about the foreclosure process below, in §4.3, as well as how courts react to attempts by lenders to avoid the debtor protections in foreclosure altogether, in §4.4.</p>
<p id="c5d42ea9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The terms and conditions of commercial lending, such as interest rates, the period of repayment (or amortization), and the rights that go along with a lender’s security interest, can vary significantly. Financing for home purchases has been more standardized, but there is still some variation. Most home loans have traditionally been long term, often 30 years, have carried a fixed rate of interest, and require a substantial down payment by the borrower, sometimes as much as 25 percent. Richard K. Green &amp; Susan M. Wachter, <i>The American Mortgage in Historical and International Context</i>, 19 J. Econ. Persp. 93, 99-101 (2005). In the run-up to the subprime crisis, home mortgages with more exotic terms, such as interest rates that fluctuate (called <b>adjustable rate mortgages</b>), with short terms that include <b>balloon payments</b>, which are large one-time payments that substantially exceed the regular payment amount, or loans that require little or no down payment, became more common.</p>
<p id="c5d42eaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Borrowers also use their property as collateral for debt that is not used for purchasing the property. In the residential context this is generally called home equity lending, where homeowners borrow money using the value in their home above what is owed on other debt as collateral. This kind of debt can be used to pay for home renovations and similar investments, but it can also be used for expenses unrelated to the property, such as medical bills, education, or even general consumer spending.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B58_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B58_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span></p>

<p id="c5d42eb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Markets are structured by law, and they need regulation to function effectively. Real estate finance is no exception, and federal, state, and local laws shape many <span title="958" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-958">p. 958</span>aspects of mortgage markets, which we can only touch on briefly here.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B7D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B7D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> Beyond the consumer protections mortgagors have when they default on their mortgage and face foreclosure, there are two other primary ways in which the law structures mortgage markets. First, public institutions seek to expand consumer credit, particularly for those underserved by traditional lending practices. Second, the federal government and to some extent the states regulate the terms and conditions of how individual loans are provided, a process called <b>origination</b>, as well as how loans are managed by lenders or companies working for lenders, which is called <b>servicing</b> the loan. We will turn to this avenue of regulation in §4.2.B, below.</p>
<p id="c5d454c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In terms of access to credit, a number of institutions have been created, primarily at the federal level, to increase the availability, or reduce the cost, of mortgage funds. In response to the Great Depression, for example, Congress in 1932 passed the <i>Federal Home Loan Bank Act</i>, Pub. L. No. 72-304, 47 Stat. 725 (1932). The act created the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and 12 regional banks to give loans to local institutions that finance home mortgages in order to encourage them to lend money to home buyers. As a further prod to home lenders, Congress in the <i>National Housing Act of 1934</i>, Pub. L. No. 84-345, 48 Stat. 847 (1934), created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency that insures private mortgages.</p>
<p id="c5d454c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other federal institutions designed to spur home lending include the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), created in 1938, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), created in 1970. These <b>government-sponsored entities</b> (GSEs) buy mortgages from lenders and sell securities to investors backed by the expected payments from borrowers on those mortgages. This fosters a <b>secondary market</b> in mortgages, bringing investment from capital markets to lending institutions to allow those institutions to make more mortgage loans.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BA9_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BA9_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span></p>
<p id="c5d454c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975</i> (HMDA), 12 U.S.C. §§2801-2810, was passed to respond to the problem of lenders failing in many communities “to provide adequate home financing to qualified applicants on reasonable terms and conditions” <i>Id.</i> §2801(a). The statute was intended to generate “sufficient information to enable [citizens and public officials] to determine whether depository institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located.” <i>Id.</i> §2801(b). HMDA requires banks to keep records <span title="959" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-959">p. 959</span>of the loans they make and to disclose them publicly to facilitate the ability to determine whether banks are engaged in discriminatory lending patterns.</p>
<p id="c5d454c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the<i> Community Reinvestment Act of 1977</i> (CRA), 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908, encourages lending institutions to provide credit in the local communities in which they operate, especially for the “credit needs [of] low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of [the] institution.” <i>Id.</i> §2903(a)(1). There are no penalties for noncompliance but banks that do not comply with the statutory requirements may be denied the right to establish new bank branches or to engage in mergers with other institutions.</p>

<p id="c5d454c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For many years, mortgage banking was a staid profession with a conservative outlook and a regulatory environment largely set by New Deal responses to the Great Depression. But beginning in the 1980s, a new regulatory environment emerged with less government oversight, more competition among mortgage providers, and new forms of mortgages and mortgage markets. <i>See generally</i> Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, <i>The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States</i> (2011); <i>see also id.</i> at xviii (“The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self-correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves.”).</p>
<p id="c5d454ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State usury laws had traditionally regulated the interest rates that could be charged for loans financing the purchase of a home. In 1980, with interest rates at historic highs, Congress passed the <i>Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act</i>, 12 U.S.C. §1735f-7a(a)(1), that preempted state usury laws, allowing banks to charge whatever they wanted. Lending institutions soon realized they could induce people to buy homes even if interest rates were high by offering <b>adjustable rate mortgages</b> (<b>ARMs</b>) with initially low interest rate payments that increased over time. These loans appeared secure because the value of real estate was rising, borrowers hoped they could refinance before higher interest rates kicked in, and lenders could always recoup their investment by foreclosure. Over time, lenders began offering these loans to lower-income families as well as more traditional borrowers; to compensate for the added risk posed by these loans, the interest rates were very high. Some lenders decided that they could make money by giving loans to borrowers who could not pay them back when the higher interest rates kicked in. They even loaned money to people without any proof of their income or ability to pay.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BEA_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BEA_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span></p>
<p id="c5d454cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="960" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-960">p. 960</span>Lenders were willing to offer such risky loans in part because they increasingly sold the loans to other entities that took over the risk. Traditionally, lenders had often kept the mortgage and with it the risk of non-payment. The market to buy the loans increased as mortgage loans were increasingly <b>securitized</b>, which involves bundling many loans and selling shares in these bundled loans to investors. These securities were called <b>collateralized debt obligations</b> (<b>CDOs</b>) or <b>mortgage-backed securities</b> (<b>MBSs</b>) because the mortgages in the real property were collateral or security for the debts. The structure of the securities became extremely complex. A typical structure involves many different parties and multiple steps of securitization. Mortgages, which may be of different types, geographies, and origins, are pooled together into a trust, which is then divided into <b>tranches</b> that have different risk and reward characteristics. The securities were themselves often rebundled and resold, removing them still further from essential information about the mortgages that backed the securities. Each time the mortgage pool was sliced or repackaged, informational problems occurred, creating more risk.</p>
<p id="c5d454cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The market for these securities grew tremendously in the 1990s and early 2000s, both in absolute dollar terms and as a part of the national and world financial markets. In 1995, only 30 percent of mortgages were securitized, but by 2006, this number had climbed to over 80 percent. Benjamin J. Keys, Tanmoy K. Mukherjee, Amit Seru &amp; Vikrant Vig, <i>Did Securitization Lead to Lax Screening? Evidence from Subprime Loans,</i> 125 Q. J. Econ. 307, 314 (2010). Importantly, the quality of mortgages declined during this time period. Subprime mortgages grew from 9.5 percent, or $70 billion, of total mortgage originations to 23.5 percent, or $600 billion, in 2006. <i>See Financial Crisis Inquiry Report</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 70. Nevertheless, as the United States experienced prolonged growth in housing prices, the real estate sector and related financial industries generated high returns, and mortgage-backed securities, together with the real estate market, experienced a boom.</p>
<p id="c5d454ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lending institutions also bought and sold a complicated form of insurance for mortgage-backed securities called <b>credit default swaps</b>, which were unregulated and not backed by any security. Companies sold this insurance because defaults on securities backed by real estate were thought to be unlikely, even if particular borrowers defaulted on their loans, because the rising value of land would recover the debts. But because many institutions were on both sides of these transactions (both insuring and being insured) and because many institutions held risky debt, any problem in the payment schedule, combined with a decrease in the value of land, had the possibility of making the whole system unravel.</p>
<p id="c5d454cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And unravel it did, partly because borrowers were over their heads and could not afford to make the higher payments when their ARMs jumped to the new higher interest rates and partly because the housing bubble burst. As long as house prices continued to rise, borrowers could refinance their loans when they became too burdensome. When house prices and sales began to drop, the decline had a nationwide effect, eroding the security for subprime mortgages. Many borrowers now owed more on their loans than the value of the real estate securing those loans. As people began to stop making mortgage payments, foreclosures increased significantly.</p>
<p id="c5d454d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="961" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-961">p. 961</span>A “death spiral” was in place: “Falling prices meant that firms using debt securities as collateral had to mark them to market and put up cash, requiring the sale of more securities, which caused market prices to plummet further downward.” Steven L. Schwarcz, <i>Understanding the Subprime Financial Crisis</i>, 60 S.C. L. Rev. 549, 553 (2009). The impact was dramatic. In the face of huge losses on the securities, and with bankruptcies of important institutions across several markets, fear began to seize lenders and investors. Banks, which had already taken huge losses from their holdings in the mortgage sector, were unable to secure funding from capital providers. Some major companies, notably Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt, and many others were reorganized, sold, or taken over by the federal government. Credit markets froze and the subprime crisis spread from mortgage-backed securities to the entire global economy. <i>See</i> Kathleen C. Engel &amp; Patricia A. McCoy, <i>The Subprime Virus: Reckless Credit, Regulatory Failure, and Next Steps</i> (2011).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C2F_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C2F_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span></p>

Between January, 2004, and March, 2007, Fremont originated 14,578 loans to Massachusetts residents secured by mortgages on owner-occupied homes. Of the loans originated during that time period, roughly 3,000 remain active and roughly 2,500 <span title="962" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-962">p. 962</span>continue to be owned or serviced by Fremont. An estimated fifty to sixty per cent of Fremont’s loans in Massachusetts were subprime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C78_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C78_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span> Because subprime borrowers present a greater risk to the lender, the interest rate charged for a subprime loan is typically higher than the rate charged for conventional or prime mortgages. After funding the loan, Fremont generally sold it on the secondary market, which largely insulated Fremont from losses arising from borrower default.</p>
<p id="c5d47bea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In originating loans, Fremont did not interact directly with the borrowers; rather, mortgage brokers acting as independent contractors would help a borrower select a mortgage product, and communicate with a Fremont account executive to request a selected product and provide the borrower’s loan application and credit report. If approved by Fremont’s underwriting department, the loan would proceed to closing and the broker would receive a broker’s fee.</p>
<p id="c5d47beb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont’s subprime loan products offered a number of different features to cater to borrowers with low income. A large majority of Fremont’s subprime loans were adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which bore a fixed interest rate for the first two or three years, and then adjusted every six months to a considerably higher variable rate for the remaining period of what was generally a thirty-year loan.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C86_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C86_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span> Thus, borrowers’ monthly mortgage payments would start out lower and then increase substantially after the introductory two-year or three-year period. To determine loan qualification, Fremont generally required that borrowers have a debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to fifty per cent — that is, that the borrowers’ monthly debt obligations, including the applied-for mortgage, not exceed one-half their income. However, in calculating the debt-to-income ratio, Fremont considered only the monthly payment required for the introductory rate period of the mortgage loan, not the payment that would ultimately be required at the substantially higher “fully indexed” interest rate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C8C_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C8C_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">15</a></span> As an additional feature to attract subprime borrowers, who typically had little or no savings, Fremont offered loans with no down payment. Instead of a down payment, Fremont would finance the full value of the property, resulting in a “loan-to-value ratio” approaching one hundred per cent. Most such financing was accomplished through the provision of a first mortgage providing eighty per cent financing and an additional “piggy-back loan” providing twenty per cent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C92_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10C92_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span></p>

An analysis by the Attorney General of ninety-eight of those loans indicated that all were ARM loans with a substantial increase in payments required after the first two (or in a few cases, three) years, and that ninety per cent of the ninety-eight had a one hundred per cent loan-to-value ratio.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 7, 2007, Fremont executed a “stipulation and consent to the issuance of an order to cease and desist” (consent agreement) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), settling charges of unsound banking practices brought by that agency. The consent agreement ordered Fremont, <i>inter alia,</i> to cease and desist from originating ARM products to subprime borrowers in ways described as unsafe and unsound, including making loans with low introductory rates without considering borrowers’ ability to pay the debt at the fully indexed rate, and with loan-to-value ratios approaching one hundred per cent. In entering into the consent agreement, Fremont did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On or about July 10, 2007, Fremont entered into a term sheet letter agreement (term sheet agreement) with the Massachusetts Attorney General, agreeing to give the Attorney General ninety days’ notice before foreclosing on any Massachusetts residential mortgage loan. If the Attorney General objected, Fremont agreed to negotiate in good faith to resolve the objection, possibly by modifying the loan agreement. If no resolution could be reached, the Attorney General was granted an additional fifteen days in which to determine whether to seek an injunction.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As it turned out, the Attorney General objected to every proposed foreclosure that Fremont identified except those where the home was not owner-occupied and Fremont had been unable to contact the borrower. On October 4, 2007, the Attorney General filed this action.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge granted a preliminary injunction in a memorandum of decision dated February 25, 2008. In his decision, the judge found no evidence in the preliminary injunction record that Fremont encouraged or condoned misrepresentation of borrowers’ incomes on stated income loans, or that Fremont deceived borrowers by concealing or misrepresenting the terms of its loans. However, the judge determined that the Attorney General was likely to prevail on the claim that Fremont’s loans featuring a combination of the following four characteristics qualified as “unfair” under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §2: (1) the loans were ARM loans with an introductory rate period of three years or less; (2) they featured an introductory rate for the initial period that was at least three per cent below the fully indexed rate; (3) they were made to borrowers for whom the debt-to-income ratio would have exceeded fifty per cent had Fremont measured the borrower’s debt by the monthly payments that would be due at the fully indexed rate rather than under the introductory rate; and (4) the loan-to-value ratio was one hundred per cent, or the loan featured a substantial prepayment penalty (defined by the judge as greater than the “conventional prepayment penalty” defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183C, §2) or a prepayment penalty that extended beyond the introductory rate period.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge reasoned that Fremont as a lender should have recognized that loans with the first three characteristics just described were “doomed to foreclosure” unless <span title="964" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-964">p. 964</span>the borrower could refinance the loan at or near the end of the introductory rate period, and obtain in the process a new and low introductory rate.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CB5_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CB5_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span> The fourth factor, however, would make it essentially impossible for subprime borrowers to refinance unless housing prices increased, because if housing prices remained steady or declined, a borrower with a mortgage loan having a loan-to-value ratio of one hundred per cent or a substantial prepayment penalty was not likely to have the necessary equity or financial capacity to obtain a new loan. The judge stated that, “[g]iven the fluctuations in the housing market and the inherent uncertainties as to how that market will fluctuate over time . . . it is unfair for a lender to issue a home mortgage loan secured by the borrower’s principal dwelling that the lender reasonably expects will fall into default once the introductory period ends unless the fair market value of the home has increased at the close of the introductory period. To issue a home mortgage loan whose success relies on the hope that the fair market value of the home will increase during the introductory period is as unfair as issuing a home mortgage loan whose success depends on the hope that the borrower’s income will increase during that same period.”</p>
<p id="c5d47bf6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge concluded that the balance of harms favored granting the preliminary injunction, and that the public interest would be served by doing so. The injunction he granted requires Fremont to do the following: (1) to give advance notice to the Attorney General of its intent to foreclose on any of its home mortgage loans; and (2) as to loans that possess each of the four characteristics of unfair loans just described and that are secured by the borrower’s principal dwelling (referred to in the injunction as “presumptively unfair” loans), to work with the Attorney General to “resolve” their differences regarding foreclosure — presumably through a restructure or workout of the loan. If the loan cannot be worked out, Fremont is required to obtain approval for foreclosure from the court. The judge made clear that the injunction in no way relieved borrowers of their obligation ultimately to prove that a particular loan was unfair and foreclosure should not be permitted, or their obligation to repay the loans they had received.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Discussion</i></p>
<p id="c5d47bf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont argues that the judge committed two “fundamental” errors of law in concluding that the Attorney General was likely to prevail on the merits of her ch. 93A claim: first, the judge in effect, and improperly, applied the provisions of the Massachusetts <i>Predatory Home Loan Practices Act</i>, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183C, to Fremont’s loans, even though the loans are not subject to ch. 183C; and second, the judge failed to recognize that under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §3, Fremont’s loans are exempt from ch. 93A because all of Fremont’s challenged loan terms were permitted under the Federal and Massachusetts laws and regulatory standards governing mortgage lenders. <span title="965" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-965">p. 965</span>Fremont also contends that the judge erred in determining that the public interest would be served by the preliminary injunction order. We address these arguments separately below. Before doing so, we consider a basic claim that lies underneath all of Fremont’s legal challenges to the injunction.</p>
<p id="c5d47bf9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Retroactive Application of Unfairness Standards</i></p>
<p id="c5d47bfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont’s basic contention is that, while the terms of its subprime loans may arguably seem “unfair” within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §2, if judged by current standards applicable to the mortgage lending industry, they did not violate any established concept of unfairness at the time they were originated; the judge, in Fremont’s view, applied new rules or standards for defining what is “unfair” in a retroactive or ex post facto fashion — a result that is not in accord with the proper interpretation of ch. 93A, §2, and also represents “bad policy,” because (among other reasons) lenders cannot know what rules govern their conduct, which will reduce their willingness to extend credit, hurting Massachusetts consumers. We do not agree that the judge applied a new standard retroactively.</p>
<p id="c5d47bfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">General Laws ch. 93A, §2 (a), makes unlawful any “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.” Chapter 93A creates new substantive rights, and in particular cases, “mak[es] conduct unlawful which was not unlawful under the common law or any prior statute.” <i>Kattar v. Demoulas</i>, 739 N.E.2d 246, 257 (Mass. 2000). The statute does not define unfairness, recognizing that “[t]here is no limit to human inventiveness in this field.” <i>Id.</i> at 257. What is significant is the particular circumstances and context in which the term is applied. It is well established that a practice may be deemed unfair if it is “within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness.” <i>PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co.</i>, 321 N.E.2d 915, 918 (Mass. 1975).</p>
<p id="c5d4a30c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fremont highlights the judge’s statement that at the time Fremont made the loans in question between 2004 and March of 2007, loans with the four characteristics the judge identified as unfair were not considered by the industry or more generally to be unfair; Fremont argues this acknowledgment by the judge is proof that the judge was creating a new definition or standard of unfairness. The argument lacks merit. First, the judge’s statement that Fremont’s combination of loan features were not recognized to be unfair does not mean the converse: that the loans were recognized to be fair. More to the point, at the core of the judge’s decision is a determination that when Fremont chose to combine in a subprime loan the four characteristics the judge identified, Fremont knew or should have known that they would operate in concert essentially to guarantee that the borrower would be unable to pay and default would follow unless residential real estate values continued to rise indefinitely — an assumption that, in the judge’s view, logic and experience had already shown as of January, 2004, to be unreasonable. The judge concluded that the Attorney General was likely to prove that Fremont’s actions, in originating loans with terms that in combination would lead predictably to the consequence of the borrowers’ default and foreclosure, were within established concepts of unfairness at the time the loans were made, and thus in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §2. The record supports this conclusion.</p>

Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation Massachusetts Division of Banks, <i>Subprime Lending</i> (Dec. 10, 1997). More particularly, the principle had been clearly stated before 2004 that loans made to borrowers on terms that showed they would be unable to pay and therefore were likely to lead to default, were unsafe and unsound, and probably unfair. Thus, an interagency Federal guidance published January 31, 2001, jointly by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, stated: “Loans to borrowers who do not demonstrate the capacity to repay the loan, <i>as structured</i>, from sources other than the collateral pledged are generally considered unsafe and unsound” (emphasis supplied).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CFA_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CFA_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span> <i>Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs</i> at 11 (Jan. 31, 2001). On February 21, 2003, one year before the first of Fremont’s loans at issue, the OCC warned that certain loans could be unfair to consumers:</p>

<p id="c5d4a310-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a loan has been made based on the foreclosure value of the collateral, rather than on a determination that the borrower has the capacity to make the scheduled payments under the terms of the loan, based on the borrower’s current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other relevant financial resources, the lender is effectively counting on its ability to seize the borrower’s equity in the collateral to satisfy the obligation and to recover the typically high fees associated with such credit. Not surprisingly, such credits experience foreclosure rates higher than the norm.</p>

<p id="c5d4a313-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record here suggests that Fremont made no effort to determine whether borrowers could “make the scheduled payments under the terms of the loan.” Rather, as the judge determined, loans were made in the understanding that they would have to be refinanced before the end of the introductory period. Fremont suggested in oral argument that the loans were underwritten in the expectation, reasonable at the time, that housing prices would improve during the introductory loan term, and thus could be refinanced before the higher payments began. However, it was unreasonable, and unfair to the borrower, for Fremont to structure its loans on such unsupportable optimism. As a bank and mortgage lender, Fremont had been warned repeatedly before 2004 (in the context of guidance on loan safety and soundness) that it needed to consider the performance of its loans in declining markets. See, e.g., <i>Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, Massachusetts Division of Banks, Subprime Lending</i> (Dec. 10, 1997) (“[M]ost subprime loans have been originated during robust economic conditions and have not been tested by a downturn in the economy. Management must ensure that the institution has adequate financial and operational strength to address these concerns effectively”). Fremont cannot now claim that it was taken by surprise by the effects of an economic decline, or that it should not be held responsible.</p>
<p id="c5d4a314-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the conclusion that Fremont’s loans featuring the four characteristics at issue violated established concepts of unfairness is supported by the consent agreement that Fremont entered into with the FDIC on March 7, 2007, the date Fremont stopped making loans. The consent agreement contains no admission of wrongdoing by Fremont, and we do not consider it as evidence of liability on Fremont’s part. However, we view it as evidence of existing policy and guidance provided to the mortgage lending industry. The fact that the FDIC ordered Fremont to cease and desist from the use of almost precisely the loan features that are included in the judge’s list of presumptively unfair characteristics indicates that the FDIC considered that under established mortgage lending standards, the marketing of loans with these features constituted unsafe and unsound banking practice with clearly harmful consequences for borrowers. Such unsafe and unsound conduct on the part of a lender, insofar as it leads directly to injury for consumers, qualifies as “unfair” under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §2.</p>

A defendant’s burden in claiming the exemption is “a difficult one to meet.

<p id="c5d4a31a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge concluded, as have we, that the Attorney General is likely to succeed on her claim that Fremont’s practice of originating loans bearing the particular combination of four features identified in the preliminary injunction was unfair. To carry its burden under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §3, of demonstrating that a regulatory scheme “affirmatively <i>permits</i> the practice which is alleged to be unfair,” Fremont must show that some regulatory scheme affirmatively permitted the practice of combining all of those features. Fremont has not done so. Rather, it cites authority demonstrating, it asserts, that each of the four features was permitted by statute and regulatory authorities. Assuming, without deciding, that Fremont is correct that every feature was affirmatively permitted separately, it was Fremont’s choice to combine them into a package that it should have known was “doomed to foreclosure”; the relevant question is whether some State or Federal authority permitted that combination. No authority did.</p>

Regulating mortgage terms.</b> <i>Fremont</i> addressed the substantive standards that should govern home lending. Several states have passed legislation regulating the terms and conditions of subprime mortgages, attempting to prevent the kinds of abusive practices that <i>Fremont</i> addressed. Among the strongest in the nation is the Minnesota statute, passed in 2007. It prohibits (1) making a residential loan to someone without regard to the borrower’s ability to pay; (2) refinancing mortgages when no economic benefit accrues to the borrowing; and (3) certain prepayment penalties. <i>See</i> Minn. Stat. §§58.13(1)(a)(24) to (26), 58.137, 609.822. <i>Similar legislation has passed in</i> Colorado (Colo. Rev. Stat. §38-40-105); Illinois (205 Ill. Comp. Stat. 635/5-6); Maryland (Md.

The <i>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</i>, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (<i>Dodd-Frank Act</i>), which was passed in response to the subprime mortgage crisis, for the first time sets national standards <span title="969" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-969">p. 969</span>to address this issue. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1639c(a)(1) (“[N]o creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance . . . and assessments.”). Lenders are now required to evaluate this ability to repay through documentation about the borrower and, for adjustable rate mortgages, lenders must evaluate ability to repay based on the required payments over the life of the loan, not just an introductory “teaser” rate. 15 U.S.C. §1639c(a)(3). <i>See generally</i> Adam Leitman Bailey &amp; John M. Desiderio, <i>A Lender’s Duty to Investigate Its Borrower</i>, 29 Prob. &amp; Prop. (Mar.-Apr. 2015) (surveying federal and state regulations on borrower ability to repay). </p>
<p id="c5d4a31f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> established a presumption that certain “qualified mortgages” comply with this provision, 15 U.S.C. §1639c(b), and a new agency that the statute created, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), has issued regulations that spell out what constitutes a qualified mortgage. <i>See Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z)</i>, 78 Fed. Reg. 6407 (Jan. 30, 2013) (to be codified at 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026). The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> also established specific prerequisites and underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, and these standards have also been elaborated by regulation. The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> generally excludes loans that are <b>negative amortizing</b>, which means that the balance increases despite regular payments; loans that require payments of interest but not principal; loans that have balloon payments; or that have terms that exceed 30 years. The act and its implementing regulations also exclude loans where lenders fail to verify the assets or income of the borrower, and loans that require borrowers to pay certain fees and “points,” which are up-front payments to reduce the interest rate of a loan.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A 1994 amendment to TILA called the <i>Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act</i> (HOEPA) regulated the terms and conditions of certain loans that have particularly high interest rates or high fees, primarily loans used for refinancing or home-equity loans. Home-equity loans are loans that are not used to purchase homes but instead use a home as collateral to finance borrowing for other purposes, such as home renovation. The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> significantly expanded HOEPA’s reach, applying it to almost all “high-cost” mortgages. 15 U.S.C. §1602. The law allows borrowers to get out of the deal within three business days of receiving a notice of their rights. It also bans certain loan terms, such as balloon payments, negative amortization, and most prepayment penalties. The law also prohibits lending to a person who is not financially able to pay back the loan and requires pre-loan consumer counseling for high-cost mortgages. <i>See High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X)</i>, 12 C.F.R. pts. 1024 and 1026.</p>

Lenders must provide such disclosures at two stages of the transaction: first when consumers apply for financing, so that they can better shop for loans, and then again when it comes time to close the loan, in order to ensure that the promised terms were actually provided. </p>

Regulating loan servicing.</b> Another area of regulation that has taken on new urgency in the wake of the subprime crisis involves what are called <b>loan servicers</b>, which are companies that lenders hire to collect mortgage payments, pay real estate taxes on behalf of borrowers, and manage other aspects of “servicing” loans. In the wake of the subprime crisis, the role of loan servicers has garnered increasing scrutiny, given their control over the borrower-lender relationship in many instances, and a number of problems that consumers have faced with servicers. <i>See</i> Peter Swire, <i>What the Fair Credit Reporting Act Should Teach Us About Mortgage Servicing</i>, Center for American Progress (Jan. 2011). The CFPB recently issued regulations under RESPA and TILA to set national standards to govern loan servicers. The rules cover a number of topics, but most significantly require periodic billing statements and statements when borrowers pay off their loans, mandate notice before an adjustable rate mortgage first changes its interest rate, and limit the servicer’s ability to charge for insurance on behalf of a borrower. The new rules, recognizing the central role that servicers play not just in managing loans but also in the process of foreclosure, require early intervention when a borrower is having difficulty repaying her loan and continuity of contact with delinquent borrowers. The regulations also set forward specific steps that servicers must take to mitigate losses for home loans, in order to keep borrowers in their homes if possible. <i>See Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X)</i> and <i>Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z)</i>, 12 C.F.R. pt. 1024; 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026.</p>

Structural responses to the subprime crisis.</b> The subprime crisis led to significant government intervention to save the banks and to help the millions of homeowners facing foreclosure. These foreclosures would affect not only the families losing their homes but neighbors as well. A neighborhood dotted with foreclosed homes lowers the property values of those who remain, and in a recession, it is difficult to find buyers for those homes. <i>See</i> Kristopher S. Gerardi et al., <i>Foreclosure Externalities: New <span title="971" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-971">p. 971</span>Evidence</i>, NBER Working Paper No. 18353 (2012). Owners are also reluctant to sell at the low market values because they will suffer big losses in their wealth.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca35-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the years after the subprime crisis hit, the federal government created a series of programs to facilitate refinancing for borrowers who owe more on their property than the property is worth or are otherwise at risk for default, see Peter W. Salsich, Jr., <i>Homeownership-Dream or Disaster?</i>, 21 J. Affordable Hous. &amp; Community Dev. L. 17, 40-50 (2012), but these programs have been faulted for not more directly restructuring at-risk mortgages. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Dan Immergluck, <i>Too Little, Too Late, and Too Timid: The Federal Response to the Foreclosure Crisis at the Five-Year Mark</i>, 23 Housing Policy Debate 199, 216 (2013).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DFE_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DFE_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">20</a></span> The federal government, as well as state and local governments, also worked to mitigate the neighborhood-level consequences of the increase in, and concentration of, foreclosures. <i>Id.</i> at 218-222 (describing efforts such as the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program). The other main area of regulatory response to the subprime crisis has occurred mostly at the state level, where the process of foreclosure itself has seen significant changes, both judicial and statutory.

<p id="c5d4ca39-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a mortgagor defaults on her loan, she has the right to prevent loss of her property by paying off the debt before foreclosure; indeed, some states allow the mortgagor to prevent foreclosure by paying the arrears only. This debtor protection is called the <b>equity of redemption</b>, a name that alludes to the origin of mortgages in the courts of equity in England — and is why people often refer to the value an owner has in her property as “equity.” Originally, the owner-borrower would convey title to the property to the lender with a condition subsequent, allowing the borrower to pay off the debt on a certain day and thereby get the deed back. If the borrower did not pay off the debt on the appointed day, she would lose the property forever. Since the land was usually worth more than the debt, the lender would often get a windfall.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca3a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Borrowers began to ask the equity courts for relief from this result, and the chancellor responded by granting the borrower extra time to pay off the debt, thereby redeeming the property (getting it back). In so doing, the court effectively rewrote the contract, changing the terms of the condition. At first, this was subject to the equity court’s discretion, but by the seventeenth century it was a matter of right. The borrower’s interest came to be called the equity of redemption, while the mortgagee held <span title="972" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-972">p. 972</span>title.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E23_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E23_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">21</a></span> <i>See</i> Ann M. Burkhart, <i>Lenders and Land</i>, 64 Mo. L. Rev. 249 (1999) (excellent overview of history of mortgage law and regulation).</p>
<p id="c5d4ca3c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Allowing the borrower some extra time to get the property back by paying off the debt protected the mortgagor’s interest but left the mortgagee without any clear remedy. For this reason, the equity courts put a time limit on the mortgagor’s right to redeem. The equity courts began a procedure to allow the lender to cut off, or <b>foreclose</b>, the equity of redemption. At first, courts used a procedure called <b>strict foreclosure</b>, which would give the borrower extra time to pay off the debt but provide that if the debt remained unpaid by a particular date, title would vest in the mortgagee without a sale. Because of perceived unfairness of strict foreclosure, this procedure has been substantially abolished in the United States and is available in only a couple of states where it is subject to judicial discretion. <i>See</i> Conn. Gen. Stat. §§49-15, 49-24; Vt. Stat. tit. 12, §4528.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca3d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today most foreclosures involve a sale of the mortgaged property, either through a judicial proceeding or by a private sale, depending on the contractual arrangements between the parties and state law. In a <b>judicial sale</b>, the mortgagee will bring a foreclosure action in which they must prove the existence of the mortgage, the right to foreclose, and the mortgagor’s default. If the mortgagee meets these burdens, and the borrower has no other defenses, the court will issue a foreclosure decree. The decree provides for public sale of the property by a court officer, payment of the proceeds to the mortgagee and any other creditors with liens on the property, and transfer of any surplus funds to the mortgagor.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca3e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several states allow the mortgagor to waive the protection of a judicial sale by granting the mortgagee a <b>power of sale</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E59_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E59_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">22</a></span> If so, the mortgagee can conduct the public sale itself or through a public official such as a sheriff, after notice to all interested parties, without the need for judicial proceedings. A similar arrangement is the <b>deed of trust</b>, which is prevalent in some states. Under this arrangement, the borrower or <b>trustor</b> conveys title to a third party (called the <b>trustee</b>) as security for the trustor’s payment of its debt obligation to the lender (called the <b>beneficiary</b>). If the trustor defaults, the trustee can arrange a public nonjudicial sale of the property to satisfy the debt. In practice, unlike in an ordinary trust, the borrower who grants a deed of trust to <span title="973" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-973">p. 973</span>secure real estate generally continues to act as the true owner, and the trustee’s functions come into play if that owner defaults.</p>
<p id="c5d4ca40-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have enacted a <b>statutory right of redemption</b>, which allows the mortgagor to buy back the property for the price bid at the foreclosure sale for a designated period (typically six months to a year) <b>after foreclosure</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E7A_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E7A_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">23</a></span> These statutes generally allow the mortgagor to remain in possession of the property in the meanwhile. The statutory right of redemption is meant to encourage market prices at the foreclosure sale on the theory that if bids are below fair market price, the mortgagor has time go to borrow the money to buy back the property for the (artificially low) price paid at the foreclosure sale. However, the ability of the mortgagor to redeem the property after foreclosure may actually decrease the market value of the property at the time of the foreclosure sale since the buyer cannot possess the property immediately and, in fact, has no assurance it will ever be able to possess the property.</p>
<p id="c5d4f152-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon a foreclosure sale, the mortgagor’s equity of redemption is cut off. If the sale does not bring in enough proceeds to pay off the debt, many states allow the lender to bring an action for a <b>deficiency judgment</b> personally against the mortgagor for the rest of the debt. Some states, however, prohibit deficiency judgments or require lenders to bring any deficiency action at the same time as they bring a foreclosure action. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Coker v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.</i>, 364 P.3d 176 (Cal. 2016) (applying Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §580b).</p>
<p id="c5d4f153-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the wake of the subprime crisis, many aspects of foreclosure practice that had once been fairly routine have become complicated by the realities of securitization. Consider the following case.</p>

<p id="c5d4f159-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 1, 2005, Antonio Ibanez took out a $103,500 loan for the purchase of property at 20 Crosby Street in Springfield, secured by a mortgage to the lender, Rose Mortgage, Inc. (Rose Mortgage). The mortgage was recorded the following day. Several days later, Rose Mortgage executed an assignment of this mortgage in blank, that is, an assignment that did not specify the name of the assignee. The blank space in the assignment was at some point stamped with the name of Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One) as the assignee, and that assignment was recorded on June 7, 2006. Before the recording, on January 23, 2006, Option One executed an assignment of the Ibanez mortgage in blank.</p>
<p id="c5d4f15a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to U.S. Bank, Option One assigned the Ibanez mortgage to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which assigned it to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which then assigned it to the Structured Asset Securities Corporation, which then assigned the <span title="974" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-974">p. 974</span>mortgage, pooled with approximately 1,220 other mortgage loans, to U.S. Bank, as trustee for the Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-Z. With this last assignment, the Ibanez and other loans were pooled into a trust and converted into mortgage-backed securities that can be bought and sold by investors — a process known as securitization.</p>
<p id="c5d4f15b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to U.S. Bank, the assignment of the Ibanez mortgage to U.S. Bank occurred pursuant to a December 1, 2006, trust agreement, which is not in the record. What is in the record is the private placement memorandum (PPM), dated December 26, 2006, a 273-page, unsigned offer of mortgage-backed securities to potential investors. The PPM describes the mortgage pools and the entities involved, and summarizes the provisions of the trust agreement, including the representation that mortgages “will be” assigned into the trust. According to the PPM, “[e]ach transfer of a Mortgage Loan from the Seller [Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] to the Depositor [Structured Asset Securities Corporation] and from the Depositor to the Trustee [U.S. Bank] will be intended to be a sale of that Mortgage Loan and will be reflected as such in the Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust Agreement, respectively.” The PPM also specifies that “[e]ach Mortgage Loan will be identified in a schedule appearing as an exhibit to the Trust Agreement.” However, U.S. Bank did not provide the [lower court] judge with any mortgage schedule identifying the Ibanez loan as among the mortgages that were assigned in the trust agreement.</p>
<p id="c5d4f15c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June, 2007, U.S. Bank caused to be published in the Boston Globe the notice of the foreclosure sale required by Mass. Gen. Laws c. 244, §14. The notice identified U.S. Bank as the “present holder” of the mortgage. At the foreclosure sale on July 5, 2007, the Ibanez property was purchased by U.S. Bank, as trustee for the securitization trust, for $94,350, a value significantly less than the outstanding debt and the estimated market value of the property. The foreclosure deed (from U.S. Bank, trustee, as the purported holder of the mortgage, to U.S. Bank, trustee, as the purchaser) and the statutory foreclosure affidavit were recorded on May 23, 2008. On September 2, 2008, more than one year after the sale, and more than five months after recording of the sale, American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc., “as successor-in-interest” to Option One, which was until then the record holder of the Ibanez mortgage, executed a written assignment of that mortgage to U.S. Bank, as trustee for the securitization trust. This assignment was recorded on September 11, 2008.</p>
<p id="c5d4f15d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A similar sequence occurred with respect to a mortgage that Mark and Tammy LaRace gave on May 19, 2005 to Option One as security for a $103,200 loan; Option One assigned the LaRace mortgage to Bank of America, who then assigned it to the Asset Backed Funding Corporation (ABFC). ABFC pooled the mortgage with others and assigned it to Wells Fargo, as trustee for the ABFC 2005-OPT 1 Trust, ABFC Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2005-OPT 1, pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement. In June 2007, Wells Fargo, as trustee, published a statutory notice of sale in the <i>Boston Globe</i>, identifying itself as the “present holder” of the mortgage. At the subsequent foreclosure sale, Wells Fargo, as trustee, purchased the LaRace property for $120,397.03, significantly below its estimated market value.]</p>

Gen. Laws ch. 240, §6, seeking declarations that the defendant mortgagors’ titles had been extinguished and that the plaintiffs were the fee simple owners of the foreclosed properties. As such, the plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing their entitlement to the relief sought. To meet this burden, they were required “not merely to demonstrate better title . . . than the defendants possess, but . . . to prove sufficient title to succeed in [the] action.” [<i>Sheriff’s Meadow Foundation, Inc. v. Bay-Courte Edgartown, Inc.</i>, 516 N.E.2d 144, 146 (Mass. 1987).] There is no question that the relief the plaintiffs sought required them to establish the validity of the foreclosure sales on which their claim to clear title rested.</p>
<p id="c5d4f15f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Massachusetts does not require a mortgage holder to obtain judicial authorization to foreclose on a mortgaged property. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, §21; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §14. Where a mortgage grants a mortgage holder the power of sale, as did both the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages, it includes by reference the power of sale set out in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, §21, and further regulated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§11-17C. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, §21, after a mortgagor defaults in the performance of the underlying note, the mortgage holder may sell the property at a public auction and convey the property to the purchaser in fee simple, “and such sale shall forever bar the mortgagor and all persons claiming under him from all right and interest in the mortgaged premises, whether at law or in equity.” Even where there is a dispute as to whether the mortgagor was in default or whether the party claiming to be the mortgage holder is the true mortgage holder, the foreclosure goes forward unless the mortgagor files an action and obtains a court order enjoining the foreclosure.</p>
<p id="c5d4f160-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing the substantial power that the statutory scheme affords to a mortgage holder to foreclose without immediate judicial oversight, we adhere to the familiar rule that “one who sells under a power [of sale] must follow strictly its terms. If he fails to do so there is no valid execution of the power, and the sale is wholly void.” <i>Moore v. Dick</i>, 72 N.E. 967 (Mass. 1905). One of the terms of the power of sale that must be strictly adhered to is the restriction on who is entitled to foreclose. The “statutory power of sale” can be exercised by “the mortgagee or his executors, administrators, successors or assigns.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, §21. Any effort to foreclose by a party lacking “jurisdiction and authority” to carry out a foreclosure under these statutes is void. <i>Chace v. Morse</i>, 76 N.E. 142 (Mass. 1905).</p>
<p id="c5d4f161-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs claim that the securitization documents they submitted establish valid assignments that made them the holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages before the notice of sale and the foreclosure sale. We turn, then, to the documentation submitted by the plaintiffs to determine whether it met the requirements of a valid assignment. Focusing first on the Ibanez mortgage, U.S. Bank argues that it was assigned the mortgage under the trust agreement described in the PPM, but it did not submit a copy of this trust agreement to the judge. The PPM, however, described the trust agreement as an agreement to be executed in the future, so it only furnished evidence of an intent to assign mortgages to U.S. Bank, not proof of their actual assignment. Even if there were an executed trust agreement with language of present assignment, U.S. Bank did not produce the schedule of loans and mortgages that was an exhibit <span title="976" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-976">p. 976</span>to that agreement, so it failed to show that the Ibanez mortgage was among the mortgages to be assigned by that agreement. Finally, even if there were an executed trust agreement with the required schedule, U.S. Bank failed to furnish any evidence that the entity assigning the mortgage — Structured Asset Securities Corporation — ever held the mortgage to be assigned. The last assignment of the mortgage on record was from Rose Mortgage to Option One; nothing was submitted to the judge indicating that Option One ever assigned the mortgage to anyone before the foreclosure sale. Thus, based on the documents submitted to the judge, Option One, not U.S. Bank, was the mortgage holder at the time of the foreclosure, and U.S. Bank did not have the authority to foreclose the mortgage.</p>
<p id="c5d4f162-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Wells Fargo was similarly unable to demonstrate authority to foreclose based on the documentation relating to the securitization of the LaRace mortgage in the record.]</p>
<p id="c5d4f163-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a plaintiff files a complaint asking for a declaration of clear title after a mortgage foreclosure, a judge is entitled to ask for proof that the foreclosing entity was the mortgage holder at the time of the notice of sale and foreclosure, or was one of the parties authorized to foreclose under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, §21, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §14. A plaintiff that cannot make this modest showing cannot justly proclaim that it was unfairly denied a declaration of clear title.</p>
<p id="c5d4f164-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not suggest that an assignment must be in recordable form at the time of the notice of sale or the subsequent foreclosure sale, although recording is likely the better practice. Where a pool of mortgages is assigned to a securitized trust, the executed agreement that assigns the pool of mortgages, with a schedule of the pooled mortgage loans that clearly and specifically identifies the mortgage at issue as among those assigned, may suffice to establish the trustee as the mortgage holder. However, there must be proof that the assignment was made by a party that itself held the mortgage. A foreclosing entity may provide a complete chain of assignments linking it to the record holder of the mortgage, or a single assignment from the record holder of the mortgage.</p>
<p id="c5d4f165-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Conclusion.</i> For the reasons stated, we agree with the judge that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they were the holders of the Ibanez and LaRace mortgages at the time that they foreclosed these properties, and therefore failed to demonstrate that they acquired fee simple title to these properties by purchasing them at the foreclosure sale.</p>

There is no dispute that the mortgagors of the properties in question had defaulted on their obligations, and that the mortgaged properties were subject to foreclosure. Before commencing such an action, however, the holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order. Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the mortgagors, that is not the point. <span title="977" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-977">p. 977</span>Foreclosure is a powerful act with significant consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it.</p>
<p id="c5d4f168-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The type of sophisticated transactions leading up to the accumulation of the notes and mortgages in question in these cases and their securitization, and, ultimately the sale of mortgage-backed securities, are not barred nor even burdened by the requirements of Massachusetts law. The plaintiff banks, who brought these cases to clear the titles that they acquired at their own foreclosure sales, have simply failed to prove that the underlying assignments of the mortgages that they allege (and would have) entitled them to foreclose ever existed in any legally cognizable form before they exercised the power of sale that accompanies those assignments. The court’s opinion clearly states that such assignments do not need to be in recordable form or recorded before the foreclosure, but they do have to have been effectuated.</p></div></div>

Problems of proof and authority in foreclosure.</b> When a bank obtains a mortgage on a home, the Statute of Frauds requires it to be in writing, and the mortgagee generally records the mortgage. If the mortgage is assigned to another institution, the purchaser of the bank’s rights should record its interest as well, although as <i>Ibanez</i> makes clear, recording is not legally required to effectuate the transfer. In some cases, the institutions that buy mortgages neither record the transaction nor obtain sufficient proof of their interest. <i>Ibanez</i> illustrates what can happen if a party seeks to foreclose on a mortgage but is unable to demonstrate that it is, in fact, authorized to do so. This has become an increasingly important aspect of foreclosure litigation in the aftermath of the housing crisis. <i>See generally</i> Bradley T. Borden, David J. Reiss &amp; W.

Mortgage servicers, as well, often file foreclosure lawsuits on behalf of mortgagees, but they are not the “owners” of the mortgages they service. Accordingly, servicers may be required to present proof of ownership of the mortgage for the foreclosure to proceed. Some courts have refused to allow loan servicers to bring foreclosure lawsuits on behalf of the underlying mortgagee. <i>See Bayview Loan Servicing, L.L.C. v. Nelson</i>, 890 N.E.2d 940 (Ill. App. Ct. 2008) (denying a loan servicer the power to bring a foreclosure suit).</p>
<p id="c5d5187d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar problems may arise with the <b>Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS)</b>. In 1993, mortgage lenders who engaged in trades of mortgages established a private organization, MERS, to hold those mortgages for the benefit of the mortgagees. MERS does not actually “own” the mortgage; it has no right to the payments from the borrower; nor does it act as the loan servicer. Rather, it acts as the agent of the mortgagees, and MERS is listed as either the “nominee” of the lender or <span title="978" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-978">p. 978</span>as the record owner of the mortgage in the recording office. This is designed to eliminate the need for new recordings when mortgages are transferred, allowing mortgages to be traded more cheaply and quickly. In a number of cases, borrowers have challenged the ability of MERS to initiate foreclosures, and the courts have disagreed about whether MERS is entitled to foreclose. <i>Compare, e.g., Brandrup v. ReconTrust Co., N.A.</i>, 303 P.3d 301 (Or. 2013) (MERS not eligible to serve as beneficiary under <i>Oregon Deed of Trust Act</i> and did not show authorization as an agent of lender); <i>Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. Saunders</i>, 2 A.3d 289 (Me. 2010) (MERS lacks standing to initiate foreclosure), <i>with Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. White</i>, 896 A.2d 797 (Conn. 2006) (upholding MERS-initiated foreclosure as nominee for lenders). MERS no longer allows foreclosures under its name, but this has not stopped challenges from arising. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB</i>, 68 A.3d 1069, 1079-1080 (R.I. 2013) (noting the policy change, but finding a challenge to MERS’s authority to act on behalf of a lender not moot); <i>see also Edwards v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.</i>, 300 P.3d 43 (Ind. 2013) (the fact that MERS acts as nominee for lender does not preclude foreclosure).</p>
<p id="c5d5187e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. The purpose of recording mortgage transfers.</b> MERS raises broader questions about the function of the public records system when it comes to mortgage transfers. The New York Court of Appeals has held that the recording office is obligated to record mortgages held by MERS, even though it is not itself the mortgagee. <i>MERSCORP, Inc. v. Romaine</i>, 861 N.E.2d 81 (N.Y. 2006). Partially dissenting, Chief Judge Judith Kaye noted that MERS makes it more difficult for the recording system to achieve its purpose, which is to create a public system that puts potential buyers on notice of who owns interests in real estate. She noted that one result of MERS is that it may be difficult (or impossible) for a homeowner to determine who owns the underlying mortgage. The mortgage can be sold, and the borrower may be dealing only with the loan servicer rather than the mortgagee. The loan servicer does not see it as its job to engage in such negotiations (particularly since loan servicers often get higher fees for conducting foreclosures than for collecting routine loan payments). If so, then there is a transactional barrier to renegotiation that may lead to an unnecessary foreclosure, with the third-party effects such foreclosures engender. <i>Id.</i> at 88-89. To solve these problems, some scholars have begun to call for a public national registry. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Tanya Marsh, <i>Foreclosures and the Failure of the American Land Title Recording System</i>, 111 Colum. L. Rev. Sidebar 19 (2011).</p>
<p id="c5d5187f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Challenging judicial versus nonjudicial foreclosures.</b> In a judicial foreclosure, there is an initial lawsuit before a sale can take place, which affords home borrowers the opportunity to contest the basis for the foreclosure and raise any affirmative defenses they might have. With a power-of-sale foreclosure or deed of trust, borrowers must affirmatively challenge the sale, or bring claims after the sale if there were infirmities in the process or result of the sale. Some borrowers in default may also file for bankruptcy, a process that includes an automatic stay of claims, including foreclosure. 11 U.S.C. §362(a)(1). <i>Ibanez</i> was somewhat unusual in that the successful bidders at the foreclosure sale, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, brought a quiet title action, <span title="979" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-979">p. 979</span>which then allowed the original borrowers to contest the validity of the foreclosure itself.

Debt collectors, for example, are barred from communicating with borrowers if borrowers are represented by counsel or inform the debt collector that they do not wish to be contacted. <i>Id.</i> §1692c. And debt collectors may not use or threaten violence or use obscene or profane language.<i> Id.</i> §1692d.

<p id="c5d51884-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A common problem in foreclosure sales arises with the price bid for the property. Anyone can bid on the property, including the mortgagor and the mortgagee. Although publicity should generate knowledge about the sale and offers from anyone interested in the property, it is often the case that the mortgagee is the only entity or person bidding at the foreclosure sale. Can you see why? In such a case, there is a danger that the mortgagee will make a low bid; the mortgagee will get the property for less than its fair market value but be able to sell it for fair market value and pocket the excess. If the sale price is less than the unpaid debt, the mortgagee can not only resell the property but, in many states, can file a deficiency judgment against a mortgagor who has other assets. Under what circumstances, then, should courts set aside the sale entirely? Consider the following case.</p>

<p id="c5d5188a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves two parcels of land originally owned by Marion and Mortimer Moore. In 1953 Mortimer was granted a homestead patent to a forty-acre parcel which he conveyed to his wife, Marion, in 1959. The following year, Marion acquired <span title="980" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-980">p. 980</span>a second parcel to the north of the homestead property, Parcel 1. In 1974 the majority of the homestead property was sold, leaving Parcel 2, which adjoined Parcel 1 to the south. The two parcels were never replatted or otherwise legally merged into a single parcel.</p>
<p id="c5d5188b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Moores divorced in 1976. In 1991 Mortimer and Marion simultaneously sold their respective parcels to Charles McAlpine. The following day, McAlpine conveyed the parcels to Annette Beal by quitclaim deed. These transactions were financed by two separate promissory notes signed by McAlpine: Note A for $95,000 payable to Mortimer; and Note B for $135,000 payable to Marion. Each note was to be paid to the respective seller through its own separate escrow account.</p>
<p id="c5d5188c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two promissory notes were secured by a single deed of trust covering both parcels containing the following special condition: “This deed of trust is covered by 2 Promissory Notes, and Trustor is aware that default on either of the 2 Note [sic], will constitute default under the other Note and foreclosure laws of the State of Alaska shall apply.” The deed of trust also provided that “[u]pon default by Trustor in payment of any indebtedness secured hereby . . . Trustee . . . shall,” at the option of the Beneficiary, “sell said property[,] . . . either as a whole or in separate parcels and in such order as it may determine, at public auction to the highest and best bidder. . . .”</p>
<p id="c5d5188d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1994 Annette paid off the $95,000 owed on Note A for Parcel 1 to Mortimer. At that time, there was some discussion regarding paying off Note B, but Marion preferred to continue to receive monthly payments rather than being paid off in a single lump sum. Marion did agree to a reduction of the interest rate on Note B. The 1991 deed of trust was modified to reflect the payoff of the note to Mortimer and the change in interest rate on Marion’s note.</p>
<p id="c5d5188e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the fall of 1999, after an erratic payment history, Annette fell behind in her payments. Sarah Baskurt, the Moores’ daughter [as trustee for a trust established by Marion Moore], took steps to commence foreclosure, including contacting attorney Jim Christie to conduct the foreclosure. Christie and Land Title Company of Alaska, Inc., made the arrangements for the foreclosure. At that time, Annette owed $26,780.81 on Parcel 2, having paid approximately eighty percent of the original $135,000 purchase price.</p>
<p id="c5d53f9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foreclosure sale was held on April 26, 2000, inside the main entrance of the Nesbett Memorial Courthouse in Anchorage. Prior to arriving at the sale, Baskurt, who wanted to bid on the property but believed she lacked the financial strength and knowledge of property development to do so on her own, contacted friends to see if they would be interested in bidding on the property as her partner. Robert and Joyce Wainscott agreed and Baskurt and Joyce Wainscott formed a partnership for the purpose of acquiring and developing or reselling the property. Baskurt, who believed the property was worth at least $250,000, brought a check for $151,000 to the sale. The Wainscotts brought a check for $100,000 to the sale. The trio had at least $251,000 available to put toward the purchase price of the property. [They later agreed to add Baskurt’s neighbor, Allen Rosenthal, whom Baskurt knew to have considerable experience in home construction, to the partnership.]</p>

Baskurt made the opening and only bid for $26,781.81, a dollar over the remaining debt owed on the property, on behalf of the partnership. There were no other bids, and the property was sold to Baskurt, Joyce, and Rosenthal via a trustee’s deed.</p>
<p id="c5d53fa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 17, 2000, Annette filed a complaint seeking to have the foreclosure sale set aside. Baskurt, Wainscott, and Rosenthal (collectively “Purchasers”) subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing there was no basis for setting aside the sale. Purchasers’ motion for summary judgment was denied because a question of fact remained whether “the parties intended for both parcels to be subject to foreclosure upon default of one note when the other note had been satisfied.” After a three-day bench trial, the superior court set aside the foreclosure sale as both void and voidable. Final judgment setting aside the foreclosure sale and awarding attorney’s fees and costs to Annette was entered on February 28, 2003. Purchasers appeal.</p>

However, defects in the mechanics of the trustee’s exercise of the power to foreclose may render the foreclosure sale voidable. Generally, mere inadequacy of price is not sufficient by itself to require setting aside a foreclosure sale. However, if the inadequacy of the sale price is (1) “so gross as to shock the conscience and raise a presumption of fraud or unfairness,” or (2) is coupled with other irregularities in the sale procedures, then invalidation of the sale may be justified.</p>

Jurisdictions vary on what percentage of fair market value renders the purchase price grossly inadequate. Foreclosure sale prices of fifty percent or more of fair market value are routinely upheld. Even prices garnering less than fifty percent of fair market value are often upheld. However, several courts have upheld the invalidation of a foreclosure sale that produced a price of twenty percent of fair market value or less.

For example, even a slight irregularity in the foreclosure process coupled with a sale price that is substantially below fair market value may justify or even compel the invalidation of the sale. . . .

<p id="c5d566bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>McHugh</i> [<i>v. Church,</i> 583 P.2d 210, 213 (Alaska 1978)], we considered the effect of selling property in bulk as opposed to by parcel. Though we declined to adopt “a flat rule requiring the trustee to sell real property in separate lots or parcels, rather than as a whole unit,” we recognized that a trustee under a deed of trust is a dual fiduciary owing duties to both the trustor and the beneficiary. Among the duties owed by the trustee is the duty to take reasonable and appropriate steps to avoid sacrifice of the debtor’s property and interest.</p>
<p id="c5d566be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bearing these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. Purchasers contend that there was no basis to set the foreclosure sale aside as voidable. They argue, among other things, that the sale should not have been set aside on the basis of an inadequate price since under <i>McHugh</i>, an inadequate price is an insufficient basis for setting aside a foreclosure sale. Further, they contend that the sale should not have been set aside on the ground that the parcels were sold together because under <i>McHugh,</i> the trustee was under no duty to sell the parcels separately.</p>
<p id="c5d566bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not convinced by Purchasers’ argument. The test for whether a sale is voidable based on price inadequacy is whether the price paid was <i>grossly</i> inadequate when compared to the fair market value of the property on the date of the foreclosure sale. The trial court found that the 1991 sales price of $225,000 was the best indicator of fair market value. The fact that the foreclosure purchase price of $26,781.10 was less than fifteen percent of the sale price indicates that the gross inadequacy standard was <span title="983" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-983">p. 983</span>met. The trial court so found, and Purchasers identify no circumstances indicating that this finding is erroneous.</p>
<p id="c5d566c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The superior court also found that the sale of either parcel alone would likely have generated sufficient proceeds to satisfy the amount due. By conducting the sale in bulk rather than selling only one parcel, the court found that the trustee failed in its duty to act reasonably to protect Beal’s interests. This finding is supported by the evidence and is in accordance with our observation in <i>McHugh</i> that a trustee has a duty to take reasonable steps to act impartially and in such a way as “not to sacrifice the debtor’s property.” When coupled with the inadequacy of the price, the trustee’s unreasonable failure to sell only one parcel initially justifies invalidating the sale.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11065_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11065_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">29</a></span></p>
<p id="c5d566c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the superior court properly set aside the sale based on the grossly inadequate sale price and the trustee’s failure to sell only one parcel in breach of its duty to act reasonably to protect Beal’s interests.</p></div></div>

<p id="c5d566c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. The process of foreclosure sales.</b> Most foreclosure sales take place by public auction, which typically involves a single opportunity for interested purchasers to come to a single location in order to bid. State law sets the terms of the required public notice of the sale and other conditions that must be met. Although this process can help borrowers in distress reduce carrying costs and market properties quickly, scholars have argued that “it would be difficult to design a sale procedure less apt to result in market prices than the usual foreclosure auction. The absence of so many features that buyers in negotiated sales have come to expect virtually ensures that below-market prices will prevail.” Grant S. Nelson &amp; Dale A. Whitman,<i> Reforming Foreclosure: The Uniform Nonjudicial Foreclosure Act</i>, 53 Duke L.J. 1399, 1423 (2004). Indeed, many institutional lenders have come to view foreclosure less as process to liquidate the property for its immediate value than as a way to transfer title to themselves so that they can sell it outside of the bidding process. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5d566c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Ensuring a fair price at foreclosure sales.</b> States have developed several mechanisms to ensure that the price bid at the foreclosure sale is near the fair market value. First, the mortgagor has the right to bid at the foreclosure sale. This enables the mortgagor to go to another lender, which may be willing to lend the mortgagor the money so long as the property is worth more than the unpaid debt, and the property will constitute the security for <i>its</i> new loan. If the mortgagee bids too low, the mortgagor may be able to counter with a higher bid, forcing the mortgagee to bid more to get the property. Second, there must be public notice of the sale so that others can bid on the property. Third, some states prohibit deficiency judgments. This decreases the mortgagee’s incentive to bid below the fair market value of the property. Fourth, many states allow a mortgagor to sue a mortgagee for unjust enrichment if the mortgagee buys the property <span title="984" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-984">p. 984</span>at a low price and resells it within a short period of time for a much higher price. The mortgagee may be forced to disgorge the profits and turn them over to the mortgagor. This procedure protects the mortgagor’s right to the excess proceeds and prevents the mortgagee from bidding low, reselling the property, and keeping those proceeds itself.</p>
<p id="c5d566c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the <i>Baskurt</i> court noted, when a party challenges a foreclosure based on the price obtained through the sale, courts generally require either a level of inadequacy that “shocks the conscience” sufficient to “raise a presumption of fraud or unfairness,” or is coupled with other irregularities in the sale procedures. Some courts are reluctant to set aside foreclosure sales, even with very low proceeds, in the absence of some irregularity. In <i>Phillips v. Blazier-Henry</i>, 302 P.3d 349 (Idaho 2013), for example, a lower court in a foreclosure action had issued a writ of execution in the amount $87,211.07 for unpaid debt, interest, and fees. At the subsequent sheriff’s sale, a bidder purchased the mortgaged property for $1,000. The lender sued to set aside the sale, arguing that a substitution of counsel prevented the lender from making a bid for the outstanding amount of the debt, something called a credit bid. The lower court agreed to set aside the sale, finding that the inadequacy of price “shocked the conscience” of the court. On appeal, the Idaho Supreme Court reversed, holding that inadequacy of price alone is insufficient to warrant setting aside a sale; “additional circumstances” even if “very slight” are required, such as an irregularity in the bidding process. <i>Id.</i> at 354. </p>
<p id="c5d566c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Priorities in foreclosure.</b> A lender who forecloses on a property may be the only lienholder; in such circumstances, the main questions about the use of the proceeds of the sale are whether there is any surplus after repaying the debt for the borrower to recover, and, if there is a shortfall, whether the lender may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. <i>See</i> §4.3, above. It is not uncommon, however, for a single property in foreclosure to have multiple liens, such as a mortgage loan taken out to purchase the property and a later home equity loan to finance renovations, or a judgment lien that has attached to the property, or a homeowners association assessment fee lien. In that situation, courts are required to decide how the proceeds of the sale should be divided among the lienholders.</p>
<p id="c5d566c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In general, proceeds are paid out in full to each lienholder in turn based on their <b>priority</b>, which is usually set by the order in which the relevant security interest was <b>recorded</b> in the public records. 12<i> Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §101.06(a). We will discuss the system of recording interests in land in detail <i>in</i> §5, below, but for now it is sufficient to understand that a mortgage, when recorded, will be entitled to any funds that flow from a foreclosure before any interests that are recorded later. These are called <b>senior</b> liens, and later-recorded interests are thus <b>junior</b>. When someone has a “first” mortgage and a “second” mortgage, it means that they have two mortgages recorded first and second. If the first mortgagee forecloses, the second mortgagee is only entitled to any proceeds of the sale if the first mortgagee’s debt is fully paid.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110B9_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N110B9_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">30</a></span></p>

For example, in most states, a <b>purchase-money mortgage</b> can take priority over other liens, even those recorded beforehand (such as a judgment lien). Similarly, in many states, <b>mechanics’ liens</b> may take priority over subsequently recorded mortgages. And liens to secure the payment of property taxes can also take priority over subsequently recorded mortgages.</p>

<p id="c5d58ddf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lienholders can also agree among themselves to change the order of priorities that would otherwise apply through a process called <b>subordination</b>. For example, a bank may not be willing to lend funds for the construction of a building on undeveloped land unless it has priority over the bank that financed the purchase of that land. The first lender might be willing to subordinate its lien to the later construction lender because those latter funds will be used to enhance the value of the property. An owner would thus negotiate a subordination agreement between the two lenders that would reverse their priorities in the event of a foreclosure.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110E7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N110E7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">31</a></span></p>

Necessary parties to a foreclosure and the effects of non-joinder.</b> For judicial foreclosures, a mortgagee is generally required to join all junior lienholders. This is because a foreclosure is meant to allow a mortgagee to sell the collateral with only claims that existed when the security interest attached. If a borrower could add additional loans and have those mortgages remain after a foreclosure, the original lender’s security interest would not be very secure. By joining all junior lienholders, a senior mortgagee can discharge junior liens and sell the property free and clear of those interests. A junior lienholder who is not joined to the foreclosure action is generally not discharged through the foreclosure action.</p>

<p id="c5d58de4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about foreclosures pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or under a deed of trust, which do not require a court proceeding? Although such foreclosures are not supervised by the court, they generally have the same effect on liens. Mortgages that are senior to the lien being foreclosed are not discharged in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, but junior liens generally are. The notice that senior lienholders are required to give junior lienholders before exercising a power of sale or foreclosing under a deed of trust can vary. <i>See</i> Nelson &amp; Whitman,<i> supra</i>, at 1431.</p>

Tenant eviction after foreclosure.</b> The same principle of priorities means that tenants can face eviction from their homes when their landlords lose their properties through foreclosure, if the tenant rented after a mortgage was recorded. Banks that buy foreclosed properties often want to evict the tenants because they believe it is easier to sell unoccupied property. Although this may be true for many types of property, it is not clear that it is true for property devoted to residential tenancy purposes, especially in a time of recession when it may not be so easy to find tenants who are creditworthy and able to pay the rent on time. At the same time, mortgage providers generally are not in the business of managing property in a landlord capacity. Mortgage foreclosure laws protect the right of borrowers to stay in their homes by making good on defaulted mortgage payments. The federal <i>Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act</i> and its state analogues, see Chapter 11, §2.3, as well as some rent-control statutes, can provide similar protection for tenants from eviction.</p>
<p id="c5d58de6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One issue that can arise after foreclosure is whether the purchaser at a foreclosure sale can use self-help to obtain possession from the former owner. While some jurisdictions do allow self-help, most require purchasers to use statutory eviction procedures. <i>See Nickens v. Mount Vernon Realty Group LLC</i>, 54 A.3d 742, 751 n.14 (Md. 2012) (approving changing the locks while a holdover was out of town following foreclosure, but noting that only 14 jurisdictions still allow such self-help). Is there any reason to allow self-help after foreclosure if a statutory eviction process is available? </p>
<p id="c5d5b4f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Reforming foreclosure process.</b> During the Great Depression, some states passed laws protecting homeowners from foreclosure under certain circumstances. In <i>Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell</i>, 290 U.S. 398 (1934), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1933 Minnesota <i>Mortgage Moratorium Act</i>, which temporarily authorized courts to extend periods of redemption — the time during which the homeowner-mortgagor could pay off the loan to the mortgagee — without being subject to a foreclosure sale. There has been no similar legislation broadly halting foreclosures during the subprime crisis; however, the crisis has ushered in important changes to foreclosure law in a number of states. Although the details vary, much of this reform effort has focused on giving home lenders and the servicers who work for them greater obligations to undertake loss mitigation, which involves finding alternatives to foreclosure, as well as on raising the procedural protections that homeowners have in foreclosure itself. <i>See</i> Frank S. Alexander et al.,<i> Legislative Responses to the Foreclosure Crisis in Nonjudicial Foreclosure States</i>, 31 Rev. Banking &amp; Fin. L. 341 (2011).</p>
<p id="c5d5b4f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2012, for example, California passed the <i>Homeowners Bill of Rights</i>, 2012 Cal. Stat., c. 86 (A.B. 278); 2012 Cal Stat. c. 87 (S.B. 900). The new statutory regime bars mortgage servicers from foreclosing if a homeowner is in the process of seeking a modification of her loan, a process known as <b>dual tracking</b> that raised significant concerns following the subprime crisis. It also requires that parties filing or recording a notice of default, an affidavit in a foreclosure action, and other documents, must have “competent and reliable evidence” of the borrower’s default and the lender’s <span title="987" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-987">p. 987</span>right to foreclose, and authorizes civil penalties for signing unverified mortgage documents. Cal. Civ. Code §2924.17. These reforms respond to a practice that came to light during the subprime crisis, called <b>robo-signing</b>, which involved servicers and others signing foreclosure-related documents, often by the thousands, without knowledge of the underlying facts.</p>
<p id="c5d5b4f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, the Illinois Supreme Court recently issued a series of rules, which took effect in May 2013, to respond to abusive foreclosure practices. Under the rules, lenders are required to file a current copy of the note and an affidavit specifying the amounts due and owing and how the lender can identify those amounts. Lenders seeking to foreclose must also show that they informed borrowers about mortgage counseling programs, mediation, free legal representation, interpretive services for non-English speakers, and loan modification procedures. Finally, lenders have to attest to compliance with any loss mitigation requirements that apply to the loan. <i>See</i> Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 99.1, 113, and 114.</p>
<p id="c5d5b4fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2015, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws promulgated the <i>Uniform Home Foreclosure Procedures Act</i>, as an attempt to fill gaps in state law and promote consistency. The act, which as of 2016 had yet to be adopted by any state, offers provisions on foreclosure resolution to improve foreclosure through a mediation-like process and a number of provisions to resolve ambiguities in lender status. <i>See</i> Emma R. Olson, <i>Finding the Middle Ground, or the Act All Intended Parties Believe Favors the Other Guy: An Overview of the Uniform Home Foreclosure Procedures Act</i>, 30 Prob. &amp; Prop. 18 (Mar.-Apr. 2016).

<p id="c5d5b4ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An installment land contract is an alternative way to finance real estate. Under an installment land contract, the buyer makes a down payment to the seller and signs a contract promising to pay the rest of the purchase price to the seller at specified times and in specified amounts. At the end of the contract, the seller will convey title to the property to the buyer. The contract normally allows the seller to regain possession of the property on the buyer’s default. It also ordinarily allows the seller to keep the payments already made by the buyer as <b>liquidated damages</b> for the buyer’s breach of the agreement. Liquidated damages are damages for breach of contract set in advance by the parties themselves as part of their agreement.</p>
<p id="c5d5b500-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This arrangement poses the same problems for the buyer as the mortgage does, but states often provide such buyer-borrowers fewer procedural protections than are granted to mortgagors. Some states implicitly or explicitly prohibit installment land contracts by making the protections of the mortgage foreclosure statute nonwaivable. Other states treat some installment land contracts like mortgages. States that allow installment land contracts may permit the seller to regain possession of the property <span title="988" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-988">p. 988</span>but will examine the amounts paid by the buyer to determine whether they are grossly disproportionate to the damages suffered by the seller. Damages that are too high are considered a <b>penalty</b> or a <b>forfeiture</b>, and the court will order the seller to disgorge part of that amount back to the buyer. Another issue raised when a buyer defaults on an installment land contract is whether the buyer has a <b>right of redemption</b>. Does the buyer have the right after default to continue in possession of the property by paying off all or some of the rest of the purchase price?</p>

<p id="c5d5dc1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The movant, Jean Sebastian, contracted on November 8, 1974, to buy a house and lot situated in Covington, Kentucky, from Perl and Zona Floyd, respondents in this motion for review. Sebastian paid $3,800.00 down and was to pay the balance of the $10,900.00 purchase price, plus taxes, insurance, and interest at the rate of 8% per annum, in monthly installments of $120.00. A forfeiture clause in the contract provided that if Sebastian failed to make any monthly payment and remained in default for 60 days, the Floyds could terminate the contract and retain all payments previously made as rent and liquidated damages.</p>
<p id="c5d5dc1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the next 21 months, Sebastian missed seven installments.

Of this amount, $4,300.00, or nearly 40% of the contract price, had been applied against the principal.</p>
<p id="c5d5dc1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Floyds brought suit in the Kenton Circuit Court against Sebastian in August, 1976, seeking a judgment of $700.00 plus compensation for payments for taxes and insurance, and seeking enforcement of the forfeiture clause.

<p id="c5d5dc1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a typical installment land contract is used as the means of financing the purchase of property, legal title to the property remains in the seller until the buyer has paid the entire contract price or some agreed-upon portion thereof, at which time the seller tenders a deed to the buyer. However, equitable title passes to the buyer when the contract is entered. The seller holds nothing but the bare legal title, as security for the payment of the purchase price.</p>

<p id="c5d5dc20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the purchaser of property has given a mortgage and subsequently defaults on his payments, his entire interest in the property is not forfeited. The mortgagor has the right to redeem the property by paying the full debt plus interest and expenses incurred by the creditor due to default. In order to cut off the mortgagor’s right to redeem, the mortgagee must request a court to sell the property at public auction. From the proceeds of the sale, the mortgagee recovers the amount owed him on the mortgage, as well as the expenses of bringing suit; the mortgagor is entitled to the balance, if any.</p>

<p id="c5d5dc24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Three approaches to installment land contracts.</b> In addressing the scope of consumer protection in alternative financing arrangements such as installment land contracts, courts have developed a variety of approaches. The first approach handles these questions in one fell swoop by holding that installment land contracts are equivalent to mortgages and therefore must be governed by the same rules. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Prue v. Royer</i>, 67 A.3d 895 (Vt. 2013) (discussing the growing trend of courts treating contracts for deed as mortgages); <i>see also Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgages)</i> §3.4 (1997) (providing that a “contract for deed” — <i>i.e</i>., an installment land contract — is a mortgage).</p>
<p id="c5d60335-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This gives buyers under installment land contracts the full range of protections available to mortgagors, including an equity of redemption (the right to retain the property by paying the rest of the purchase price at or before the foreclosure sale), the procedural protections of the foreclosure statutes (including notice of intent to foreclose and perhaps a judicially supervised public sale), and the right to recover any proceeds of the foreclosure sale in excess of the unpaid debt.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111F7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N111F7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">33</a></span> This approach, adopted by the Kentucky court in <i>Sebastian v. Floyd</i>, effectively makes the protections of mortgage foreclosure statutes nondisclaimable.</p>

Colorado, for example, has developed a test to distinguish installment land contracts that must be treated like mortgages from those that may be enforced according to their own terms. In <i>Grombone v. Krekel</i>, 754 P.2d 777 (Colo. Ct. App. 1988), the court held that trial courts have the discretion to make this determination based on a range of factors, including “the amount of the vendee’s equity in the property, the length of the default period, the willfulness of the default, whether the vendee has made improvements, and whether the property has been adequately maintained.” <i>Id</i>. at 779. If the buyer has made a large down payment, occupied the property for a long time, and paid a substantial portion of the purchase price, the court is likely to provide the buyer with all the protections accorded a mortgagee, including a right to redeem, a right to notice and a foreclosure sale, and a right to recover proceeds from the foreclosure sale exceeding the unpaid debt. <i>See also Lewis v. Premium Investment Corp.</i>, 568 S.E.2d 361 (S.C. 2002); <i>Bean v. Walker</i>, 464 N.Y.S.2d 895 (App. Div. 1983).</p>
<p id="c5d60338-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, some states hold that the buyer has no right of redemption under installment land contracts; thus, the seller has the right to get the property back on the buyer’s default and to eject the buyer from the property. The only question in these states is whether the amount of payments already made by the buyer so exceeds the seller’s damages as to constitute an unconscionable <b>forfeiture</b> or <b>penalty</b>. If it does, the buyer may have a right to be reimbursed for part of the down payment. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals took this approach in <i>Stonebraker v. Zinn</i>, 286 S.E.2d 911 (W. Va. 1982). In that case, the buyers had occupied the property for a year and made a $1,500 down payment as well as 12 monthly payments of $189.09 each. The parties agreed that $189.09 was a fair rental payment for the property, and the court found that allowing the seller to retain the $1,500 down payment as well as the monthly payments as liquidated damages was not excessive.</p>

<p id="c5d6033a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The predominant use of installment land sale contracts has been to finance the purchase of housing by low-income families and individuals unable to qualify for conventional mortgage financing or government loan guarantee programs.</p>

Most important, defaulting vendees would be able to avoid the loss of their homes by paying only the delinquent amounts. Under the majority’s holding, a wilfully defaulting vendee may avoid this fate only by paying the outstanding balance in full. This is an unjustifiably harsh burden to place on the low-income and middle-income families and individuals who will be most affected.</p>

By April 1973 the Petersens had made only 58 out of the 65 payments then due, and their first attempt to reinstate the contract was not until 29 months later, when they tendered $250 out of the $1,800 that was by then overdue and unpaid.”</p>

Marshall</i>, 301 N.E.2d 641 (Ind. 1973), that the question whether an installment land contract should be treated like a mortgage should depend on case-by-case determinations of whether “forfeiture” of the buyer’s accumulated equity in the property would be consistent with “generally accepted principles of fairness and equity.” <i>Id.</i> at 646. The buyer who has paid most of the purchase price “has acquired a substantial interest in the property, which, if forfeited, would result in substantial injustice.” <i>Id.</i> Is this argument circular? If the seller is entitled to keep the proceeds and evict the buyer, then the buyer will not have “acquired a substantial interest in the property.” The buyer will have “acquired” such an interest only if the courts strike down the forfeiture provision in the contract. What then makes the forfeiture unjust?</p>

If the monthly payment to the lender is near the fair rental value of the property, isn’t the only difference between a renter and a buyer the amount of the down payment? Or is there also a distinction in the sense that the buyer is entitled to treat the property as her own, renovating the property and making structural changes as she sees fit, and thus develops expectations based on considering the property as her own? Does the buyer have no right to develop a personal attachment to the property given the seller’s right to end the agreement if the buyer defaults?</p>

<p id="c5d62a5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1970, plaintiff [Helen Koenig] owned a home in Oakland County with a market value of $60,000 that was encumbered by three mortgages totaling $25,933.26. The real estate taxes on plaintiff’s home had become delinquent and foreclosure proceedings had begun on one of the mortgages. Plaintiff was then approached by defendant, Stanley Van Reken, who proposed that for a fee of 10 percent he would “service” the mortgages and pay the delinquent taxes. Subsequently, on June 16, 1970, plaintiff and defendant Stanley Van Reken executed three documents that form the basis of this action.</p>
<p id="c5d62a5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first of these documents, entitled “AGREEMENT,” stated that plaintiff desired to prevent the loss of her home and provided that defendant Stanley Van Reken purchase the property, redeem it from tax sale and mortgage foreclosure, and give plaintiff an exclusive right to repurchase according to the terms of a lease-option agreement that was also executed between the parties.</p>
<p id="c5d62a5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second document was a warranty deed which conveyed the property from plaintiff to defendants for a stated consideration of $28,600. Plaintiff alleges that the deed was silent as to consideration when she signed it, that the figure of $28,600 was added subsequently, and that she never received any such consideration.</p>
<p id="c5d62a5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third document provided that Stanley Van Reken was to lease the premises to plaintiff for a 3-year period at a fixed monthly rent of $300. Plaintiff was also to receive an exclusive option to repurchase the premises during the term of the lease for a price of $32,318.79, with a down payment of $3,500 and monthly payments of $300 which were to include taxes, insurance, principal and interest.</p>
<p id="c5d62a5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At no time during the negotiations that led to the execution of these documents was plaintiff represented by an attorney, and all three documents were prepared by Stanley Van Reken.</p>
<p id="c5d62a60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties operated under the lease from June 16, 1970, to February, 1972, and during this time plaintiff made total payments of $5,800. In February, 1972, plaintiff defaulted in a monthly rental payment. Plaintiff was thereupon evicted from the home.</p>

<p id="c5d65172-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of equity protects the necessitous by looking through form to the substance of the transaction. Although no set criterion has been established, the controlling factor in determining whether a deed absolute on its face should be deemed a mortgage is the intention of the parties. Such intention may be gathered from the circumstances attending the transaction including the conduct and relative economic positions of the parties and the value of the property in relation to the price fixed in the alleged sale. Under Michigan law, it is well settled that the adverse financial condition <span title="993" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-993">p. 993</span>of the grantor, coupled with the inadequacy of the purchase price for the property, is sufficient to establish a deed absolute on its face to be a mortgage. <i>Ellis v. Wayne Real Estate Co.</i>, 97 N.W.2d 758 (Mich. 1959).</p>
<p id="c5d65173-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ellis, supra</i>, plaintiffs initially sought a loan from defendant to save their home from forfeiture. After hurried negotiations, the plaintiffs executed a quitclaim deed to defendant and simultaneously entered into a land contract under which the plaintiffs were to repurchase the property. The defendant then satisfied a default and paid the delinquent taxes. In noting the discrepancy between the price paid by the defendant and the value of the property, the Court held that the transaction constituted a loan by defendant secured by a mortgage on the property.</p>
<p id="c5d65174-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In taking the plaintiff’s well-pleaded facts in the present case as true, there is a close parallel with <i>Ellis, supra</i>. Here the plaintiff, while in financial distress, sought help from the defendants in saving her home from foreclosure. Although plaintiff was not desirous of selling her home, she entered into a transaction which conveyed her equity worth over $30,000 for less than $4,000. While financial embarrassment of the grantor and inadequacy of consideration do not provide an infallible test, they are an indication that the parties did not consider the conveyance to be absolute. We note that the lease-back arrangement entered into by the parties effectively circumvented the right to redeem, which is designed to protect purchasers such as plaintiff in times of financial crisis. In applying these facts to the aforementioned case law, it could be found without difficulty that the subject transaction constituted a mortgage to secure a loan in the amount of defendants’ initial expenditure.</p></div></div>

Transfer as a security interest.</b> An equitable mortgage is declared when a transfer of a deed was intended merely to provide security for a loan rather than a sale of the property. The most common example is the deed of trust, which generally purports to be a conveyance from the borrower to a trustee, but actually only grants a security interest. <i>See Bain v. Metropolitan Mortgage Group, Inc.</i>, 285 P.3d 34, 38 (Wash. 2012). In other situations, however, parties attempt to circumvent mortgage law by entering into agreements that appear to convey property.</p>

When Johnson and his wife were later divorced, Johnson purchased his ex-wife’s community interest in the property with a note promising to pay over time. Johnson encountered difficulty paying all his debts, which totaled $120,000. He entered into a series of transactions with defendants F.G. Cherry and the Texas State Bank of Tatum whereby he gave a deed to the property to defendants, and they gave him a one-year lease on the land with an option to repurchase it. In return for the general warranty deed, Johnson received $120,000 from Cherry, who assumed the $38,000 remaining balance on the note to Johnson’s ex-wife. The lease provided for two semiannual payments of $12,510 each; also, Johnson could exercise his option for $132,000 and reassume the note to his ex-wife. When Johnson defaulted on his lease payments, Johnson sued defendants to cancel the deed on the grounds that it was a mortgage on his homestead prohibited by the Texas constitution.</p>

<p id="c5d6789a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recording system is intended to provide buyers of real property with the security of knowing that they will really own the property interests they are buying and to let those with other interests in property, such as a lien, understand who has priority when conflicts arise. Purchasers can use the system to find out whether the person purporting to own and sell the property indeed owns it and to ensure that neither the owner nor any of his predecessors in interest has conveyed to someone else all or part of the property interests that the seller has contracted to sell to the buyer. Lenders can also use the system to understand and give notice to others of their security interest in the property.</p>
<p id="c5d6789b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every state has a <b>recording act</b>, which provides for a central registry at each locality — often at the county level of government — where holders of real property interests can submit copies of deeds, mortgages, leases, easements, general plans, condominium declarations, judgment liens, and the like. Submitting a document to the registry is called <b>recording</b>. Although many recording-act disputes involve competing claims of outright ownership, the recording acts also help to establish the respective priorities and rights of lienholders, tenants, and others having interests in a given property.</p>
<p id="c5d6789c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law rule before the recording system was “first in time, first in right.” This rule was based on the theory that the grantor could not convey what she did not own; once the property interest had been transferred to the first grantee, the grantor had nothing left to convey to the subsequent grantee.</p>
<p id="c5d6789d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recording acts change the common law rule by defining the circumstances under which a party who has recorded his interest in the proper registry of deeds will prevail over a party who did not properly protect his interest by recording it. In general, a <i>subsequent interest holder who has no notice of a prior conveyance and who records his interest will prevail over any prior unrecorded interest.</i></p>
<p id="c5d6789e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recording acts define the property interests that may be recorded. Many statutes, for example, provide for recording leases of longer than a year. A variety of other interests may also be recorded, such as mortgages, option agreements, wills, judgments in <span title="996" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-996">p. 996</span>suits affecting property, or even a <i>lis pendens</i>, which is a filing that provides notice of pending litigation. For property interests not covered by the recording act, the common law rule of “first in time, first in right” applies.</p>
<p id="c5d6789f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to recognize that recording acts do not <i>require</i> that an instrument be recorded to be legally valid. A deed, for example, is valid against the grantor upon delivery with or without recording. When the seller delivers the deed to the buyer, the buyer becomes the lawful owner of the property — at least in the absence of conflicting claims by other grantees. The seller cannot dispossess the buyer on the ground that the seller’s deed (received from the seller’s grantor) was recorded but that the grantee had not yet recorded her deed. Similarly, a month-to-month tenant could not defend against an eviction proceeding brought by the new owner on the ground that the new owner had not recorded her deed and therefore did not own the property.</p>
<p id="c5d69eb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recording system will not protect the grantee against all risk. In many places, the buyer may have to check other parts of the court system to determine whether a lawsuit being brought affects ownership of the property, a will being probated affects the title, or a divorce proceeding being filed by the owners results in changes in property rights. Other points to check are whether the owner has declared bankruptcy and whether the tax authorities are planning to place a lien on the property to collect unpaid property taxes. Finally, the recording system will not protect a buyer against a claim of adverse possession; for this reason, the buyer must investigate to determine whether any such claims may be in the wings.</p>

<p id="c5d69eb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is impossible for a buyer to find all the interests affecting a particular parcel of land without referring to some kind of index. It also is impossible for the system to work unless the buyer can limit his search to places where conflicting deeds are likely to be found; otherwise, a search of the hundreds of thousands of documents would be endless.</p>
<p id="c5d69eb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The simplest way to index and research the title is to file information by <b>tract</b>. Given the mathematical precision with which physical descriptions of the geographic bounds of each parcel of property can be made, it is possible to create a tract system whereby the buyer can find, in one place, all interests that purport to affect the title to <span title="997" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-997">p. 997</span>that particular tract. The problem is that this is not how the recording system started, and converting to a tract system would be quite expensive. Most places do not have a tract index.</p>
<p id="c5d69eb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The typical recording office uses a <b>grantor-grantee index</b>. Separate files are kept for grantors and grantees. In the <b>grantor index</b>, all instruments are listed both alphabetically and chronologically by the grantor’s last name. In the <b>grantee index</b>, all instruments are listed both alphabetically and chronologically by the grantee’s last name. A deed from Johann Sebastian Bach to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would be indexed under the name “Bach” in the grantor index and the name “Mozart” in the grantee index. Where paper records are still being used, the recording office ordinarily compiles volumes that cover particular time periods. For example, conveyances by grantors may be divided into one volume that includes conveyances made between 1960 and 1970, a second volume for the years 1970 to 1980, and so on. More recent conveyances may be grouped by year, and very recent conveyances by month and by day. The recent conveyances are later compiled in master volumes like those of the older conveyances to simplify the search process by limiting the number of places in which one must look.</p>
<p id="c5d69eb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The index describes the bare outlines of each transaction, including the grantor and grantee, a description of the land, the type of interest conveyed, the date recorded, and the book and page numbers where a copy of the document can be found. The title searcher must then look at each complete document.</p>
<p id="c5d6c5c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose you are planning to buy a house from J.S. Bach. You want to find out if and how Bach obtained title to the property. You would therefore start in the grantee index to find who his grantor was. You start in the present in the grantee index and go backward until you find a deed to Bach conveying the property in question. You find a reference to a deed in 2007 from Frédéric Chopin. To find out how Chopin obtained his title, you look backward in the grantee index from 2007 until you find a conveyance to Chopin. You continue this process until you have gone back far enough to assure yourself that the title will be good. The practice in each locality differs on how far back to go. It may be enough to look backward for 50 or 60 years, or until the beginning of the twentieth century, or until a title can be traced to some sovereign. In most places, the practice is not to go all the way back to the beginning of the recording system but some lesser number of years. <b>Marketable title acts</b> may describe a time period beyond which interests are lost if they are not re-recorded. <i>See</i> §5.5, below. When you are done, you have a list of grantors who are predecessors in interest of Bach.</p>
<p id="c5d6c5ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose you have gone back to 1964 to find a deed from Edward Elgar to Antonín Dvořák. You now switch to the <b>grantor index</b> and go forward in time under the name of <b>each grantor</b> you have found, starting on the date that grantor acquired her interest and going forward until you find an instrument conveying that interest to a subsequent grantee. The period for each search starts when the grantor <b>acquired</b> her interest (the date of <b>execution</b> of the first deed giving title to the grantor) and stops on the date a new conveyance of that interest is <b>recorded</b>. You would thus start with Dvořák and carry forward until the point the conveyance of Dvořák’s interest is recorded, and then to the next owner, and so forth. It is important to note that the search in <span title="998" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-998">p. 998</span>the grantor index starts at the date of <b>execution</b> rather than at the date of <b>recording</b>.

<p id="c5d71401-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recording acts generally protect <b>bona fide purchasers</b>. In notice and race-notice jurisdictions, this requires that an interest holder purchases in good faith without notice of a conflicting interest. We will consider notice in the next section, but conflicts also often arise with respect to a second requirement for bona fide purchaser status, which is that the interest holder must have paid value for her interest. Courts generally agree that something more than nominal value is required to be considered a “purchaser,” although it need not be the property’s full market value. <i>Anderson v. Anderson</i>, 435 N.W.2d 687 (N.D. 1987). This requirement of payment for value excludes donees, heirs, and devisees from the protections of the recording system. Thus, if a donor gives the same property as a gift to two different people, the first donee wins under the common law first-in-time rule.</p>
<p id="c5d71402-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But what about a purchaser who has only made a down payment, but not yet paid the full purchase price when a conflicting interest is recorded? Or a purchaser under an installment land contract who has paid half the value of the property, but still owes the remaining half? Can they claim the protection of the recording acts? The outcome partly depends on whether the subsequent purchaser would ordinarily be expected to search the records. An ordinary purchaser would normally search title prior to closing, and courts will generally not accord purchaser status in the context of executory contracts. However, a purchaser in a long-term installment contract might not. Some courts afford subsequent purchasers partial protection, giving them a claim against the prior purchaser but only for the value they paid.</p>
<p id="c5d71403-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When parties other than actual purchasers seek to invoke the recording acts to protect their priority, the question of value can be complicated. For example, parties who win a lawsuit are entitled to record the judgment as a lien against the losing party’s property. If the losing party has actually conveyed the property in an unrecorded transfer, can the judgment creditor claim priority against the prior purchaser who failed to record, even though winning a lawsuit is not paying value? Some recording acts explicitly protect judgment creditors in this situation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.J. Stat. §46:26A-12(c). Where the recording act is silent, however, judgment credits are generally not able to prevail, either because they are only entitled to a lien against property that a defendant actually owns or because the recording act is interpreted to exclude them from the definition of “purchaser.” William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §11.10, at 878-879 (3d ed. 2000).</p>

Lowery occupied land in the Chitna Recording District on October 10, 1964 for purposes of obtaining Federal patent. Lowery filed a location notice on February 24, 1965, and made his application to purchase on June 6, 1967 with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). On March 7, 1968, the BLM field examiner’s report was filed which recommended that patent issue to Lowery. On October 7, 1969, a request for survey was made by the United States Government. On January 3, 1970, Lowery issued a document entitled “Quitclaim Deed” to the Horvaths; Horvath recorded the deed on January 5, 1970 in the Chitna Recording District. Horvath testified that when he bought the land from Lowery, he knew patent and title were still in the United States Government, but he did not rerecord his interest after patent had passed to Lowery.</p>

In this case, Lowery executed his conveyance to the Horvaths after the BLM field report had recommended patent.</p>
<p id="c5d73b1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first question this court must consider is whether Lowery had an interest to convey at the time of his transfer to the Horvaths.</p>

Since a “quitclaim” only transfers the interest of the grantor, the question is whether a “quitclaim” deed itself puts a purchaser on constructive notice. Although the authorities are in conflict over this issue, the clear weight of authority is that a quitclaim grantee can be protected by the recording system, assuming, of course, the grantee purchased for valuable consideration and did not otherwise have actual or constructive knowledge as defined by the recording laws. We choose to follow the majority rule and hold that a quitclaim grantee is not precluded from attaining the status of an “innocent purchaser.”</p>
<p id="c5d73b26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the Horvaths recorded their interest from Lowery prior to the time the Sabos recorded their interest. Thus, the issue is whether the Sabos are charged with constructive knowledge because of the Horvaths’ prior recordation. Horvath is correct in his assertion that in the usual case a prior recorded deed serves as constructive notice pursuant to Alaska Stat. §34.15.290, and thus precludes a subsequent recordation from taking precedence. Here, however, the Sabos argue that because Horvath recorded his deed prior to Lowery having obtained patent, they were not given constructive notice by the recording system. They contend that since Horvaths’ recordation was outside the chain of title, the recording should be regarded as a “wild deed.”</p>
<p id="c5d73b27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is an axiom of hornbook law that a purchaser has notice only of recorded instruments that are within his “chain of title.” If a grantor (Lowery) transfers prior to obtaining title, and the grantee (Horvath) records prior to title passing, a second grantee who diligently examines all conveyances under the grantor’s name from the date that the grantor had secured title would not discover the prior conveyance. The rule in most jurisdictions which have adopted a grantor-grantee index system of recording is that a “wild deed” does not serve as constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser who duly records.</p>
<p id="c5d73b28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alaska’s recording system utilizes a “grantor-grantee” index. Had Sabo searched title under both grantor’s and grantee’s names but limited his search to the chain of title subsequent to patent, he would not be chargeable with discovery of the pre-patent transfer to Horvath.</p>

<p id="c5d7623c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On one hand, we could require Sabo to check beyond the chain of title to look for pretitle conveyances. While in this particular case the burden may not have been great, as a general rule, requiring title checks beyond the chain of title could add a significant burden as well as uncertainty to real estate purchases. To a certain extent, requiring title searches of records prior to the date of a grantor acquired title would thus defeat the purposes of the recording system. The records as to each grantor in the chain of title would theoretically have to be checked back to the later of the grantor’s date of birth or the date when records were first retained.</p>
<p id="c5d7623d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, we could require Horvath to rerecord his interest in the land once title passes, that is, after patent had issued to Lowery. As a general rule, rerecording an interest once title passes is less of a burden than requiring property purchasers to check indefinitely beyond the chain of title.</p>

Since the Sabos’ interest is the first duly recorded interest and was recorded without actual or constructive knowledge of the prior deed, we hold that the Sabos’ interest must prevail.</p>

<p id="c5d76242-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Types of notice.</b> In both notice and race-notice jurisdictions, only subsequent purchasers without notice of the earlier conveyance can prevail over the earlier grantee. <b>Actual notice</b>, where a party knows about an earlier instrument, obviously violates this condition. But the import of the recording system is that <b>constructive notice</b> will also deprive a subsequent purchaser of protection. Constructive notice exists when the grantee, by conducting a reasonable title search, would have discovered the earlier conveyance. This holds true whether or not the grantee actually searched the records.</p>
<p id="c5d76243-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Complications arise if a deed is recorded incorrectly or was not entitled to be recorded in the first place. For example, if an instrument is required to be witnessed before a notary public or court officer, recording an instrument that lacks such an attestation may not give constructive notice to subsequent interest holders. <i>U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Gordon</i>, 709 S.E.2d 258, 261 (Ga. 2012). <i>But cf. Regions Bank v. Deluca</i>, 97 So. 3d 879 (Fla. App. Ct. 2012) (because errors in a mortgage’s property description could be corrected by examining the entire document, the document still imparted constructive notice).</p>
<p id="c5d76244-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, a clerical error in <i>indexing</i> the deed, which is important because it is only through the index that a party may find certain interests, may result in a finding that a later purchaser was not on constructive notice of the prior conveyance. <i>Greenpoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. v. Schlossberg</i>, 888 A.2d 297 (Md. 2005). Problems may also arise if a subsequent conveyance occurs after the deed is filed with the registry office but before it is indexed. <i>Compare NYCTL 1998-1 Trust &amp; the Bank of N.Y. v. Ibrahiem,</i> 15 Misc. 3d 294 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 2007) (deed is considered recorded when delivered to registry office), <i>with Dyar v. Martinez</i>, 54 Cal. Rptr. 3d 907 (Ct. App. 2007) (unindexed <i>lis pendens</i> did not impart constructive notice).</p>
<p id="c5d76245-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another common problem involves misspelled names in documents. If a purchaser is searching for records relating to J.S. Bach, and there is a mortgage recorded under the name J.S. Back, will that document give constructive notice? A doctrine known as <i>idem sonans</i> governs this question and generally looks to whether similar names sound alike or common usage otherwise associates them.</p>
<p id="c5d76246-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1004" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1004">p. 1004</span>What about electronic recording systems, which are easier to search than paper records? Should the standard for which instruments give constructive notice then change? <i>See First Citizens National Bank v. Sherwood</i>, 879 A.2d 178 (Pa. 2005) (finding constructive notice because an electronic search would have revealed a mortgage improperly indexed under the name of the beneficiary of a trust rather than the trustee); <i>see also</i> William A. Reppy, Jr., <i>Some Issues Raised by Alaska’s Recording Act</i>, 27 Alaska L. Rev. 195, 210 (2010) (arguing that because Alaska’s title records have now been digitized and can be searched on-line, <i>Sabo</i> should be overruled).</p>
<p id="c5d78957-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Inquiry notice</b> is a kind of constructive notice. Under this theory, notice will be imputed if the subsequent purchaser would have discovered the conveyance had she acted reasonably to investigate facts at her disposal. If the property is being occupied by someone other than the grantor, for example, a purchaser is on inquiry notice that a prior claim may be hanging around. Inquiry notice will also exist if a recorded instrument refers to another property interest, such as a lease, a life estate, a condominium declaration, or a general plan. Inquiry notice can even arise from an oral statement made by the earlier interest holder. <i>Swanson v. Swanson</i>, 796 N.W.2d 614 (N.D. 2011) (statement declaring a conflicting property interest sufficient to put subsequent purchasers on notice that they should at least investigate basis for the statement).</p>
<p id="c5d78958-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Estoppel by deed.</b> <i>Sabo v. Horvath</i> concerns a dispute between two grantees. What would have happened if the grantor, Lowery, had claimed ownership of the property as against the first grantees, the Horvaths, when the grantor finally received the patent from the government? The doctrine of <b>estoppel by deed</b> would enable the grantees to prevail. <i>Ackerman v. Abbott</i>, 978 A.2d 1250 (D.C. 2009). If a grantor purports to convey a property interest she does not own to a grantee, and the grantor subsequently comes to own the property interest by receiving the deed, ownership is automatically vested in the grantee. Thus, if <i>O</i> purports to convey property to <i>A</i>, but <i>O</i> does not own the property, <i>A</i> gets nothing; one can convey only what one owns. However, if <i>O</i> later obtains title to the property from <i>B</i>, the doctrine of estoppel by deed vests title immediately in <i>A. O</i> is estopped from asserting ownership rights as against <i>A</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11618_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11618_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">37</a></span></p>
<p id="c5d7895a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Wild deeds.</b> <i>Sabo v. Horvath</i> deals with a particular version of the more general problem of deeds outside the <b>chain of title</b>, the linked documents that make up a record of a property’s ownership. This problem arises because it is impractical to require all buyers to search every one of the hundreds of thousands of deeds in the entire recording index. To make the search manageable, customary practice limits the search to the period between the date the grantor obtained his deed and the date a deed out from that grantor was recorded. Because it is sometimes possible that a predecessor in interest made a conveyance outside that period — either before or <span title="1005" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1005">p. 1005</span>after — and because some buyers do not diligently record their interest, it is possible that some deeds relating to the property in question will not be found. Some deeds are recorded <i>too early</i> to appear in the chain of title (before a grantor obtained title to the property); others are recorded <i>too late</i> to be discovered (after a deed from that grantor was recorded).</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5d7895b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Recorded too early.</b> <i>O</i> conveys property to <i>A</i> that <i>O</i> does not own. <i>A</i> records the deed. <i>B</i>, the true owner, conveys the property to <i>O</i>. At this point, the property transfers automatically to <i>A</i> under the doctrine of estoppel by deed. However, unbeknownst to <i>A</i>, <i>O</i> then conveys title to <i>X</i>, a bona fide purchaser who has no knowledge of the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>. The majority of states will handle the situation just as the Alaska Supreme Court did. In these states, the first purchaser, <i>A</i>, would prevail in a contest between herself and the grantor, <i>O</i>. However, <i>X</i>, the second purchaser without notice of the earlier conveyance to <i>A</i>, would prevail in a contest with the first purchaser, <i>A</i>. This result obtains because <i>X</i> is required to search the records only so far back as the date when her grantor, <i>O</i>, acquired her interest; since <i>O</i> had purported to convey the interest to <i>A before O</i> obtained her title from <i>B</i>, <i>X</i> would not be charged with notice of the conveyance to <i>A</i>. This result, of course, protects the interests of the second bona fide purchaser, <i>X</i>, at the expense of the earlier bona fide purchaser, <i>A</i>, perhaps on the ground that <i>A</i> acted negligently in purchasing property from someone who did not in fact possess the right to convey it.</p>
<p id="c5d7895c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states require a more extended search on the part of the subsequent grantee; in these states, the doctrine of estoppel by deed is extended to apply to disputes not only between the grantor and the first grantee but between the first grantee and subsequent grantees. Under this theory, when the grantor gets the deed to the property already conveyed to the first grantee, title automatically passes to the first grantee, leaving the grantor nothing to convey to the subsequent purchaser.</p>
<p id="c5d7895d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Recorded too late.</b> <i>O</i> conveys to <i>A</i>, who does not record. <i>A</i> conveys to <i>B</i>, who records. <i>O</i> then conveys to <i>Z</i>, a bona fide purchaser without notice of the earlier conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>. <i>B</i> then gets ahold of the deed from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> and records it. In a contest between <i>B</i> and <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i> would prevail because the deed from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> was recorded too late. When <i>Z</i> bought the property, the deed from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> had already been recorded, but since <i>A</i> had not yet recorded the deed from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>, there is no way that <i>Z</i> could have found it. Neither <i>A</i> nor <i>B</i> was in <i>O</i>’s chain of title at the time <i>Z</i> purchased, so <i>Z</i> had no way to learn of the conveyance to <i>B</i>.</p>
<p id="c5d7b06e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here is a second example. <i>O</i> conveys to <i>A</i>, who does not record. <i>O</i> then conveys to <i>X</i>, who has notice of the earlier conveyance to <i>A</i>. <i>X</i> records her deed; then <i>A</i> records her deed. <i>X</i> conveys to <i>Z</i>, who has no notice of the earlier conveyance to <i>A</i>. In a contest between <i>A</i> and <i>Z</i>, <i>Z</i> would prevail because the deed from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> was recorded too late. Can you see why?</p>

<p id="c5d7b06f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Shelter doctrine.</b> The shelter doctrine allows a bona fide purchaser to convey property to a third party even if the third party is on notice of an earlier conveyance. <span title="1006" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1006">p. 1006</span>For example, <i>O</i> conveys to <i>A</i>, who does not record. <i>O</i> then conveys to <i>X</i>, a bona fide purchaser without notice of the conveyance to <i>A</i>; <i>X</i> records. Because <i>X</i> had no notice of the earlier conveyance to <i>A</i>, and because <i>X</i> recorded first, <i>X</i> would prevail over <i>A</i> in either a notice jurisdiction or a race-notice jurisdiction. <i>X</i> then wants to convey to <i>C</i>, but <i>C</i> has notice of the earlier conveyance to from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>. The <b>shelter doctrine</b> allows <i>X</i> to convey the property to <i>C</i>, despite <i>C</i>’s knowledge of the earlier conveyance. This doctrine allows bona fide purchasers to convey title even if they subsequently find out, after they buy the property, of the earlier conveyance. The bona fide purchaser who records first obtains full rights in the property over the earlier buyer who did not record. Any other rule would restrict the bona fide purchaser’s ability to transfer the property.</p>
<p id="c5d7b070-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Favored position of bona fide purchasers.</b> In <i>Matter of Edwards</i>, 962 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1992), the bona fide purchaser of property at a bankruptcy sale obtained title free and clear of a preexisting mortgage because the debtor who declared bankruptcy gave the court an old address for the mortgagee’s lawyer; the mortgagee had listed its correct address, but the court clerk did not notice the discrepancy, so the mortgagee-lender was not notified of the bankruptcy sale of the property. Judge Richard Posner commented on the policies behind the protection of bona fide purchasers: “If purchasers at judicially approved sales of property of a bankrupt estate, and their lenders, cannot rely on the deed that they receive at the [bankruptcy] sale, it will be difficult to liquidate bankrupt estates at positive prices.” <i>Id.</i> at 643. Yet Posner noted the unfairness of this procedure to the innocent owner:</p>

<p id="c5d825c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property owners may take out more than one mortgage on their property. In such cases, the first mortgage has priority over later mortgages, at least if the first mortgage is recorded or the second mortgagee otherwise has notice of it. This means that if the borrower defaults on payments and the property is sold through foreclosure, the proceeds are paid to the first mortgagee; if there are assets left, they go to pay off the <span title="1008" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1008">p. 1008</span>second mortgage, and so on down the priority list. But what happens if a borrower refinances a particular loan? In <i>Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. First National Bank of Steamboat Springs,</i> 144 P.3d 1224 (Wyo. 2006), an owner took out a third mortgage for the purpose of paying off the first mortgage. When the borrower defaulted on the second mortgage, the court had to determine whether the second mortgagee or the third mortgagee had priority; who would get paid first if the foreclosure sale did not yield enough proceeds to pay off both mortgages? The court applied the recording act principle of “first in time, first in right.” Since the third mortgage was not only given after the second mortgage, but also recorded afterward (with notice of the second mortgage), the court held that the second mortgagee should be paid off first.</p>
<p id="c5d825c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opposite result was reached in <i>Columbia Community Bank v. Newman Park, LLC</i>, 304 P.3d 472 (Wash. 2013), because the court applied the doctrine of <b>equitable subrogation</b><i>.</i> Under that doctrine, someone who assumes the rights or obligations of another steps into their shoes and assumes whatever rights or obligations they had to the extent necessary to prevent unjust enrichment. Because second mortgagees know that their mortgages are subordinate to first mortgages, they cannot not complain if the identity of the first mortgagee changes by assignment. If the refinancing of the loan and the assignment of the mortgagee’s rights to a third party would mean that the second mortgage would move up and have priority over the first mortgagee, this would amount to a windfall neither earned nor deserved by the second mortgage and would constitute unjust enrichment. The <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgages)</i> §7.6 (1997) adopts this position on the ground that it serves the interests of homeowners by making refinancing cheaper and more widely available and does not hurt the interests of anyone else; the <i>Restatement</i> found it not to conflict with the spirit (if not the letter) of the state recording statute.</p>

<p id="c5d84ce0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant Jerry Brock (“Brock”) commenced this action against his ex-wife, Joyce Brock (“Joyce”), and appellee Yale Mortgage Corporation (“Yale”) to, among other things, quiet title in the Suwanee residence he and Joyce once shared (the “property”); set aside a forged quitclaim deed purporting to transfer Brock’s interest in the property to Joyce; and set aside a subsequent deed to secure debt Joyce executed in Yale’s favor or limit the deed to a one-half undivided interest in the property.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Brocks purchased the property jointly in 1987, financing the transaction with a loan from First Railroad Mortgage Company. In connection with the loan, the Brocks executed a security deed and promissory note in the amount of $56,000 in the lender’s favor. The Brocks did not have a joint bank account. Brock maintained a checking account and gave his wife money each month to make the loan payment, but she did not <span title="1009" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1009">p. 1009</span>always use the funds for that purpose. As a result, [the Brocks’ loan went into default in 1996, but Joyce] borrowed money from a friend to bring the loan current and stop the foreclosure process. In August 2000, Joyce received a second notice of foreclosure sale [but she worked out a payment plan with the lender.]</p>
<p id="c5d84ce2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 2001, Joyce received a third notice of foreclosure sale after defaulting under the payment plan. Once again, Joyce did not inform Brock of the foreclosure sale notice, but instead contacted Jerri Browning of mortgage broker Capital Lending Group (“Capital”), about obtaining a new loan. Browning assisted Joyce in procuring a loan from Yale. Browning advised Joyce that in order to secure a loan in her name only, Brock would need to convey his interest in the property to her. At Browning’s suggestion, Joyce requested a blank quitclaim deed from Yale’s closing attorney, who faxed the deed to her. At the February 2001 loan closing, Joyce presented an executed, unrecorded quitclaim deed by which Brock purportedly transferred his interest in the property to her. Yale does not dispute that Brock’s signature on the quitclaim deed is forged. Yale loaned Joyce $60,000, of which $15,460 was used to satisfy the Brocks’ [original mortgage]. Joyce received $38,085.44 in cash at closing. Joyce executed a promissory note and deed to secure debt in Yale’s favor.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 2004, Brock discovered that his wife had spent over $200,000 from his checking account without his knowledge. He filed for divorce shortly thereafter. Around the same time, Brock learned about the 2001 foreclosure proceedings, the forged quitclaim deed, and the Yale loan. According to Brock, he called Yale after learning of the Yale loan, but the representative he spoke with told him she did not have to speak with him and terminated the call. In August 2004, the Brocks executed a settlement agreement in their divorce proceedings in which Joyce transferred “any and all of her rights, title and interest [in the property], whether legal or equitable” to her husband. In January 2005, Brock commenced this action.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Georgia Code §23-3-40] provides that a deed may be cancelled on grounds of forgery. If the forged quitclaim deed is set aside here, however, that would not invalidate the subsequent security deed in its entirety. One holding property with another person as tenants in common cannot convey or affect that person’s interest without his or her consent. Yet, a tenant in common may encumber or convey his or her own interest in property without the consent of other cotenants. Thus, if a tenant in common purports to convey an interest in the entire property, the deed will affect his or her interest although non-consenting cotenants will not be bound. It is undisputed that the Brocks acquired the property as tenants in common under a 1987 warranty deed transferring the property to both of them as grantees. Accordingly, the security deed under which Joyce purported to convey legal title to the entire property to Yale, at a minimum, effectively vested Yale with a security interest in the one-half undivided interest in the property Joyce indisputably held and was free to convey.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a general rule, “[a] bona fide purchaser for value is protected against outstanding interests in land of which the purchaser has no notice.” <i>Farris v. Nationsbanc Mortg. Corp.</i>, 493 S.E.2d 143, 145 (1997); [Georgia Code §§23-1-19, 23-1-20]. We have long held that “[a] grantee in a security deed who acts in good faith stands in the attitude of a bona fide purchaser, and is entitled to the same protection.” <i>Roop Grocery <span title="1010" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1010">p. 1010</span>Co. v. Gentry</i>, 25 S.E.2d 705, 711 (1943). But we have also long recognized that a forged deed is a nullity and vests no title in a grantee. As such, even a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of a forgery cannot acquire good title from a grantee in a forged deed, or those holding under such a grantee, because the grantee has no title to convey. [Accordingly,] Yale would not acquire a valid security interest in the entire property simply by proving its status as a bona fide purchaser for value.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Georgia law, a forged signature is nonetheless binding if ratified by the person whose name was signed. “A ratification may be express or implied from the acts or silence of the principal.” [Georgia Code] §10-6-52. Whether ratification occurs is usually a fact question for the jury.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yale argues, and the trial court apparently agreed, that Brock ratified “the subject loan agreement” under the divorce settlement agreement. The correct focus of the analysis, however, is whether Brock ratified the forged quitclaim deed such that his wife’s security deed effectively conveyed a security interest in the entire property to Yale. The ratification doctrine does not apply to the loan agreement or security deed because Joyce did not purport to enter into them in Brock’s name or under authority from him.</p>
<p id="c5d84ce8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yale principally relies on the following language in the settlement agreement, which appears immediately after Joyce’s agreement to transfer her interest in the property to him:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5d84ce9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties acknowledge that [Joyce] has incurred a $50,000 liability on the property. The parties will seek to have said debt forgiven. If the parties are unsuccessful in having the debt forgiven, then [Joyce] shall be responsible for the repayment of said debt. [Joyce] shall further indemnify and hold [Brock] harmless from any and all liability, loss, damage, claim, demand, cost or judgment, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising out of [Joyce’s] failure to pay said debt.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5d84cea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In acknowledging that Joyce incurred a “liability on the property,” the settlement agreement appears to assume the existence of a valid encumbrance on the property but does not specify its nature. Significantly, the settlement agreement does not clarify whether the parties believed that the Yale debt encumbered the entire property or only Joyce’s interest. To the extent that Brock merely acknowledged that his wife encumbered her share of the property, that acknowledgment would not evidence an election to treat the forged quitclaim deed as valid. <i>See Restatement (Third) of Agency</i> §4.01 cmt. b (2006) (“The act of ratification consists of an externally observable manifestation of assent to be bound by the prior act of another person.”). Further, if Brock believed that the property interest he was accepting from his wife was encumbered, he might have wanted to clarify that he was not personally liable for the debt and to bargain for protection from any loss he might incur as the result of the debt. Given the ambiguity in the settlement agreement arising from the phrase “liability on the property,” a factual issue exists regarding the intention of the parties, which should be determined in light of all the relevant evidence.</p>
<p id="c5d873fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court also concluded that ratification occurred by virtue of the fact that a portion of the Yale loan proceeds paid off the balance of $15,460 on the [original] <span title="1011" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1011">p. 1011</span>note. Ratification occurs if a principal, with full knowledge of all the material facts, accepts the benefits of an unauthorized act, or retains such benefits after discovering the material facts. For example, in [<i>Ferguson v. Golf Course Consultants</i>, 252 S.E.2d 907 (Ga. 1979),] we held that the plaintiff ratified and could not set aside a warranty deed to which his business partner signed the plaintiff’s name without the plaintiff’s knowledge or authority when the plaintiff knowingly received and spent proceeds the partner earned from the conveyance. In concluding that “[the plaintiff] cannot accept the proceeds of the sale, keep them, use them, decline to tender them back, and then expect a court of equity to set aside the deed from which he derived a profit,” <i>id</i>. [at 908], we relied, inter alia, on prior precedent that a grantor seeking to cancel a deed in equity must first restore or tender to the grantee any consideration received under the deed.</p>
<p id="c5d873fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Brock received nothing of value under the forged quitclaim deed. To the extent he allegedly benefitted incidentally from the payoff of the prior loan in a transaction “once removed” from the unauthorized forged quitclaim deed, he was not required to tender such benefit to Yale as a precondition to equitable relief or to avoid ratification.</p>
<p id="c5d873fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="c5d87403-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mary V. Nowling Elliott, now deceased, brought an action seeking the cancellation of a deed. The trial court found that Mrs. Elliott, a simple, elderly woman who could neither read nor write, owned an undivided one-fifth interest in the minerals underlying a seventy-five acre tract of land. In January 1972 B.G. Russell offered to buy her entire interest, but she refused. She orally agreed to sell Mr. Russell two of the thirteen to fifteen mineral acres she owned for $3300.00. The trial court found further: Defendant Russell prepared the mineral deed, and instead of the two acres of minerals agreed upon, fraudulently substituted the clause: “one-fifth (1/5) interest in and to all the oil, gas, and other minerals” and then inserted the legal description of the 75 acres. Obviously, one-fifth of 75 acres is 15 acres, a deal that the Plaintiff had consistently refused to make.</p>
<p id="c5d87404-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Elliott lived with her daughter, who could read, write, and understand simple things. The daughter looked over the instrument Russell had prepared. Although she did not understand the deed, she advised Mrs. Elliott that she guessed it was all right.</p>
<p id="c5d87405-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several days later, Russell contacted Mrs. Elliott and told her that he had made a mistake in drawing up the deed. He offered to pay her $15,000 for the interest that had been conveyed. She refused and insisted on a reconveyance of that portion of the interest which she had not intended to sell. “[O]n February 16, 1972, Russell and his wife purported to reconvey to Plaintiff the thirteen seventy-fifths (13/75ths) interest of which she had been defrauded.” On February 11, 1972, however, Russell conveyed a <span title="1012" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1012">p. 1012</span>substantial portion of the same mineral rights to C.P. McClelland, who later conveyed to respondents Messrs. Love, Harris, and Carpenter. Mrs. Elliott remained ignorant of the Russell-McClelland and subsequent transactions until October 1973 when she wanted to sell more of her mineral rights and a title search revealed them. She sued for cancellation of the deed.</p>
<p id="c5d87406-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A bona fide purchaser has the right to rely on the record title of his grantor, but this protection extends only to those purchasing a legal title. The recording of a void or forged deed is legally insufficient to create a legal title, and affords no protection to those claiming under it.</p>
<p id="c5d87407-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s findings of fact that the grantee committed fraud and that the grantor was not negligent do not compel the conclusion that there was such an alteration of documents as to be the equivalent of a forgery. The grantor knew that she was executing and delivering a deed of mineral rights. The law charged her with the responsibility of informing herself as to the legal effect of the document she was signing.</p>
<p id="c5d89b18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where all the essential legal requisites of a deed are present, it conveys legal title. Fraud in the inducement renders such a legally effective deed voidable in equity. We hold that the district court was correct in holding that the deed was merely voidable, and that it conveyed a legal title to the grantee.</p>
<p id="c5d89b19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of its holding that the deed was void, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Therefore there were no findings of fact on the issue of the good faith of the purchasers from McClelland. While the district court was correct in holding the deed voidable rather than void, there was no basis for it to conclude from the record that the defendants were bona fide purchasers. The case should be remanded for trial of this factual issue.</p></div></div>

<p id="c5d89b1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Void or voidable?</b> When a deed has been obtained by fraud or forgery, it is classified as either void or voidable. If no further conveyances are made, a court will set aside the deed on the true owner’s request. The difficult issue is determining what happens if the property has been conveyed to a bona fide purchaser, one who paid value and had no notice of the fraud or forgery. If the deed is <b>void</b>, then it conveys no title to the grantee and the grantee has no power to convey title to another; the bona fide purchaser is therefore not protected. If, however, the deed is merely <b>voidable</b> by the true owner, who was the victim of the foul play, then a subsequent bona fide purchaser will be able to obtain good title. In that case, the victim’s sole remedy will be a suit for damages for fraud or conversion against the wrongdoer.</p>
<p id="c5d89b1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Forgery.</b> Forged deeds are absolutely void and therefore transfer no interest to the grantee; nor can they be the basis of a transfer from the grantee to a subsequent bona fide purchaser even though that purchaser has no knowledge of the forgery. Thus, a bona fide purchaser who buys in reliance on the record title, which appears good, will obtain nothing. <i>In re Sutter</i>, 665 F.3d 722, 728 (6th Cir. 2012); <i>Special Property VI v. Woodruff</i>, 730 N.W.2d 753, 756 (Mich. Ct. App. 2007); <i>First National Bank in Albuquerque v. Enriquez</i>, 634 P.2d 1266, 1268 (N.M. 1981). This universally recognized <span title="1013" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1013">p. 1013</span>rule appears to conflict with the policies underlying the recording system, which is intended to give a bona fide purchaser assurance that she receives what she pays for and that the seller has a right to convey the property. Why do you suppose courts refuse to protect bona fide purchasers from forged deeds?</p>
<p id="c5d89b1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Brock v. Yale Mortgage Corp.</i>, the court also considered whether Jerry Brock had <b>ratified</b> the forged deed. Ratification, as well as the equitable defenses of waiver and estoppel, can validate a void deed; ratification generally involves a party knowingly accepting the action of the forger and indicating intent to adopt the otherwise unauthorized deed. <i>See Erier v. Creative Finance &amp; Investments, L.L.C.</i>, 203 P.3d 744, 750-752 (Mont. 2009).</p>
<p id="c5d89b1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Fraud.</b> In contrast to forged deeds, deeds obtained through fraud are generally voidable rather than void. They are voidable by the defrauded victim — the one who was fraudulently induced to transfer the property. Once the property passes to a bona fide purchaser without notice of the fraud, however, the conveyance can no longer be rescinded. <i>Fallon v. Triangle Management</i>, 215 Cal. Rptr. 748 (Ct. App. 1985). The reason for this distinction has been explained by a Maryland court as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5d89b20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A deed obtained through fraud, deceit or trickery is voidable as between the parties thereto, but not as to a bona fide purchaser. A forged deed, on the other hand, is void ab initio.</p>
<p id="c5d89b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] forger can pass no better title than he has. Consequently, there can be no bona fide holder of title under a forged deed. A forged deed, unlike one procured by fraud, deceit or trickery is void from its inception. The distinction between a deed obtained by fraud and one that has been forged is readily apparent. In a fraudulent deed an innocent purchaser is protected because the fraud practiced upon the signatory to such a deed is brought into play, at least in part, by some act or omission on the part of the person upon whom the fraud is perpetrated. He has helped in some degree to set into motion the very fraud about which he later complains. A forged deed, on the other hand, does not necessarily involve any action on the part of the person against whom the forgery is committed.</p>
</div>

Courts seem to suggest that if the grantor has negligently participated in creating the problem, she is estopped from claiming the property from a bona fide purchaser.</p>
<p id="c5d89b23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the fraud/forgery distinction, the courts have often had to contend with behavior that could be described as either forgery or fraud. For example, in <i>Harding v. Ja Laur</i>,<i> supra</i>, plaintiff Lucille M. Harding claimed that defendant Ja Laur induced her to sign a blank page that she was told would be used merely to straighten out a boundary line but that was later affixed to a deed transferring a small portion of land that she owned. Defendant Ja Laur had wanted the land because it was contiguous to land it owned and was extremely valuable because it provided access to that land. On one hand, the court could have held that the case involved fraud rather than forgery because Ms. Harding had been induced to sign on the basis of a false impression of the document. On the other hand, the court could characterize the affixing of the signature to another legal document as a forgery since it involved an alteration of her signature, <i>id.</i> at 135-136:</p>

<p id="c5d8c238-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several other statutory regimes operate in conjunction with the recording acts to determine the state of title for any given property. Statutes of limitation and adverse possession are a common way in which disputes over title are resolved, at least where physical possession is an issue. <i>See</i> Chapter 5, §1.1. This makes understanding the precise state of title from the public record more complicated.</p>
<p id="c5d8c239-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A seemingly more bright-line approach can be found in <b>marketable title acts</b>, which exist in 18 states. 11<i> Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §92.06. These acts try to solve the problem of defining how far back one must search in the grantor-grantee index by limiting searches to a reasonable period, often 30 to 40 years. When a person has a record title for the designated period of time, all prior claims or interests are extinguished. To preserve prior claims, owners must <b>re-record</b> their interest or file a <b>notice of claim</b> every 30 years or so after the recording of their initial deed. Some property interests are exempt from this requirement, including easements that are observable by physical inspection and mineral rights, federal and state interests, and, in some states, remainders, reversions, rights of entry, possibilities of reverter, and restrictive covenants. These various exceptions have the effect of reducing the utility of the marketable title acts as a method of reducing the cost of searching title, but serve other interests.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11AA7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11AA7_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">38</a></span></p>

<p id="c5d8c23d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Originally, lawyers conducted the title searches required to determine the state of a property’s title, either for a conveyance or for establishing a lender’s lien priority. In some areas, this is still the case. In many places, however, title insurance companies have emerged to fulfill this function. Most lenders require the purchaser to buy title insurance as a condition for getting a mortgage loan. Even when insurance is not required, many purchasers will obtain it to protect their interests. It has therefore become standard practice for title companies to perform title searches.</p>
<p id="c5d8c23e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1015" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1015">p. 1015</span>Title companies can be liable for negligently performing title searches, independent of any claims under a title insurance policy, although many courts still refuse to identify such a duty. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>, <i>100 Investment LP v. Columbia Town Center Title Co.</i>, 60 A.3d 1 (Md. 2013) (title companies owed a duty of care to their customer in preparing a title commitment) <i>with Walker Rogge, Inc. v. Chelsea Title &amp; Guaranty Co.</i>, 562 A.2d 208 (N.J. 1989) (limiting a title company’s liability to the insurance policy and barring tort liability for negligence in searching records).</p>
<p id="c5d8c23f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A title company will typically issue a title commitment, also known as a title binder, which indicates that the company will insure a given beneficiary under specified conditions, such as certain affidavits being provided or liens being removed. The title commitment also typically contains detailed information about the state of title, including encumbrances and defects. Title companies generally issue the actual title policy after closing. Title insurance policies provided to owners explain that the company promises, in return for a premium, to insure the purchaser against losses occasioned by defects in title to the property, defining the kinds of defects they cover and specifying exceptions to coverage. Similarly, lender policies insure a specified lien priority. The insurance company may also promise to pay the costs of defending the title through litigation.</p>
<p id="c5d8c240-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disputes may arise between a title insurance companies and the holder of the insurance over the interpretation of the insurance contract. These disputes involve issues such as the kinds of defects in title that are covered by the contract and the nature of exclusions and exceptions. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Cox v. Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co.</i>, 59 A.3d 1280 (Me. 2013); <i>Hart v. Ticor Title Insurance Co</i>., 272 P.3d 1215 (Haw. 2012). They can also involve an insurer’s obligation to defend the insured against lawsuits based on matters covered by title insurance. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Deutsche Bank National Association v. First American Title Insurance Co.</i>, 465 Mass. 741 (2013) (title insurer not obligated to defend lender against claim seeking to have a note and mortgage rescinded because of predatory lending).</p>

<p id="c5d8e953-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some jurisdictions have partially adopted a <b>title registration system</b>, or “Torrens system,” named after Sir Robert Torrens, an Irish immigrant in Australia who established the first registration system there in 1858. It has never caught on broadly in the United States, and is available only in ten states. 14-83 <i>Powell on Real Property</i> §83.01[3]. An owner who wishes to register his land must file a petition for a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding that is similar to an action to quiet title. Notice must be given to all persons having any interest in the land. The result of the adjudication is a certificate of registration or title. The official certificate of title states the identity of the property owner and includes descriptions of all encumbrances (easements, covenants, liens, mortgages, leases, and the like) affecting the title. The certificate is conclusive as to the title and is filed in the registrar’s office. If an owner transfers his land, the deed must be brought to the registry and a new certificate issued. A title examiner <span title="1016" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1016">p. 1016</span>for a purchaser need only examine the current certificate of title and the documents referred to in the list of encumbrances on the certificate.</p>
<p id="c5d8e954-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this system simplifies title problems immensely, it is expensive to institute. Either the state would have to pay for a judicial proceeding to produce a certificate of title for every parcel in the state or the individual owner would have to bear the cost, which may amount to hundreds of dollars. Because the states that have adopted it have allowed owners to register their land on a voluntary basis, most land is still unregistered and governed by the old grantor-grantee record system.</p>
<p id="c5d8e955-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, some factors militate against the absolute conclusiveness that is supposed to attach to the title. What happens, for example, if it turns out that an earlier deed was forged? If the current certificate of title is absolutely conclusive — if it cannot be challenged — then an innocent person may lose the property because of the forgery. Note, however, that forgeries are rare because the “registry will not issue a new certificate in the ordinary course of business unless the old owner’s duplicate is presented for cancellation. In addition, the registries in some states maintain files of signature cards against which purported conveyances are checked.” William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §11.15, at 928 n.20 (3d ed. 2000).</p>

Order No. 13,224, 66 Fed. Reg. 49,079 (Sept. 23, 2001). Real estate lawyers must accordingly check a government watch list to ensure they do not help listed persons engage in real estate transactions. Many real estate lawyers now include clauses in purchase and sale agreements requiring buyers and sellers to warrant that they are not on the watch list, they are not entities prohibited from doing business under antiterrorism laws, and that they will not do business with anyone who is so prohibited. <i>See</i> Nora Lockwood Tooher, <i>Real Estate Lawyers Adding “Anti-Terrorism” Clauses to Contracts and Leases</i>, Lawyers USA, Aug. 28, 2006, at 5. </p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d0abe9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1017D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N1017D_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span>&nbsp;In some transactions, particularly in commercial real estate, the parties may mark the general terms of an agreement through a term sheet or similar informal document.

This section restates what is widely known as the “part performance doctrine.” Part performance is not an accurate designation of such acts as taking possession and making improvements when the contract does not provide for such acts, but such acts regularly bring the doctrine into play. The doctrine is contrary to the words of the Statute of Frauds, but it was established by English courts of equity soon after the enactment of the Statute. Payment of purchase-money, without more, was once thought sufficient to justify specific enforcement, but a contrary view now prevails, since in such cases restitution is an adequate remedy. Enforcement has been justified on the ground that repudiation after “part performance” amounts to a “virtual fraud.” A more accurate statement is that courts with equitable powers are vested by tradition with what in substance is a dispensing power based on the promisee’s reliance, <i>a discretion to be exercised with caution</i> in the light of all the circumstances [emphasis supplied]. </p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d1e3e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">b. Two distinct elements enter into the application of the rule of this Section: first, the extent to which the evidentiary function of the statutory formalities is fulfilled by the conduct of the parties; second, the reliance of the promisee, providing a compelling substantive basis for relief in addition to the expectations created by the promise.</p>

Where specific enforcement is rested on a transfer of possession plus either part payment of the price or the making of improvements, it is commonly said that the action taken by the purchaser must be unequivocally referable to the oral agreement. But this requirement is not insisted on <i>if the making of the promise is admitted or is clearly proved</i>. The promisee <i>must act in reasonable reliance on the promise, before the promisor has repudiated</i> it, and the action must be such that the remedy of restitution is inadequate. If these requirements are met, <i>neither taking of possession nor payment of money nor the making of improvements is essential</i> [emphasis supplied].</p>

In a reverse mortgage, a homeowner takes out a loan using the value of her house as collateral, but is not required to repay the loan until she moves or passes away. This can be a way to generate funds for older homeowners for medical expenses or even daily expenses, but can also be risky because borrowers are still required to have enough resources to pay property taxes and insurance on their homes. <i>See</i> Jessica Silver-Greenberg, <i>A Risky Lifeline for the Elderly Is Costing Some Their Homes</i>, N.Y.

Where this creates a conflict, federal law can preempt state law, which can restrict the ability of the states to enforce consumer protection laws.

Similarly, mortgage brokers had incentives to induce homeowners to refinance their mortgages, even if there were no economic benefits to the homeowners, because brokers received fees for every refinancing.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d454d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C2F_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10C2F_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span>&nbsp;Some commentators argue that the subprime crisis can be attributed to incentives under the <i>Community Reinvestment Act</i> (CRA) to serve low-income communities and individuals. Likewise, commentators point to the obligations that the federal government has placed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since 1992 to serve low-income borrowers. These affordable housing mandates, the argument goes, distorted the market and induced lenders into taking unreasonable risks in their underwriting. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Raghuram Rajan, <i>Bankers Have Been Sold Short by Market Distortions</i>, Financial Times (June 2, 2010). There are several problems with this argument. First, there is a question of timing. The CRA was passed in 1977 and existed for nearly three decades before the subprime crisis. Similarly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were very late to the subprime mortgage market, entering only in the immediate run-up to the crisis to compete with so-called private-label lenders. And the majority of subprime loans were made by lenders who were either not subject to supervision under the CRA, or subject to relatively little oversight. <i>See</i> Prepared Testimony of Michael S. Barr, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, <i>The Community Reinvestment Act: Thirty Years of Accomplishments, But Challenges Remain</i>, Feb. 13, 2008, at 4 (“More than half of subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies not subject to comprehensive federal supervision; another 30 percent of such originations were made by affiliates of banks or thrifts, which are not subject to routine examination or supervision.”). Finally, careful empirical studies have found that the CRA and the GSE affordable housing mandates had no effect on subprime lending volumes, loan pricing, or default rates. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rubén Hernández-Murillo et al., <i>Did Affordable Housing Legislation Contribute to the Subprime Securities Boom?</i>, Federal Reserve Working Paper 2012-005B (Aug. 2012).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d47be9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C78_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10C78_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span>&nbsp;“Subprime” loans are loans made to borrowers who generally would not qualify for traditional loans offered at the generally prevailing rate of interest for conventional mortgages.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d47bec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10C86_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10C86_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span>&nbsp;The variable rate was based on the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a market interest rate, plus a fixed margin (referred to as a “rate add”) to reflect the risk of the loan.

Not all conduct that is institutionally unsafe and unsound is harmful to borrowers. However, when the lending institution’s practices are deemed unsafe and unsound because they create too high a risk of default and foreclosure, the borrower, as the counterparty to the loan, obviously faces the same risk. Accordingly, such lending practices may indicate unfairness under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. <i>Cf.</i> Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation Massachusetts Division of Banks, <i>Subprime Lending</i> (Dec. 10, 1997) (warning of both safety and soundness, and consumer protection, risks from subprime lending); OCC, <i>Guidelines for National Banks to Guard Against Predatory and Abusive Lending Practices</i>, AL 2003-2 at 1 (Feb. 21, 2003) (“even where the particular attributes of a loan are not subject to a specific prohibition, loans reflecting abusive practices nevertheless can involve unfair and deceptive conduct and present significant safety and soundness, reputation, and other risks to national banks”).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5d4ca36-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10DFE_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10DFE_ceeab89d-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">20</a></span>&nbsp;One significant proposal that emerged early in the subprime crisis would have allowed homeowners to restructure mortgages in bankruptcy. Currently, home mortgage loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, unlike most other consumer debt. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. §1322(b)(2) (debtors may “modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor’s principal residence”)<i>.</i> Reform of bankruptcy law would have enabled borrowers to reduce or eliminate their mortgage debt in bankruptcy in order to start over.

Most states subscribe to the <b>lien theory</b>, under which the borrower retains title to the property and the lender has merely a lien on the property.
