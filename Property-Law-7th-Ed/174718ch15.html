<p id="c5f1ef5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an inherent aspect of their sovereignty, the federal and state governments have the power to take property by eminent domain. The fifth amendment provides that “Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” U.S. Const., amend. V. That clause is made applicable to the States by the fourteenth amendment, <i>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. Chicago</i>, 166 U.S. 226 (1897), and all state constitutions have equivalent provisions. The text of the takings clause suggests several constitutional questions in eminent domain: Does a purported taking involve “private property” subject to the clause; is the taking for “public use”; and, if so, has there been payment of “just compensation”?</p>
<p id="c5f1ef5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the government acquires property without the owner’s consent, it is usually clear that a taking has occurred and compensation must be paid. However, where governmental actions interfere with an owner’s property rights but do not involve an actual transfer to the government, the question is whether there has been a “taking” at all. We will focus on that issue, which falls under the doctrinal heading of “regulatory takings,” beginning in §2.</p>
<p id="c5f1ef5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The condemnation power is regulated and defined by statute. Sometimes the legislature exercises the power directly and sometimes it delegates eminent domain authority to an agency that is empowered by the government to take property for specific purposes. For example, the Massachusetts Port Authority has the statutory power to take property for airport or harbor purposes and the U.S. Department of Transportation has the power to take property for highway purposes, as authorized by legislation. Municipalities generally are delegated eminent domain power as well for purposes such as road and school construction and condemnation of unsafe structures. In some circumstances private entities, such as railroads, utilities, and turnpike companies, are also delegated the authority to condemn private property.</p>
<p id="c5f1ef60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1150">p. 1150</span>Statutes define the procedures by which the condemnation process occurs. Some states have “quick-take” statutes that authorize the seizure of property immediately in certain circumstances, with the government paying what it deems to be just compensation, and placing the burden on the owner to challenge that amount. Usually, however, the condemning agency must attempt to negotiate to purchase the property from the owner for a fair price before filing a lawsuit against the owner and any occupants to condemn the property. If the parties cannot agree on a fair price, the court may appoint experts to determine the fair market value of the property, and a lawsuit with witnesses on both sides may be conducted to determine the compensation mandated by both statute and the constitution. Absent appeals, the suit ends with a condemnation decree that transfers title to the property from the owner to the condemning agency.</p>

The question presented is whether the city’s proposed disposition of this property qualifies as a “public use” within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p id="c5f2167c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I</i></p>
<p id="c5f2167d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut. Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to designate the City a “distressed municipality.” In 1996, the Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had employed over 1,500 people. In 1998, the City’s unemployment rate was nearly double that of the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920.</p>
<p id="c5f2167e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These conditions prompted state and local officials to target New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic revitalization. To this end, respondent <span title="1151" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1151">p. 1151</span>New London Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning economic development, was reactivated. In January 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support the NLDC’s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park. In February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull; local planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby serving as a catalyst to the area’s rejuvenation. After receiving initial approval from the city council, the NLDC continued its planning activities and held a series of neighborhood meetings to educate the public about the process. In May, the city council authorized the NLDC to formally submit its plans to the relevant state agencies for review. Upon obtaining state-level approval, the NLDC finalized an integrated development plan focused on 90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area.</p>
<p id="c5f2167f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into the Thames River. The area comprises approximately 115 privately owned properties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State Park now occupies 18 of those 32 acres). The development plan encompasses seven parcels. Parcel 1 is designated for a waterfront conference hotel at the center of a “small urban village” that will include restaurants and shopping. This parcel will also have marinas for both recreational and commercial uses. A pedestrian “riverwalk” will originate here and continue down the coast, connecting the waterfront areas of the development. Parcel 2 will be the site of approximately 80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development, including the state park. This parcel also includes space reserved for a new U.S. Coast Guard Museum. Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the Pfizer facility, will contain at least 90,000 </p>

Parcel 4A is a 2.4-acre site that will be used either to support the adjacent state park, by providing parking or retail services for visitors, or to support the nearby marina. Parcel 4B will include a renovated marina, as well as the final stretch of the riverwalk. Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide land for office and retail space, parking, and water-dependent commercial uses.</p>
<p id="c5f21684-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the arrival of the Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was expected to attract. In addition to creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and helping to “build momentum for the revitalization of downtown New London,” the plan was also designed to make the City more attractive and to create leisure and recreational opportunities on the waterfront and in the park.</p>
<p id="c5f21685-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city council approved the plan in January 2000, and designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of implementation. <i>See</i> Conn. Gen. Stat. §8-188. The city council also authorized the NLDC to purchase property or to acquire property by exercising eminent domain in the City’s name. <i>Id.</i> §8-193. The NLDC successfully negotiated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre area, but its negotiations with petitioners failed. As a consequence, in November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condemnation proceedings that gave rise to this case.</p>

<p id="c5f21687-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbull area since 1997. She has made extensive improvements to her house, which she prizes for its water view. Petitioner Wilhelmina Dery was born in her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and has lived there her entire life. Her husband Charles (also a petitioner) has lived in the house since they married some 60 years ago. In all, the nine petitioners own 15 properties in Fort Trumbull — 4 in parcel 3 of the development plan and 11 in parcel 4A. Ten of the parcels are occupied by the owner or a family member; the other five are held as investment properties. There is no allegation that any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor condition; rather, they were condemned only because they happen to be located in the development area.</p>
<p id="c5f21688-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In December 2000, petitioners brought this action in the New London Superior Court. They claimed, among other things, that the taking of their properties would violate the “public use” restriction in the Fifth Amendment. After a 7-day bench trial, the Superior Court granted a permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the properties located in parcel 4A (park or marina support). It, however, denied petitioners relief as to the properties located in parcel 3 (office space).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100DE_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100DE_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f23d9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. That court held, over a dissent, that all of the City’s proposed takings were valid. [R]elying on cases such as <i>Hawai`i Housing Authority v. Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), and <i><span title="1153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1153">p. 1153</span>Berman v. Parker</i>, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), the court held that such economic development qualified as a valid public use under both the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>
<p id="c5f23d9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three dissenting justices would have imposed a “heightened” standard of judicial review for takings justified by economic development. Although they agreed that the plan was intended to serve a valid public use, they would have found all the takings unconstitutional because the City had failed to adduce “clear and convincing evidence” that the economic benefits of the plan would in fact come to pass.</p>
<p id="c5f23d9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari to determine whether a city’s decision to take property for the purpose of economic development satisfies the “public use” requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5f23d9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5f23d9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two polar propositions are perfectly clear. On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of <i>A</i> for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party <i>B</i>, even though <i>A</i> is paid just compensation. On the other hand, it is equally clear that a State may transfer property from one private party to another if future “use by the public” is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of land for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar example. Neither of these propositions, however, determines the disposition of this case.</p>
<p id="c5f23d9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the first proposition, the City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioners’ land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party. Nor would the City be allowed to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit. The takings before us, however, would be executed pursuant to a “carefully considered” development plan. The trial judge and all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case. Therefore, as was true of the statute challenged in <i>Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S., at 245, the City’s development plan was not adopted “to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals.”</p>
<p id="c5f23da0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is planning to open the condemned land — at least not in its entirety — to use by the general public. Nor will the private lessees of the land in any sense be required to operate like common carriers, making their services available to all comers. But although such a projected use would be sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement, this “Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public.” <i>Id.</i> at 244. Indeed, while many state courts in the mid-19th century endorsed “use by the public” as the proper definition of public use, that narrow view steadily eroded over time. Not only was the “use by the public” test difficult to administer (<i>e.g.</i>, what proportion of the public need have access to the property? at what price?), but it proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1011A_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1011A_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> Accordingly, when this Court began applying the Fifth <span title="1154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1154">p. 1154</span>Amendment to the States at the close of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as “public purpose.” Thus, in a case upholding a mining company’s use of an aerial bucket line to transport ore over property it did not own, Justice Holmes’ opinion for the Court stressed “the inadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test.” <i>Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co.</i>, 200 U.S. 527, 531 (1906).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1012B_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1012B_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> We have repeatedly and consistently rejected that narrow test ever since.</p>
<p id="c5f23da3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question whether the City’s development plan serves a “public purpose.” Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field.</p>
<p id="c5f23da4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Berman v. Parker</i>, 348 U.S. 26 (1954), this Court upheld a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D.C., in which most of the housing for the area’s 5,000 inhabitants was beyond repair. Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it utilized for the construction of streets, schools, and other public facilities. The remainder of the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of redevelopment, including the construction of low-cost housing.</p>
<p id="c5f23da5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The owner of a department store located in the area challenged the condemnation, pointing out that his store was not itself blighted and arguing that the creation of a “better balanced, more attractive community” was not a valid public use. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation, deferring instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area “must be planned as a whole” for the plan to be successful. The Court explained that “community redevelopment programs need not, by force of the Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis — lot by lot, building by building.” The public use underlying the taking was unequivocally affirmed, <i>id.</i> at 33:</p>

The concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well as carefully patrolled. In the present case, the Congress and its authorized agencies have made determinations that take into account a wide variety of values. It is not for us to reappraise them. If those who govern the District of Columbia decide that the Nation’s Capital should be beautiful as well as sanitary, there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment that stands in the way.</p>

<p id="c5f264b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hawai`i Housing Authority v. Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Court considered a Hawai`i statute whereby fee title was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees (for just compensation) in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership. We unanimously upheld the statute and rejected the Ninth Circuit’s view that it was “a naked attempt on the part of the state of Hawai`i to take the property of A and transfer it <span title="1155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1155">p. 1155</span>to B solely for B’s private use and benefit.” Reaffirming <i>Berman</i>’s deferential approach to legislative judgments in this field, we concluded that the State’s purpose of eliminating the “social and economic evils of a land oligopoly” qualified as a valid public use. Our opinion also rejected the contention that the mere fact that the State immediately transferred the properties to private individuals upon condemnation somehow diminished the public character of the taking. “It is only the taking’s purpose, and not its mechanics,” we explained, that matters in determining public use. <i>Id.</i> at 244.</p>
<p id="c5f264b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that same Term we decided another public use case that arose in a purely economic context. In <i>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.</i>, 467 U.S. 986 (1984), the Court dealt with provisions of the <i>Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</i> under which the Environmental Protection Agency could consider the data (including trade secrets) submitted by a prior pesticide applicant in evaluating a subsequent application, so long as the second applicant paid just compensation for the data. We acknowledged that the “most direct beneficiaries” of these provisions were the subsequent applicants, but we nevertheless upheld the statute under <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i>. We found sufficient Congress’ belief that sparing applicants the cost of time-consuming research eliminated a significant barrier to entry in the pesticide market and thereby enhanced competition.</p>
<p id="c5f264b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewed as a whole, our jurisprudence has recognized that the needs of society have varied between different parts of the Nation, just as they have evolved over time in response to changed circumstances. Our earliest cases in particular embodied a strong theme of federalism, emphasizing the “great respect” that we owe to state legislatures and state courts in discerning local public needs. For more than a century, our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power.</p>

The City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including — but by no means limited to — new jobs and increased tax revenue. As with other exercises in urban planning and development,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10179_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10179_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in <i>Berman</i>, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that <span title="1156" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1156">p. 1156</span>plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5f264bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use. Putting aside the unpersuasive suggestion that the City’s plan will provide only purely economic benefits, neither precedent nor logic supports petitioners’ proposal. Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of government. There is, moreover, no principled way of distinguishing economic development from the other public purposes that we have recognized. In our cases upholding takings that facilitated agriculture and mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries to the welfare of the States in question; in <i>Berman</i>, we endorsed the purpose of transforming a blighted area into a “well-balanced” community through redevelopment;<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1018D_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1018D_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span> in <i>Midkiff</i>, we upheld the interest in breaking up a land oligopoly that “created artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the State’s residential land market”; and in <i>Monsanto</i>, we accepted Congress’ purpose of eliminating a “significant barrier to entry in the pesticide market.” It would be incongruous to hold that the City’s interest in the economic benefits to be derived from the development of the Fort Trumbull area has less of a public character than any of those other interests. Clearly, there is no basis for exempting economic development from our traditionally broad understanding of public purpose.</p>
<p id="c5f264bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioners contend that using eminent domain for economic development impermissibly blurs the boundary between public and private takings. Again, our cases foreclose this objection. Quite simply, the government’s pursuit of a public purpose will often benefit individual private parties. For example, in <i>Midkiff</i>, the forced transfer of property conferred a direct and significant benefit on those lessees who were previously unable to purchase their homes. In <i>Monsanto</i>, we recognized that the “most direct beneficiaries” of the data-sharing provisions were the subsequent pesticide applicants, but benefiting them in this way was necessary to promoting competition in the pesticide market. The owner of the department store in <i>Berman</i> objected to “taking from one businessman for the benefit of another businessman,” referring to the fact that under the redevelopment plan land would be leased or sold to private <span title="1157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1157">p. 1157</span>developers for redevelopment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101B4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101B4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span> Our rejection of that contention has particular relevance to the instant case: “The public end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of government — or so the Congress might conclude. We cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects.” <i>Id.</i> at 34.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101C0_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101C0_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f264c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is further argued that without a bright-line rule nothing would stop a city from transferring citizen <i>A</i>’s property to citizen <i>B</i> for the sole reason that citizen <i>B</i> will put the property to a more productive use and thus pay more taxes. Such a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case. While such an unusual exercise of government power would certainly raise a suspicion that a private purpose was afoot,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101E1_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101E1_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span> the hypothetical cases posited by petitioners can be confronted if and when they arise.

<p id="c5f28bd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, petitioners maintain that for takings of this kind we should require a “reasonable certainty” that the expected public benefits will actually accrue. Such a rule, however, would represent an even greater departure from our precedent. “When <span title="1158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1158">p. 1158</span>the legislature’s purpose is legitimate and its means are not irrational, our cases make clear that empirical debates over the wisdom of takings — no less than debates over the wisdom of other kinds of socioeconomic legislation — are not to be carried out in the federal courts.” <i>Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S., at 242. Indeed, earlier this Term we explained why similar practical concerns (among others) undermined the use of the “substantially advances” formula in our regulatory takings doctrine. <i>See Lingle</i> v. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</i>, 544 U.S. 528, 544 (2005) (noting that this formula “would empower — and might often require — courts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies”). The disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially pronounced in this type of case. Orderly implementation of a comprehensive redevelopment plan obviously requires that the legal rights of all interested parties be established before new construction can be commenced. A constitutional rule that required postponement of the judicial approval of every condemnation until the likelihood of success of the plan had been assured would unquestionably impose a significant impediment to the successful consummation of many such plans.</p>
<p id="c5f28bd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as we decline to second-guess the City’s considered judgments about the efficacy of its development plan, we also decline to second-guess the City’s determinations as to what lands it needs to acquire in order to effectuate the project. “It is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a particular project area. Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of land to be taken for the project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.” <i>Berman</i>, 348 U.S., at 35-36.</p>

Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S. 229, 241 (1984). This deferential standard of review echoes the rational-basis test used to review economic regulation under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, see, e.g., <i>FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.</i>, 508 U.S. 307, 313-314 (1993); <i>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</i>, 348 U.S. 483 (1955). The determination that a rational-basis standard of review is appropriate does not, however, alter the fact that transfers intended to confer benefits on particular, favored private entities, and with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, are forbidden by the Public Use Clause.</p>
<p id="c5f28bde-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court applying rational-basis review under the Public Use Clause should strike down a taking that, by a clear showing, is intended to favor a particular private party, with only incidental or pretextual public benefits, just as a court applying rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause must strike down a government classification that is clearly intended to injure a particular class of private parties, with only incidental or pretextual public justifications. <i>See Cleburne v.

<p id="c5f2b2ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should treat the objection as a serious one and review the record to see if it has merit, though with the presumption that the government’s actions were reasonable and intended to serve a public purpose. Here, the trial court conducted a careful and extensive inquiry into “whether, in fact, the development plan is of primary benefit to the developer [<i>i.e.</i>, Corcoran Jennison], and private businesses which may eventually locate in the plan area [<i>e.g.</i>, Pfizer], and in that regard, only of incidental benefit to the city.” The trial court considered respondents’ awareness of New London’s depressed economic condition and evidence corroborating the validity of this concern; the substantial commitment of public funds by the State to the development project before most of the private beneficiaries were known; evidence that respondents reviewed a variety of development plans and chose a private developer from a group of applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand; and the fact that the other private beneficiaries of the project are still unknown because the office space proposed to be built has not yet been rented.</p>
<p id="c5f2b2f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court concluded, based on these findings, that benefiting Pfizer was not “the primary motivation or effect of this development plan”; instead, “the primary motivation for [respondents] was to take advantage of Pfizer’s presence.” Likewise, the trial court concluded that “there is nothing in the record to indicate that [respondents] <span title="1160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1160">p. 1160</span>were motivated by a desire to aid [other] particular private entities.” This case, then, survives the meaningful rational basis review that in my view is required under the Public Use Clause.</p>
<p id="c5f2b2f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My agreement with the Court that a presumption of invalidity is not warranted for economic development takings in general, or for the particular takings at issue in this case, does not foreclose the possibility that a more stringent standard of review than that announced in <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i> might be appropriate for a more narrowly drawn category of takings. There may be private transfers in which the risk of undetected impermissible favoritism of private parties is so acute that a presumption (rebuttable or otherwise) of invalidity is warranted under the Public Use Clause. This demanding level of scrutiny, however, is not required simply because the purpose of the taking is economic development.</p>
<p id="c5f2b2f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not the occasion for conjecture as to what sort of cases might justify a more demanding standard, but it is appropriate to underscore aspects of the instant case that convince me no departure from <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i> is appropriate here. This taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious city-wide depression, and the projected economic benefits of the project cannot be characterized as <i>de minimus</i>. The identity of most of the private beneficiaries were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans. The city complied with elaborate procedural requirements that facilitate review of the record and inquiry into the city’s purposes. In sum, while there may be categories of cases in which the transfers are so suspicious, or the procedures employed so prone to abuse, or the purported benefits are so trivial or implausible, that courts should presume an impermissible private purpose, no such circumstances are present in this case.</p>

To reason, as the Court does, that the incidental public benefits resulting from the subsequent ordinary use of private property render economic development takings “for public use” is to wash out any distinction between private and public use of property — and thereby effectively to delete the words “for public use” from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

I would hold that they are not. We are guided by two precedents about the taking of real property by eminent domain. In <i>Berman</i>, we upheld takings within a blighted neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The neighborhood had so deteriorated that, for example, 64.3% of its dwellings were beyond repair. It had become burdened with “overcrowding of dwellings,” “lack of adequate streets and alleys,” and “lack of light and air.” Congress had determined that the neighborhood had become “injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare” and that it was necessary to “eliminate all such injurious conditions by employing all means necessary and appropriate for the purpose,” including eminent domain. Mr. Berman’s department store was not itself blighted. Having approved of Congress’ decision to eliminate the harm to the public emanating from the blighted neighborhood, however, we did not second-guess its decision to treat the neighborhood as a whole rather than lot-by-lot. <i>See Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S., at 244 (“it is only the taking’s purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny”).</p>
<p id="c5f2b2f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Midkiff</i>, we upheld a land condemnation scheme in Hawai`i whereby title in real property was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees. At that time, the State and Federal Governments owned nearly 49% of the State’s land, and another 47% was in the hands of only 72 private landowners. Concentration of land ownership was so dramatic that on the State’s most urbanized island, Oahu, 22 landowners owned 72.5% of the fee simple titles. The Hawai`i Legislature had concluded that the oligopoly in land ownership was “skewing the State’s residential fee simple market, inflating land prices, and injuring the public tranquility and welfare,” and therefore enacted a condemnation scheme for redistributing title.</p>
<p id="c5f2da0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In those decisions, we emphasized the importance of deferring to legislative judgments about public purpose. Because courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the efficacy of proposed legislative initiatives, we rejected as unworkable the idea of courts’ “ deciding on what is and is not a governmental function and invalidating legislation on the basis of their view on that question at the moment of decision, a practice which has proved impracticable in other fields.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at 240-41.</p>
<p id="c5f2da0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s holdings in <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i> were true to the principle underlying the Public Use Clause. In both those cases, the extraordinary, precondemnation use of the targeted property inflicted affirmative harm on society — in <i>Berman</i> through blight resulting from extreme poverty and in <i>Midkiff</i> through oligopoly resulting from extreme wealth. And in both cases, the relevant legislative body had found that eliminating the existing property use was necessary to remedy the harm. Thus a public purpose was realized when the harmful use was eliminated. Because each taking <i><span title="1162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1162">p. 1162</span>directly</i> achieved a public benefit, it did not matter that the property was turned over to private use. Here, in contrast, New London does not claim that Susette Kelo’s and Wilhelmina Dery’s well-maintained homes are the source of any social harm. Indeed, it could not so claim without adopting the absurd argument that any single-family home that might be razed to make way for an apartment building, or any church that might be replaced with a retail store, or any small business that might be more lucrative if it were instead part of a national franchise, is inherently harmful to society and thus within the government’s power to condemn.</p>
<p id="c5f2da0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public — such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words “for public use” do not realistically exclude <i>any</i> takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.</p>
<p id="c5f2da0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result. “That alone is a <i>just</i> government,” wrote James Madison, “which <i>impartially</i> secures to every man, whatever is his <i>own</i>.” For the National Gazette, Property, (Mar. 29, 1792), <i>reprinted in</i> 14 Papers of James Madison 266 (R. Rutland et al. eds. 1983).</p>

<p id="c5f2da0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Long ago, William Blackstone wrote that “the law of the land . . . postpones even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private property.” 1 <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> 134-135 (1765). The Framers embodied that principle in the Constitution, allowing the government to take property not for “public necessity,” but instead for “public use.” Amdt. 5. Defying this understanding, the Court replaces the Public Use Clause with a “ Public Purpose’” Clause (or perhaps the “Diverse and Always Evolving Needs of Society” Clause (capitalization added)), a restriction that is satisfied, the Court instructs, so long as the purpose is “legitimate” and the means “not irrational.” This deferential shift in phraseology enables the Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for a “public use.”</p>
<p id="c5f2da10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I cannot agree. The most natural reading of the [Public Use] Clause is that it allows the government to take property only if the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the property, as opposed to taking it for any public purpose or necessity <span title="1163" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1163">p. 1163</span>whatsoever. At the time of the founding, dictionaries primarily defined the noun “use” as “the act of employing any thing to any purpose.” 2 S. Johnson, <i>A Dictionary of the English Language</i> 2194 (4th ed. 1773). The term “use,” moreover, “is from the Latin <i>utor</i>, which means to use, make use of, avail one’s self of, employ, apply, enjoy, etc.’ ” J. Lewis, <i>Law of Eminent Domain</i> §165, p. 224, n.4 (1888). When the government takes property and gives it to a private individual, and the public has no right to use the property, it strains language to say that the public is “employing” the property, regardless of the incidental benefits that might accrue to the public from the private use. The term “public use,” then, means that either the government or its citizens as a whole must actually “employ” the taken property.</p>
<p id="c5f2da11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Granted, another sense of the word “use” was broader in meaning, extending to “convenience” or “help,” or “qualities that make a thing proper for any purpose.” 2 Johnson 2194. Nevertheless, read in context, the term “public use” possesses the narrower meaning. Elsewhere, the Constitution twice employs the word “use,” both times in its narrower sense. Claeys, <i>Public-Use Limitations and Natural Property Rights</i>, 2004 Mich. St. L. Rev. 877, 897. Article 1, §10 provides that “the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States,” meaning the Treasury itself will control the taxes, not use it to any beneficial end. And Article I, §8 grants Congress power “to raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years.” Here again, “use” means “employed to raise and support Armies,” not anything directed to achieving any military end. The same word in the Public Use Clause should be interpreted to have the same meaning. The Constitution’s text, in short, suggests that the Takings Clause authorizes the taking of property only if the public has a right to employ it, not if the public realizes any conceivable benefit from the taking.</p>
<p id="c5f2da12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Constitution’s common-law background reinforces this understanding. The common law provided an express method of eliminating uses of land that adversely impacted the public welfare: nuisance law. Blackstone and Kent, for instance, both carefully distinguished the law of nuisance from the power of eminent domain. Blackstone rejected the idea that private property could be taken solely for purposes of any public benefit. “So great . . . is the regard of the law for private property,” he explained, “that it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the general good of the whole community.” 1 <i>Blackstone</i> 135. He continued: “If a new road . . . were to be made through the grounds of a private person, it might perhaps be extensively beneficial to the public; but the law permits no man, or set of men, to do this without the consent of the owner of the land.” <i>Id.</i> Only “by giving [the landowner] full indemnification” could the government take property, and even then “the public [was] now considered as an individual, treating with an individual for an exchange.” <i>Id.</i> When the public took property, in other words, it took it as an individual buying property from another typically would: for one’s own use. The Public Use Clause, in short, embodied the Framers’ understanding that property is a natural, fundamental right, prohibiting the government from “taking <i>property</i> from A. and giving it to B.” <i>Calder v. Bull</i>, 3 U.S. 386, 388 (1798).</p>
<p id="c5f2da13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early American eminent domain practice largely bears out this understanding of the Public Use Clause. States employed the eminent domain power to provide <span title="1164" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1164">p. 1164</span>quintessentially public goods, such as public roads, toll roads, ferries, canals, railroads, and public parks. Though use of the eminent domain power was sparse at the time of the founding, many States did have so-called Mill Acts, which authorized the owners of grist mills operated by water power to flood upstream lands with the payment of compensation to the upstream landowner. Those early grist mills “were regulated by law and compelled to serve the public for a stipulated toll and in regular order,” and therefore were actually used by the public. J. Lewis, <i>Law of Eminent Domain</i> §178, at 246, &amp; n.3 (1888). They were common carriers — quasi-public entities. These were “public uses” in the fullest sense of the word, because the public could legally use and benefit from them equally.</p>
<p id="c5f2da14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, some early state legislatures tested the limits of their state-law eminent domain power. Some States enacted statutes allowing the taking of property for the purpose of building private roads. These statutes were mixed; some required the private landowner to keep the road open to the public, and others did not. Later in the 19th century, moreover, the Mill Acts were employed to grant rights to private manufacturing plants, in addition to grist mills that had common-carrier duties. <i>See, e.g.</i>, M. Horwitz, <i>The Transformation of American Law 1780-1860</i>, at 51-52 (1977).</p>
<p id="c5f2da15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These early uses of the eminent domain power are often cited as evidence for the broad “public purpose” interpretation of the Public Use Clause, but in fact the constitutionality of these exercises of eminent domain power under state public use restrictions was a hotly contested question in state courts throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. The disagreement among state courts, and state legislatures’ attempts to circumvent public use limits on their eminent domain power, cannot obscure that the Public Use Clause is most naturally read to authorize takings for public use only if the government or the public actually uses the taken property.</p>
<p id="c5f2da16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would revisit our Public Use Clause cases and consider returning to the original meaning of the Public Use Clause: that the government may take property only if it actually uses or gives the public a legal right to use the property. The consequences of today’s decision are not difficult to predict, and promise to be harmful. So-called “urban renewal” programs provide some compensation for the properties they take, but no compensation is possible for the subjective value of these lands to the individuals displaced and the indignity inflicted by uprooting them from their homes. Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities. Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful. If ever there were justification for intrusive judicial review of constitutional provisions that protect “discrete and insular minorities,” <i>United States v. Carolene Products Co.</i>, 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938), surely that principle would apply with great force to the powerless groups and individuals the Public Use Clause protects. The deferential standard this Court has adopted for the Public Use Clause is therefore deeply perverse. It encourages “those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms” to victimize the weak (<i>see ante</i>, O’Connor, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="c5f2da17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1165">p. 1165</span>Those incentives have made the legacy of this Court’s “public purpose” test an unhappy one. In the 1950’s, no doubt emboldened in part by the expansive understanding of “public use” this Court adopted in <i>Berman</i>, cities “rushed to draw plans” for downtown development. B. Frieden &amp; L. Sagalayn, <i>Downtown, Inc. How America Rebuilds Cities</i> 17 (1989). “Of all the families displaced by urban renewal from 1949 through 1963, 63 percent of those whose race was known were nonwhite, and of these families, 56 percent of nonwhites and 38 percent of whites had incomes low enough to qualify for public housing, which, however, was seldom available to them.” <i>Id.</i> at 28. Public works projects in the 1950’s and 1960’s destroyed predominantly minority communities in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Baltimore, Maryland. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29. In 1981, urban planners in Detroit, Michigan, uprooted the largely “lower-income and elderly” Poletown neighborhood for the benefit of the General Motors Corporation. J. Wylie, <i>Poletown: Community Betrayed</i> 58 (1989). Urban renewal projects have long been associated with the displacement of blacks; “in cities across the country urban renewal came to be known as Negro removal.’” Pritchett, <i>The “Public Menace” of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent Domain</i>, 21 Yale L. &amp; Pol’y Rev. 1, 47 (2003). Over 97 percent of the individuals forcibly removed from their homes by the “slum-clearance” project upheld by this Court in <i>Berman</i> were black. 348 U.S. at 30. Regrettably, the predictable consequence of the Court’s decision will be to exacerbate these effects.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5f30129-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="c5f3012a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. The eminent domain power and the police power.</b> In <i>Hawai`i Housing Authority v. Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S. 229, 240 (1984), the Supreme Court held that “[t]he public use’ requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign’s police powers.” This means that whatever the state may legitimately achieve through its power to regulate property under the police power, it may instead choose to do through the power to take property through eminent domain. Justice Kennedy, in a passage quoted by the majority in <i>Kelo</i>, justified the breadth of public use on the theory that, unlike the police power, the takings clause “operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the government to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.” <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498, 545 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). Are there reasons to take a narrower view of public use in the power to take property by eminent domain than the full reach of the police power to regulate? Conversely, are there actions that the government might <i>not</i> be able to take through its power to regulate that it might, nonetheless, justify as public use for purposes of condemnation?</p>
<p id="c5f3012b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Detecting political process failure.</b> As the <i>Kelo</i> majority suggests, one reason for courts to take a deferential approach to reviewing public use challenges is to respect the democratic process. However, Justice Kennedy, in his concurrence, argues that courts should nonetheless scrutinize takings for “impermissible favoritism,” and take a more skeptical approach to their review where such favoritism is evident. Both the <i>Kelo</i> majority and Justice Kennedy placed some weight on the fact that there had been an extensive planning process for the redevelopment of the Fort Trumbull area<i>.</i> <span title="1166" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1166">p. 1166</span>If the New London city council had passed legislation taking the property at issue in the case as part of the city council’s ordinary business, but without a separate planning process, would that have made the taking more vulnerable to a public use challenge? Should it?</p>
<p id="c5f3012c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Harms and benefits.</b> Justice O’Connor, in her <i>Kelo</i> dissent, distinguished the Supreme Court’s unanimous decisions in <i>Berman</i> and <i>Midkiff</i>, the latter of which she authored, as cases that involved property arrangements that “inflicted affirmative harm on society.” Is there a principled way to distinguish between exercises of the power of eminent domain that cause harm and those that seek to improve conditions or otherwise confer a benefit? Is there a reason to limit the power of eminent domain to harm prevention?</p>
<p id="c5f3012d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. “Use by the public.”</b> Justice Thomas would have held that “the government may take property only if it actually uses or gives the public a legal right to use the property.” There are certainly relatively easy cases under this standard, as with a government buildings, public parks, and highways. Would public housing, which is publicly funded but open only to a limited number of qualified tenants, be an acceptable “public use” under Justice Thomas’s standard?</p>
<p id="c5f3012e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. State constitutions.</b> Many state supreme courts have historically interpreted their state constitutions in a manner consistent with the federal interpretation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>County of Hawai`i v. C &amp; J Coupe Family LP</i>, 242 P.3d 1136, 1151 (Haw. 2010) (“Great weight is accorded to legislative findings and declarations of public use, and a heavy burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the use was clearly and palpably of a private character.”)<i>.</i> However, states are entitled to grant greater protection for property than that afforded by the U.S. Constitution, and an increasing number of supreme courts have adopted a different path, interpreting their state constitutional “public use” requirements more stringently than has the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="c5f3012f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, some courts have adopted a version of the test proposed by Justice Kennedy and held that the public use test is not met unless “the public benefits and characteristics of the intended use substantially predominate over the private nature of that use.” <i>Bailey v. Myers</i>, 76 P.3d 898, 904 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) (city could not take private property for transfer to private developers to construct a retail shopping and office center). <i>Accord</i>,<i> In re Opening Private Road for Benefit of O’Reilly</i>, 5 A.3d 246, 258-259 (Pa. 2010) (private roads act can only be constitutional if the public is “the primary and paramount beneficiary of the taking”); <i>City of Bozeman v. Vaniman</i>, 898 P.2d 1208 (Mont. 1995) (not a public purpose to take property for space in visitors center to be occupied by private Chamber of Commerce).</p>
<p id="c5f30130-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, some courts have adopted a version of the test proposed by Justice O’Connor and held that property cannot be taken and transferred from one owner to another unless the nature of the property itself justifies the taking. Such rulings prohibit takings for economic development purposes unless the property being taken is causing harm to others. For example, property may be taken and transferred to another owner if its condition is dangerous to occupants or neighbors and in need in <span title="1167" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1167">p. 1167</span>demolition or if it is “blighted” and in need of redevelopment to counteract slum conditions. <i>See Arvada Urban Renewal Authority v. Columbine Professional Plaza Association</i>, 85 P.3d 1066 (Colo. 2004) (not a public purpose to take a private lake for a new Wal-Mart unless there was a recent finding that the property was blighted). <i>Accord</i>, <i>Gallenthin Realty Development, Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro</i>, 924 A.2d 447 (N.J. 2007); <i>City of Norwood v. Horney,</i> 853 N.E.2d 1115 (Ohio 2006).</p>
<p id="c5f30131-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, some courts have held that the taking must be justified in the sense that the public purpose could not be achieved in any other way than through a taking of one owner’s property and transfer to another. <i>Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental</i>, 768 N.E.2d 1 (Ill. 2002) (not a public purpose to take a factory’s property to expand a parking lot for a race track next door).</p>
<p id="c5f30132-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Michigan Supreme Court combined several of these rationales in <i>Wayne County v. Hathcock</i>, 684 N.W.2d 765 (Mich. 2004), which unanimously overruled the famous 1981 decision in <i>Poletown Neighborhood Council v. City of Detroit</i>, 304 N.W.2d 455 (Mich. 1981). <i>Poletown</i> had held that the public use requirement was met when a city took private homes and other properties in a residential area and transferred those lots to General Motors Corp. to construct an automobile manufacturing plant. However, in <i>Hathcock</i>, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed course, holding that economic development was not a sufficient purpose to justify the condemnation of private lands for transfer to another private owner. Rather, the court held that transferring property from one private owner to another satisfies the public use test only when (1) “public necessity of the extreme sort” requires collective action; (2) the property will be “subject to public oversight after transfer to a private entity”; and (3) the property is selected because of “facts of independent public significance” about the property being taken, rather than advantage to the private entity to whom the property is transferred, such as a conclusion that the area is blighted and in need of redevelopment that is unlikely to occur without public action of this sort. 684 N.W.2d at 781-783.</p>

</div>
<p id="c5f30136-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, some courts have adopted a version of the approach proposed by Justice Thomas and held that “public use” means either “public ownership” or “use by the public,” thereby denying the power to take property from any private person if it is to be transferred to another and used privately rather than by the public at large. For example, in <i>Manufactured Housing Communities of Washington v. Washington</i>, 13 P.3d 183 (Wash. 2000), the Washington Supreme Court struck down a state law granting existing mobile home tenants a right of first refusal if the landlord sought to sell the property on which their mobile homes sat. As the court explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f30137-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although preserving dwindling housing stocks for a particularly vulnerable segment of society provides a “public benefit,” this public benefit does not constitute a public use. If it is something in which he has the actual right of property there is no rule of law nor principle of equity which would warrant a court in taking it from him against his will for the benefit of another. No amount of hardship in a given case would justify the establishment of such a precedent. The next step in the invasion of the right of property would be to invite the courts to measure the comparative needs of private parties, and compel a transfer to the one most needing and who might best utilize the property. If <span title="1168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1168">p. 1168</span>a man may be required to surrender what is his own, because he does not need it and cannot use it, and because another does need it and can use it, then there is no reason why he may not be required to surrender what he needs but little because another needs it much. A doctrine so insidiously dangerous should never find lodgment in the body of the law through judicial declaration.</p>

City of New London</i>, 843 A.2d 500, 510 (Conn. 2004). Imagine instead that New London had decided to develop the Fort Trumbull property itself and become the landlord for the occupants of the planned residences, offices, and retail facilities.

<p id="c5f34e65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As noted, the U.S. Constitution requires payment of “just compensation” when private property is taken for public use. U.S. Const. amends. V &amp; XIV. The Supreme Court has held that this requires payment of the <b>fair market value</b> of the property prior to the taking. In general, this means the amount the property would likely sell for on the open market. Compensation is measured by the damage suffered to the owner, not the benefit attained by the government; thus any increase in value of the property caused by the taking is not owed to the owner. By definition, fair market value is likely to undercompensate the owner. For example, any owner who is not trying to sell her property likely values it at more than fair market value because if you offered to buy her property at its market price, the owner would refuse. To induce such an owner to sell, one would have to offer more (and perhaps much more) than fair market value. If the goal is to fully indemnify the owner for the loss, then the just measure of compensation should be the owner’s asking price, not market value. But the Supreme Court has rejected asking price as the constitutional measure of just compensation because it is too hard to figure out what an owner’s asking price is, while market value can be determined relatively objectively. <i>Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States</i>, 338 U.S. 1, 5 (1949) (“In view of the liability of all property to condemnation for the common good, loss to the owner of nontransferable values deriving from his unique need for property or idiosyncratic attachment to it, like loss due to an exercise of the police power, is properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship.”).</p>
<p id="c5f34e66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The potential unfairness of paying market value may be especially acute if the property taken is a home or a small business. In such cases, the owner may have substantial emotional attachment to the property, and no amount of compensation will make up for the loss. We saw such a case with Susette Kelo, who refused to sell her house in New London. <i>See</i> §1.2 above. Our legal system allows this where such takings are necessary to collect the properties required for the common good, such as public roads. It arguably also reflects the fact that vulnerability to having one’s property taken is one of the obligations imposed on citizens in a democracy. <i>Cf.</i> Brian Angelo Lee, <i>Just Undercompensation: The Idiosyncratic Premium in Eminent Domain</i>, 113 Colum. L. Rev. 593, 622 (2013) (“Each member of the community has a social duty, in his or her relationship with property, not to impose too much upon the well-being of other members of the community, and a ready criterion for what is too much’ in the property context is what appreciably exceeds the ordinary community member’s level of imposition.”).</p>
<p id="c5f34e67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few states have legislation mandating payment of 125 or 150 percent of fair market value when property is taken for public use. For example, Indiana requires payment of 150 percent of fair market value if a residence is taken. Ind. Code §32-24-4.5-8(2)(A). Although this may mitigate the harm to the owner, it cannot fully compensate for losses that cannot be measured in dollar terms and for which money cannot make the owner whole. Such “super-compensation” statutes have the side effect of impeding voluntary transfers of property to the government at fair market value. Owners whose asking prices are near fair market value will likely refuse to sell for less than 150 percent of fair market value if statutes entitle them to recover this amount; in such cases, <span title="1171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1171">p. 1171</span>the government may be overcompensating. At the same time, such overcompensation may be justified to mitigate injustice to owners who really do value their homes at amounts far exceeding market value.</p>
<p id="c5f34e68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Moving costs, consequential loss, and business goodwill.</b> Do owners have a constitutional right to compensation for costs of moving to another location? Because the constitution provides compensation for the “property” taken, and nothing else, the Supreme Court has held that the answer is no. What about loss of business goodwill and going-concern value? Business goodwill is the “value which inheres in the fixed and favorable consideration of customers, arising from an established and well-known and well-conducted business.” <i>Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission</i>, 289 U.S. 287, 313 (1933). “Going-concern value” refers to “the many advantages inherent in acquiring an operating business as compared to starting a new business with only land, buildings and equipment in place.” <i>Gray Line Bus Co. v. Greater Bridgeport Transit District</i>, 449 A.2d 1036, 1039 (Conn. 1982). For example, a barber shop located on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge near Harvard Square depends on a particular customer base; taking the property means the business must close and seek another location, but it is not clear that such a location can be found for a comparable price. Nor is it clear that the customers will follow the barber to the new location.</p>
<p id="c5f34e69-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has refused to grant compensation for either goodwill or going-concern value on the ground that only the land and buildings are taken; the business is free to relocate elsewhere, where it may be as profitable if not more so. Any barrier to relocation is merely an incidental result of the taking of the land and is noncompensable. <i>Mitchell v. United States</i>, 267 U.S. 341 (1925); <i>see generally United States v. General Motors Corp.</i>, 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945) (distinguishing between compensable losses and noncompensable consequential harms from takings). <i>Accord, United States v. 0.073 Acres of Land</i>, 705 F.3d 540 (5th Cir. 2013) (taking of units in a townhouse development to facilitate rebuilding of levees after Hurricane Katrina did not constitute a taking of the homeowners association’s right to collect assessments on the properties, as that property interest was a noncompensable consequential loss). Can you reconcile this reasoning with the approach that states take to the treatment of goodwill as property to be divided upon divorce? <i>See</i> Chapter 9, §3.3.</p>
<p id="c5f34e6a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One exception to this general principle is applied in takings that are not permanent, which may entitle the business owner to compensation for loss of goodwill. In <i>Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States</i>, 338 U.S. 1 (1949), the government temporarily took over a factory from 1942 to 1946, retaining most of the employees and using the laundry for military purposes. The Court accepted the owner’s argument that because the taking was temporary, the owner was unable to reestablish its business elsewhere during the takeover. Thus, the loss of going-concern value was compensable. <i>See also, e.g., Primetime Hospitality, Inc. v. Albuquerque</i>, 206 P.3d 112, 122-123 (N.M. 2009) (compensation for lost profits allowed following a temporary taking).</p>
<p id="c5f34e6b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Statutory compensation.</b> The federal government has passed legislation requiring compensation for moving costs, lost personal property occasioned by the <span title="1172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1172">p. 1172</span>move, and “actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business” if property is taken by the federal government or by state governments using federal funding. <i>See Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970,</i> 42 U.S.C. §§4601 to 4655. The act also provides extra compensation if a person’s home is taken. 42 U.S.C. §4623.</p>
<p id="c5f34e6c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have passed legislation providing for compensation for goodwill when a business is inextricably tied to a particular location and the loss cannot be avoided by relocation of the business after the land and structures are taken. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §1263.510; Ind. Code §32-24-4.5-8(2)(A); Wyo. Stat. §1-26-713. Some state courts have also allowed compensation for business losses in narrow instances if the business is not easily movable because of the unique character of the property. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> City of McCall v. Seubert</i>, 130 P.3d 1118, 1123 (Idaho 2005); <i>Housing Authority v. S.R.</i>, 264 S.E.2d 174 (Ga. 1980); <i>Housing &amp; Redevelopment Authority v.

<p id="c5f34e6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Nicole Garnett has argued that public agencies empowered to take property have incentives to avoid undercompensation, including financial penalties if mandatory negotiations with owners fail and an obligation to pay statutory compensation to displaced owners that can be substantially above the constitutional minimum. Such agencies, Garnett also argues, may avoid taking property that people are particularly attached to not because just compensation takes that subjective value into account, but because such owners are more likely to challenge the taking and create political sympathy. <i>See</i> Nicole Stelle Garnett, <i>The Neglected Political Economy of Eminent Domain</i>, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 101 (2006). On the other hand, there is empirical evidence to suggest that agencies tend to undercompensate lower-valued property but overcompensate higher-value property. <i>See</i> Thomas W. Mitchell, Stephen Malpezzi &amp; Richard K. Green, <i>Forced Sale Risk: Class, Race, and the “Double Discount</i>,<i>”</i> 37 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 589, 632-638 (2010). How might these incentives shape the choices that public officials make about which public projects to pursue — and where?</p>
<p id="c5f34e6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Delineating the “property” taken.</b> In <i>Almota Farmers Elevator &amp; Warehouse v. United States</i>, 409 U.S. 470 (1972), the U.S. government took property from a railroad company that it had leased to a business that had constructed buildings on the property and used them for its business purposes. At the time of the taking, more than seven years remained on the lease. Although the lease did not give the lessee a legally enforceable right to renew the lease, the lessor had routinely renewed the lease in the past and was likely to do so in the future. There was no question that the leasehold held by the tenant was “property” compensable when taken by the government or that the value of the improvements during the remaining years of the lease should be counted in determining the market value of the lease, but the trial court had held that there should be no compensation for the likelihood that the lease would be renewed or for the value of the buildings that would remain after the lease ended.</p>
<p id="c5f34e6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court held that just compensation should be measured by the market value of the lease and that this included the “full monetary equivalent of the property taken. The owner is to be put in the same position monetarily as he would have <span title="1173" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1173">p. 1173</span>occupied if his property had not been taken.” <i>Id.</i> at 473-474. Since “fair market value” is defined by the amount “a willing buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller,” the lessee was entitled to be compensated for the value of the improvements on the land over their useful life, based on evidence that the lessor would likely have continued to renew the lease and that the lessee could have alienated the leasehold based on the ability of the purchaser to continue to use those buildings. <i>Id.</i> at 474. Four Justices dissented, arguing that the “property” taken by the government should be defined by the legal rights acquired by the government and that, in this case, the government condemned the leasehold and not the buildings or the business; because the tenant had no contractual right to renewal of the lease, it was not entitled to compensation for the mere expectation of renewal. 409 U.S. at 484-485 (Rehnquist, J, dissenting).</p>
<p id="c5f34e70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>United States v. 564.54 Acres of Land, More or Less</i>, 441 U.S. 506 (1979), however, the Supreme Court held that the owner was not entitled to the replacement cost of the buildings on the land that was taken. The owner operated three nonprofit summer camps along the Delaware River, and although the cost of building functionally equivalent facilities elsewhere was approximately $5.8 million, the fair market value of the properties taken was only $485,400. Justice Thurgood Marshall noted that “fair market value does not include the special value of property to the owner arising from its adaptability to his particular use.” <i>Id.</i> at 512. The Court acknowledged that this result might be unjust but found that “it is not at all unusual that property uniquely adapted to the owner’s use has a market value on condemnation which falls far short of enabling the owner to preserve that use.” <i>Id.</i> at 514. <i>Accord</i>,<i> United States v. 50 Acres of Land</i>, 469 U.S. 24 (1984) (public owner legally obligated to replace the facilities taken has no right to compensation for replacement costs).</p>
<p id="c5f34e71-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Partial takings.</b> Imagine an owner has 100 acres of farmland. If the state takes only 40 acres from the owner to build a government facility, rather than the property as a whole, it must compensate not only for the fair market value of those 40 acres but also for any reduction in value to the remaining 60 acres caused by the taking of the 40. This reduction in the value of the remaining 60 acres is called <b>severance damages</b>. <i>New Hampshire Department of Transportation v. Franchi</i>, 48 A.3d 849, 852 (N.H. 2012). For example, in <i>State v. Weiswasser</i>, 693 A.2d 864 (N.J. 1997), New Jersey took a sliver of property from a large undeveloped parcel near a major highway as part of road project. The court held that the owners were entitled to compensation not only for the physical property that was taken, but also for the diminution of value of the owners’ remaining property that was specifically attributable to the fact that the property could now not be seen as easily from the nearby highway, which made marketing development on the parcel more expensive. <i>Id.</i> at 876. <i>Accord</i>,<i> Utah Department of Transportation v.

<p id="c5f34e72-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, sometimes the taking will <i>increase</i> the value of the owner’s remaining property by providing a <b>special benefit</b> that will not accrue to the public at large. This can happen, for example, by placing a major road along the land in a way that will increase its attractiveness to retail business. It may be that all businesses in the area will benefit from improved traffic circulation, but some businesses will benefit <span title="1174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1174">p. 1174</span>specifically by being particularly close to the opportunity that new traffic creates — a benefit that derives from the taking itself. Where there are severance damages and special benefits, courts will generally reduce, or <i>offset</i>, the severance damages by the amount of the special benefit. <i>City of Maryland Heights v. Heitz</i>, 358 S.W.3d 98, 105-108 (Mo. Ct. App. 2011); <i>Oregon v. Fullerton</i>, 34 P.3d 1180 (Or. Ct. App. 2001). Some courts allow an offset for both special <i>and</i> <b>general benefits</b> accruing to the remaining property. <i>L.A. County v. Continental Development Corp.</i>, 941 P.2d 809 (Cal. 1997); <i>see also McCoy v. Union Elevated Railroad Co.</i>, 247 U.S. 354, 366 (1918) (holding that “we are unable to say that [an owner] suffers deprivation of any fundamental right when a state . . . permits consideration of actual benefits-enhancement in market value flowing directly from a public work, although all in the neighborhood receive like advantages”).</p>
<p id="c5f34e73-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts are divided on the question whether the government may reduce the amount it owes to an owner for property actually taken by the amount of the special benefit accruing to the land not taken. For example, assume the 40 acres taken by the government are worth $200,000 but the taking provides a special benefit that increases the value of the remaining 60 acres by $50,000. Under an old Supreme Court case, <i>Bauman v. Ross</i>, 167 U.S. 548 (1897), the increase in value from a special benefit to the remaining 60 acres would be offset against the amount due for the taking of the 40 acres; thus, the owner would receive only $150,000. A substantial number of states agree. <i>E-470 Public Highway Authority v. Revenig</i>, 91 P.3d 1038, 1043-1044 (Colo. 2004); <i>see also Department of Transportation v. Rowe</i>, 549 S.E.2d 203 (N.C. 2001). However, most states do not allow such an offset, and instead would award the owner the full $200,000 for the taken land without any reduction for the increase in the value of the retained land. <i>Williams Natural Gas Co. v. Perkins</i>, 952 P.2d 483 (Okla. 1997). Is granting an owner full value for property taken as well as the increase in value to any retained property from the taking a fair measure of compensation to an owner?</p>
<p id="c5f34e74-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New Jersey recently changed its longstanding rule that limited any reduction in compensation for partial takings to special benefits. In <i>Borough of Harvey Cedars v. Karan</i>, 70 A.3d 524 (N.J. 2013), the borough government took part of a couple’s beachfront property to construct dunes to prevent erosion or loss during storms. At the condemnation trial, the court allowed the owners to introduce evidence that the dunes had reduced the value of their home by obstructing their view, but did not allow the borough to introduce evidence that the dune had enhanced the value of the couple’s home by protecting it from storms and ocean surges. The jury awarded the couple $375,000. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed. “In a partial-takings case,” the court held, “homeowners are entitled to the fair market value of their loss, not to a windfall, not to a pay out that disregards the home’s enhanced value resulting from a public project.” <i>Id.</i> at 527. That meant that just compensation for a partial taking “must be based on a consideration of all relevant, reasonably calculable, and non-conjectural factors that either decrease or increase the value of the remaining property,” including in this case that “the dune would likely spare the Karans’ home from total destruction in certain fierce storms and from other damage in lesser storms.” <i>Id.</i> This eliminated the distinction between special and general benefits, and instead <span title="1175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1175">p. 1175</span>simply required any benefits to the owner, if reasonably quantifiable, to be measured against losses in market value caused by the partial taking.</p>

<p id="c5f34e77-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Starting around 2006, the real estate market in the U.S. began to suffer a significant downturn. <i>See</i> Chapter 12, §4.2. In the wake of the subprime crisis, home values plummeted, leaving many owners “underwater,” meaning that they owe more — sometimes multiple times more — on their mortgage loans than their homes are worth. Refinancing these mortgages would reduce the incentive to default and the risk of foreclosure, relieving the burden on communities where cascades of foreclosure have caused significant harm. However, many of these mortgages were securitized, posing significant barriers to renegotiation. Securitized mortgages are typically managed by servicers who may have no incentive to renegotiate, and often contractually cannot renegotiate without the agreement of a supermajority of the disparate investors with interests in the securities.

Hockett, <i>It Takes a Village: Municipal Condemnation Proceedings and Public/Private Partnerships for Mortgage Loan Modification, Value Preservation, and Local Economic Recovery</i>, 18 Stan. J.L.

<p id="c5f34e78-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A private company called Mortgage Resolution Partners has proposed working with local governments to use eminent domain to solve this impasse. A local government would condemn a homeowner’s loan, using funds provided by private investors to pay just compensation to the lender. The compensation for these loans would be set based on the fact that if an underwater mortgage were sold on the open market, its value should be less than its face value because the security for the loan is worth less than the outstanding debt. The local government, now the owner of the mortgage loan, would then negotiate with the borrower — the homeowner — to refinance the mortgage at a rate that more clearly reflected the home’s post-crisis value. <i>See</i> Tad Friend, <i>Home Economics: Can an Entrepreneur’s Audacious Plan Fix the Mortgage Mess?</i>, New Yorker, Feb. 4, 2013, at 26.</p>

Rands</i>, 389 U.S. 121, 125-126 (1967) (state-created riparian rights that “are not assertable against the superior rights of the United States, are not property” for the takings clause even though they might be enforceable against private parties). As a general matter, the Supreme Court has noted that <span title="1176" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1176">p. 1176</span>“[b]ecause the Constitution protects rather than creates property interests, the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.’ ” <i>Phillips v.

<p id="c5f3758f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of interests in land and most personal property, determining whether the interest is “private property” for purposes of the takings clause is not often controversial, although it can be. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>, <i>Lynch v.

<p id="c5f37599-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice S<span class="epub-small-caps">TANLEY</span> R<span class="epub-small-caps">EED</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5f3759a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case rests upon a claim under the Fifth Amendment by petitioner, an identifiable group of American Indians of between 60 and 70 individuals residing in Alaska, for compensation for a taking by the United States of certain timber from Alaskan lands allegedly belonging to the group. The area claimed is said to contain over 350,000 acres of land and 150 square miles of water. The Tee-Hit-Tons, a clan of the Tlingit Tribe, brought this suit in the Court of Claims under 28 U.S.C. §1505. The compensation claimed does not arise from any statutory direction to pay. Payment, if it can be compelled, must be based upon a constitutional right of the Indians to recover.</p>
<p id="c5f3759b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Claims held that petitioner was an identifiable group of American Indians residing in Alaska; that its interest in the lands prior to purchase of Alaska by the <span title="1177" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1177">p. 1177</span>United States in 1867 was “original Indian title” or “Indian right of occupancy.” It was further held that if such original Indian title survived the Treaty of 1867, 15 Stat. 539, Arts. III and VI, by which Russia conveyed Alaska to the United States, such title was not sufficient basis to maintain this suit as there had been no recognition by Congress of any legal rights in petitioner to the land in question. [W]e granted certiorari.</p>
<p id="c5f3759c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Alaskan area in which petitioner claims a compensable interest is located near and within the exterior lines of the Tongass National Forest. By Joint Resolution of August 8, 1947, 61 Stat. 920, the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to contract for the sale of national forest timber located within this National Forest “notwithstanding any claim of possessory rights.” The Resolution defines “possessory rights”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1065F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1065F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">15</a></span> and provides for all receipts from the sale of timber to be maintained in a special account in the Treasury until the timber and land rights are finally determined.</p>
<p id="c5f3759e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Secretary of Agriculture, on August 20, 1951, contracted for sale to a private company of all merchantable timber in the area claimed by petitioner. This is the sale of timber which petitioner alleges constitutes a compensable taking by the United States of a portion of its proprietary interest in the land.</p>
<p id="c5f3759f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem presented is the nature of the petitioner’s interest in the land, if any. Petitioner claims a “full proprietary ownership” of the land; or, in the alternative, at least a “recognized” right to unrestricted possession, occupation and use. Either ownership or recognized possession, petitioner asserts, is compensable. If it has a fee simple interest in the entire tract, it has an interest in the timber and its sale is a partial taking of its right to “possess, use and dispose of it.” <i>United States v. General Motors</i>, 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945).</p>
<p id="c5f375a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I. Recognition</i></p>
<p id="c5f375a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the Congress by treaty or other agreement has declared that thereafter Indians were to hold the lands permanently, compensation must be paid for subsequent taking. The petitioner contends that Congress has sufficiently “recognized” its possessory rights in the land in question so as to make its interest compensable. Petitioner points specifically to two statutes to sustain this contention.</p>
<p id="c5f375a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have carefully examined these statutes and the pertinent legislative history and find nothing to indicate any intention by Congress to grant to the Indians any permanent rights in the lands of Alaska occupied by them by permission of Congress.</p>
<p id="c5f375a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Indian Title</i></p>
<p id="c5f39cb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled that in all the States of the Union the tribes who inhabited the lands of the States held claim to such lands after the coming of the white man, under what is sometimes termed original Indian title or permission from the whites to occupy. That description means mere possession not specifically recognized as ownership by Congress. After conquest they were permitted to occupy portions of territory <span title="1178" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1178">p. 1178</span>over which they had previously exercised “sovereignty,” as we use that term. This is not a property right but amounts to a right of occupancy which the sovereign grants and protects against intrusion by third parties but which right of occupancy may be terminated and such lands fully disposed of by the sovereign itself without any legally enforceable obligation to compensate the Indians.</p>
<p id="c5f39cb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This position of the Indian has long been rationalized by the legal theory that discovery and conquest gave the conquerors sovereignty over and ownership of the lands thus obtained. The great case of <i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i>, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823), denied the power of an Indian tribe to pass their right of occupancy to another. It confirmed the practice of two hundred years of American history “that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest.” 8 Wheat. at 587.</p>

<p id="c5f39cb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be, respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted. 8 Wheat. at 590-591.</p>

<p id="c5f39cb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Beecher v. Wetherby</i>, 95 U.S. 517 (1877), a tract of land which Indians were then expressly permitted by the United States to occupy was granted to Wisconsin. In a controversy over timber, this Court held the Wisconsin title good.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f39cb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The grantee, it is true, would take only the naked fee, and could not disturb the occupancy of the Indians: that occupancy could only be interfered with or determined by the United States. It is to be presumed that in this matter the United States would be governed by such considerations of justice as would control a Christian people in their treatment of an ignorant and dependent race. Be that as it may, the propriety or justice of their action towards the Indians with respect to their lands is a question of governmental policy, and is not a matter open to discussion in a controversy between third parties, neither of whom derives title from the Indians. The right of the United States to dispose of the fee of lands occupied by them has always been recognized by this court from the foundation of the government. 95 U.S. at 525.</p>

<p id="c5f39cb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1941 a unanimous Court wrote, concerning Indian title, the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f39cba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Extinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course a different matter. The power of Congress in that regard is supreme. The manner, method and time of such extinguishment raise political, not justiciable issues. <i>United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R.

</div>
<p id="c5f39cbb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No case in this Court has ever held that taking of Indian title or use by Congress required compensation. The American people have compassion for the descendants of those Indians who were deprived of their homes and hunting grounds by the drive of civilization. They seek to have the Indians share the benefits of our society as citizens of this Nation. Generous provision has been willingly made to allow tribes to recover for wrongs, as a matter of grace, not because of legal liability.</p>
<p id="c5f39cbc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is true, not because an Indian or an Indian tribe has no standing to sue or because the United States has not consented to be sued for the taking of original Indian title, but because Indian occupation of land without government recognition of <span title="1179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1179">p. 1179</span>ownership creates no rights against taking or extinction by the United States protected by the Fifth Amendment or any other principle of law.</p>
<p id="c5f39cbd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What has been heretofore set out deals largely with the Indians of the Plains and east of the Mississippi. The Tee-Hit-Tons urge, however, that their stage of civilization and their concept of ownership of property takes them out of the rule applicable to the Indians of the States. They assert that Russia never took their lands in the sense that European nations seized the rest of America. The Court of Claims, however, saw no distinction between their use of the land and that of the Indians of the Eastern United States. That court had no evidence that the Russian handling of the Indian land problem differed from ours. The natives were left the use of the great part of their vast hunting and fishing territory but what Russia wanted for its use and that of its licensees, it took. The court’s conclusion on this issue was based on strong evidence.</p>
<p id="c5f39cbe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering the character of the Tee-Hit-Tons’ use of the land, the Court of Claims had before it the testimony of a single witness who was offered by plaintiff. He stated that he was the chief of the Tee-Hit-Ton tribe. He qualified as an expert on the Tlingits, a group composed of numerous interconnected tribes including the Tee-Hit-Tons. His testimony showed that the Tee-Hit-Tons had become greatly reduced in numbers. Membership descends only through the female line. At the present time there are only a few women of childbearing age and a total membership of some 65.</p>
<p id="c5f39cbf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The witness pointed out that their claim of ownership was based on possession and use. The use that was made of the controverted area was for the location in winter of villages in sheltered spots and in summer along fishing streams and/or bays. The ownership was not individual but tribal. As the witness stated, “Any member of the tribe may use any portion of the land that he wishes, and as long as he uses it that is his for his own enjoyment, and is not to be trespassed upon by anybody else, but the minute he stops using it then any other member of the tribe can come in and use that area.”</p>
<p id="c5f39cc0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The witness learned the alleged boundaries of the Tee-Hit-Ton area from hunting and fishing with his uncle after his return from Carlisle Indian School about 1904. From the knowledge so obtained, he outlined in red on the map, which petitioner filed as an exhibit, the territory claimed by the Tee-Hit-Tons. Use by other tribal members is sketchily asserted. This is the same 350,000 acres claimed by the petition. On it he marked six places to show the Indians’ use of the land: (1) his great uncle was buried here, (2) a town, (3) his uncle’s house, (4) a town, (5) his mother’s house, (6) smokehouse. He also pointed out the uses of this tract for fishing salmon and for hunting beaver, deer and mink.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony further shows that while membership in the tribe and therefore ownership in the common property descended only through the female line, the various tribes of the Tlingits allowed one another to use their lands. Before power boats, the Indians would put their shelters for hunting and fishing away from villages. With the power boats, they used them as living quarters.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to this verbal testimony, exhibits were introduced by both sides as to the land use. These exhibits are secondary authorities but they bear out the general proposition that land claims among the Tee-Hit-Tons [were] wholly tribal. It was more <span title="1180" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1180">p. 1180</span>a claim of sovereignty than of ownership. There were scattered shelters and villages moved from place to place as game or fish became scarce. There was recognition of tribal rights to hunt and fish on certain general areas, with claims to that effect carved on totem poles. From all that was presented, the Court of Claims concluded, and we agree, that the Tee-Hit-Tons were in a hunting and fishing stage of civilization, with shelters fitted to their environment, and claims to rights to use identified territory for these activities as well as the gathering of wild products of the earth.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The line of cases adjudicating Indian rights on American soil leads to the conclusion that Indian occupancy, not specifically recognized as ownership by action authorized by Congress, may be extinguished by the Government without compensation. Every American schoolboy knows that the savage tribes of this continent were deprived of their ancestral ranges by force and that, even when the Indians ceded millions of acres by treaty in return for blankets, food and trinkets, it was not a sale but the conquerors’ will that deprived them of their land.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the light of the history of Indian relations in this Nation, no other course would meet the problem of the growth of the United States except to make congressional contributions for Indian lands rather than to subject the Government to an obligation to pay the value when taken with interest to the date of payment. Our conclusion does not uphold harshness as against tenderness toward the Indians, but it leaves with Congress, where it belongs, the policy of Indian gratuities for the termination of Indian occupancy of Government-owned land rather than making compensation for its value a rigid constitutional principle.</p>

[Section 8 provides that] “the Indians or other persons in said district shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them but the terms under which such persons may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress.” Respondent contends, and the Court apparently agrees, that this provision should be read, not as recognizing Indian title, but as reserving the question whether they have any rights in the land.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In the debates about the Act,] Senator Benjamin Harrison [said] it was the intention of the committee “to save from all possible invasion the rights of the Indian residents of Alaska . . . except in so far as it was necessary in order to establish title to mining claims in the Territory.” The conclusion seems clear that Congress in the 1884 Act recognized the claims of these Indians to their Alaskan lands. [Given uncertainty about the extent of Indian claims,] Congress did the humane thing of saving to the Indians all rights claimed; it let them keep what they had prior to the new Act. The future course of action was made clear — conflicting claims would be reconciled and the Indian lands would be put into reservations.</p>
<p id="c5f39cc8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That purpose is wholly at war with the one now attributed to the Congress of reserving for some future day the question whether the Indians were to have any rights to the land.</p>

<p id="c5f39ccb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Indian title and the takings clause.</b> As far back as 1835, the Supreme Court called it “a settled principle, that [American Indians’] right of occupancy is considered as sacred as the fee simple of the whites.” <i>Mitchel v. United States</i>, 34 U.S. 711, 746 (1835). Since 1790, federal statutes have criminalized trespass on tribal land and required restitution for damage to tribal property. The federal government has repeatedly sued to protect or seek damages for interference with the tribal right of occupancy, regardless of whether that right was guaranteed by the federal government. <i>See United States v. Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Co.</i>, 314 U.S. 339, 345 (1941) (“Unquestionably it has been the policy of the federal government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy . . .”). Congress also enacted many laws waiving sovereign immunity so that tribes could sue the federal government for taking of tribal property. Nonetheless, <i>Tee-Hit-Ton</i> holds that Indian title is not property within the meaning of the fifth amendment’s taking clause, and can instead can be abrogated by the United States without compensation. Only Indian title recognized by Congress through a treaty or statute constitutes property that cannot be taken without just compensation. What justifies this distinction?</p>
<p id="c5f39ccc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Statutory compensation after <i>Tee-Hit-Ton.</i></b> Although not constitutionally compelled to do so, in 1971 Congress enacted the <i>Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</i>, compensating native inhabitants of Alaska for the loss of their land in the amount of $962.5 million and reserving approximately 45 million acres of federal public lands to Alaska Native villages. 43 U.S.C. §1601 <i>et seq</i>.; <i>Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law</i> §4.07[3][b][ii][B], at 330 (Nell Newton et al. eds. 2012 ed.). In return, the Native Alaskans agreed to extinguishment of claims to an additional 335 million acres. The act was catalyzed by the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay in 1968. Because Alaska Natives likely still had property claims against private individuals, oil developers pressed Congress to reach a settlement with Alaska Natives to avoid uncertainty in mineral development.</p>
<p id="c5f39ccd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Interest on past expropriations.</b> Perhaps the greatest practical significance of <i>Tee-Hit-Ton</i> was that it helped protect the United States from having to pay interest on claims based on seizure of Indian lands. In 1946, Congress had enacted the <i>Indian Claims Commission Act</i> (ICCA), 60 Stat. 1049, 25 U.S.C. §70 <i>et seq</i>., which allowed Indian nations to bring claims against the United States for uncompensated (or poorly compensated) takings of their property. The ICCA granted compensation for takings of both original Indian title land and recognized title land; the amount of compensation due was measured by the value of the land at the time of the taking — in many cases, low, nineteenth-century values. Interest, however, was paid only in takings of recognized title land since only such takings were found to have violated the fifth amendment. In a portion of the <i>Tee-Hit-Ton</i> opinion not included in the excerpt above, the Court noted that “if aboriginal Indian title was compensable without specific legislation to that effect, there were claims with estimated interest already pending under the Indian jurisdictional act aggregating $9,000,000,000.” Of this $9 billion, <span title="1182" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1182">p. 1182</span>$8 billion was interest. Nell Jessup Newton, <i>At the Whim of the Sovereign: Aboriginal Title Reconsidered</i>, 31 Hastings L.J. 1215, 1248 (1980). The <i>Tee-Hit-Ton</i> decision, in effect, saved the United States $8 billion, almost $70 billion in 2012 dollars.</p>
<p id="c5f39cce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Compensation for the taking of recognized Indian title.</b> In 1868, the United States entered the <i>Fort Laramie Treaty</i> with the Sioux Nation, 15 Stat. 635, and pledged that the Great Sioux Reservation, including the Black Hills, would be “set apart for [their] absolute and undisturbed use and occupation,” “solemnly agree[ing]” that no unauthorized persons “shall ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in [this] territory.” In return, the Sioux agreed to relinquish their rights under a prior treaty to occupy territories outside the reservation, while reserving their right to hunt on some of those lands. The treaty also provided that no agreement to cede any of the reservation “shall be of any validity or force as against the said Indians, unless executed and signed by at least three fourths of all the adult male Indians, occupying or interested in the same.”</p>
<p id="c5f3c3df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1874, Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer led an expedition to the Reservation, confirming the presence of gold in the region. That led to an intense popular demand for the “opening” of the Black Hills for settlement. In 1875, President Grant secretly instructed the military to stop protecting the Sioux from invasion by settlers. That winter, the military also sought to prevent the Sioux from hunting off the reservation; these efforts initially led to the Sioux victory in the Battle of Little Big Horn, but the hunters were eventually rounded up, deprived of their horses and weapons, and left dependent on government rations. In 1876, Congress sought new land cessions, threatening to stop supplying rations if they did not sign. The resulting agreement was signed by only 10 percent of the adult male Sioux population in violation of the <i>Fort Laramie Treaty</i>. It was enacted into law on Feb. 28, 1877.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians</i>, 448 U.S. 371 (1980), found that the <i>1877 Act</i> constituted a compensable taking. In its opinion, the Supreme Court noted that previous cases had held that the United States may manage tribal lands as a trustee for Indian nations and had discretion to exchange tribal lands for other property so long as it made a good faith effort to provide fair compensation. But the power to manage did not extend “ so far as to enable the Government to give the tribal lands to others, or to appropriate them to its own purposes, without rendering, or assuming an obligation to render, just compensation. Spoliation is not management.’ ” 448 U.S. at 408 (quoting <i>Shoshone Tribe v. United States</i>, 299 U.S. 476, 477, 478 (1937)). The question was how to distinguish between a “good faith effort” to manage tribal property and an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation:</p>

<p id="c5f3c3e9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has broadly interpreted the police power to allow states to regulate property for public health, welfare, and safety. <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926). In a long line of cases, the Court held that in exercising this authority, the state was not required to compensate owners for any resulting loss in value to their property. For example, in <i>Mugler v. Kansas</i>, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), the Court held that a state statute that prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages did not constitute a “taking” of the plaintiff’s property. It reached this result even though the brewery had been constructed solely for the purpose of manufacturing such beverages, the property had “little value” for any other purpose, and that purpose had been lawful at the time plaintiff invested in building the factory and its business. The Court declared that “[a] prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property.” <i>Id.</i> at 668-669. Two years later, <i>Powell v. Pennsylvania</i>, 127 U.S. 678 (1888), held that it was permissible to outlaw completely the manufacture of oleomargarine, even if the value of the plaintiff’s buildings and equipment “would be entirely lost,” so long as the legislature passed the law for the purpose of protecting public health and preventing fraud. Similarly, in <i>Hadacheck v. Sebastian</i>, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), the Court upheld a city ordinance prohibiting the operation of an established brickyard, although the owner had made excavations on the land that prevented it from being utilized for any other purpose and the brickyard was lawful when the owner started operating. The Court held that it was within the legislative power to declare the business a nuisance and that the city need not compensate even if that declaration destroyed the business.</p>

<p id="c5f3c3ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice O<span class="epub-small-caps">LIVER</span> W<span class="epub-small-caps">ENDELL</span> H<span class="epub-small-caps">OLMES</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a bill in equity brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Pennsylvania Coal Company from mining under their property in such way as to remove the supports and cause a subsidence of the surface and of their house. The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface but in express terms reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same and the grantee takes the premises with the risk and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that whatever may have been the Coal Company’s rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921 (P.L. 1198), commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that if not restrained the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought but denied an injunction, holding that the statute if applied to this case would be unconstitutional. On appeal the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power and directed a decree for the plaintiffs. A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. But usually in ordinary private affairs the public interest does not warrant much of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public. The extent of the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the <span title="1185" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1185">p. 1185</span>statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land — a very valuable estate — and what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the plaintiffs’ position alone we should think it clear that the statute does not disclose a public interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of the defendant’s constitutionally protected rights.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, “For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it.” <i>Commonwealth v. Clearview Coal Co</i>., 100 A. 820 (Pa. 1917). What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. This we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that in <i>Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania</i>, 232 U.S. 531, it was held competent for the legislature to require a pillar of coal to the left along the line of adjoining property, that with the pillar on the other side of the line would be a barrier sufficient for the safety of the employees of either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water. But that was a requirement for the safety of employees invited into the mine, and secured an average reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various laws.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go — and if they go beyond the general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. In general it is not plain that a man’s misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor’s shoulders. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the <span title="1186" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1186">p. 1186</span>change. As we already have said this is a question of degree — and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions.</p>
<p id="c5f3c3f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice L<span class="epub-small-caps">OUIS</span> D. B<span class="epub-small-caps">RANDEIS</span> dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Coal in place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the Legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation; and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>
<p id="c5f3eb0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If by mining anthracite coal the owner would necessarily unloose poisonous gases, I suppose no one would doubt the power of the state to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may not the state, likewise, without paying compensation, prohibit one from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the community to like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying on the business would be a public nuisance.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that one fact for consideration in determining whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the resulting diminution in value, and that here the restriction destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If we are to consider the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the land. That is, with the value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole. The estate of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as extending ab orco usque ad coelum. But I suppose no one would contend that by selling his interest above 100 feet from the surface he could prevent the state from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a city. And why should a sale <span title="1187" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1187">p. 1187</span>of underground rights bar the state’s power? For aught that appears the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction may be negligible as compared with the value of the whole property, or even as compared with that part of it which is represented by the coal remaining in place and which may be extracted despite the statute.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet it is said that these provisions of the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems to rest upon the assumption that in order to justify such exercise of the police power there must be “an average reciprocity of advantage” as between the owner of the property restricted and the rest of the community; and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage is an important consideration, and may even be an essential [one], where the state’s power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the property of a neighborhood, as in drainage projects or upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions. But where the police power is exercised, not to confer benefits upon property owners but to protect the public from detriment and danger, there is in my opinion, no room for considering reciprocity of advantage . . . unless it be the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the act to the coal operators.</p>

Contemporary regulatory takings claims do not rely directly on <i>Mahon</i> for a doctrinal test, but echoes of Justice Holmes’s reasoning can be heard in the modern cases.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are several ways that one might interpret <i>Mahon</i> to discern when a regulation has gone “too far.” One way is to focus on the magnitude of the harm to an owner. At some point, under this view, a restriction on property has crossed a threshold of permissible harm regardless of the importance of the public purpose at issue, and compensation must be provided. This might be so because, from an owner’s perspective, such a regulation is the functional equivalence of an actual physical taking by the government, which requires compensation even though the exercise of the power of eminent domain must be for a valid public purpose.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another interpretation of <i>Mahon</i> is that determining when a regulation has gone too far requires balancing public interest against private harm. In this view, the determinative question is not simply the diminution in an owner’s value, but also the extent to which the public interest demands such diminution. Pennsylvania Coal in this case had purchased the “support estate,” a distinct estate under Pennsylvania law consisting of the subsurface support needed to keep the surface from collapsing. On one view, then, Justice Holmes may have viewed the act as primarily serving private interests by shifting the support estate back to the surface estate holders. <i>See</i> William Michael Treanor, <i>Jam for Justice Holmes: Reassessing the Significance of</i> Mahon, 86 Geo. L.J. 813, 859-860 (1998).</p>
<p id="c5f3eb14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1188">p. 1188</span>A third way to read <i>Mahon</i> is that the case is more generally about when it is fair to <i>concentrate</i> harms as opposed to asking the general public to bear a given burden. “In general it is not plain,” Justice Holmes wrote, “that a man’s misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor’s shoulders.”</p>
<p id="c5f3eb15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor William Treanor has argued that Justice Holmes viewed the case as involving a different concern: the role of the state not as regulator but as an interested party acquiring property for the public. According to Professor Treanor, Holmes was concerned that Pennsylvania was trying to protect public property by acquiring only surface estates and then requiring subsurface estates to be left in place without paying for that right. As Treanor noted, private risks posed by subsidence could have been protected by notice from coal companies, but there was “greater evidence of real harm with respect to public lands. The record in the case shows that, while homeowners might have avoided danger, the same was not true of people travelling on public roads and children going to school.” Treanor, <i>supra</i>, at 859-860. In correspondence with then professor, later Justice, Felix Frankfurter, Holmes wrote that he regretted not “bring[ing] out more clearly the distinction between the rights of the public generally and their rights in respect of being in a particular place where they have no right to be at all except so far as they have paid for it.” Letter from Oliver Wendell Holmes to Felix Frankfurter (Feb. 14, 1923), in<i> Holmes and Frankfurter: Their Correspondence, 1912-1934</i>, 150 (Robert M. Mennel &amp; Christine L. Compston eds. 1996). In this view, then, what went “too far” in <i>Mahon</i> was the state acting to acquire property for its own purposes without paying for that property.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court effectively repudiated the result in <i>Mahon</i> in <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. DeBenedictis</i>, 480 U.S. 470 (1987), which upheld the constitutionality of a similar law. However, the principle <i>Mahon</i> established is settled law; regulations that “go too far” — however that line is determined — may be deemed takings of property. </p>
<p id="c5f3eb17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Average reciprocity of advantage and the harm/benefit distinction.</b> How does Justice Holmes address cases such as <i>Mugler</i> and <i>Powell</i>? What about Justice Brandeis? Should it make a difference in terms of whether a restriction on property requires compensation that the regulatory regime creates reciprocal harms and benefits, as where a rule requiring an owner to maintain a party wall also protects that owner from harm by her neighbors? One way to think about reciprocity of advantage is that certain regulations, however onerous the burden, provide a kind of implicit compensation that mitigates the unfairness of not directly compensating owners.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. What is the extent of the property being regulated?</b> How did Justice Holmes define the relevant property interest being regulated by the Kohler Act? How did Justice Brandeis in dissent approach this issue? Why does it matter?</p>
<p id="c5f3eb19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How one defines the property that is being regulated has come to be called the <b>denominator</b> question, and it is crucial in determining the extent to which a regulation diminishes the value of the property, among other aspects of takings law. <i>See Palazzolo v. Rhode Island</i>, 533 U.S. 606, 631 (2001) (noting “the difficult, persisting question of what is the proper denominator in the takings fraction”). In discussing <span title="1189" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1189">p. 1189</span>this question, Professor Margaret Jane Radin coined the term “conceptual severance,” which, she says,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f3eb1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">consists of delineating a property interest consisting of just what the government action has removed from the owner, and then asserting that that particular whole thing has been permanently taken. Thus this strategy hypothetically or conceptually “severs” from the whole bundle of rights just those strands that are interfered with by the regulation, and then hypothetically or conceptually construes those strands in the aggregate as a separate whole thing.</p>

<p id="c5f3eb1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that the takings clause serves “to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” <i>Armstrong v. United States</i>, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960). A regulation of property will therefore be deemed a taking if “fairness and justice” require a court to conclude that “the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest.” <i>Agins v. Tiburon</i>, 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980). In other words, regulations are not takings if they are “properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship,” <i>Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States</i>, 338 U.S. 1 (1949).</p>
<p id="c5f3eb1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is of more than passing interest that the standard the Supreme Court has adopted to determine whether a regulation has “taken” property is whether the burden the regulation imposes on the owner is just or fair. This places concepts of fairness and justice at the heart of both the takings clause and property law itself. It also assumes that owners have obligations as well as rights. Owners must live with substantial regulation designed to protect the interests of others affected by the exercise of their property rights, including other owners and non-owners, as well as the community at large. Nevertheless, fairness and justice place limits on the obligations individual owners can be forced to bear for the good of the community.</p>
<p id="c5f3eb20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Doctrinally, the vast majority of regulatory takings cases are analyzed under the test the Supreme Court articulated in <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). The <i>Penn Central</i> test requires courts to engage in “essentially <i>ad hoc</i>, factual inquiries” of the “particular circumstances” of each case, with a focus on three factors of “particular significance”: (1) the “economic impact” of the regulation on the particular owner; (2) the protection of “reasonable” or “distinct” “investment-backed expectations”; and (3) the “character of the governmental action.” <i>Id.</i> at 124; <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S. 164, 175 (1979). Most, but by no means all, regulations will be upheld under this test as legitimate exercises of the police power despite their impact on property use or value. <i>See</i> §3, below.</p>
<p id="c5f41231-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1190" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1190">p. 1190</span>While the Court normally applies this <b>ad hoc</b>, multifactor test to determine when a regulation becomes a taking, it has flirted with attempts to develop <i>per se</i> tests to identify types of regulations that constitute <b>categorical takings</b> for which compensation is required regardless of other factors. For a while the Court appeared to be intent on identifying more <i>per se</i> takings. However, the Court has now clarified that there are only “two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed <i>per se</i> takings.” <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</i>, 544 U.S. 528, 538 (2005).</p>
<div class="epub-feature epub-feature2 cc-feature-sidebar epub-feature-sidebar epub-sidebar-right">
<div class="epub-feature-heading2 cc-font-medium epub-text-left"><p id="c5f41233-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-left">Terms:</p></div>
<p id="c5f41234-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regulatory takings claims are brought through an action for <b>inverse condemnation</b>. This is a claim by a property owner against a public body alleging that a regulation has taken the owner’s property without just compensation. In the usual eminent domain case, the public body brings condemnation proceedings against the property and the court sets the amount of just compensation required. Lawsuits by property owners for damages are the “inverse” of this procedure.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5f41235-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two types of “categorical” takings are government-mandated “permanent physical invasions of property,” <i>id.</i>; <i>see Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</i>, 458 U.S. 419 (1982), and regulations that “completely deprive an owner of <i>all</i> economically viable use of her property [unless] background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner’s intended use of the property,” <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S. at 538; <i>see Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</i>, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). These cases apply in “relatively narrow” circumstances and will only “generally” be deemed <i>per se</i> takings. <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S. at 538. Thus even these two classes of cases are not always deemed takings of property. <i>See</i> §4, below.</p>
<p id="c5f41236-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>per se</i> categories apply the general rule; they merely identify particular circumstances that are almost certain to be classified as regulatory takings. For that reason, if a case does not qualify as a purportedly categorical taking, it may nonetheless be deemed an unconstitutional taking of property under the <i>Penn Central</i> test.</p>
<p id="c5f41237-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are additional types of regulations or laws that have significantly more chance to be deemed takings of property, even if the court has not characterized these categories as <i>per se</i> takings. The first involves the deprivation of certain core property rights or estates in land, such as the right to pass on fee simple property at death.<i> See, e.g.</i>, <i>Babbitt v. Youpee</i>, 519 U.S. 234 (1997). <i>See</i> §5.1, below. A second type of case involves retroactive deprivation of vested rights belonging to owners who invested in reasonable reliance on a prior regulatory authorization. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S. 164, 179-180 (1979). <i>See</i> §5.2, below. In addition, a Supreme Court plurality has suggested that judicial decisions that eliminate property rights, as opposed to legislation or executive action, might give rise to takings liability. <i>See</i> §5.3, below.</p>
<p id="c5f41238-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One final doctrinal category bears mention. The Supreme Court has held that in certain circumstances, conditions on land use development permits, commonly known as exactions, can be unconstitutional when those conditions do not “substantially advance[] the <i>same</i> interests that land-use authorities asserted would allow them to deny the permit altogether.” <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S. at 547; <i>see Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District</i>, 133 S. Ct. 420 (2013); <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, 512 U.S. 374 (1994); <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). As the Court explained in <i>Dolan</i>, the government “may not require a person to give up a constitutional right — [for example,] the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use — in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the <span title="1191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1191">p. 1191</span>government where the benefit has little or no relationship to the property.” 512 U.S. at 385. <i>See</i> §6, below.</p>

<p id="c5f4123b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1980, the Court stated that a regulatory taking would be found if a law “does not substantially advance legitimate state interests,” <i>Agins v</i>. <i>City of Tiburon</i>, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). This formulation suggested a version of a means-end test akin to due process analysis, but possibly with a higher level of scrutiny than the deferential rational basis standard. The formulation reflected longstanding confusion in the Court’s decisions about the interaction between due process and regulatory takings.</p>
<p id="c5f4394c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2005, however, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a regulation cannot be ruled to be an unconstitutional taking on that basis, and that it was improper to derive a test for regulatory takings based on due process precedents. <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</i>, 544 U.S. 528 (2005). In <i>Lingle</i>, the Court upheld a Hawai`i statute that limited the rents that oil companies could charge dealers leasing company-owned stations against claims that the law was unlikely to achieve its stated purpose of helping consumers because the oil companies could recoup any reductions in their rental income by raising wholesale gasoline prices. <i>Id.</i> at 544. The Court held that the judiciary should not be in the business of “scrutiniz[ing] the efficacy [of government regulations,] a task for which courts are not well suited [and which] might often require courts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies.” <i>Id.</i> A “substantially advances” inquiry, the Court noted,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f4394d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">suggests a means-ends test: It asks, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is <i>effective</i> in achieving some legitimate public purpose. An inquiry of this nature has some logic in the context of a due process challenge, for a regulation that fails to serve any legitimate governmental objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of the Due Process Clause. See, <i>e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis</i>, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998) (stating that the Due Process Clause is intended, in part, to protect the individual against “the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective”). But such a test is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been “taken” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5f4394e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 542. The Court thus made clear that despite the doctrinal variation in approaches to regulatory takings — a landscape we will be begin to explore in the next section — each approach “aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.” <i>Id.</i> at 539.</p>
<p id="c5f4394f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One area where the distinction between due process and regulatory takings continues to be unresolved involves retroactivity. It is clear that newly enacted laws that interfere with owners’ reliance interests can be unconstitutional; it is not clear, however, whether those interests are most appropriately protected by the takings clause or by the due process clause. As you work through regulatory takings doctrine for the remainder of this chapter, pay attention to this tension.</p>

<p id="c5f48786-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the New York City <i>Landmarks Preservation Law</i>, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (Commission) [may] designate a building to be a “landmark,” situated on a particular “landmark site,” or will designate an area to be a “historic district.” After the Commission makes a designation, New York City’s Board of Estimate may modify or disapprove the designation, and the owner may seek judicial review of the final designation decision. Final designation as a landmark imposes a duty upon the owner to keep the exterior features of the building “in good repair” [and requires] Commission [approval of] any proposal to alter the exterior architectural features of the landmark or to construct any exterior improvement on the landmark site. Under New York City’s zoning laws, owners of real property who have not developed their property to the full extent permitted by the applicable zoning laws are allowed to transfer development rights to [nearby] parcels.</p>
<p id="c5f48787-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves the application of New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Law to Grand Central Terminal (Terminal). The Terminal, which is owned by the Penn Central Transportation Co. and its affiliates (Penn Central), is one of New York City’s most famous buildings. Opened in 1913, it is regarded not only as providing an ingenious engineering solution to the problems presented by urban railroad stations, but also as a magnificent example of the French beaux-arts style.</p>
<p id="c5f48788-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Commission designated the Terminal a “landmark” and designated the “city tax block” it occupies a “landmark site” [and the] Board of Estimate confirmed this action on September 21, 1967. Although appellant Penn Central had opposed the designation before the Commission, it did not seek judicial review of the final designation decision.</p>
<p id="c5f48789-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Four months later,] appellant Penn Central entered into a [lease] with appellant UGP Properties, Inc., [under which] UGP was to construct a [50 story-high] office building above the Terminal.</p>
<p id="c5f4878a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commission rejected two different plans for the building on the ground that “balanc[ing] a 55-story office tower above a flamboyant Beaux-Arts facade seems nothing more than an aesthetic joke. Quite simply, the tower would overwhelm the Terminal by its sheer mass.”</p>
<p id="c5f4878b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1194">p. 1194</span>Appellants did not seek judicial review of the denial of either certificate. Instead, appellants filed suit in New York Supreme Court, Trial Term, claiming that the application of the Landmarks Preservation Law had “taken” their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and arbitrarily deprived them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5f4878c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>

<p id="c5f4878e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question of what constitutes a “taking” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty. While this Court has recognized that the “Fifth Amendment’s guarantee [is] designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole,” <i>Armstrong</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960), this Court, quite simply, has been unable to develop any “set formula” for determining when “justice and fairness” require that economic injuries caused by public action be compensated by the government, rather than remain disproportionately concentrated on a few persons. <i>See Goldblatt v. Hempstead</i>, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). Indeed, we have frequently observed that whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government’s failure to pay for any losses proximately caused by it depends largely “upon the particular circumstances [in that] case.” <i>United States v</i>. <i>Central Eureka Mining Co.</i>, 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958); <i>see United States v. Caltex, Inc.</i>, 344 U.S. 149, 156 (1952).</p>
<p id="c5f4878f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In engaging in these essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries, the Court’s decisions have identified several factors that have particular significance. The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations are, of course, relevant considerations. So, too, is the character of the governmental action. A “taking” may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government, see, e.g., <i>United States v. Causby</i>, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), than when interference arises from some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.</p>
<p id="c5f48790-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922), and this Court has accordingly recognized, in a wide variety of contexts, that government may execute laws or programs that adversely affect recognized economic value.</p>
<p id="c5f48791-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More importantly for the present case, in instances in which a state tribunal reasonably concluded that “the health, safety, morals, or general welfare” would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, this Court has upheld land-use regulations that destroyed or adversely affected recognized real property interests. Zoning laws are, of course, the classic example, see<i> Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (prohibition of industrial use); <i>Gorieb v. Fox</i>, 274 U.S. 603, 608 <span title="1195" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1195">p. 1195</span>(1927) (requirement that portions of parcels be left unbuilt); <i>Welch v. Swasey</i>, 214 U.S. 91 (1909) (height restriction), which have been viewed as permissible governmental action even when prohibiting the most beneficial use of the property.</p>
<p id="c5f48792-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Zoning laws generally do not affect existing uses of real property, but “taking” challenges have also been held to be without merit in a wide variety of situations when the challenged governmental actions prohibited a beneficial use to which individual parcels had previously been devoted and thus caused substantial individualized harm. <i>Miller v. Schoene</i>, 276 U.S. 272 (1928), is illustrative. In that case, [a] unanimous Court [found no taking when the state ordered the destruction of many ornamental red cedar trees to prevent the transmission of cedar rust fatal to apple trees cultivated nearby.] The Court held that the State might properly make “a choice between the preservation of one class of property and that of the other” and since the apple industry was important in the State involved, concluded that the State had not exceeded “its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property [without compensation] in order to save another which, in the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public.” <i>Id.</i> at 279.</p>
<p id="c5f48793-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Again, <i>Hadacheck v. Sebastian</i>, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), upheld a law prohibiting the claimant from continuing his otherwise lawful business of operating a brickyard in a particular physical community on the ground that the legislature had reasonably concluded that the presence of the brickyard was inconsistent with neighboring uses. <i>See also Walls v. Midland Carbon Co.</i>, 254 U.S. 300 (1920) (law prohibiting manufacture of carbon black upheld); <i>Reinman v. Little Rock</i>, 237 U.S. 171 (1915) (law prohibiting livery stable upheld); <i>Mugler v. Kansas</i>, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting liquor business upheld).</p>
<p id="c5f48794-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Goldblatt v. Hempstead</i>,<i> supra</i>, [upheld a 1958 city safety ordinance that] effectively prohibited the claimant from continuing a sand and gravel mining business that had been operated on the particular parcel since 1927. The Court upheld the ordinance against a “taking” challenge, although the ordinance prohibited the present and presumably most beneficial use of the property and had, like the regulations in <i>Miller</i> and <i>Hadacheck</i>, severely affected a particular owner. The Court assumed that the ordinance did not prevent the owner’s reasonable use of the property since the owner made no showing of an adverse effect on the value of the land. Because the restriction served a substantial public purpose, the Court thus held no taking had occurred.</p>
<p id="c5f4aea5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), [found a taking when a law] forbade any mining of coal that caused the subsidence of any house, unless the house was the property of the owner of the underlying coal and was more than 150 feet from the improved property of another. Because the statute made it commercially impracticable to mine the coal, and thus had nearly the same effect as the complete destruction of rights claimant had reserved from the owners of the surface land, the Court held that the statute was invalid as effecting a “taking” without just compensation. <i>See generally</i> Michelman, <i>Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law</i>, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1229-34 (1967).</p>
<p id="c5f4aea6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, government actions that may be characterized as acquisitions of resources to permit or facilitate uniquely public functions have often been held to constitute <span title="1196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1196">p. 1196</span>“takings.” <i>United States v. Causby</i>, 328 U.S. 256 (1946), is illustrative. In holding that direct over flights above the claimant’s land that destroyed the present use of the land as a chicken farm, constituted a “taking,” <i>Causby</i> emphasized that Government had not “merely destroyed property [but was] using a part of it for the flight of its planes.” <i>Id.</i> at 262-63 n.7.</p>
<p id="c5f4aea7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5f4aea8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants urge that the Landmarks Law has deprived them of any gainful use of their “air rights” above the Terminal and that, irrespective of the value of the remainder of their parcel, the city has “taken” their right to this superjacent airspace, thus entitling them to “just compensation” measured by the fair market value of these air rights.</p>
<p id="c5f4aea9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he submission that appellants may establish a “taking” simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest that they heretofore had believed was available for development is quite simply untenable. Were this the rule, this Court would have erred not only in upholding laws restricting the development of air rights, but also in approving those prohibiting both the subjacent, and the lateral development of particular parcels. “Taking” jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a particular governmental action has effected a taking, this Court focuses rather both on the character of the action and on the nature and extent of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole — here, the city tax block designated as the “landmark site.”</p>
<p id="c5f4aeaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondly, appellants, focusing on the character and impact of the New York City law, argue that it effects a “taking” because its operation has significantly diminished the value of the Terminal site. Appellants concede that the decisions sustaining other land-use regulations, which, like the New York City law, are reasonably related to the promotion of the general welfare, uniformly reject the proposition that diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a “taking,” <i>see Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926) (75% diminution in value caused by zoning law); <i>Hadacheck v. Sebastian</i>, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (87 1/2% diminution in value); and that the “taking” issue in these contexts is resolved by focusing on the uses the regulations permit. Appellants, moreover, also do not dispute that a showing of diminution in property value would not establish a “taking” if the restriction had been imposed as a result of historic-district legislation, but appellants argue that New York City’s regulation of individual landmarks is fundamentally different from zoning or from historic-district legislation because the controls imposed by New York City’s law apply only to individuals who own selected properties.</p>
<p id="c5f4aeab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stated baldly, appellants’ position appears to be that the only means of ensuring that selected owners are not singled out to endure financial hardship for no reason is to hold that any restriction imposed on individual landmarks pursuant to the New York City scheme is a “taking” requiring the payment of “just compensation.” Agreement with this argument would, of course, invalidate not just New York City’s law, but all comparable landmark legislation in the Nation. We find no merit in it.</p>
<p id="c5f4aeac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1197">p. 1197</span>It is true, as appellants emphasize, that both historic-district legislation and zoning laws regulate all properties within given physical communities whereas landmark laws apply only to selected parcels. But, contrary to appellants’ suggestions, landmark laws are not like discriminatory, or “reverse spot,” zoning: that is, a land-use decision which arbitrarily singles out a particular parcel for different, less favorable treatment than the neighboring ones. In contrast to discriminatory zoning, which is the antithesis of land-use control as part of some comprehensive plan, the New York City law embodies a comprehensive plan to preserve structures of historic or aesthetic interest wherever they might be found in the city, and as noted, over 400 landmarks and 31 historic districts have been designated pursuant to this plan.</p>
<p id="c5f4aead-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is, of course, true that the Landmarks Law has a more severe impact on some landowners than on others, but that in itself does not mean that the law effects a “taking.” Legislation designed to promote the general welfare commonly burdens some more than others. The owners of the brickyard in <i>Hadacheck</i>, of the cedar trees in <i>Miller v. Schoene</i>, and of the gravel and sand mine in <i>Goldblatt v. Hempstead</i>, were uniquely burdened by the legislation sustained in those cases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B25_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B25_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span> Similarly, zoning laws often affect some property owners more severely than others but have not been held to be invalid on that account. For example, the property owner in <i>Euclid</i> who wished to use its property for industrial purposes was affected far more severely by the ordinance than its neighbors who wished to use their land for residences.</p>
<p id="c5f4aeb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, appellants’ repeated suggestions that they are solely burdened and unbenefited is factually inaccurate. This contention overlooks the fact that the New York City law applies to vast numbers of structures in the city in addition to the Terminal — all the structures contained in the 31 historic districts and over 400 individual landmarks, many of which are close to the Terminal. Unless we are to reject the judgment of the New York City Council that the preservation of landmarks benefits all New York citizens and all structures, both economically and by improving the quality of life in the city as a whole — which we are unwilling to do — we cannot conclude that the owners of the Terminal have in no sense been benefited by the Landmarks Law. <span title="1198" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1198">p. 1198</span>Doubtless appellants believe they are more burdened than benefited by the law, but that must have been true, too, of the property owners in <i>Miller</i>,<i> Hadacheck</i>,<i> Euclid</i>, and <i>Goldblatt</i>.</p>
<p id="c5f4aeb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C</i></p>
<p id="c5f4d5c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now must consider whether the interference with appellants’ property is of such a magnitude that “there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain [it].” <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v</i>. <i>Mahon</i>, 260 U.S., at 413. That inquiry may be narrowed to the question of the severity of the impact of the law on appellants’ parcel, and its resolution in turn requires a careful assessment of the impact of the regulation on the Terminal site.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he New York City law does not interfere in any way with the present uses of the Terminal. Its designation as a landmark not only permits but contemplates that appellants may continue to use the property precisely as it has been used for the past 65 years: as a railroad terminal containing office space and concessions. So the law does not interfere with what must be regarded as Penn Central’s primary expectation concerning the use of the parcel. More importantly, on this record, we must regard the New York City law as permitting Penn Central not only to profit from the Terminal but also to obtain a “reasonable return” on its investment.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants, moreover, exaggerate the effect of the law on their ability to make use of the air rights above the Terminal in two respects. First, it simply cannot be maintained, on this record, that appellants have been prohibited from occupying <i>any</i> portion of the airspace above the Terminal. While the Commission’s actions in denying applications to construct an office building in excess of 50 stories above the Terminal may indicate that it will refuse to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any comparably sized structure, nothing the Commission has said or done suggests an intention to prohibit <i>any</i> construction above the Terminal. The Commission’s report emphasized that whether any construction would be allowed depended upon whether the proposed addition “would harmonize in scale, material, and character with [the Terminal].” Since appellants have not sought approval for the construction of a smaller structure, we do not know that appellants will be denied any use of any portion of the airspace above the Terminal.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, to the extent appellants have been denied the right to build above the Terminal, it is not literally accurate to say that they have been denied <i>all</i> use of even those pre-existing air rights. Their ability to use these rights has not been abrogated; they are made transferable to at least eight parcels in the vicinity of the Terminal, one or two of which have been found suitable for the construction of new office buildings. Although appellants and others have argued that New York City’s transferable development-rights program is far from ideal, the New York courts here supportably found that, at least in the case of the Terminal, the rights afforded are valuable. While these rights may well not have constituted “just compensation” if a “taking” had occurred, the rights nevertheless undoubtedly mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has imposed on appellants and, for that reason, are to be taken into account in considering the impact of regulation.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this record, we conclude that the application of New York City’s Landmarks Law has not effected a “taking” of appellants’ property. The restrictions imposed are <span title="1199" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1199">p. 1199</span>substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties.</p>

<p id="c5f4d5c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the over one million buildings and structures in the city of New York, appellees have singled out 400 for designation as official landmarks. The question in this case is whether the cost associated with the city of New York’s desire to preserve a limited number of “landmarks” within its borders must be borne by all of its taxpayers or whether it can instead be imposed entirely on the owners of the individual properties.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Typical zoning restrictions may, it is true, so limit the prospective uses of a piece of property as to diminish the value of that property in the abstract because it may not be used for the forbidden purposes. But any such abstract decrease in value will more than likely be at least partially offset by an increase in value which flows from similar restrictions as to use on neighboring properties. All property owners in a designated area are placed under the same restrictions, not only for the benefit of the municipality as a whole but also for the common benefit of one another. In the words of Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922), there is “an average reciprocity of advantage.”</p>
<p id="c5f4d5cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where a relatively few individual buildings, all separated from one another, are singled out and treated differently from surrounding buildings, no such reciprocity exists. The cost to the property owner which results from the imposition of restrictions applicable only to his property and not that of his neighbors may be substantial — in this case, several million dollars — with no comparable reciprocal benefits. And the cost associated with landmark legislation is likely to be of a completely different order of magnitude than that which results from the imposition of normal zoning restrictions. Under the historic-landmark preservation scheme adopted by New York, the property owner is under an affirmative duty to <i>preserve</i> his property <i>as a landmark</i> at his own expense. The property has been thus subjected to a nonconsensual servitude not borne by any neighboring or similar properties.</p>
<p id="c5f4d5cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees are not prohibiting a nuisance. The record is clear that the proposed addition to the Grand Central Terminal would be in full compliance with zoning, height limitations, and other health and safety requirements. Instead, appellees are seeking to preserve what they believe to be an outstanding example of beaux arts architecture. Penn Central is prevented from further developing its property basically because <i>too good</i> a job was done in designing and building it. The city of New York, because of its unadorned admiration for the design, has decided that the owners of the building must preserve it unchanged for the benefit of sightseeing New Yorkers and tourists.</p>

<p id="c5f4fce7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Economic impact.</b> The greater the diminution in value, the more likely the regulation will be characterized as a taking. Complete deprivation of any “economically viable use” is likely to be a taking unless the regulation denies property rights that never existed in the first place, such as the right to commit a nuisance, <i>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</i>, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). On the other hand, no owner is guaranteed the most beneficial use of the property. Moreover, regulatory laws can be passed and applied to economic conduct even if this has the effect of depriving the parties of bargained-for contractual rights. For example, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of rent control laws as long as they guarantee the landlord a reasonable return on her investment. <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</i>, 544 U.S. 528 (2005); <i>Yee v. City of Escondido</i>, 503 U.S. 519 (1992); <i>Pennell v. City of San Jose</i>, 485 U.S. 1 (1988); <i>Block v. Hirsch</i>, 256 U.S. 135 (1921).</p>
<p id="c5f4fce8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extent of the diminution in value depends on how the courts define the relevant property interest, a question that first divided the Supreme Court in <i>Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon</i>. <i>See</i> §2.1, above. A zoning law that prohibits construction above four stories can be understood as destroying a separate parcel of “air rights,” which can, after all, be bought and sold and are valuable property interests. If, however, the property right is defined more broadly as “the right to build on one’s parcel,” then the ordinance will restrict a much smaller percentage of the total property value since it allows construction up to four stories.</p>
<p id="c5f4fce9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is how to identify the “denominator” against which the deprivation numerator will be compared. In <i>Penn Central</i>, the Court endorsed a “parcel as a whole” rule for the denominator, which echoes Justice Brandeis’s approach in his dissent in <i>Mahon</i>. But what <i>is</i> that whole parcel? In <i>Penn Central</i>, the Court considered it to be the “city tax block designated as the landmark site.’ ” The New York Court of Appeals had earlier determined the relevant parcel to include Penn Central’s other property in the same vicinity as Grand Central Terminal. <i>See Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City</i>, 366 N.E.2d 1271, 1276-1277 (N.Y. 1977). In a footnote in <i>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</i>, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), Justice Scalia criticized the New York court’s approach as “extreme” and “unsupportable.” <i>Id.</i> at 1016 n.7. Was it necessarily so far off? Grand Central Terminal was built as part of a development on land reclaimed when the New York Central Railroad, Penn Central’s predecessor, moved its rail yards underground. New York Central had marketed the entire development as a single “Terminal City,” a 30-block “city within a city” — the very area the New York Court of Appeals had in mind for the relevant parcel.</p>

It is less likely to be ruled a taking if the regulation prevents the owner from realizing an expected benefit in the future, imposing a mere opportunity cost, as was the case in <i>Penn Central.</i> The dilemma here is that people must have some right to rely on existing law at the time they invest; otherwise, the state could pass a general law subjecting all property in the state to being taken for public use without just compensation, thereby rendering the constitutional protection meaningless. At the same time, the legislature must have the power to change the law to impose greater restrictions on land use when circumstances change or new scientific discoveries arise concerning the importance of wetlands, navigable waters, and fragile coastland to the environment.</p>
<p id="c5f523fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Character of the government action.</b> The state is generally empowered to legislate to protect the public without compensating those whose property interests suffer a resultant economic impact. “Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922). However, if “protecting the public welfare” is sufficient to characterize a government action as a legitimate regulation rather than an unconstitutional taking, then the government will be able to destroy property interests at will without compensation and the takings clause will be meaningless. On the other hand, by defining “nuisance” or “public welfare” narrowly, courts will interfere in the legislatures’ ability to protect people from harm and to promote the general welfare; moreover, activist judges would be substituting their own judgment for that of democratically elected representatives.</p>
<p id="c5f523ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One question this raises is whether a regulatory law is legitimately preventing an owner from harming others by imposing negative externalities on neighbors or the community or is illegitimately requiring the owner to contribute a benefit to <span title="1203" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1203">p. 1203</span>the community. The dispute between the majority and minority opinions in <i>Penn Central</i> revolves around this issue. It also concerns whether the law illegitimately imposes a disparate impact on a few owners or constitutes a legitimate general regulatory law affecting a class of property that is appropriately subject to restrictions. It is clear that owners have no vested right to destroy the environment and pollute neighboring property; the common law of nuisance has always limited an owner’s property rights in this regard. In contrast, if the city government needs new office space and wants to take a private home to be used for that purpose, there is no question it must compensate the owner for the taking. But drawing the line between harm-preventing and benefit-conferring legislation is not an exact science. How should courts go about making this distinction?</p>
<p id="c5f52400-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Transfer of development rights.</b> The Court in <i>Penn Central</i> argues that one factor militating against the finding of a taking is that the owners of Grand Central Terminal could sell their air rights. Transfer of development rights, or “TDR,” regimes, are increasingly common and generally involve a kind of market created by a zoning code that allows owners of unused development rights to sell those rights to other owners. <i>See</i> Robin Finn, <i>The Great Air Race</i>, N.Y. Times, Feb. 24, 2013, at RE-1. The general idea is to hold total density of development constant, but shift where that density is placed in a given community, with the benefit of creating a valuable asset where there would otherwise only be a restriction. TDR regimes can also be used to generate funds for public purposes, in addition to compensating owners, and have been used to support goals such as preserving open space, maintaining parks, and supporting the arts. <i>See generally</i> Arthur C. Nelson, Rick Pruetz &amp; Doug Woodruff, <i>The TDR Handbook: Designing and Implementing Transfer of Development Rights Programs</i> (2011).</p>

Can the government take the value of property by creating more of it?</b> In a sequel to the <i>Penn Central</i> case, Midtown TDR Ventures, the current owner of the Grand Central Terminal, recently filed suit asserting that a 2015 decision by New York City to rezone to allow more development in the area around the station constituted a taking of its remaining TDRs. <i>See</i> Christopher Serkin, Penn Central <i>Take Two</i>, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. (forthcoming 2017). A developer had acquired property across the street from the station and proposed to build a massive office tower. Rather than acquire development rights from Midtown TDR Ventures, the developer reached an agreement with the city to obtain additional development rights in exchange for promises to make infrastructure improvements. Midtown TDR Ventures argued that by creating new development rights, the city took the value of its preexisting TDRs. <i>Id.</i> </p>
<p id="c5f52404-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the case settled, see Charles V. Bagli, <i>Owners of Grand Central Drop Lawsuit, Clearing Way for 1,401-Foot-Tall Skyscraper</i>, N.Y. Times, Aug. 10, 2016, at A20, it raised the important issue of whether the government can be liable to holders of existing property rights created under regulatory regimes such as New York City’s TDR program, when it purportedly undermines the value of those property interests. Taxi owners made a similar claim — unsuccessfully — in a suit against Boston, <span title="1204" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1204">p. 1204</span>arguing that the failure to regulate ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft constituted a taking of the property interest the taxi owners had in the medallions they were required to obtain in order to operate. <i>See Boston Taxi Owners Association, Inc. v. City of Boston</i>, No. CV 15-10100-NMG, 2016 WL 1274531 (D. Mass. Mar. 31, 2016) (rejecting the takings claim on grounds that “exclusivity of medallion owners’ access to the [transportation-for-hire] market prior to the arrival of [ride-sharing companies] existed by virtue of [Boston’s] regulatory structure rather than the medallion owners’ property rights”). These kinds of conflicts are likely to become more common. As Professor Serkin notes, “regulatory property has become increasingly important and valuable in our modern economy and includes such assets as pollution credits, fishing quotas, taxi medallions, telecommunications spectrum, and financial guarantees, among many others.” Serkin, <i>supra</i>, at *4. How much should owners of property created through regulatory regimes be able to rely on the continuing nature of such programs?</p>

The company has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to undertake the research. Word of the purpose of the facility leaks out to the general public. A referendum is placed on the ballot to amend the zoning ordinance to prohibit the testing of chemical weapons anywhere in the city. The company explains that the facility is perfectly safe; scientific experts agree that operation of the plant poses little, if any, danger of causing public health problems. Nonetheless, the public is frightened by the prospect of the facility and votes for the referendum. The company sues the city, claiming that enforcement of the amended zoning law would interfere with its vested rights and constitute a taking of property without just compensation. The multimillion-dollar facility is not structured for other kinds of scientific research and would have to be substantially rebuilt in order to convert to other research purposes; application of the ordinance therefore would destroy millions of dollars of the company’s investment. The city responds that the amendment regulates a public nuisance and protects the community from any possible contagion from the facility. Does the regulation take the company’s property rights? How should the case be resolved?</p>

<p id="c5f54b19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few states have passed statutes that go beyond the takings clause in protecting owners from uncompensated deprivation of property rights. Both the federal government and many states have passed assessment laws that require government entities to consider the impact of regulations on private property owners before promulgating them to avoid unconstitutional takings of property and to review regulations if they are challenged as regulatory takings or if they are likely to reduce property values by a set amount. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Del. Code tit. 29, §605; Fla. Stat. §70.001.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CC4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10CC4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f54b1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few states have passed laws that allow either injunctive relief or just compensation when regulation reduces the value of property, even if that reduction would not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property. Some states require compensation if an owner’s property values are reduced by a particular percentage unless the regulation fits into an established exemption. <i>See</i> Tex. Govt. Code §§2007.001-2007.045 (<i>Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act</i>) (both injunctive relief and damages available for state agency regulations that reduce property value by 25 percent or more unless the regulation fits within a list of exemptions). Other states provide relief if a regulation imposes an unfair or inordinate burden on a property owner, even if that burden would not amount to an unconstitutional taking, effectively leaving it to the courts to determine what constitutes an unfair burden. <i>See</i> Fla. Stat. §70.001(a) (<i>Bert J. Harris, Jr. Private Property Rights Protection Act of 1995</i>) (granting relief when a “new” law or regulation “unfairly affects real property” by imposing an “inordinate burden” on an existing use of real property by impairing the owner’s “reasonable, investment-backed expectation for the existing use of the real property” or by leaving the owner “with existing or vested uses that are unreasonable such that the property owner bears permanently a disproportionate share of a burden imposed for the good of the public, which in fairness should be borne by the public at large”).</p>
<p id="c5f54b1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Oregon adopted the most radical law. In 2004, the voters adopted a state law known as Measure 37 that required compensation when any regulation “restricts the use of real property” and is enacted after an owner or a family member acquires title to land if the regulation “has the effect of reducing the fair market value of property,” unless the regulation restricts public nuisances, protects public health and safety, or prohibits the use of property for selling pornography or performing nude dancing. Or. Stat. §195:305; Michael C. Blumm &amp; Erik Grafe, <i>Enacting Libertarian Property: Oregon’s Measure 37 and Its Implications,</i> 85 Denv. U. L. Rev. 279 (2007). Because the law applied to any regulations passed after an owner (or a family member) acquired title, owners could go back to the laws in effect at the time their family first acquired the land — for some families, this may go back to a time before any zoning or environmental laws were in effect. This meant that zoning in a particular area would be <span title="1206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1206">p. 1206</span>inconsistent if acquired by different families at different times, meaning each parcel might be subject to different land use regulations.</p>
<p id="c5f54b1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rather than pay compensation for land use restrictions going back to the 1970s, municipalities overwhelmingly chose to waive their zoning laws. As property owners found their neighbors planning massive development in their quiet neighborhoods or valuable agricultural land, support for the Measure turned to passionate opposition. In 2007, Oregon voters passed Measure 49, which restricted Measure 37 claims to laws regulating residential, farm, or forest uses of property, while allowing, without compensation, laws that limit commercial or industrial uses like strip malls and mines, and limited those seeking compensation for pre-enactment regulations to waivers to build a few houses on their land.

<p id="c5f54b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of theories have been proposed to justify the exercise of identifying regulatory takings as distinct from exercises of the police power that do not require compensation. These include (a) tradition, (b) efficiency, and (c) distributive justice. Consider the extent to which these theories might apply to explain the government’s power of eminent domain more generally.</p>
<p id="c5f54b22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Tradition.</b> One answer looks to traditional definitions of property interests to determine which government actions other than outright transfer of property to the government constitute “takings” of “property” that must be compensated. Traditional doctrine may identify both the type of activity that constitutes a nuisance (thereby helping to distinguish harm prevention from benefit extraction) and the strands of rights that constitute core property rights. But how does one identify what property rights are traditional? Should the courts look just to the common law, or should they consider longstanding legislative alterations to common law rights? Recognizing that property law has changed over time (sometimes dramatically), one must identify both a particular time — and a particular jurisdiction — to identify the property interests to which “tradition” will refer. How should this be done? Should changes over time be recognized as evolution of the tradition or departure from it? <i>See</i> Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Government Interests and Takings: Cultural Commitments of Property and the Role of Political Theory</i> in <i>Reinterpreting Property</i> 166, 172-177 (1993) (noting that sudden large changes in property law are more likely to be held to be takings while the same <span title="1207" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1207">p. 1207</span>changes occurring gradually over a long period of time are less likely to be seen as takings because gradual evolution alters expectations of what rights go along with ownership).</p>
<p id="c5f54b23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when the rules appear to be clear, determining their scope involves discretion and judgment; prior cases can, after all, be distinguished. Moreover, property rights have always been subject to restrictions incorporated in various equitable doctrines, such as <i>laches</i>, estoppel and the <i>sic utere</i> doctrine (use your rights so as not to injure the legitimate rights of others). Should the source of traditional property law be the relatively clear <i>rules</i> that developed over time (and at what time?) or the background <i>principles</i> that modify and condition otherwise applicable rights? <i>See</i> Frank Michelman, <i>Property, Federalism, and Jurisprudence: A Comment on</i> Lucas <i>and Judicial Conservatism</i>, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 301 (1993). A final problem is that the common law definition of property was developed by unelected judges; why should their definition of “property” have greater legitimacy than the definition embodied in statutes promulgated by elected legislators who are responding to public needs and contemporary social values? <i>See</i> Louise A. Halper, <i>Why the Nuisance Knot Can’t Undo the Takings Muddle</i>, 28 Ind. L. Rev. 329 (1995).</p>
<p id="c5f54b24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Efficiency.</b> In an important article, Frank Michelman argued that compensation should be required when it will help to promote efficient (that is, welfare-maximizing) legislation. Frank Michelman, <i>Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law</i>, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1184 (1967). Michelman explained that a utilitarian should be concerned about weighing the gains from public projects against three kinds of costs: (1) the harms to uncompensated victims resulting from the project, (2) the settlement or administrative costs of arranging for compensation for those victims, and (3) the “demoralization” costs that would accrue if the victims were not compensated and people believed that this lack of compensation was unfair. He argued that from a utilitarian perspective, compensation should be awarded when the demoralization costs of failing to compensate are greater than the settlement costs of arranging for compensation. Other scholars have similarly used efficiency analysis to argue for and against compensation for the effects of particular changes in regulatory laws. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Daniel Farber, <i>Economic Analysis and Just Compensation</i>, 12 Intl. Rev. L. &amp; Econ. 125 (1992); William A. Fischel, <i>Introduction: Utilitarian Balancing and Formalism in Takings</i>, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1581 (1988); Louis Kaplow, <i>An Economic Analysis of Legal Transitions</i>, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 509 (1986).</p>
<p id="c5f54b25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The efficiency argument that would justify requiring compensation when regulatory laws impinge on property rights rests on the proposition that legislation is welfare maximizing if its benefits outweigh its costs. Legislatures may pass statutes that cause more harm than good because they are responding to special interest groups. Requiring compensation for those whose property interests are harmed by legislation tests the proposition that the legislation benefits the public welfare by requiring those who benefit from the policy to compensate those who lose. If the winners win more than the losers lose, the winners should be willing to raise taxes to pay for the program since they will gain more from the legislation than it costs them in taxes; if winners are not <span title="1208" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1208">p. 1208</span>willing to pay for the program by compensating those who lose, we have evidence that the program benefits them less than it harms the property owners adversely affected by it. In this case the legislation is not efficient and should not have been passed in the first place; requiring compensation will prevent legislators from passing an inefficient law. This can serve to reduce the incentive for corruption and align the actions of the government more closely to the general public good. <i>See</i> Abraham Bell &amp; Gideon Parchomovsky, <i>The Hidden Function of Takings Compensation</i>, 96 Va. L. Rev. 1673 (2010); <i>cf.</i> Jed Rubinfeld, <i>Usings</i>, 102 Yale L.J. 1077, 1080 (1993) (arguing that governmental action should require compensation only “when government conscripts someone’s property for state use”).</p>
<p id="c5f57236-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, there are a number of efficiency arguments that would justify <i>not</i> compensating owners when regulatory laws impinge on their property rights.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D64_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D64_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">20</a></span> First, the administrative costs of compensating everyone injured by any regulation are enormous and may outweigh any benefit derived from the regulation. Second, requiring compensation may mean that efficient legislation, which benefits the public by preventing activities whose social costs outweigh their benefits, will not be passed; this may happen when people irrationally underestimate the risks of current conduct (for example, people seek the short-run benefits of industrial development and fail to take into account the long-run harm to the environment). If government fails to adopt welfare-maximizing policies, government policy will lower social welfare by adopting an inefficiently low level of regulation. Third, requiring compensation creates a “moral hazard” by removing incentives for economic actors to foresee both the effects of their conduct on others and the likelihood that their conduct will be regulated in the future. Providing compensation for changes in regulatory law creates insurance against adverse changes in land use regulation, causing developers to over-invest in socially harmful activities. In contrast, if no compensation is provided, developers will discount the profitability of activity that is likely to be regulated in the future, decreasing the likelihood that they will engage in socially destructive conduct. <i>See</i> Kaplow, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<p id="c5f57238-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Distributive justice.</b> A third justification for compensation recognizes that takings doctrine in many respects rests on distributive concerns. The central question is whether the regulation causes a loss that the individual property owner should, in all fairness and justice, bear as a member of society for the good of the community as a whole.</p>
<p id="c5f57239-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distributive argument for requiring compensation is that this ensures that the costs of public programs benefiting the community are borne by taxpayers as a group rather than unfairly imposed on individual property owners. When particular owners suffer unique burdens from regulation, there is no average reciprocity of advantage; <span title="1209" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1209">p. 1209</span>therefore, they should be compensated unless their use of the property is morally wrongful.</p>
<p id="c5f5723a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distributive argument against requiring compensation is that regulations prevent owners from engaging in activities that harm the public welfare. Because individuals have no right to commit a nuisance or to engage in activities that cause substantial negative externalities, they have no right to be compensated when those regulations impinge on their property interests; they have not lost anything to which they were entitled in the first place. Regulations generally create an “average reciprocity of advantage”; those harmed by the regulation are also benefited by it because it regulates not only their activities but their neighbors’ as well. The distributive effect is therefore fair because the burdens of the regulation are balanced by a compensating benefit.</p>
<p id="c5f5723b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Individuals are not generally expected to pay for public goods that benefit them disproportionately, what can be called “givings” as opposed to takings. <i>See</i> Abraham Bell &amp; Gideon Parchomovsky,<i> Givings</i>, 111 Yale L.J. 547 (2001). A property owner whose property greatly increases in value because the government decides to build a golf course or an off ramp nearby need not pay for the related giving to her property; does distributive justice demand that she share some of this unearned benefit with the community that created it?</p>

<p id="c5f59857-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice W<span class="epub-small-caps">ILLIAM</span> H. R<span class="epub-small-caps">EHNQUIST</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5f59858-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant PruneYard is a privately owned shopping center in the city of Campbell, Cal. It covers approximately 21 acres — 5 devoted to parking and 16 occupied by walkways, plazas, sidewalks, and buildings that contain more than 65 specialty shops, 10 restaurants, and a movie theater. The PruneYard is open to the public for the purpose of encouraging the patronizing of its commercial establishments. It has a policy not to permit any visitor or tenant to engage in any publicly expressive activity, including the circulation of petitions, that is not directly related to its commercial purposes. This policy has been strictly enforced in a nondiscriminatory fashion. The PruneYard is owned by appellant Fred Sahadi.</p>
<p id="c5f59859-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees are high school students who sought to solicit support for their opposition to a United Nations resolution against “Zionism.” On a Saturday afternoon they <span title="1210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1210">p. 1210</span>set up a card table in a corner of PruneYard’s central courtyard. They distributed pamphlets and asked passersby to sign petitions, which were to be sent to the President and Members of Congress. Their activity was peaceful and orderly and so far as the record indicates was not objected to by PruneYard’s patrons.</p>
<p id="c5f5985a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Soon after appellees had begun soliciting signatures, a security guard informed them that they would have to leave because their activity violated PruneYard regulations. The guard suggested that they move to the public sidewalk at the PruneYard’s perimeter. Appellees immediately left the premises and later filed this lawsuit in the California Superior Court of Santa Clara County. They sought to enjoin appellants from denying them access to the PruneYard for the purpose of circulating their petitions.</p>
<p id="c5f5985b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The California Supreme Court [held] that the California Constitution protects “speech and petitioning, reasonably exercised, in shopping centers even when the centers are privately owned.” It concluded that appellees were entitled to conduct their activity on PruneYard property.</p>
<p id="c5f5985c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before this Court, appellants contend that their constitutionally established rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to exclude appellees from adverse use of appellants’ private property cannot be denied by invocation of a state constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction of a State’s laws of private property.</p>
<p id="c5f5985d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants contend that a right to exclude others underlies the Fifth Amendment guarantee against the taking of property without just compensation and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee against the deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>
<p id="c5f5985e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that one of the essential sticks in the bundle of property rights is the right to exclude others. <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80 (1979). And here there has literally been a “taking” of that right to the extent that the California Supreme Court has interpreted the State Constitution to entitle its citizens to exercise free expression and petition rights on shopping center property. But it is well established that “not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a taking’ in the constitutional sense.” <i>Armstrong v. United States</i>, 364 U.S. 40, 48 (1960). Rather, the determination whether a state law unlawfully infringes a landowner’s property in violation of the Taking Clause requires an examination of whether the restriction on private property “forc[es] some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” <i>Id.</i> at 49. This examination entails inquiry into such factors as the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. When “regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.” <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922).</p>
<p id="c5f5985f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here the requirement that appellants permit appellees to exercise state-protected rights of free expression and petition on shopping center property clearly does not amount to an unconstitutional infringement of appellants’ property rights under the Taking Clause. There is nothing to suggest that preventing appellants from prohibiting this sort of activity will unreasonably impair the value or use of their property as a shopping center. The PruneYard is a large commercial complex that covers several <span title="1211" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1211">p. 1211</span>city blocks, contains numerous separate business establishments, and is open to the public at large. The decision of the California Supreme Court makes it clear that the PruneYard may restrict expressive activity by adopting time, place, and manner regulations that will minimize any interference with its commercial functions. Appellees were orderly, and they limited their activity to the common areas of the shopping center. In these circumstances, the fact that they may have “physically invaded” appellants’ property cannot be viewed as determinative.</p>
<p id="c5f59860-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is quite different from <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, <i>supra</i>. <i>Kaiser Aetna</i> was a case in which the owners of a private pond had invested substantial amounts of money in dredging the pond, developing it into an exclusive marina, and building a surrounding marina community. The marina was open only to fee-paying members, and the fees were paid in part to “maintain the privacy and security of the pond.” <i>Id.</i> at 168. The Federal Government sought to compel free public use of the private marina on the ground that the marina became subject to the federal navigational servitude because the owners had dredged a channel connecting it to “navigable water.”</p>
<p id="c5f59861-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government’s attempt to create a public right of access to the improved pond interfered with Kaiser Aetna’s “reasonable investment backed expectations.” We held that it went “so far beyond ordinary regulation or improvement for navigation as to amount to a taking.” <i>Id.</i> at 178. Nor as a general proposition is the United States, as opposed to the several States, possessed of residual authority that enables it to define “property” in the first instance. A State is, of course, bound by the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but here appellants have failed to demonstrate that the “right to exclude others” is so essential to the use or economic value of their property that the state-authorized limitation of it amounted to a “taking.”</p>
<p id="c5f59862-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice H<span class="epub-small-caps">ARRY</span> A. B<span class="epub-small-caps">LACKMUN</span> joins the opinion of the Court except that sentence thereof, which reads: “Nor as a general proposition is the United States, as opposed to the several States, possessed of residual authority that enables it to define property’ in the first instance.”</p>
<p id="c5f59863-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice T<span class="epub-small-caps">HURGOOD</span> M<span class="epub-small-caps">ARSHALL</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="c5f59864-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ claim in this case amounts to no less than a suggestion that the common law of trespass is not subject to revision by the State, notwithstanding the California Supreme Court’s finding that state-created rights of expressive activity would be severely hindered if shopping centers were closed to expressive activities by members of the public. If accepted, that claim would represent a return to the era of <i>Lochner v. New York</i>, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), when common-law rights were also found immune from revision by State or Federal Government. Such an approach would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century state of development. It would allow no room for change in response to changes in circumstance. The Due Process Clause does not require such a result.</p>
<p id="c5f59865-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, I do not understand the Court to suggest that rights of property are to be defined solely by state law, or that there is no federal constitutional barrier to the abrogation of common-law rights by Congress or a state government. The <span title="1212" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1212">p. 1212</span>constitutional terms “life, liberty, and property” do not derive their meaning solely from the provisions of positive law. They have a normative dimension as well, establishing a sphere of private autonomy which government is bound to respect. Quite serious constitutional questions might be raised if a legislature attempted to abolish certain categories of common-law rights in some general way. Indeed, our cases demonstrate that there are limits on governmental authority to abolish “core” common-law rights, including rights against trespass, at least without a compelling showing of necessity or a provision for a reasonable alternative remedy. That “core” has not been approached in this case.</p>
<p id="c5f59866-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice L<span class="epub-small-caps">EWIS</span> F. P<span class="epub-small-caps">OWELL</span>, J<span class="epub-small-caps">R</span>., with whom Mr. Justice W<span class="epub-small-caps">HITE</span> joins, concurring in part and in the judgment.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf77-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State may not compel a person to affirm a belief he does not hold. A property owner may be faced with speakers who wish to use his premises as a platform for views that he finds morally repugnant. Numerous examples come to mind. A minority-owned business confronted with distributors from the American Nazi Party or the Ku Klux Klan, a church-operated enterprise asked to host demonstrations in favor of abortion, or a union compelled to supply a forum to right-to-work advocates could be placed in an intolerable position if state law requires it to make its private property available to anyone who wishes to speak. The strong emotions evoked by speech in such situations may virtually compel the proprietor to respond.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf78-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the record before us, I cannot say that customers of this vast center would be likely to assume that appellees’ limited speech activity expressed the views of the PruneYard or of its owner.</p>

<p id="c5f5bf81-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents the question whether a minor but permanent physical occupation of an owner’s property authorized by government constitutes a “taking” of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. New York law provides that a landlord must permit a cable television company to install its cable facilities upon his property. N.Y. Exec. Law §828(1). In this case, the cable installation occupied portions of appellant’s roof and the side of her building. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that this appropriation does not amount to a taking. Because we conclude that such a physical occupation of property is a taking, we reverse.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf82-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Appellant Jean Loretto purchased a five-story rental apartment building located at 303 West 105th Street, New York City in 1971. The previous owner had granted <span title="1213" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1213">p. 1213</span>appellees Teleprompter Corp. and Teleprompter Manhattan CATV (collectively Teleprompter) permission to install a crossover cable on the building (serving other property but not the Loretto property) and the exclusive privilege of furnishing cable television (CATV) services to the tenants at some point in the future. The cable measured slightly less than one-half inch in diameter and ran approximately 36 feet in length along the side of the building; Teleprompter also installed two directional taps measuring 4 inches by 4 inches by 4 inches and two cable boxes measuring 18 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches for a total displaced volume of about one and a half cubic feet. On January 1, 1973, New York state adopted a law that required residential landlords to allow cable television companies to install cable boxes and cables on their property to enable tenants to get access to cable television, N.Y. Exec. Law §828. The state commission established by that law later ruled that landlords were entitled to a nominal fee of $1 when such cables are installed.]</p>
<p id="c5f5bf83-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant [Loretto] did not discover the existence of the cable until after she had purchased the building. She brought a class action against Teleprompter in 1976 on behalf of all owners of real property in the State on which Teleprompter has placed CATV components, alleging that Teleprompter’s installation was a trespass and, insofar as it relied on §828, a taking without just compensation. [The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals both upheld the constitutionality of the statute. We reverse.] We conclude that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf84-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Court has often upheld substantial regulation of an owner’s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest. At the same time, we have long considered a physical intrusion by government to be a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the Takings Clause. Our cases further establish that when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred. In such a case, “the character of the government action” not only is an important factor in resolving whether the action works a taking but also is determinative.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf85-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property, this Court has invariably found a taking. As early as 1872, in <i>Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co.</i>, 13 Wall. 166, this Court held that the defendant’s construction, pursuant to state authority, of a dam which permanently flooded plaintiff’s property constituted a taking.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf86-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), the Court held that the Government’s imposition of a navigational servitude requiring public access to a pond was a taking where the landowner had reasonably relied on Government consent in connecting the pond to navigable water. The Court emphasized that the servitude took the land-owner’s right to exclude, “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” <i>Id.</i> at 176. The Court explained [that] “the imposition of the navigational servitude in this context will result in an <i>actual physical invasion</i> of the privately owned marina.” <i>Id. Kaiser Aetna</i> reemphasizes that a physical invasion is a government intrusion of an unusually serious character.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another recent case underscores the constitutional distinction between a permanent occupation and a temporary physical invasion. In <i>PruneYard Shopping Center v. <span title="1214" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1214">p. 1214</span>Robins</i>, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), the Court upheld a state constitutional requirement that shopping center owners permit individuals to exercise free speech and petition rights on their property, to which they had already invited the general public. The Court emphasized that the State Constitution does not prevent the owner from restricting expressive activities by imposing reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to minimize interference with the owner’s commercial functions. Since the invasion was temporary and limited in nature, and since the owner had not exhibited an interest in excluding all persons from his property, “the fact that [the solicitors] may have physically invaded’ [the owners’] property cannot be viewed as determinative.” <i>Id.</i> at 84.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf88-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, when the “character of the governmental action” is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf89-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The historical rule that a permanent physical occupation of another’s property is a taking has more than tradition to commend it. Such an appropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an owner’s property interests. To borrow a metaphor, <i>cf</i>. <i>Andrus v. Allard</i>, 444 U.S. 51, 65-66 (1979), the government does not simply take a single “strand” from the “bundle” of property rights: it chops through the bundle, taking a slice of every strand.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf8a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property rights in a physical thing have been described as the rights “to possess, use and dispose of it.” <i>United States v. General Motors Corp.</i>, 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945). To the extent that the government permanently occupies physical property, it effectively destroys <i>each</i> of these rights. First, the owner has no right to possess the occupied space himself, and also has no power to exclude the occupier from possession and use of the space. The power to exclude has traditionally been considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner’s bundle of property rights. Second, the permanent physical occupation of property forever denies the owner any power to control the use of the property; he not only cannot exclude others, but can make no nonpossessory use of the property. Although deprivation of the right to use and obtain a profit from property is not, in every case, independently sufficient to establish a taking, it is clearly relevant. Finally, even though the owner may retain the bare legal right to dispose of the occupied space by transfer or sale, the permanent occupation of that space by a stranger will ordinarily empty the right of any value, since the purchaser will also be unable to make any use of the property.</p>
<p id="c5f5bf8b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, an owner suffers a special kind of injury when a <i>stranger</i> directly invades and occupies the owner’s property. [P]roperty law has long protected an owner’s expectation that he will be relatively undisturbed at least in the possession of his property. To require, as well, that the owner permit another to exercise complete dominion literally adds insult to injury. <i>See</i> Michelman, <i>Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of “Just Compensation” Law</i>, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165, 1228, and n.110 (1967). Furthermore, such an occupation is qualitatively more severe than a regulation of the <i>use</i> of property, even a regulation that imposes affirmative duties on the owner, since the owner may have no control over the timing, extent, or nature of the invasion.</p>
<p id="c5f5e69c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1215">p. 1215</span>The traditional rule also avoids otherwise difficult line-drawing problems. Few would disagree that if the State required landlords to permit third parties to install swimming pools on the landlords’ rooftops for the convenience of the tenants, the requirement would be a taking. If the cable installation here occupied as much space, again, few would disagree that the occupation would be a taking. But constitutional protection for the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on the size of the area permanently occupied.</p>
<p id="c5f5e69d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter’s cable installation on appellant’s building constitutes a taking under the traditional test. The installation involved a direct physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon the roof and along the building’s exterior wall.</p>
<p id="c5f5e69e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Teleprompter notes that the law applies only to buildings used as rental property, and draws the conclusion that the law is simply a permissible regulation of the use of real property. We fail to see, however, why a physical occupation of one type of property but not another type is any less a physical occupation. Insofar as Teleprompter means to suggest that this is not a permanent physical invasion, we must differ. So long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation, the landlord must permit it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F02_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F02_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">21</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f5e6a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we do not agree with appellees that application of the physical occupation rule will have dire consequences for the government’s power to adjust landlord-tenant relationships. This Court has consistently affirmed that States have broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States</i>, 379 U.S. 241 (1964) (discrimination in places of public accommodation); <i>Home Building &amp; Loan Assn</i>. <i>v. Blaisdell</i>, 290 U.S. 398 (1934) (mortgage moratorium); <i>Block v. Hirsh</i>, 256 U.S. 135 (1921) (rent control). In none of these cases, however, did the government authorize the permanent occupation of the landlord’s property by a third party. Consequently, our holding today in no way alters the analysis governing the State’s power to require landlords to comply with building codes and provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building. So long as these regulations do not require the landlord to suffer the physical occupation of a portion of his building by a third party, they will be analyzed under the multifactor inquiry generally applicable to nonpossessory governmental activity. <i>See Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).</p>

We affirm the traditional rule that a permanent physical occupation of property is a taking. In such a case, the property owner entertains a historically rooted expectation of compensation, and the character of the invasion is qualitatively more intrusive than perhaps any other category of property regulation. We do not, however, question the equally substantial authority upholding a State’s broad power to impose appropriate restrictions upon an owner’s <i>use</i> of his property. The issue of the amount of compensation that is due, on which we express no opinion, is a matter for the state courts to consider on remand.</p>

<p id="c5f5e6a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals found, first, that §828 represented a reasoned legislative effort to arbitrate between the interests of tenants and landlords and to encourage development of an important educational and communications medium. Second, the court concluded that the statute’s economic impact on appellant was <i>de minimis</i> because §828 did not affect the fair return on her property. Third, the statute did not interfere with appellant’s reasonable investment-backed expectations. When appellant purchased the building, she was unaware of the existence of the cable. Thus, she could not have invested in the building with any reasonable expectation that the one-eighth cubic foot of space occupied by the cable television installment would become income-productive.</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s recent Takings Clause decisions teach that <i>nonphysical</i> government intrusions on private property, such as zoning ordinances and other land-use restrictions may diminish the value of private property far more than minor physical touchings. Nevertheless, as the Court recognizes, it has “often upheld substantial regulation of an owner’s use of his own property where deemed necessary to promote the public interest.”</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surprisingly, the Court draws an even finer distinction today — between “temporary physical invasions” and “permanent physical occupations.” When the government authorizes the latter type of intrusion, the Court would find “a taking without regard to the public interests” the regulation may serve. Yet the newly created distinction is even less substantial than the distinction between physical and nonphysical intrusions that the Court already has rejected.</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, what does the Court mean by “permanent”? As the Court itself concedes, §828 does not require appellant to permit the cable installation forever, but only “[so] long as the property remains residential and a CATV company wishes to retain the installation.” This is far from “permanent.”</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court reaffirms that “States have broad power to regulate housing conditions in general and the landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails.” Thus, §828 merely defines one of the many statutory responsibilities that a New Yorker accepts when she enters the rental business. If appellant occupies her own building, or converts it into a commercial property, she becomes perfectly free to exclude Teleprompter from her one-eighth cubic foot of roof space. But once appellant chooses to use her property for rental purposes, she must comply with all reasonable government statutes regulating the landlord-tenant relationship.</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1217">p. 1217</span>The Court’s talismanic distinction between a continuous “occupation” and a transient “invasion” finds no basis in either economic logic or Takings Clause precedent. In the landlord-tenant context, the Court has upheld against takings challenges rent control statutes permitting “temporary” physical invasions of considerable economic magnitude. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g., Block v</i>. <i>Hirsh</i>, 256 U.S. 135 (1921) (statute permitting tenants to remain in physical possession of their apartments for two years after the termination of their leases). Moreover, precedents record numerous other “temporary” officially authorized invasions by third parties that have intruded into an owner’s enjoyment of property far more deeply than did Teleprompter’s long-unnoticed cable. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g., PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins</i>, 447 U.S. 74 (1980) (leafletting and demonstrating in busy shopping center).</p>
<p id="c5f5e6a9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Setting aside history, the Court also states that the permanent physical occupation authorized by §828 is a <i>per se</i> taking because it uniquely impairs appellant’s powers to dispose of, use, and exclude others from, her property. In fact, the Court’s discussion nowhere demonstrates how §828 impairs these private rights in a manner <i>qualitatively</i> different from other garden-variety landlord-tenant legislation.</p>
<p id="c5f5e6aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a practical matter, the regulation ensures that tenants living in the building will have access to cable television for as long as that building is used for rental purposes, and thereby likely increases both the building’s resale value and its attractiveness on the rental market. In any event, §828 differs little from the numerous other New York statutory provisions that require landlords to install physical facilities “permanently occupying” common spaces in or on their buildings. As the Court acknowledges, the States traditionally — and constitutionally — have exercised their police power “to require landlords to . . . provide utility connections, mailboxes, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and the like in the common area of a building.” Like §828, these provisions merely ensure tenants access to services the legislature deems important, such as water, electricity, natural light, telephones, intercommunication systems, and mail service.</p>
<p id="c5f60dbb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also suggests that §828 unconstitutionally alters appellant’s right to control the <i>use</i> of her one-eighth cubic foot of roof space. But other New York multiple dwelling statutes not only oblige landlords to surrender significantly larger portions of common space for their tenants’ use, but also compel the <i>landlord</i> — rather than the tenants or the private installers — to pay for and to maintain the equipment. For example, New York landlords are required by law to provide and pay for mailboxes that occupy more than five times the volume that Teleprompter’s cable occupies on appellant’s building. If the State constitutionally can insist that appellant make this sacrifice so that her tenants may receive mail, it is hard to understand why the State may not require her to surrender less space, <i>filled at another’s expense</i>, so that those same tenants can receive television signals.</p>

The physical invasion “rule.”</b> The Supreme Court often repeats that a <i>per se</i> taking occurs when a law authorizes a permanent physical invasion of property. <i>See Arkansas Game and Fish Commission v.

Although <i>Loretto</i> tries to establish a clear rule, not all physical invasions of property authorized by the state are takings of property and the <i>per se</i> rule announced in <i>Loretto</i> “is very narrow.” 458 U.S. at 441.

Cases finding a taking on the basis of a physical invasion by a stranger. </b>Besides <i>Loretto</i>, a few other cases are routinely cited for the proposition that forced physical invasion or occupation of property by a stranger constitutes a <i>per se</i> taking. Here are the most widely cited cases.</p>
<p id="c5f60dc2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 80 U.S. 166 (1872).</b> When a statute authorized a canal company to build a dam and flood the plaintiff’s land, the Supreme Court had no trouble in finding that this constitutes a <i>per se</i> taking of plaintiff’s property. The court found that it would be “a very curious and unsatisfactory result” if the state could “destroy [the] value [of property] entirely,” or “inflict irreparable and permanent injury” to it or even cause its “total destruction” and avoid paying compensation merely because the government did not formally “take” title to the land. <i>Id.</i> at 177-178. “Such a construction would pervert the constitutional provision[].” <i>Id.</i> at 178.</p>
<p id="c5f60dc3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946).</b> Military aircraft flew so close to the ground and caused such extreme noise over plaintiffs’ property near an airport that it both rendered plaintiffs’ home uninhabitable and made it impossible for them to operate their chicken farm because the noise frightened the chickens and caused them to fly into the walls, killing many of them. Although owners own the airspace over their land, and the passage of planes overhead is technically a trespass, all land ownership is subject to an airspace servitude that allows this. But because the planes were flying so low to the ground, the Court found that this exceeded the scope of the public servitude and thus the entry and passage of the planes constituted a forced taking of a public easement over the plaintiffs’ land. Although the “airspace is a public highway, it is obvious that if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate <span title="1219" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1219">p. 1219</span>reaches of the enveloping atmosphere.

<p id="c5f60dc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979).</b> In <i>Kaiser Aetna</i>, the owner and lessee of a shallow, private lagoon invested substantial amounts of money in developing the property, connecting it to navigable waters in the ocean, and creating a marina that was to be open only to fee-paying members. Navigable waters are subject to a servitude that allows public access for navigation purposes. The federal government tried to force the owners to grant public access to the lagoon once it had been converted into navigable waters. Although upholding the navigational servitude doctrine, the Supreme Court noted that the owners had invested in developing the marina and connecting the lagoon to the ocean in the expectation that they would continue to be able to control access to the lagoon and charge its members fees to pay for maintenance of the lagoon; the property became included in the navigable waters of the United States only because of the owner’s investment. A public access requirement would have converted at least some of the property from land controlled by a private fee-paying club into land freely open to the public. The owners would therefore have lost “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property — the right to exclude others.” <i>Id.</i> at 176.</p>

Cases finding no taking despite a forced physical invasion by a stranger. </b>Besides <i>PruneYard</i>, the most important cases authorizing the physical invasion of land are those upholding the constitutionality of antidiscrimination laws, including public accommodation, fair housing, and employment discrimination laws. No takings claims have reached the Supreme Court to challenge either the employment discrimination laws or the fair housing laws. Both require owners to suffer the physical invasion of property by strangers they would rather exclude. In the case of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3631, owners and landlords covered by the act can be compelled by injunction to transfer their property to a prospective buyer or tenant when the reason for refusing to sell or rent is the potential occupant’s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap.</p>

Since the statute provides for injunctive relief alone, it authorizes courts to issue injunctions mandating that owners allow strangers to stay in their premises that those owners would rather exclude. Besides finding the statute to be properly enacted pursuant to Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce, the Supreme Court held, with no analysis whatsoever, that it did not “find any merit in the claim that the Act is a taking of property without just compensation.” <i>Id.</i> at 261.</p>

Physical invasions by those in contractual relationships with the owner. </b>The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld anti-eviction laws that grant tenants the right to continue renting their apartments as long as they pay the agreed-upon rent and do not damage the property or violate other material terms of the lease, even if these laws authorize occupation beyond the end of the lease term. A similar result has obtained in the case of mortgage moratorium statutes.</p>

The owner could evict the tenant only if the tenant were in breach of the lease or if the owner sought to regain possession for occupancy by herself or her family. Justice Holmes noted that the statute guaranteed the owner a “reasonable rent” and that the statutory eviction controls were justified by the emergency conditions of a housing shortage in Washington, D.C., brought on by an influx of people during World War I. <i>Accord</i>,<i> Edgar A.

Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398 (1934).</b> In the midst of the Great Depression, Minnesota passed a mortgage moratorium law giving courts discretion to postpone foreclosure on homes whose mortgages were in default and giving borrowers an extension of the period of redemption during which they could pay their delinquent mortgage charges and thus keep their homes. The effect of the law was to allow the borrower/homeowner to remain in her home and to delay transfer of title to the property at foreclosure sale to a buyer (who often would be the bank that loaned the money in the first place). The statute thus authorized a forced physical occupation of the premises by the homeowner in a manner that was inconsistent with the mortgage agreement and the mortgagee’s foreclosure rights. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the statute against challenges that it violated both the due process clause and the constitutional clause prohibiting the impairment of contracts, U.S. Const. art. I, §10, because the moratorium was temporary and the bank was entitled to rent to compensate for the extended occupation of the premises.</p>
<p id="c5f60dca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Yee v. City of Escondido, California, 503 U.S. 519 (1992).</b> The Supreme Court reaffirmed <i>Block v. Hirsh</i> in <i>Yee</i>, holding that an anti-eviction law that allowed mobile home owners to continue renting the land in the mobile home park on which their homes sat, even after the end of the lease term, did not amount to a forced physical invasion of the park owner’s property. The statute allowed the park owner to give six months’ notice and then go out of business, evict the mobile home tenants, and convert the property to other uses. It did not matter to the Court that the effect of the anti-eviction law, when combined with the applicable rent control statute, allowed the mobile home owner to sell the home in place and transfer the tenancy to the new owner of the mobile home (at the rent-controlled rent) without the consent of the park owner. The buyer of the mobile home who would become the new tenant would of course be a stranger to the park owner. In effect, the law gave the tenants an absolute right to assign their leasehold even if assignment was prohibited by the lease. Such a buyer/assignee would pay more to buy such mobile homes because they were located in a rent-controlled environment; the mobile home owner, rather than the landlord, would reap the economic benefit of this one-time premium.</p>
<p id="c5f60dcb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None of this was relevant to the question of whether the law constituted a taking even though it imposed a forced physical occupation by a stranger.

The statutes here did “not authorize an unwanted physical occupation” of the park owners’ land; rather, they were “a regulation of [the park owners’] use of their property, and thus [did] not amount to a <i>per se</i> taking [under <i>Loretto</i>].” <i>Id.</i> at 532. However, the Court did note that the ordinance allowed the owner to go out of business and that “[a] different case would be presented were the statute, on its face or as applied, to compel a landowner over objection to rent his property or to refrain in perpetuity from terminating a tenancy.” <i>Id.</i> at 528.</p>

<p id="c5f60dcc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Does the landlord have a right to occupy her own land or stop renting altogether?</b> State courts have generally upheld anti-eviction laws against takings challenges even when those laws prevent the landlord from converting the property to another use. In <i>Flynn v. City of Cambridge</i>, 418 N.E.2d 335 (Mass. 1981), for example, the court upheld a condominium conversion law that prohibited landlords from evicting a tenant so they could convert the building into condominiums and move into the property themselves. The court found that the law did not cause an unconstitutional taking because the owners retained their “primary expectation concerning the use of the property” and they were still able to “obtain a reasonable return on [their] investment.” <i>Id.</i> at 339-340; <i>see also Nash v. City of Santa Monica</i>, 688 P.2d 894 (Cal. 1984), <i>appeal dismissed</i>, 470 U.S. 1046 (1985) (upholding a rent-control ordinance prohibiting removal of rental units from the housing market by conversion or demolition without a removal permit). Some courts, however, have struck down anti-eviction statutes as unconstitutional takings of property when they prevent the landlord from evicting a tenant so the landlord can move into the property herself, see, e.g., <i>Cwynar v.

Rails-to-trails controversies.</b> One recurring conflict over physical occupancy by the public involves conversions of abandoned rail corridors to recreation trails under §8(d) of the <i>National Trails System Act</i>, 16 U.S.C. §1247(d). In the nineteenth century, railroads developed rail corridors through a variety of means, including private purchases, eminent domain, and federal and state grants. <i>See</i> Danaya C. Wright, <i>Doing a Double Take: Rail-Trail Takings Litigation in the Post-</i>Brandt Trust <i>Era</i>, 39 Vt. L. Rev. 703, 710-717 (2015). Section 1247(d) created a process to convert those corridors to recreational use, which has led claimants to the underlying land to seek just compensation for public use, arguing either that recreational uses were not in the scope of the original right of way or that abandonment by the railroads leaves the underlying land unencumbered. In these cases, courts have struggled with questions such as the nature of the original grant (an easement, a fee interest, something else?) as well as <span title="1222" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1222">p. 1222</span>any interests retained by the government at the time of the grant. In <i>Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States</i>, 134 S. Ct. 1257 (2014), the Supreme Court held that a right of way granted to a railway under an 1875 federal statute was an easement that terminated when abandoned in 2006, freeing the underlying land of the restriction. <i>Id</i>. at 1264. The federal government argued that it retained an implied reversionary interest at the time of the grant, but the Court disagreed. The lone dissenter in the case, Justice Sotomayor, noted that this narrow interpretation of the easement may result in the federal government having pay “hundreds of millions of dollars” to compensate owners in order to convert similar rail corridors. <i>Id</i>. at 1272. </p>
<p id="c5f634de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Physical occupancy of personal property.</b> As should be evident by now, most takings cases asserting claims of physical occupancy involve real property. What about personal property? In <i>Horne v. Department of Agriculture</i><b>,</b> 133 S. Ct. 2053 (2013), the Supreme Court confronted a takings challenge to a United States Department of Agriculture program that required raisin growers to reserve a portion of their crop from sale under certain conditions to stabilize raisin prices. A committee appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture would dispose of these set-aside raisins, for example by selling them to foreign countries at below market rates or donating them to charity, with any profits returned to the original growers. The Court found that this program constituted a physical appropriation of personal property, and thus a <i>per se</i> taking akin to <i>Loretto</i><b>.</b> The Court reaffirmed that the takings clause does not prohibit the regulation of personal property, but having to render specific personal property to the government is a taking. To the Court, any economic benefits farmers received from the program or funds returned from sales of the reserved raisins do not affect the question of whether a taking has occurred. And the Court likewise held that the government cannot condition participation in a price-support program on the condition that a grower turn over a portion of its crop to the government.</p>
<p id="c5f634df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a concurrence, Justice Breyer argued that a remand should have been ordered to determine if any compensation would have been due had the grower actually complied with the program. Because the fifth amendment does not prohibit takings, but simply requires just compensation when property is taken for public use, Justice Breyer noted that the possibility that the program may have actually provided just compensation — by raising the value of the raisins not handed over to the program — might have obviated any constitutional violation. If that amount was sufficient to compensate for the value of the raisins handed over to the government, then no more compensation should be due. </p>

The order stays in effect for three months while she looks for a new place to live. He brings a lawsuit claiming that, because the title to the house is in his name and the couple is not married, she has no property interest in the house; to exclude him from his own home, even for a short period of time, without a criminal conviction, constitutes a taking of property without just compensation.

<p id="c5f634ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1986, petitioner David H. Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential lots on the Isle of Palms in Charleston County, South Carolina, on which he intended to build <span title="1224" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1224">p. 1224</span>single family homes. In 1988, however, the South Carolina Legislature enacted the <i>Beachfront Management Act</i>, S.C. Code §§48-39-250 <i>et seq.</i> (Act), which had the direct effect of barring petitioner from erecting any permanent habitable structures on his two parcels. A state trial court found that this prohibition rendered Lucas’s parcels “valueless.” This case requires us to decide whether the Act’s dramatic effect on the economic value of Lucas’s lots accomplished a taking of private property under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requiring the payment of “just compensation.” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5.</p>

<p id="c5f634f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">South Carolina’s expressed interest in intensively managing development activities in the so-called “coastal zone” dates from 1977 when, in the aftermath of Congress’s passage of the federal <i>Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972</i>, 86 Stat. 1280, as amended, 16 U.S.C. §§1451 <i>et seq.</i>, the legislature enacted a <i>Coastal Zone Management Act</i> of its own. <i>See</i> S.C. Code §§48-39-10 <i>et seq.</i> (1987). In its original form, the South Carolina Act required owners of coastal zone land that qualified as a “critical area” (defined in the legislation to include beaches and immediately adjacent sand dunes) to obtain a permit from the newly created South Carolina Coastal Council (respondent here) prior to committing the land to a “use other than the use the critical area was devoted to on [September 28, 1977].”</p>
<p id="c5f65c03-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late 1970’s, Lucas and others began extensive residential development of the Isle of Palms, a barrier island situated eastward of the City of Charleston. Toward the close of the development cycle for one residential subdivision known as “Beachwood East,” Lucas in 1986 purchased the two lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. No portion of the lots, which were located approximately 300 feet from the beach, qualified as a “critical area” under the 1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these parcels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from the Council in advance of any development activity. His intention with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of the immediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect single-family residences. He commissioned architectural drawings for this purpose.</p>
<p id="c5f65c04-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Beachfront Management Act</i> brought Lucas’s plans to an abrupt end. Under that 1988 legislation, the Council was directed to establish a “baseline” connecting the landward-most “point[s] of erosion . . . during the past forty years” in the region of the Isle of Palms that includes Lucas’s lots. In action not challenged here, the Council fixed this baseline landward of Lucas’s parcels. That was significant, for under the Act construction of occupable improvements was flatly prohibited seaward of a line drawn 20 feet landward of, and parallel to, the baseline. The Act provided no exceptions.</p>

<p id="c5f65c06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lucas promptly filed suit in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, contending that the <i>Beachfront Management Act</i>’s construction bar effected a taking of his property without just compensation.

Following a bench trial, the court agreed.</p>
<p id="c5f65c07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed.

<p id="c5f65c0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to Justice Holmes’ exposition in <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a “direct appropriation” of property, <i>Legal Tender Cases</i>, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a “practical ouster of [the owner’s] possession.” <i>Transportation Co. v. Chicago</i>, 99 U.S. 635, 642 (1879). Justice Holmes recognized in <i>Mahon</i>, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfully enforced, the government’s power to redefine the range of interests included in the ownership of property was necessarily constrained by constitutional limits. If, instead, the uses of private property were subject to unbridled, uncompensated qualification under the police power, “the natural tendency of human nature [would be] to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappear[ed].” <i>Id.</i> at 415. These considerations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that, “while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5f65c0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, our decision in <i>Mahon</i> offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulation would be seen as going “too far” for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding “regulatory takings” jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any “set formula” for determining how far is too far, preferring to “engag[e] in . . . essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,” <i>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978). We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint. The first encompasses regulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physical “invasion” of his property. In general (at least with regard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the intrusion, and no matter how weighty the public purpose behind it, we have required compensation. For example, in <i>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</i>, 458 U.S. 419 (1982), we determined that New York’s law requiring landlords to allow television cable companies to emplace cable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a taking, even though the facilities occupied at most only 1½ cubic feet of the landlords’ property.</p>
<p id="c5f65c0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land. <i>See</i><span title="1226" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1226">p. 1226</span></p>

As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use regulation “does not substantially advance legitimate state interests <i>or denies an owner economically viable use of his land</i>.” <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111C4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N111C4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">23</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f65c12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have never set forth the justification for this rule. Perhaps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that total deprivation of beneficial use is, from the land-owner’s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstance when no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumption that the legislature is simply “adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life,” <i>Penn Central Transp. Co.</i>, 438 U.S., at 124, in a manner that secures an “average reciprocity of advantage” to everyone concerned. <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S., at 415. And the <span title="1227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1227">p. 1227</span>functional basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect property values without compensation — that “Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,” <i>id.</i> at 413 — does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has deprived a landowner of all economically beneficial uses.</p>
<p id="c5f65c13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other side of the balance, affirmatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations that leave the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use — typically, as here, by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state — carry with them a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm. The many statutes on the books, both state and federal, that provide for the use of eminent domain to impose servitudes on private scenic lands preventing developmental uses, or to acquire such lands altogether, suggest the practical equivalence in this setting of negative regulation and appropriation.</p>
<p id="c5f65c14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.</p>
<p id="c5f65c15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5f65c16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court found Lucas’s two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by respondent’s enforcement of the coastal-zone construction ban. Under Lucas’s theory of the case, which rested upon our “no economically viable use” statements, that finding entitled him to compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either the purposes behind the <i>Beachfront Management Act</i>, or the means chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectuate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, thought otherwise. In its view, the <i>Beachfront Management Act</i> was no ordinary enactment, but involved an exercise of South Carolina’s “police powers” to mitigate the harm to the public interest that petitioner’s use of his land might occasion. By neglecting to dispute the findings enumerated in the Act or otherwise to challenge the legislature’s purposes, petitioner “concede[d] that the beach/dune area of South Carolina’s shores is an extremely valuable public resource; and that discouraging new construction in close proximity to the beach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great public harm.” In the court’s view, these concessions brought petitioner’s challenge within a long line of this Court’s cases sustaining against Due Process and Takings Clause challenges the State’s use of its “police powers” to enjoin a property owner from activities akin to public nuisances. <i>See Mugler v. Kansas</i>, 123 U.S. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages); <i>Hadacheck v. Sebastian</i>, 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (law barring operation of brick mill in residential area); <i>Miller v. Schoene</i>, 276 U.S. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees to prevent infection of nearby orchards); <i>Goldblatt v. Hempstead</i>, 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing continued operation of quarry in residential area).</p>
<p id="c5f65c17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is correct that many of our prior opinions have suggested that “harmful or noxious uses” of property may be proscribed by government regulation without the <span title="1228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1228">p. 1228</span>requirement of compensation. For a number of reasons, however, we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too quick to conclude that that principle decides the present case. The “harmful or noxious uses” principle was the Court’s early attempt to describe in theoretical terms why government may, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property values by regulation without incurring an obligation to compensate — a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with respect to the full scope of the State’s police power. We made this very point in <i>Penn Central Transportation Co.</i>, where, in the course of sustaining New York City’s landmarks preservation program against a takings challenge, we rejected the petitioner’s suggestion that <i>Mugler</i> and the cases following it were premised on, and thus limited by, some objective conception of “noxiousness”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f65c18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he uses in issue in <i>Hadacheck, Miller</i>, and <i>Goldblatt</i> were perfectly lawful in themselves.

These cases are better understood as resting not on any supposed “noxious” quality of the prohibited uses but rather on the ground that the restrictions were reasonably related to the implementation of a policy — not unlike historic preservation — expected to produce a widespread public benefit and applicable to all similarly situated property. 438 U.S., at 133-34 n.30.</p>

<p id="c5f65c1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The transition from our early focus on control of “noxious” uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realm within which government may regulate without compensation was an easy one, since the distinction between “harm-preventing” and “benefit-conferring” regulation is often in the eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for example, to describe in either fashion the ecological, economic, and aesthetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina legislature in the present case. One could say that imposing a servitude on Lucas’s land is necessary in order to prevent his use of it from “harming” South Carolina’s ecological resources; or, instead, in order to achieve the “benefits” of an ecological preserve. <i>Compare, e.g.</i>,<i> Claridge v. New Hampshire Wetlands Board</i>, 485 A.2d 287, 292 (N.H. 1984) (owner may, without compensation, be barred from filling wetlands because landfilling would deprive adjacent coastal habitats and marine fisheries of ecological support), <i>with, e.g.</i>,<i> Bartlett v. Zoning Comm’n of Old Lyme</i>, 282 A.2d 907, 910 (Conn. 1971) (owner barred from filling tidal marshland must be compensated, despite municipality’s “laudable” goal of “preserv[ing] marshlands from encroachment or destruction”). Whether one or the other of the competing characterizations will come to one’s lips in a particular case depends primarily upon one’s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate. A given restraint will be seen as mitigating “harm” to the adjacent parcels or securing a “benefit” for them, depending upon the observer’s evaluation of the relative importance of the use that the restraint favors. Whether Lucas’s construction of single-family residences on his parcels should be described as bringing “harm” to South Carolina’s <span title="1229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1229">p. 1229</span>adjacent ecological resources thus depends principally upon whether the describer believes that the State’s use interest in nurturing those resources is so important that any competing adjacent use must yield.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11237_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11237_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">24</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f6832c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it is understood that “prevention of harmful use” was merely our early formulation of the police power justification necessary to sustain (without compensation) any regulatory diminution in value; and that the distinction between regulation that “prevents harmful use” and that which “confers benefits” is difficult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis; it becomes self-evident that noxious-use logic cannot serve as a touchstone to distinguish regulatory “takings” — which require compensation — from regulatory deprivations that do not require compensation. A fortiori the legislature’s recitation of a noxious-use justification cannot be the basis for departing from our categorical rule that total regulatory takings must be compensated. If it were, departure would virtually always be allowed. The South Carolina Supreme Court’s approach would essentially nullify <i>Mahon</i>’s affirmation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our cases provide no support for this: None of them that employed the logic of “harmful use” prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allegation that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of the claimant’s land.</p>
<p id="c5f6832d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner’s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with. This accords, we think, with our “takings” jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of, and the State’s power over, the “bundle of rights” that they acquire when they obtain title to property. It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; “[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.” <i>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon</i>, 260 U.S., at 413. And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State’s traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless (at least if the property’s only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale), see<i> Andrus v. Allard</i>, 444 U.S. 51, 66-67 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the “implied limitation” that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable <span title="1230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1230">p. 1230</span>use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1124F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1124F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">25</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f6832f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where “permanent physical occupation” of land is concerned, we have refused to allow the government to decree it anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty the asserted “public interests” involved — though we assuredly would permit the government to assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the landowner’s title. <i>Compare Scranton v. Wheeler</i>, 179 U.S. 141, 163 (1900) (interests of “riparian owner in the submerged lands . . . bordering on a public navigable water” held subject to Government’s navigational servitude), <i>with Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S., at 178-80 (imposition of navigational servitude on marina created and rendered navigable at private expense held to constitute a taking). We believe similar treatment must be accorded confiscatory regulations, <i>i.e.</i>, regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial use of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must, in other words, do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the courts — by adjacent landowners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State’s law of private nuisance, or by the State under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public generally, or otherwise.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11267_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11267_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">26</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f68331-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this analysis, the owner of a lake bed, for example, would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied the requisite permit to engage in a landfilling operation that would have the effect of flooding others’ land. Nor the corporate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is directed to remove all improvements from its land upon discovery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Such regulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating the land’s only economically productive use, but it does not proscribe a productive use that was previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles. The use of these properties for what are <span title="1231" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1231">p. 1231</span>now expressly prohibited purposes was always unlawful, and (subject to other constitutional limitations) it was open to the State at any point to make the implication of those background principles of nuisance and property law explicit. In light of our traditional resort to “existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law” to define the range of interests that qualify for protection as “property” under the Fifth (and Fourteenth) amendments, this recognition that the Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land to a use that is proscribed by those “existing rules or understandings” is surely unexceptional. When, however, a regulation that declares “off-limits” all economically productive or beneficial uses of land goes beyond what the relevant background principles would dictate, compensation must be paid to sustain it.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11275_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11275_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">27</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f68333-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “total taking” inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily entails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm to public lands and resources, or adjacent private property, posed by the claimant’s proposed activities, the social value of the claimant’s activities and their suitability to the locality in question, and the relative ease with which the alleged harm can be avoided through measures taken by the claimant and the government (or adjacent private landowners) alike. The fact that a particular use has long been engaged in by similarly situated owners ordinarily imports a lack of any common-law prohibition (though changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so). So also does the fact that other landowners, similarly situated, are permitted to continue the use denied to the claimant.</p>
<p id="c5f68334-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improvements on petitioner’s land; they rarely support prohibition of the “essential use” of land. The question, however, is one of state law to be dealt with on remand. We emphasize that to win its case South Carolina must do more than proffer the legislature’s declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with the public interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>. As we have said, a “State, by <i>ipse dixit</i>, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.” <i>Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith</i>, 449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980). Instead, as it would be required to do if it sought to restrain Lucas in a common-law action for public nuisance, South Carolina must identify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibit the uses he now intends in the circumstances in which the property is presently found.

<p id="c5f68338-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that petitioner’s real property has been rendered valueless by the State’s regulation. The finding appears to presume that the property has no significant market value or resale potential. This is a curious finding, and I share the reservations of some of my colleagues about a finding that a beach front lot loses all value because of a development restriction. While the Supreme Court of South Carolina on remand need not consider the case subject to this constraint, we must accept the finding as entered below. Accepting the finding as entered, it follows that petitioner is entitled to invoke the line of cases discussing regulations that deprive real property of all economic value.</p>
<p id="c5f68339-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The finding of no value must be considered under the Takings Clause by reference to the owner’s reasonable, investment-backed expectations. The Takings Clause, while conferring substantial protection on property owners, does not eliminate the police power of the State to enact limitations on the use of their property. The rights conferred by the Takings Clause and the police power of the State may coexist without conflict. Property is bought and sold, investments are made, subject to the State’s power to regulate. Where a taking is alleged from regulations which deprive the property of all value, the test must be whether the deprivation is contrary to reasonable, investment-backed expectations.</p>
<p id="c5f6833a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this synthesis, of course; for if the owner’s reasonable expectations are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exercise of governmental authority, property tends to become what courts say it is. Some circularity must be tolerated in these matters, however, as it is in other spheres. The definition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. The expectations protected by the Constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved.</p>
<p id="c5f6833b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, reasonable expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition. The common law of nuisance is too narrow a confine for the exercise of regulatory power in a complex and interdependent society. The State should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initiatives in response to changing conditions, and courts must consider all reasonable expectations whatever their <span title="1233" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1233">p. 1233</span>source. The Takings Clause does not require a static body of state property law; it protects private expectations to ensure private investment. I agree with the Court that nuisance prevention accords with the most common expectations of property owners who face regulation, but I do not believe this can be the sole source of state authority to impose severe restrictions. Coastal property may present such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the State can go further in regulating its development and use than the common law of nuisance might otherwise permit.</p>
<p id="c5f6833c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of South Carolina erred, in my view, by reciting the general purposes for which the state regulations were enacted without a determination that they were in accord with the owner’s reasonable expectations and therefore sufficient to support a severe restriction on specific parcels of property. The promotion of tourism, for instance, ought not to suffice to deprive specific property of all value without a corresponding duty to compensate. Furthermore, the means as well as the ends of regulation must accord with the owner’s reasonable expectations. Here, the State did not act until after the property had been zoned for individual lot development and most other parcels had been improved, throwing the whole burden of the regulation on the remaining lots. This too must be measured in the balance.</p>

<p id="c5f6aa4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse. The Court creates its new taking jurisprudence based on the trial court’s finding that the property had lost all economic value. This finding is almost certainly erroneous. Petitioner still can enjoy other attributes of ownership, such as the right to exclude others, “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.” <i>Kaiser Aetna v. United States</i>, 444 U.S. 164, 176 (1979). Petitioner can picnic, swim, camp in a tent, or live on the property in a movable trailer. State courts frequently have recognized that land has economic value where the only residual economic uses are recreation and camping. Petitioner also retains the right to alienate the land, which would have value for neighbors and for those prepared to enjoy proximity to the ocean without a house.</p>

<p id="c5f6aa50-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court repeatedly has recognized the ability of government, in certain circumstances, to regulate property without compensation no matter how adverse the financial effect on the owner may be. More than a century ago, the Court explicitly upheld the right of States to prohibit uses of property injurious to public health, safety, or welfare without paying compensation: “A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property.” <i>Mugler v. Kansas</i>, 123 U.S. 623, 668-669 (1887). On this basis, the Court upheld an ordinance effectively prohibiting operation of a previously lawful brewery, although the “establishments will become of no value as property.” <i>Id.</i> at 664.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa51-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1234" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1234">p. 1234</span><i>Mugler</i> was only the beginning in a long line of cases. In <i>Powell v. Pennsylvania</i>, 127 U.S. 678 (1888), the Court upheld legislation prohibiting the manufacture of oleomargarine, despite the owner’s allegation that “if prevented from continuing it, the value of his property employed therein would be entirely lost and he be deprived of the means of livelihood.” <i>Id.</i> at 682. In <i>Hadacheck v. Sebastian</i>, 239 U.S. 394 (1915), the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting a brickyard, although the owner had made excavations on the land that prevented it from being utilized for any purpose but a brickyard. In <i>Miller v. Schoene</i>, 276 U.S. 272 (1928), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not require Virginia to pay compensation to the owner of cedar trees ordered destroyed to prevent a disease from spreading to nearby apple orchards. The “preferment of [the public interest] over the property interest of the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects property.” <i>Id.</i> at 280.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, in <i>Goldblatt v. Hempstead</i>, 369 U.S. 590 (1962), the Court upheld a town regulation that barred continued operation of an existing sand and gravel operation in order to protect public safety. “Although a comparison of values before and after is relevant,” the Court stated, “it is by no means conclusive.” <i>Id.</i> at 594. In <i>First Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County</i>, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), the owner alleged that a floodplain ordinance had deprived it of “all use” of the property.

DeBenedictis</i>, 480 U.S. 470 (1987)], the Court summarized over 100 years of precedent: “the Court has repeatedly upheld regulations that destroy or adversely affect real property interests.” 480 U.S. at 489, n.18.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases rest on the principle that the State has full power to prohibit an owner’s use of property if it is harmful to the public. “[S]ince no individual has a right to use his property so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others, the State has not taken’ anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like activity.” <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal</i>, 480 U.S., at 491, n.20. It would make no sense under this theory to suggest that an owner has a constitutionally protected right to harm others, if only he makes the proper showing of economic loss.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately even the Court cannot embrace the full implications of its <i>per se</i> rule: it eventually agrees that there cannot be a categorical rule for a taking based on economic value that wholly disregards the public need asserted. Instead, the Court decides that it will permit a State to regulate all economic value only if the State prohibits uses that would not be permitted under “background principles of nuisance and property law.”</p>
<p id="c5f6aa56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until today, the Court explicitly had rejected the contention that the government’s power to act without paying compensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is a common-law nuisance. The brewery closed in <i>Mugler</i> itself was not a common-law <span title="1235" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1235">p. 1235</span>nuisance, and the Court specifically stated that it was the role of the legislature to determine what measures would be appropriate for the protection of public health and safety. In upholding the state action in <i>Miller</i>, the Court found it unnecessary to “weigh with nicety the question whether the infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to common law; or whether they may be so declared by statute.” 276 U.S., at 280. Instead the Court has relied in the past, as the South Carolina Court has done here, on legislative judgments of what constitutes a harm.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa57-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court rejects the notion that the State always can prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without granting compensation because “the distinction between harm-preventing’ and benefit-conferring’ regulation is often in the eye of the beholder.” Since the characterization will depend “primarily upon one’s evaluation of the worth of competing uses of real estate,” the Court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longer can provide the desired “objective, value-free basis” for upholding a regulation. The Court, however, fails to explain how its proposed common law alternative escapes the same trap.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold inquiry for imposition of the Court’s new rule, “deprivation of all economically valuable use,” itself cannot be determined objectively. As the Court admits, whether the owner has been deprived of all economic value of his property will depend on how “property” is defined. The “composition of the denominator in our deprivation’ fraction,” is the dispositive inquiry. Yet there is no “objective” way to define what that denominator should be. “We have long understood that any land-use regulation can be characterized as the total’ deprivation of an aptly defined entitlement. Alternatively, the same regulation can always be characterized as a mere partial’ withdrawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landholding affected by the regulation.” Michelman, <i>Takings, 1987</i>, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (1988).</p>
<p id="c5f6aa59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even more perplexing, however, is the Court’s reliance on common-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a value-free taking jurisprudence. In determining what is a nuisance at common law, state courts make exactly the decision that the Court finds so troubling when made by the South Carolina General Assembly today: they determine whether the use is harmful.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common-law public and private nuisance law is simply a determination whether a particular use causes harm. There is nothing magical in the reasoning of judges long dead. They determined a harm in the same way as state judges and legislatures do today. If judges in the 18th and 19th centuries can distinguish a harm from a benefit, why not judges in the 20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? There simply is no reason to believe that new interpretations of the hoary common law nuisance doctrine will be particularly “objective” or “value-free.” Once one abandons the level of generality of <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>, one searches in vain, I think, for anything resembling a principle in the common law of nuisance.</p>
<p id="c5f6aa5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court justifies its new rule that the legislature may not deprive a property owner of the only economically valuable use of his land, even if the legislature finds it to be a harmful use, because such action is not part of the “long recognized” “understandings of our citizens.” These “understandings” permit such regulation only if the use is a nuisance under the common law. Any other course is “inconsistent with <span title="1236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1236">p. 1236</span>the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause.” It is not clear from the Court’s opinion where our “historical compact” or “citizens’ understanding” comes from, but it does not appear to be history.</p>
<p id="c5f6d16c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle that the State should compensate individuals for property taken for public use was not widely established in America at the time of the Revolution. “The colonists . . . inherited . . . a concept of property which permitted extensive regulation of the use of that property for the public benefit — regulation that could even go so far as to deny all productive use of the property to the owner if, as Coke himself stated, the regulation extends to the public benefit . . . for this is for the public, and every one hath benefit by it.’ ” F. Bosselman, D. Callies &amp; J. Banta, <i>The Taking Issue</i> 80-81 (1973), quoting <i>The Case of the King’s Prerogative in Saltpetre</i>, 12 Co. Rep. 12-13 (1606).</p>
<p id="c5f6d16d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although, prior to the adoption of the Bill of Rights, America was replete with land use regulations describing which activities were considered noxious and forbidden, the Fifth Amendment’s Taking Clause originally did not extend to regulations of property, whatever the effect. Most state courts agreed with this narrow interpretation of a taking. Even when courts began to consider that regulation in some situations could constitute a taking, they continued to uphold bans on particular uses without paying compensation, notwithstanding the economic impact, under the rationale that no one can obtain a vested right to injure or endanger the public.</p>
<p id="c5f6d16e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the State’s power to regulate harmful uses even to the point of destroying all economic value. Nothing in the discussions in Congress concerning the Taking Clause indicates that the Clause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine. In short, I find no clear and accepted “historical compact” or “understanding of our citizens” justifying the Court’s new taking doctrine.</p>

<p id="c5f6d170-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s new [categorical] rule is wholly arbitrary. A landowner whose property is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an owner whose property is diminished 100% recovers the land’s full value. Moreover, because of the elastic nature of property rights, the Court’s new rule will also prove unsound in practice. In response to the rule, courts may define “property” broadly and only rarely find regulations to effect total takings.</p>
<p id="c5f6d171-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, developers and investors may market specialized estates to take advantage of the Court’s new rule. The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatory change will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, for example, purchase the right to build a multi-family home on a specific lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that allows only single-family homes would render the investor’s property interest “valueless.” In short, the categorical rule will likely have one of two effects: Either courts will alter the definition of the “denominator” in the takings “fraction,” rendering the Court’s categorical rule meaningless, or investors will manipulate the relevant property interests, giving the Court’s rule sweeping effect. To my mind, neither of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both are distortions of our takings jurisprudence.</p>
<p id="c5f6d172-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1237">p. 1237</span>Like many bright-line rules, the categorical rule established in this case is only “categorical” for a page or two in the U.S. Reports. No sooner does the Court state that “total regulatory takings must be compensated,” than it quickly establishes an exception to that rule. The exception provides that a regulation that renders property valueless is not a taking if it prohibits uses of property that were not “previously permissible under relevant property and nuisance principles.” The Court’s holding today effectively freezes the State’s common law, denying the legislature much of its traditional power to revise the law governing the rights and uses of property. Arresting the development of the common law is not only a departure from our prior decisions; it is also profoundly unwise. The human condition is one of constant learning and evolution — both moral and practical. Legislatures implement that new learning; in doing so they must often revise the definition of property and the rights of property owners. Thus, when the Nation came to understand that slavery was morally wrong and mandated the emancipation of all slaves, it, in effect, redefined “property.” On a lesser scale, our ongoing self-education produces similar changes in the rights of property owners: New appreciation of the significance of endangered species, the importance of wetlands, and the vulnerability of coastal lands, shapes our evolving understandings of property rights.</p>
<p id="c5f6d173-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, some legislative redefinitions of property will effect a taking and must be compensated — but it certainly cannot be the case that every movement away from common law does so. There is no reason, and less sense, in such an absolute rule. We live in a world in which changes in the economy and the environment occur with increasing frequency and importance. If it was wise a century ago to allow Government “the largest legislative discretion” to deal with “the special exigencies of the moment,” <i>Mugler</i>, 123 U.S., at 669, it is imperative to do so today. The rule that should govern a decision in a case of this kind should focus on the future, not the past.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1137C_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1137C_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">30</a></span></p>

<p id="c5f6d177-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001).</b> Anthony Palazzolo was denied permits to develop his waterfront property in Rhode Island by a state agency charged with enforcing laws regulating construction on the coast. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval to fill in his coastal marshlands and develop 74 homes there, Palazzolo sued the State of Rhode Island, seeking $3,150,000 in compensation for a taking of his property. He argued, on the authority of <i>Lucas</i>, that he had been <span title="1238" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1238">p. 1238</span>denied all economically viable use of his property because it appeared that the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council would not allow him to build anything on the waterfront property. It did appear that the agency would allow him to develop the upland part of the property away from the water; that development was worth $200,000.</p>
<p id="c5f6d178-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected his takings claim for three reasons. First, the court held that his claim was not ripe for decision; the state agency had merely rejected several development proposals and had not issued a final ruling that clearly denied any right to develop the marshland area. Second, the court held that Palazzolo had not been deprived of all economic value because he could develop the upland property away from the water. Third, the court noted that at the time Palazzolo acquired title to the property from the prior owner (a corporation in which he had held shares and eventually became the sole shareholder), the law regulating coastal development was already in place. The court held that Palazzolo could have no “reasonable” investment-backed expectations at the time he acquired title if existing laws at the time he acquired title made his intended use of the property illegal. In effect, the state court created a safe haven rule that would have protected the state from any takings claim by an owner who obtained title after a regulatory law restricting the use of that property came into effect.</p>
<p id="c5f6d179-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court reversed the first and third findings and reserved judgment on the second. Over the objections of three dissenters, the Court found, first, that the evidence was sufficiently clear that the coastal agency would not allow any of the marshland to be filled in; thus the scope of the permitted development was clear and the takings claim was ripe for decision. <i>See also MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v. Yolo County</i>, 477 U.S. 340, 351 (1986); <i>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City</i>, 473 U.S. 172 (1985) (both holding that a takings claim is not ripe for decision unless the state has made a final decision on the scope of the permitted development).</p>
<p id="c5f6d17a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the Supreme Court refused to define the constitutional standard for determining whether Palazzolo had been denied all economically viable use of his land. Because it appeared that he could develop some of his land, but not all of it, the Court was confronted with the “denominator” question reserved in <i>Lucas</i>. Was the development ban a 100 percent taking of the portion of his land that could not be developed or only a partial taking of his whole parcel (the upland land that could be developed combined with the marshland that could not be developed)? Palazzolo had argued that it was irrelevant that he was allowed to develop 18 acres in the upland part of his property; because the wetlands law prevented him from building on his substantial waterfront property, that law had effectively converted a substantial portion of his property into a “nature reserve,” denying him 100 percent of the value of that land. In deciding whether this was a partial taking or a total taking, he argued that the relevant denominator was the developable tract or some subset of his whole property. The fact that he was allowed to develop part of his property did not alter the fact that he was denied the right to develop most of his land; the land he could not develop had been deprived of all economically viable use. The Supreme Court found that Palazzolo had effectively waived this argument below. However, Justice Kennedy observed that <span title="1239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1239">p. 1239</span>“[s]ome of our cases indicate that the extent of deprivation effected by a regulatory action is measured against the value of the parcel as a whole, but we have at times expressed discomfort with the logic of this rule.” 533 U.S. at 631.</p>
<p id="c5f6d17b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling that states are insulated from taking claims merely because an owner has acquired title after a regulatory law went into effect. The fact that the owner took title with notice of the regulation did not, by itself, immunize the state from facing a challenge to the regulation as a taking of property. Justice Kennedy explained, <i>id.</i> at 627-630:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f6f88c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right to improve property, of course, is subject to the reasonable exercise of state authority, including the enforcement of valid zoning and land-use restrictions. The Takings Clause, however, in certain circumstances allows a landowner to assert that a particular exercise of the State’s regulatory power is so unreasonable or onerous as to compel compensation. Just as a prospective enactment, such as a new zoning ordinance, can limit the value of land without effecting a taking because it can be understood as reasonable by all concerned, other enactments are unreasonable and do not become less so through passage of time or title. Were we to accept the State’s rule, the postenactment transfer of title would absolve the State of its obligation to defend any action restricting land use, no matter how extreme or unreasonable. A State would be allowed, in effect, to put an expiration date on the Takings Clause. This ought not to be the rule. Future generations, too, have a right to challenge unreasonable limitations on the use and value of land.</p>
<p id="c5f6f88d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does the justification of notice take into account the effect on owners at the time of enactment, who are prejudiced as well. Should an owner attempt to challenge a new regulation, but not survive the process of ripening his or her claim (which, as this case demonstrates, will often take years), under the proposed rule the right to compensation may not be asserted by an heir or successor, and so may not be asserted at all. The State’s rule would work a critical alteration to the nature of property, as the newly regulated landowner is stripped of the ability to transfer the interest which was possessed prior to the regulation. The State may not by this means secure a windfall for itself.</p>
<p id="c5f6f88e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have no occasion to consider the precise circumstances when a legislative enactment can be deemed a background principle of state law or whether those circumstances are present here. It suffices to say that a regulation that otherwise would be unconstitutional absent compensation is not transformed into a background principle of the State’s law by mere virtue of the passage of title.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5f6f88f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the lower court had found that this was not a 100 percent taking of the property’s value, the <i>Lucas</i> rule did not apply. However, the general multifactor <i>Penn Central</i> test did apply and the Supreme Court remanded the case to be addressed under that standard.</p>
<p id="c5f6f890-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice O’Connor concurred, agreeing that the acquisition of title after a regulatory law was passed did not protect the state from a takings claim. She explained, <i>id.</i> at 632-633 (O’Connor, J., concurring):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f6f891-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more difficult question is what role the temporal relationship between regulatory enactment and title acquisition plays in a proper <i>Penn Central</i> analysis. Today’s holding does not mean that the timing of the regulation’s enactment relative to the <span title="1240" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1240">p. 1240</span>acquisition of title is immaterial to the <i>Penn Central</i> analysis. Indeed, it would be just as much error to expunge this consideration from the takings inquiry as it would be to accord it exclusive significance. Our polestar instead remains the principles set forth in <i>Penn Central</i> itself and our other cases that govern partial regulatory takings. Under these cases, interference with investment-backed expectations is one of a number of factors that a court must examine. Further, the regulatory regime in place at the time the claimant acquires the property at issue helps to shape the reasonableness of those expectations.</p>
<p id="c5f6f892-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If investment-backed expectations are given exclusive significance in the <i>Penn Central</i> analysis and existing regulations dictate the reasonableness of those expectations in every instance, then the State wields far too much power to redefine property rights upon passage of title. On the other hand, if existing regulations do nothing to inform the analysis, then some property owners may reap windfalls and an important indicium of fairness is lost. As I understand it, our decision today does not remove the regulatory backdrop against which an owner takes title to property from the purview of the <i>Penn Central</i> inquiry. It simply restores balance to that inquiry. Courts properly consider the effect of existing regulations under the rubric of investment-backed expectations in determining whether a compensable taking has occurred. As before, the salience of these facts cannot be reduced to any “set formula.” The temptation to adopt what amount to <i>per se</i> rules in either direction must be resisted. The Takings Clause requires careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances in this context.</p>

<p id="c5f6f894-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the fact that a restriction existed at the time the purchaser took title (other than a restriction forming part of the “background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance”) should have no bearing upon the determination of whether the restriction is so substantial as to constitute a taking. The “investment-backed expectations” that the law will take into account do not include the assumed validity of a restriction that in fact deprives property of so much of its value as to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p id="c5f6f896-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On remand, the Rhode Island trial court found that development of Palazzolo’s salt marsh land south of a shallow, tidal pond would constitute a public nuisance because it would inhibit the “valuable filtering system regarding water runoff containing pollutants and nitrogen from adjacent land.” <i>Palazzolo v. State,</i> No. WM 88-0297, 2005 WL 1645974, at *3 (R.I. Super. Ct. 2005). The court also found that half of the property was below the mean high water line, making it tidal land subject to the public trust doctrine, which defines such lands as owned by the public and not subject to private development at all. Finally, the court found that although one upland site could be developed, almost no lower lots could ever have been profitably developed because of the extraordinary engineering costs involved in draining the site and preparing the site to support structures. Thus, there was no taking of property.</p>
<p id="c5f6f897-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1241" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1241">p. 1241</span><b>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302 (2002).</b> A regional planning agency placed a temporary moratorium on construction around Lake Tahoe. The moratorium officially lasted for 32 months, but a court injunction effectively extended the ban on construction for as much as 6 years. The construction ban was intended to allow the agency time to develop a plan to limit construction around the lake to prevent the loss of Lake Tahoe’s “exceptional clarity.” Unlike most lakes, Lake Tahoe lacked algae that obscures the water clarity; the district court found that undue development could change runoff patterns in a manner that would not only destroy this clarity, but that it would be impossible to fix for 700 years, if at all. Petitioners were owners of land around the lake who claimed that the temporary building moratorium took all economically viable use of their property for the period in which it was in effect and that this amounted to a categorical (although temporary) taking of their property for which they were entitled to compensation under the rule in <i>Lucas.</i></p>
<p id="c5f6f898-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court disagreed, refusing to find that a temporary building moratorium was a <i>per se</i> taking of property. Justice Stevens explained that, despite the attempts in <i>Loretto</i> and <i>Lucas</i> to develop some rules that could identify categorical takings, the Court has “ generally eschewed’ any set formula” for identifying regulatory takings, instead engaging in “essentially <i>ad hoc</i>, factual inquiries.” <i>Id.</i> at 326. “Indeed,” wrote Justice Stevens, “we still resist the temptation to adopt <i>per se</i> rules in our cases involving partial regulatory takings, preferring to examine a number of factors’ rather than a simple mathematically precise’ formula.” <i>Id.</i> The majority opinion went on to quote Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion in <i>Palazzolo</i> at some length, agreeing with her inclination to “resist[] the temptation to adopt what amount to <i>per se</i> rules in either direction.” <i>Id.</i> at 321.</p>
<p id="c5f6f899-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court acknowledged that a prior case, <i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles</i>, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), had held that owners are entitled to sue for compensation for temporary takings of their property. When a regulation is determined to be a taking, the government may either enforce the regulation and pay compensation for the loss of property rights or decide to forgo enforcing the regulation and pay compensation for the temporary loss of property rights during the time the regulation limited the use of the property. However, Justice Stevens explained that <i>First English</i> merely held that compensation should be paid when a taking is found; it did not hold that a temporary limit on construction necessarily constituted a taking.</p>
<p id="c5f6f89a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court clarified that it meant what it said in <i>Lucas</i>: only a 100 percent diminution in value of the property — a “complete elimination of value” — triggered the <i>Lucas</i> rule. <i>Id.</i> at 330. Any lesser deprivation of value is governed by the multifactor <i>Penn Central</i> test. <i>See also Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A.</i>, 544 U.S. 528, 538 (2005) (<i>Lucas</i> applies to regulations that “completely deprive an owner of <i>all</i> economically beneficial use of her property”). Because ownership extends over time as well as space, a temporary moratorium, by definition, does not result in a complete elimination of value, <i>id.</i> at 334-335:</p>

Such a rule would undoubtedly require changes in numerous practices that have long been considered permissible exercises of the police power. As Justice Holmes warned in <i>Mahon</i>, “government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.” 260 U.S. at 413.

They argued that the development ban, as extended by court injunction, had actually lasted for six years and that such a long moratorium was not reasonably related to legitimate land use planning needs.

The “practical equivalence,” from the landowner’s point of view, of a “temporary” ban on all economic use is a forced leasehold. For example, assume the following situation: Respondent is contemplating the creation of a National Park around Lake Tahoe to preserve its scenic beauty. Respondent decides to take a 6-year leasehold over petitioners’ property, during which any human activity on the land would be prohibited, in order to prevent any further destruction to the area while it was deciding whether to request that the area be designated a National Park. Surely that leasehold would require compensation.</p>

Rules, standards, and the “denominator” problem.</b> The <i>Lucas</i> rule applies when an owner has been deprived of “economically viable use,” but this seemingly bright line rule raises a variation on the denominator problem that first emerged in the debate between Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis in <i>Mahon</i>. Consider a developer who seeks to develop 50 acres. Does a regulation prohibiting development of 5 acres constitute a 100 percent taking of the 5 acres or only a 10 percent taking of the 50 acres? Is the denominator 5 or 50? This can have a great deal of practical significance, because a regulation that falls within the <i>Lucas</i> rule is generally more vulnerable than one that is evaluated based on <i>Penn Central</i>’s<i> ad hoc</i> approach.</p>

Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit held that the courts must use a “flexible approach, designed to account for factual nuances” to determine <span title="1243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1243">p. 1243</span>the appropriate “denominator” for calculating whether a <i>Lucas</i> total deprivation has occurred. <i>See also Dunes W.

<p id="c5f71fb2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possibility is the “whole property” owned by the developer — in this case, the entire 50 acres. The trial judge on remand in <i>Palazzolo</i> used this measure: “This Justice finds that the denominator or parcel as a whole’ is that property in which Palazzolo invested that is subject to the regulations.” 2005 WL 1645974, at *3. Another possibility is the “developable tract” or the area that could have been developed under reasonable zoning laws — in this case the five acres. When air rights are at issue, the courts have consistently held that a height limit does not constitute a 100 percent taking of air rights over that limit; the denominator is the tract as a whole. However, the Federal Circuit has sometimes held that, in the context of wetlands regulations, the denominator is the developable tract. <i>Palm Beach Isles Associates v. United States</i>, 208 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (relevant parcel was a 50.7-acre tract out of an original 311.7-acre purchase); <i>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, supra</i> (relevant parcel was a 12.5-acre tract out of an original 51-acre purchase). The Federal Circuit continues to vacillate on this issue. <i>Compare Norman v. United States</i>, 429 F.3d 1081, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (proper denominator is the entire 2,280 acres held for development purposes, not the individual parcels), <i>with Lost Tree Village Corp. v. United States</i>, 707 F.3d 1286, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing <i>Loveladies</i> and finding that an individual plat rather than the larger property originally purchased as one contiguous lot that included that plat, was the relevant parcel). Should the denominator be the individual lots that zoning and land use law allow to be separately developed? Which definition of the “denominator” is correct?</p>
<p id="c5f71fb3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in <i>Murr v. Wisconsin</i>, 136 S. Ct. 890 (2016), to examine again the contours of the parcel-as-a-whole rule. In 1960, William and Dorothy Murr purchased a parcel of land along the St. Croix River in Wisconsin, on which they built a vacation cabin; in 1963, the couple bought an adjacent parcel, which remained undeveloped. In 1994 and 1995, the couple transferred both parcels in turn to their children. In 2004, the children decided to sell the empty parcel to raise money to upgrade the cabin. A county ordinance passed in 1975, however, required that parcels contain at least an acre of buildable land before buildings could be constructed on them. The law permits building on undeveloped lots under one acre created before 1976, but because the Murrs own both lots, and there is already a residence on the combined lots, their property does not qualify for the exception. Because the parcel the Murr children wanted to sell had only half a buildable acre, it could not be developed separately from the developed lot. The Murr children asserted that the ordinance deprived them of “all, or practically all, of the use” of the empty parcel, but a Wisconsin appellate court disagreed, upholding the county’s treatment of the contiguous lots. <i>See Murr v. State</i>, 359 Wis. 2d 675, 859 N.W.2d 628 (Table), at *1-*2 (2014). Before the Supreme Court, the case raises questions about the role of state law in defining property interests for purposes of federal regulatory takings analysis and the relevance of the timing of the transfers and the ordinance addressing the treatment of contiguous parcels, among other issues.

Background principles of property law.</b> Many owners have brought inverse condemnation cases challenging the application of environmental protection statutes to their property. Many statutes designed to protect the environment also severely restrict the development of particular types of land, such as wetlands and habitats for endangered species. The courts have traditionally upheld these regulations, even when they have severely limited land development, by analogy to nuisance laws, which prevent owners from using their land in a way that will injure the community. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Gardner v. N.J. Pinelands Commission</i>, 593 A.2d 251 (N.J. 1991); <i>Presbytery of Seattle v. King County</i>, 787 P.2d 907 (Wash. 1990); <i>Just v. Marinette County</i>, 201 N.W.2d 761 (Wis. 1972). The Federal Circuit and the Court of Federal Claims have suggested or ruled that compensation is required when wetlands or endangered species act regulations have prevented all development of land. <i>Palm Beach Isles Associates v. United States</i>, 231 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (wetlands); <i>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v. United States</i>, 50 Fed.

<p id="c5f71fb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in these cases is whether laws that deprive owners of “economically viable use” are constitutional because they “inhere in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership background principles of the State’s law of property and nuisance” and thus regulate conduct that was never part of the owner’s title in the first place? On remand in <i>Palazzolo,</i> the court found that development of Palazzolo’s salt marsh land south of a shallow, tidal pond would constitute a public nuisance because it would inhibit the “valuable filtering system regarding water runoff containing pollutants and nitrogen from adjacent land” and thus his property rights never included the power to engage in this proposed development. <i>Palazzolo v. State</i>, No. WM 88-0297, 2005 WL 1645974, at *3 (R.I. Super. Ct. 2005). In contrast, on remand in <i>Lucas</i>, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that construction of housing on the coast would not have constituted a public or private nuisance under the common law existing before the regulatory laws limited such development. <i>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</i>, 424 S.E.2d 484 (S.C. 1992).</p>
<p id="c5f746c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can “background principles” evolve? Justice Stevens, in his <i>Lucas</i> dissent, argued that the decision “effectively freezes the State’s common law,” but is there any reason why judges in evaluating common law nuisances cannot recognize new harms? In <i>Prah v. Maretti</i>, 321 N.W.2d 182 (Wis. 1982), the Wisconsin Supreme Court recognized that interference with solar panels can be a private nuisance, see Chapter 6, §3. Does this suggest that the harm principle is no longer relevant?</p>
<p id="c5f746c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Public nuisance and legislative latitude to define “background principles.” </b>Legislatures have traditionally had wide latitude to define public nuisance in order to address harms that would not necessarily constitute private nuisances. In his <i>Lucas</i> concurrence and again in his majority opinion in <i>Palazzolo</i>, Justice Kennedy raised — but did not answer — the question whether and in what way a legislative enactment can become a “background principle” of a state’s law of property. One way <span title="1245" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1245">p. 1245</span>this may happen is when regulatory regimes become widespread enough that they become part of the reasonable expectations of most owners. Comprehensive zoning codes were considered innovative at the time the Supreme Court validated that approach to regulating property in <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,</i> 272 U.S. 365 (1926). Today few owners would question the idea that zoning is not a part of the background principles of every state. <i>Cf. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v.

<p id="c5f746c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public nuisance has also become increasingly important in the context of criminal activity, which again raises the question of the latitude allowed for abating public nuisances without compensation. In <i>City of Seattle v. McCoy</i>, 4 P.3d 159 (Wash. Ct. App. 2000), the court found a regulatory taking when a restaurant was temporarily closed as a drug nuisance when the owner had acted reasonably and done as much as possible to prevent the drug use. The court found a total taking under <i>Lucas</i> and that the nuisance exception to <i>Lucas</i> did not apply because it interpreted state law not to impose absolute liability for nuisance on an owner who took all reasonable steps to prevent illegal activity on the property. The court held that abatement of a business could not be based on illegal acts of business patrons when the owners were not aware of or involved in the illegal activity.</p>
<p id="c5f746c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Destruction and necessity.</b> In a footnote in <i>Lucas</i>, Justice Scalia indicated that the destruction of “real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity” need not be compensated. This issue arises commonly when property is damaged pursuant to police activities. A car may be hit in a chase; a building may be damaged in pursuit of a criminal. Most courts hold that no compensation is required when such injuries occur. In <i>Eggleston v. Pierce County</i>, 64 P.3d 618 (Wash. 2003), the court found no taking when a home was rendered uninhabitable because of damage that occurred when police executed a search of the house pursuant to a valid search warrant. The police came to the house to arrest the owner’s son for drug dealing; he engaged in an exchange of fire with the police and killed a police officer. The search warrant authorized the police to take evidence from the home; that evidence included two walls, one of which was load bearing. Its removal made the house unstable and uninhabitable. The court held that the seizure of evidence for a criminal trial can never be a taking; nor was the damage to the home pursuant to the police efforts to apprehend a criminal. <i>Accord, Kam-Almaz v. United States</i>, 682 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding no taking from seizure and examination of laptop at an airport immigration and customs station resulting in damage to the hard drive and the loss of irretrievable business records);<i> Johnson v. Manitowoc County</i>, 635 F.3d 331 (7th Cir. 2011) (destruction of a concrete garage floor with a jackhammer during a murder investigation was not a taking). In contrast, in <i>Steele v. City of Houston</i>, 603 S.W.2d 786 (Tex. 1980), the court found a taking when police had burned down an innocent person’s home to eject suspects. <i>Accord</i>,<i> Wegner v.

<p id="c5f746ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are governments liable for takings of property when they inadvertently or negligently cause damage to property? <i>Pumpelly v.

City of San Diego</i>, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 897 (Ct. App. 2000), the court held that a city had taken property when a pipe leading to a fire hydrant corroded and burst, flooding a house, because the “city’s water delivery system was deliberately designed, constructed, and maintained without any method or program for monitoring the inevitable deterioration of cast iron pipes other than waiting for a pipe to break.” And in <i>Richards v. Washington Terminal Co.</i>, 233 U.S. 546 (1914), the Supreme Court held that government may legislatively authorize a railroad to commit what would otherwise be a nuisance without any requirement of paying compensation for the lost value of property but that if a particular owner suffers “special and peculiar damage” then compensation may be due. <i>See</i> Carlos A.

<p id="c5f76ddb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hurricane Katrina led to the destruction of much of New Orleans, and it has been argued that the damage was partly caused by negligent construction of levees and the water drainage system, as well as design flaws in the canal system in the city that caused the erosion of wetlands and channeled water into particular areas of the city. If the homeowners in New Orleans could prove that the flooding that destroyed most of the property in the city would not have occurred if the flood control system had been designed, built, and maintained better, do they have a takings claim against the federal government that designed the flood control system in the city? <i>Nicholson v. United States</i>, 77 Fed. Cl. 605 (2007), answered this question in the negative on the ground that a taking occurs only if the government intends to invade a property interest or the harm is the “direct, natural, or probable result of an authorized activity and not the incidental or consequential injury inflicted by the action.” <i>Id.</i> at 617. Do you agree with that approach? </p>
<p id="c5f76ddc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Temporary takings and the temporal denominator.</b> As <i>Tahoe-Sierra</i> notes, the Court in <i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles</i>, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), held that owners might be able to obtain damages for a <b>temporary taking</b> if they were prevented from using their property for any period. A court judgment that a regulation constitutes a taking of property leaves the regulatory body with the choice of enforcing the regulation (in which case compensation must be paid for a permanent taking) or rescinding the regulation (in which case the owner may have a claim for damages for a temporary taking for the period when the regulation was enforced against him). However, <i>Tahoe-Sierra</i> explained that a building ban does not necessarily constitute a taking, especially if it is temporary. <i>Tahoe-Sierra</i> approached the question of how long the period of a ban must be to give rise to a taking the same way that the Court had approached the question of the appropriate physical “denominator” for takings claims. Just as the owner of Grand Central in the <i>Penn Central</i> case could not legitimately isolate the physical area over which it had air rights as a distinctive “parcel,” the Court in <i>Tahoe-Sierra</i> held that an owner cannot isolate the <i>slice of time</i> over which it had the right to build as a distinctive (temporal) piece of property. The parcel-as-a-whole rule prohibits this kind of conceptual severance.</p>

<p id="c5f76de0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> A developer who owns 50 acres of property subdivides it and sells 45 single-family homes on single-acre lots. One 5-acre parcel remains but is designated as wetlands; under state law, the owner is prohibited from building anything on it. The developer sues the state, arguing that the wetlands regulation deprives her of any economically viable use for the 5 acres of wetlands; the diminution in value for this parcel is 100 percent. The state claims that the parcel represents 10 percent of the total area that the developer had owned and that since the developer had sold 45 homes, she was not deprived of economically viable use for her property. How should the court analyze this question? Is this a 100 percent taking of the 5 acres or a 10 percent taking of the 50 acres? Should the owner be entitled to compensation for her inability to develop the 5-acre parcel?</p>
<p id="c5f794f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3.</b> In <i>Hunziker v. State</i>, 519 N.W.2d 367 (Iowa 1994), a lot owner was prevented from building a house on his lot when excavators discovered an American Indian burial mound made between 1,000 and 2,500 years ago in the middle of his property. A state statute in effect at the time the developer purchased the land authorized the state archeologist to prohibit owners from disinterring human remains found on private land if they had historic significance. The archeologist so found and required a buffer zone around the mound to protect its continued existence. The original developers of the subdivision refunded the purchase price and took back title and then sued the state, claiming that their inability to develop the lot deprived them of all economically viable use and that the statute, as applied to the lot, constituted a taking of property. The court held that the <i>Lucas</i> rule did not apply because the restriction on developing property where human beings are buried was part of the law of Iowa at the time the owner purchased the land and thus “inhered in the title.” Because state law did not allow development in these circumstances, the owner could not have had a legitimate expectation of being able to so develop the property. The case is appealed to the Supreme Court. Should it affirm or reverse? It should be noted that state laws have traditionally regulated and required the preservation of marked cemeteries but only recently have states passed laws protecting older unmarked graves of American Indians. <i>See</i> Chapter 3, §7.2.

In contrast, a challenge to a regulation “as applied” argues that the <i>effect</i> of the regulation on a <i>particular</i> parcel or parcels of property owned by the plaintiff constitutes a taking of the plaintiff’s property. Facial challenges are likely to succeed only in cases where a law imposes a permanent physical invasion of property, <i>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</i>, 458 U.S. 419 (1982), or completely extinguishes a core property right, such as the right to pass on fee simple property at death, <i>Babbitt v.

In general, this means that an owner must apply for a permit to develop the land and be denied that right in a manner that suggests that further applications will be fruitless. <i>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates v. Yolo County</i>, 477 U.S. 340 (1986); <i>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City</i>, 473 U.S. 172 (1985).

Moreover, once an owner goes to state court to argue that a regulatory law constitutes a taking of property as applied to that owner’s property, and the state courts rule on the owner’s takings claim, the only way to attain federal court review is by appealing through the state court system and then seeking a writ of <i>certiorari</i> from the Supreme Court. The owner is not entitled to bring an action in federal district court to challenge the ruling of a state supreme court as effecting an unconstitutional taking because the federal full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. §1738, requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to final state court judgments. <i>San Remo Hotel L.P. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco</i>, 545 U.S. 323 (2005).

<p id="c5f7bc08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Civil rights.</b> Section 1983 authorizes a party who has been deprived of a federal right under the color of state law to seek relief through “an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” 42 U.S.C. §1983. <i>City of Monterey, supra</i>, held that an owner may sue the city under §1983 for violating its civil rights by taking its property through repeatedly rejecting development proposals over a five-year period, thus arguably denying the owner economically viable use of the property. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s finding that the city had both taken the owner’s property and denied plaintiff equal protection by treating the owner differently from other similarly situated owners without adequate reason. <i>City of Monterey</i> approved the use of §1983 as a remedy for a takings claim even though the effect of the ruling was to allow a jury rather than the judge to decide whether a taking had occurred. The Supreme Court held that this was permissible in that the jury’s discretion was constrained by proper instructions limiting them to determining whether the “the city’s particular decision to deny Del Monte Dunes’ final development proposal was reasonably related to the city’s proffered justifications.” <i>Id.</i> at 706. <i>But see Wilkie v.

<p id="c5f7bc0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, individuals are generally free to write a will determining who will own their property when they die. Statutes require wills to be in writing and to be witnessed (generally by two persons). Individuals are free to sell or give away their property before death so as to leave nothing to their family members when they pass on. Family members have no right to inherit property. U.S. law generally allows parents to disinherit their children. Every state does provide some protection for surviving spouses, however. Most states allow a surviving spouse to reject the will and recover a set portion of the decedent’s estate (<b>statutory forced share statutes</b>). Many states also protect the right of a surviving spouse to continue living in the marital <b>homestead</b>. Other states provide for joint ownership of property acquired during marriage and give the surviving spouse half the <b>community property</b> acquired during the <span title="1250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1250">p. 1250</span>marriage on the death of the spouse. The property of those who die without a valid will is distributed to the decedent’s <b>heirs</b> as specified in the state <b>intestacy statute</b>. Some intestacy laws divide the decedent’s property between a surviving spouse and the children, while others leave everything to the surviving spouse. If the decedent leaves no spouse and no children, then other relatives are entitled to inherit, such as parents, uncles and aunts, and cousins. If the decedent leaves no heirs, the property will <b>escheat</b> to the state.</p>

<p id="c5f7e324-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, we consider for a second time the constitutionality of an escheat-to-tribe provision of the <i>Indian Land Consolidation Act</i> (ILCA). 96 Stat. 2519, <i>as amended</i>, 25 U.S.C. §2206. Specifically, we address §207 of the ILCA, as amended in 1984. Congress enacted the original provision in 1983 to ameliorate the extreme fractionation problem attending a century-old allotment policy that yielded multiple ownership of single parcels of Indian land. Amended §207 provides that certain small interests in Indian lands will transfer — or “escheat” — to the tribe upon the death of the owner of the interest. In <i>Hodel v. Irving</i>, 481 U.S. 704 (1987), this Court held that the original version of §207 of the ILCA effected a taking of private property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We now hold that amended §207 does not cure the constitutional deficiency this Court identified in the original version of §207.</p>
<p id="c5f7e325-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I</i></p>
<p id="c5f7e326-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late Nineteenth Century, Congress initiated an Indian land program that authorized the division of communal Indian property. Pursuant to this allotment policy, some Indian land was parceled out to individual tribal members. Lands not allotted to individual Indians were opened to non-Indians for settlement. <i>See Indian General Allotment Act of 1887</i>, ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388. Allotted lands were held in trust by the United States or owned by the allottee subject to restrictions on alienation. On the death of the allottee, the land descended according to the laws of the State or Territory in which the land was located. In 1910, Congress also provided that allottees could devise their interests in allotted land.</p>
<p id="c5f7e327-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The allotment policy “quickly proved disastrous for the Indians.” <i>Irving</i>, 481 U.S. at 707. The program produced a dramatic decline in the amount of land in Indian hands. And as allottees passed their interests on to multiple heirs, ownership of allotments became increasingly fractionated, with some parcels held by dozens of owners. A number of factors augmented the problem: Because Indians often died without wills, many interests passed to multiple heirs; Congress’ allotment Acts subjected trust lands to alienation restrictions that impeded holders of small interests from <span title="1251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1251">p. 1251</span>transferring those interests; Indian lands were not subject to state real estate taxes, which ordinarily serve as a strong disincentive to retaining small fractional interests in land. The fractionation problem proliferated with each succeeding generation as multiple heirs took undivided interests in allotments.</p>
<p id="c5f7e328-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The administrative difficulties and economic inefficiencies associated with multiple undivided ownership in allotted lands gained official attention as early as 1928. <i>See</i> L. Meriam, <i>Institute for Government Research, The Problem of Indian Administration</i> 40-41 (1928). Governmental administration of these fractionated interests proved costly, and individual owners of small undivided interests could not make productive use of the land. Congress ended further allotment in 1934. <i>See Indian Reorganization Act</i>, 25 U.S.C. §§461 <i>et seq</i>. But that action left the legacy in place. As most owners had more than one heir, interests in lands already allotted continued to splinter with each generation. In the 1960’s, congressional studies revealed that approximately half of all allotted trust lands were held in fractionated ownership; for over a quarter of allotted trust lands, individual allotments were held by more than six owners to a parcel.</p>
<p id="c5f7e329-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1983, Congress adopted the ILCA in part to reduce fractionated ownership of allotted lands. Section 207 of the Act — the “escheat” provision — prohibited the descent or devise of small fractional interests in allotments. Instead of passing to heirs, such fractional interests would escheat to the tribe, thereby consolidating the ownership of Indian lands. Congress defined the targeted fractional interest as one that both constituted 2 percent or less of the total acreage in an allotted tract and had earned less than $100 in the preceding year. Section 207 made no provision for the payment of compensation to those who held such interests.</p>
<p id="c5f7e32a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Hodel v. Irving</i>, this Court invalidated §207 on the ground that it effected a taking of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The appellees in <i>Irving</i> were, or represented, heirs or devisees of members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. But for §207, the appellees would have received 41 fractional interests in allotments; under §207, those interests would escheat to the Tribe. This Court tested the legitimacy of §207 by considering its economic impact, its effect on investment-backed expectations, and the essential character of the measure. Turning first to the economic impact of §207, the Court in <i>Irving</i> observed that the provision’s income-generation test might fail to capture the actual economic value of the land. The Court next indicated that §207 likely did not interfere with investment-backed expectations. Key to the decision in <i>Irving</i>, however, was the “extraordinary” character of the Government regulation. As this Court noted, §207 amounted to the “virtual abrogation of the right to pass on a certain type of property.” Such a complete abrogation of the rights of descent and devise could not be upheld.</p>
<p id="c5f7e32b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5f7e32c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1984, while <i>Irving</i> was still pending in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, Congress amended §207. Amended §207 differs from the original escheat provision in three relevant respects. First, an interest is considered fractional if it both constitutes 2 percent or less of the total acreage of the parcel and “is incapable of earning $100 in any one of the five years [following the] decedent’s death” — as opposed to one year <span title="1252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1252">p. 1252</span>before the decedent’s death in the original §207. 25 U.S.C. §2206(a). If the interest earned less than $100 in any one of five years prior to the decedent’s death, “there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such interest is incapable of earning $100 in any one of the five years following the death of the decedent.” <i>Id</i>. Second, in lieu of a total ban on devise and descent of fractional interests, amended §207 permits devise of an otherwise escheatable interest to “any other owner of an undivided fractional interest in such parcel or tract” of land. 25 U.S.C. §2206(b). Finally, tribes are authorized to override the provisions of amended §207 through the adoption of their own codes governing the disposition of fractional interests; these codes are subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. 25 U.S.C. §2206(c). In <i>Irving</i>, “we express[ed] no opinion on the constitutionality of §207 as amended.” 481 U.S. at 710, n.1.</p>
<p id="c5f7e32d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under amended §207, the interests in this case would escheat to tribal governments. The initiating plaintiffs, respondents here, are the children and potential heirs of William Youpee. An enrolled member of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana, William Youpee died testate in October 1990. His will devised to respondents, all of them enrolled tribal members, his several undivided interests in allotted trust lands on various reservations in Montana and North Dakota. These interests, as the Ninth Circuit reported, were valued together at $1,239. Each interest was devised to a single descendant. Youpee’s will thus perpetuated existing fractionation, but it did not splinter ownership further by bequeathing any single fractional interest to multiple devisees.</p>
<p id="c5f7e32e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5f7e32f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the 1984 amendments to §207 render the provision constitutional, we are guided by <i>Irving</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN116F7_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N116F7_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">32</a></span> The United States maintains that the amendments, though enacted three years prior to the <i>Irving</i> decision, effectively anticipated the concerns expressed in the Court’s opinion. As already noted, amended §207 differs from the original in three relevant respects: It looks back five years instead of one to determine the income produced from a small interest, and creates a rebuttable presumption that this income stream will continue; it permits devise of otherwise escheatable interests to persons who already own an interest in the same parcel; and it authorizes tribes to develop their own codes governing the disposition of fractional interests. These modifications, according to the United States, rescue amended §207 from the fate of its predecessor. The Government maintains that the revisions moderate the economic impact of the provision and temper the character of the Government’s regulation; the latter factor weighed most heavily against the constitutionality of the original version of §207.</p>
<p id="c5f7e331-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The narrow revisions Congress made to §207, without benefit of our ruling in <i>Irving</i>, do not warrant a disposition different from the one this Court announced and <span title="1253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1253">p. 1253</span>explained in <i>Irving</i>. Amended §207 still trains on income generated from the land, not on the value of the parcel. The Court observed in <i>Irving</i> that “even if . . . the income generated by such parcels may be properly thought of as <i>de minimis</i>,” the value of the land may not fit that description. The parcels at issue in <i>Irving</i> were valued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs at $2,700 and $1,816, amounts we found “not trivial.” The value of the disputed parcels in this case is not of a different order; as the Ninth Circuit reported, the value of decedent Youpee’s fractional interests was $1,239. In short, the economic impact of amended §207 might still be palpable.</p>
<p id="c5f7e332-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the economic impact of amended §207 is not significantly less than the impact of the original provision, the United States correctly comprehends that <i>Irving</i> rested primarily on the “extraordinary” character of the governmental regulation. <i>Irving</i> stressed that the original §207 “amount[ed] to virtually the abrogation of the right to pass on a certain type of property — the small undivided interest — to one’s heirs.” 481 U.S. at 716. The <i>Irving</i> Court further noted that the original §207 “effectively abolish[ed] both descent and devise [of fractional interests] even when the passing of the property to the heir might result in consolidation of property.” 481 U.S. at 716. As the United States construes <i>Irving</i>, Congress cured the fatal infirmity in §207 when it revised the section to allow transmission of fractional interests to successors who already own an interest in the allotment.</p>
<p id="c5f80a43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress’ creation of an ever-so-slight class of individuals equipped to receive fractional interests by devise does not suffice, under a fair reading of <i>Irving</i>, to rehabilitate the measure. Amended §207 severely restricts the right of an individual to direct the descent of his property. Allowing a decedent to leave an interest only to a current owner in the same parcel shrinks drastically the universe of possible successors. And, as the Ninth Circuit observed, the “very limited group [of permissible devisees] is unlikely to contain any lineal descendants.” Moreover, amended §207 continues to restrict devise “even in circumstances when the governmental purpose sought to be advanced, consolidation of ownership of Indian lands, does not conflict with the further descent of the property.” <i>Irving</i>, 481 U.S. at 718.</p>
<p id="c5f80a44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third alteration made in amended §207 also fails to bring the provision outside the reach of this Court’s holding in <i>Irving</i>. Amended §207 permits tribes to establish their own codes to govern the disposition of fractional interests; if approved by the Secretary of the Interior, these codes would govern in lieu of amended §207. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. §2206(c). The United States does not rely on this new provision to defend the statute. Nor does it appear that the United States could do so at this time: Tribal codes governing disposition of escheatable interests have apparently not been developed.</p>
<p id="c5f80a45-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice J<span class="epub-small-caps">OHN</span> P<span class="epub-small-caps">AUL</span> S<span class="epub-small-caps">TEVENS</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5f80a46-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 207 of the <i>Indian Land Consolidation Act</i>, 25 U.S.C. §2206, did not, in my view, effect an unconstitutional taking of William Youpee’s right to make a testamentary disposition of his property. As I explained in <i>Hodel v. Irving</i>, 481 U.S. 704 (1987) (opinion concurring in judgment), the Federal Government, like a State, has a valid interest in removing legal impediments to the productive development of real estate. For this reason, the Court has repeatedly “upheld the power of the State to condition <span title="1254" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1254">p. 1254</span>the retention of a property right upon the performance of an act within a limited period of time.” <i>Texaco, Inc. v. Short</i>, 454 U.S. 516, 529 (1982). I remain convinced that “Congress has ample power to require the owners of fractional interests in allotted lands to consolidate their holdings during their lifetimes or to face the risk that their interests will be deemed to be abandoned.” <i>Hodel</i>, 481 U.S. at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). The federal interest in minimizing the fractionated ownership of Indian lands — and thereby paving the way to the productive development of their property — is strong enough to justify the legislative remedy created by §207, provided, of course, that affected owners have adequate notice of the requirements of the law and an adequate opportunity to adjust their affairs to protect against loss.</p>
<p id="c5f80a47-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion, William Youpee did have such notice and opportunity. More than six years passed from the time §207 was amended until Mr. Youpee died on October 19, 1990 (this period spans more than seven years if we count from the date §207 was originally enacted). During this time, Mr. Youpee could have realized the value of his fractional interests (approximately $1,239) in a variety of ways, including selling the property, giving it to his children as a gift, or putting it in trust for them. I assume that he failed to do so because he was not aware of the requirements of §207. This loss is unfortunate. But I believe Mr. Youpee’s failure to pass on his property is the product of inadequate legal advice rather than an unconstitutional defect in the statute.</p>

Was allotment a taking of property?</b> As Justice Ginsburg notes, the <i>General Allotment Act of 1887</i> provided for the breakup of communally held tribal property into allotments held by individual tribal members. Congress took property owned by Indian nations and transferred title over that land to individual tribal members, who then owned bits of what had been tribal land. The act was intended to destroy tribal culture, and eventually tribal sovereignty, and to speed the assimilation and Christianization of American Indians by giving them individual property rights. The allotment acts provided compensation to the tribes, but the compensation was frequently far below market value.</p>

Another attempt to address fractionation.</b> The first two versions of the <i>Indian Land Consolidation Act</i> (ILCA) were held unconstitutional in <i>Hodel v. Irving</i> and <i>Babbitt v. Youpee.</i> Congress tried again, passing a third version of the law in 2000, which it then amended in the <i>American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004</i>. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. §2206. It authorizes the Indian nations to pass their own probate laws, and it prescribes a federal probate code to determine devise and descent if the tribe does not enact its own code. In general, the property of an allottee who dies intestate will go to the decedent’s surviving spouse, with the remainder in the decedent’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren, or the decedent’s parents or siblings, and if the decedent leaves no such relatives, the interest will go to the tribe (unless a co-owner buys the interest for its fair market value). If the interest is less than 5 percent of the total undivided ownership of the property, the remainder can go only to one person — the oldest eligible child, grandchild, great-grandchild, parent, or sibling, with the tribe as heir of last resort. The allottee can get around these restrictions by writing a valid will. If there is no tribal probate code regulating devise, the allottee may devise the interest to lineal descendants, any co-owner of the allotment, the tribe, or any Indian. The owner may also give a life estate to any person (such as a non-Indian spouse or child), with the remainder interest to be held by the tribe. The statute also gives the Secretary of the Interior the power to partition highly fractionated allotments (with more than 100 owners or 50 to 99 owners if none owns more than a 10 percent interest). At such a partition sale, the only eligible buyers would be the tribe, the tribe’s members, descendants of the original allottee, or co-owners of the interest if they are members of another tribe.</p>

Ferguson</i>, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), it struck down a local zoning law that promoted racial segregation in housing. The Louisville city ordinance in <i>Buchanan</i> prohibited both white persons and African Americans from purchasing homes on a street that included a majority of owners of the opposite race. Justice Day explained: “Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns. It is elementary that it includes the right to acquire, use, and dispose of it. The Constitution protects these essential attributes of property.” <i>Id.</i> at 74. While reaffirming state-mandated racial segregation in public accommodations, <i>id.</i> at 81, the Court found zoning laws that prohibit the sale of real property on the basis of race deny “property rights . . . by due process of law” and therefore are “not a legitimate exercise of the police power” because they “annul[] . . . the civil right of a white to dispose of his property if he saw fit to do so to a person of color and of a colored person to make such disposition to a white person,” <i>id.</i> at 81-82. Thus, although the Court mentioned the “right to acquire” property, its focus in striking down the ordinance was denial of the “right to sell.”</p>

<p id="c5f80a51-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The regulations challenged here do not compel the surrender of the artifacts, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them. Rather, a significant restriction has been imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts. But the denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full “bundle” of property rights, the destruction of one “strand” of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety. Regulations that bar trade in certain goods have been upheld against claims of unconstitutional taking. For example, the Court has sustained regulations prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages despite the fact that individuals were left with previously acquired stocks.</p>

<p id="c5f83064-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts allow time limits to be placed on contingent future interests created before passage of the statute on the ground that the owner had “no more than an expectation, a possibility” that an interest might accrue in the future. <i>Trustees of Schools of Township No. 1 v. Batdorf</i>, 130 N.E.2d 111 (Ill. 1955) (upholding a marketable title act that retroactively limited possibilities of reverter and rights of entry created before passage of the act to 50 years). However, these courts usually find it important that owners of previously created interests are given a limited time to re-register the interest. <i>See id.</i> (one year to re-record interest was sufficient to permit retroactive application of statute). <i>Accord</i>,<i> Black Mountain Energy Corp. v. Bell County Board of Education</i>, 467 F. Supp. 2d 715 (D. Ky. 2006); <i>Town of Brookline v. Carey</i>, 245 N.E.2d 446 (Mass. 1969); <i>see also Walton v. City of Red Bluff</i>, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 275 (Ct. App. 1991) (upholding retroactive application of a statute converting a possibility of reverter into a right of entry when owner had five years to re-record the interest). However, some courts have held that some statutory changes in the rule against perpetuities cannot constitutionally be retroactively applied to property interests created before passage of the statute. <i>Lake of the Woods Association, Inc. v. McHugh</i>, 380 S.E.2d 872 (Va. 1989) (holding that the statutory wait and see test could not retroactively be applied to preserve a preemptive right invalid under the traditional rule against perpetuities).</p>

Retroactive application is arguably legitimate here because the unequal property rights associated with tenancies by the entirety probably violate the equal protection clause. <i>Kirchberg v. Feenstra</i>, 450 U.S. 455 (1981). <i>But see West v. First Agricultural Bank</i>, 419 N.E.2d 262 (Mass. 1981) (refusing to apply retroactively a change in tenancy by the entirety law granting women equal management powers over property).</p>
<p id="c5f83066-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts ordinarily do not find a taking when statutes retroactively alter the enforceability of covenants by modifying the changed conditions or relative hardship doctrines. <i>Blakeley v. Gorin</i>, 313 N.E.2d 903 (Mass. 1974); <i>see also Barrett v. Dawson</i>, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 899 (Ct. App. 1998) (statute that retroactively precluded enforcement of restrictive covenants limiting family day care homes in residential neighborhoods was not a taking). However, some courts have found takings when a statute retroactively increases or decreases the time period during which a covenant will be enforceable. <i>Compare Appalachee Entertainment v. Walker</i>, 463 S.E.2d 896 (Ga. 1995) (unconstitutional to apply a statute allowing covenants to last for 30 years when the developer purchased the property in reliance on a prior statute that limited covenants to 20 years), <i>with Bickford v. Yancey Development Co.</i>, 585 S.E.2d 78 (Ga. 2003) (statute can apply to property purchased after the statute was in effect and the covenants had been in existence for 20 years). </p>

Similar “right-to-farm” statutes have been enacted in many states. Neighbors challenged the statute because it deprived them of rights they had under prior law to be protected against nuisances committed on neighboring property.

Because property law traditionally gave owners the right to be free from unreasonable and substantial interferences with their use or enjoyment of their property, the Iowa Supreme Court concluded that the statute authorizing farmers to commit nuisances effectuated an unconstitutional taking of the property rights of those affected by what would otherwise have constituted an actionable nuisance.

Two years after the building is completed, the city completes a “downzoning” project and rezones much of the land in the city to limit the placement and development of institutional and commercial uses and increase areas zoned for housing. The land on which the classroom building sits is now placed in a district limited to residential uses. Is the university obligated to tear down the building and construct an apartment building in its place?

Moreover, the effect of the statute “is to mandate appellant’s immediate physical removal from his . . . residence.” The court noted “the strong governmental interests that are advanced by the residency restriction” on sex offenders, but also found that the law effectively allowed “private third parties” to establish child-centered uses and thereby “force a registered sex offender . . . to forfeit valuable property rights in his legally-purchased home.” Was the case correctly decided?</p>

In return, the developers consented to extensive government regulation of the properties. The terms of the mortgages provided that they could be prepaid without government approval after 20 years and that doing so would lift the restrictions arising from the regulations. In 1990, to stop a mass withdrawal of properties from the program through prepayment, Congress enacted statutes that effectively nullified the prepayment right. Although Congress reinstated the prepayment rights in 1996, in <i>Cienega Gardens v. United States</i>, 331 F.3d 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit held that the developers had a vested property right to “buy out” of the program. The repeal of this right constituted a temporary taking under the <i>ad hoc</i> test for the four plaintiffs for whom the trial court had made findings of fact. However, when on remand the trial court held that the measure took property of the other developers, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the court had to consider the impact of the measure on the value of the property as a whole, the benefits that the developers received from participation in the program, and the extent of reliance on the prepayment option. <i>Cienega Gardens v. United States</i>, 503 F.3d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2007). How should the court on remand analyze the question of whether denying prepayment rights constituted a taking of property that interfered with the owner’s reasonable investment-backed expectations? <i>See CCA Associates v.

Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 560 U.S. 702 (2010).</b> In Florida, beachfront property is generally divided into private (“littoral”) ownership of dry land and public ownership of what is called the foreshore, the land between the low-tide line and the mean high-water line. When dry land is added to a beach in a slow, gradual way (called an <b>accretion</b>), that new land is added to the littoral owner’s property. When new land is added suddenly (a transition called an <b>avulsion</b>), that new land becomes the property of the state. Beachfront owners traditionally also had a right of access to the water, among other “littoral” rights.</p>

For projects that involve depositing sand on submerged land owned by the state, the state sets an “erosion control line,” which then replaces the traditional fluctuating boundary between private ownership and the state’s property in the foreshore. Once that fixed line is set, private owners lose the right to add to their land through accretions when the mean high-water line moves seaward.</p>

A nonprofit formed by beachfront property owners called Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. sued to stop the project, asserting that the restoration project eliminated the littoral owners’ rights to receive accretions to their property and to have contact between their property and the water. The Florida Supreme Court concluded that the restoration fell under the doctrine of avulsion, albeit an avulsion caused by the state, with right to accretions being a future contingent interest rather than a vested property right, and found there was no independent right of contact with the water. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. then unsuccessfully sought rehearing on the argument that the decision itself constituted a taking.</p>

There is no textual justification for saying that the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expropriate private property without just compensation varies according to the branch of government effecting the expropriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.</p>

Thus, six Justices agree, in some fashion, that judicial infringement of property rights raises constitutional problems.

<p id="c5f87ea7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Judiciary as the state actor for takings.</b> Almost all claims that property has been unlawfully “taken” without compensation involve challenges to legislative or administrative actions. Barton H. Thompson, Jr., in a well-known article, <i>Judicial Takings</i>, 76 Va. L. Rev. 1449 (1990), argued that judicial interpretations of the common law or changes in common law rules could constitute a taking of property, and Justice Scalia embraced this proposition in his plurality opinion in <i>Stop the Beach Renourishment.</i> The plurality’s approach raises important questions about takings law and the role of the judiciary.</p>
<p id="c5f87ea8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On one hand, there is no inherent reason why a state supreme court’s interpretation of the common law could not unfairly divest owners of rights they had assumed belonged to them, thereby unjustly interfering with investment-backed expectations. And it is certainly not unheard of for the Supreme Court to recognize the judiciary as the relevant state actor in constitutional cases. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948).</p>
<p id="c5f87ea9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, interpreting the law is not necessarily the same thing as enforcing private agreements, and courts often define the rights that go along with property <span title="1263" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1263">p. 1263</span>ownership through the common law process. If changes in common law rules can represent takings of property, the courts could be significantly curtailed in modernizing the law. They might even be disempowered from holding that a prior case was distinguishable from the current case.</p>
<p id="c5f87eaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Takings versus due process, again.</b> Justice Kennedy had earlier stated a view similar to the position he took in concurrence in <i>Stop the Beach Renourishment</i> as the deciding Justice in a concurrence in <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498 (1998).  <i>Apfel</i> involved a statute that required Eastern Enterprises to contribute funds for health benefits for retired coal miners who had worked for it before 1966 even though the company had left the coal business in 1966. The company had previously signed labor agreements obligating it to contribute certain amounts to trust funds established for this purpose, but the statute obligated it to contribute an additional $50 to $100 million. A four-Justice plurality would have held this to be a taking of property, arguing that legislation is unconstitutional “if it imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the liability, and the extent of that liability is substantially disproportionate to the parties’ experience.” 524 U.S. at 528-529. The plurality found this standard met because Eastern Enterprises’ new liability was not proportional to its experience with the plan and substantially interfered with its investment-backed expectations by imposing obligations based on events that had happened 30 years earlier. In addition, no pattern of regulation would have placed Eastern on notice that such large, disproportionate, retroactive obligations might be forthcoming.</p>
<p id="c5f87eab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, a five-Justice majority took a different approach, all agreeing that the case should not be resolved under the takings clause. Justice Kennedy voted with the four-Justice plurality to hold the statute unconstitutional as applied to Eastern, but did so under the due process clause, arguing that the problem with the law was not that it “took” property but was unfairly retroactive. “If retroactive laws [of great severity] change the legal consequences of transactions long closed, the change can destroy the reasonable certainty and security which are the very objects of property ownership.” <i>Id.</i> at 548-549. (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part). The four other dissenting Justices agreed that the statute should be evaluated under the due process clause, but would have held that it was not unfair retroactive legislation both because Eastern had led its employees to expect that it would take care of them and because it was not unfair to require Eastern to compensate its own workers for medical problems caused by their exposure to coal dust on the job.</p>
<p id="c5f87eac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is due process a better constitutional framework than the takings clause for evaluating state actions that retroactively upset investment-backed expectations? What are the arguments on both sides? For one approach, see Eduardo Moisés Peňalver &amp; Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, <i>Judicial Takings or Due Process?</i>, 97 Cornell L. Rev. 305 (2012) (arguing that the takings clause is more appropriate where judicial decisions intentionally seize private property to achieve legitimate public ends, but due process better serves to analyze cases where there is no intent to appropriate or the judicial action is claimed to serve no legitimate public purpose).</p>

Practical difficulties with judicial takings.</b> Because only four members of the Court endorsed the theory of judicial takings, it may not be necessary to work out the range of difficult procedural questions the doctrine poses any time soon. Those questions include how to join the state if the suit initially involves only private parties; what remedies should be available and, if compensation is required, how to compel the state to pay for the results of a judicial decision; and how to address the claims of owners whose property may be “taken” by a judicial decision to which they are not a party, among others. <i>See generally</i> D.

Custom and beach access.</b> One area where judicial takings has been an issue is in public access to beaches. <i>See</i> Chapter 1, §4. In <i>McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson</i>, 504 P.2d 1330 (Haw. 1973), the Hawai`i Supreme Court overruled a Territorial Court decision holding that two sugar plantation owners possessed certain water rights in their land. <i>Territory v. Gay</i>, 31 Haw. 376, 387-388, <i>aff’d</i>, 52 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1930). The Hawai`i Supreme Court held that this pre-statehood decision had unlawfully divested native Hawaiians of their traditional customary rights of access to water and that the state had the exclusive right to control the flow of the river in question. The property owners whose water rights were divested sued state officials, claiming that the court’s decision in <i>McBryde</i> effectuated a taking of their property rights. The state defended on the grounds that the <i>McBryde</i> court overruled a prior decision in an effort to correct an error, that the overruled decision had itself effectuated a taking of native Hawaiians’ property, and that the sugar companies never had rights to the land free of preexisting water easements. The Ninth Circuit ruled, in <i>Robinson v. Ariyoshi</i>, 753 F.2d 1468 (9th Cir. 1984), <i>aff’g</i> 441 F. Supp. 559 (D. Haw. 1977), <i>vacated on other grounds</i>, 477 U.S. 902 (1986), that the <i>McBryde</i> decision unconstitutionally took the “vested” property rights of the plantation owners without compensation.</p>

City of Cannon Beach</i>, 854 P.2d 449 (Or. 1993), Oregon beachfront owners unsuccessfully charged that the Oregon Supreme Court had effected a taking of their property when it applied the common law doctrine of custom to rule that the public had a right of access to dry sand areas of beaches for recreational purposes in <i>State ex rel. Thornton v. Hay</i>, 462 P.2d 671 (Or. 1969). The U.S. Supreme Court denied <i>certiorari</i>, 510 U.S. 1207 (1994), but Justices Scalia and O’Connor dissented from that denial, Justice Scalia writing that although “the Constitution leaves the law of real property to the States,” a state may not “deny” property rights “by invoking nonexistent rules of state substantive law.” Justice Scalia argued that the Oregon Supreme Court had misapplied the English doctrine of custom. “It is by no means clear that the facts — either as to the entire Oregon coast, or as to the small segment at issue here — meet the requirements for the English doctrine of custom.” <i>See also Esplanade Properties, L.L.C. v. City of Seattle</i>, 307 F.3d 978 (9th Cir. 2002) (restriction on construction in tidelands area is not a taking because the public trust doctrine had always prohibited such uses to preserve public access).</p>

<p id="c5f8a5c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1972, petitioner purchased an undeveloped 14.9-acre tract of land on the south side of Florida State Road 50, a divided four-lane highway east of Orlando. The property is located less than 1,000 feet from that road’s intersection with Florida State Road 408, a tolled expressway that is one of Orlando’s major thoroughfares.</p>
<p id="c5f8a5c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A drainage ditch runs along the property’s western edge, and high-voltage power lines bisect it into northern and southern sections. The combined effect of the ditch, a 100-foot wide area kept clear for the power lines, the highways, and other construction on nearby parcels is to isolate the northern section of petitioner’s property from any other undeveloped land. Although largely classified as wetlands by the State, the northern section drains well; the most significant standing water forms in ruts in an unpaved road used to access the power lines. The natural topography of the property’s southern section is somewhat more diverse, with a small creek, forested uplands, and wetlands that sometimes have water as much as a foot deep. A wildlife survey found evidence of animals that often frequent developed areas: raccoons, rabbits, several species of bird, and a turtle. The record also indicates that the land may be a suitable habitat for opossums.</p>
<p id="c5f8a5ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same year that petitioner purchased his property, Florida enacted the Water Resources Act, which divided the State into five water management districts and authorized each district to regulate “construction that connects to, draws water from, drains water into, or is placed in or across the waters in the state.” 1972 Fla. Laws ch. 72-299, pt. IV, §1(5), pp. 1115, 1116 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. §373.403(5) (2010)). Under the Act, a landowner wishing to undertake such construction must obtain from the relevant district a Management and Storage of Surface Water (MSSW) permit, which may impose “such reasonable conditions” on the permit as are “necessary to assure” that construction will “not be harmful to the water resources of the district.” 1972 Fla. Laws §4(1), at 1118 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. §373.413(1)).</p>
<p id="c5f8a5cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1984, in an effort to protect the State’s rapidly diminishing wetlands, the Florida Legislature passed the <i>Warren S. Henderson Wetlands Protection Act</i>, which made it illegal for anyone to “dredge or fill in, on, or over surface waters” without a Wetlands Resource Management (WRM) permit. 1984 Fla. Laws ch. 84-79, pt. VIII, §403.905(1), pp. 204-205. Under the Henderson Act, permit applicants are required to provide “reasonable assurance” that proposed construction on wetlands is “not contrary to the public interest,” as defined by an enumerated list of criteria. See Fla. Stat. §373.414(1).</p>
<p id="c5f8a5cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1266" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1266">p. 1266</span>Petitioner decided to develop the 3.7-acre northern section of his property, and in 1994 he applied to the District for MSSW and WRM permits. Under his proposal, petitioner would have raised the elevation of the northernmost section of his land to make it suitable for a building, graded the land from the southern edge of the building site down to the elevation of the high-voltage electrical lines, and installed a dry-bed pond for retaining and gradually releasing stormwater runoff from the building and its parking lot. To mitigate the environmental effects of his proposal, petitioner offered to foreclose any possible future development of the approximately 11-acre southern section of his land by deeding to the District a conservation easement on that portion of his property.</p>
<p id="c5f8a5cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District considered the 11-acre conservation easement to be inadequate, and it informed petitioner that it would approve construction only if he agreed to one of two concessions. First, the District proposed that petitioner reduce the size of his development to 1 acre and deed to the District a conservation easement on the remaining 13.9 acres. In the alternative, the District told petitioner that he could proceed with the development as proposed, building on 3.7 acres and deeding a conservation easement to the government on the remainder of the property, if he also agreed to hire contractors to make improvements to District-owned land several miles away. When the District asks permit applicants to fund offsite mitigation work, its policy is never to require any particular offsite project, and it did not do so here. Instead, the District said that it “would also favorably consider” alternatives to its suggested offsite mitigation projects if petitioner proposed something “equivalent.” App. 75.</p>
<p id="c5f8a5ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Believing the District’s demands for mitigation to be excessive in light of the environmental effects that his building proposal would have caused, petitioner filed suit in state court. Among other claims, he argued that he was entitled to relief under Fla. Stat. §373.617(2), which allows owners to recover “monetary damages” if a state agency’s action is “an unreasonable exercise of the state’s police power constituting a taking without just compensation.”</p>
<p id="c5f8a5cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After considering testimony from several experts who examined petitioner’s property, the trial court found that the property’s northern section had already been “seriously degraded” by extensive construction on the surrounding parcels. App. to Pet. for Cert. D-3. In light of this finding and petitioner’s offer to dedicate nearly three-quarters of his land to the District, the trial court concluded that any further mitigation in the form of payment for offsite improvements to District property lacked both a nexus and rough proportionality to the environmental impact of the proposed construction. It accordingly held the District’s actions unlawful under our decisions in <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm’n</i>, 483 U.S. 825 (1987) and <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).</p>
<p id="c5f8a5d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida District Court affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed.

<p id="c5f8cce3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have said in a variety of contexts that “the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.” <i>Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash</i>., 461 U.S. 540, 545. In <i>Perry v. Sindermann</i>, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), for example, we held that a public college would violate a professor’s freedom of speech if it declined to renew his contract because he was an outspoken critic of the college’s administration. And in <i>Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County</i>, 415 U.S. 250 (1974), we concluded that a county impermissibly burdened the right to travel by extending healthcare benefits only to those indigent sick who had been residents of the county for at least one year. Those cases reflect an overarching principle, known as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, that vindicates the Constitution’s enumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people into giving them up.</p>
<p id="c5f8cce4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> “involve a special application” of this doctrine that protects the Fifth Amendment right to just compensation for property the government takes when owners apply for land-use permits. Our decisions in those cases reflect two realities of the permitting process. The first is that land-use permit applicants are especially vulnerable to the type of coercion that the unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits because the government often has broad discretion to deny a permit that is worth far more than property it would like to take. By conditioning a building permit on the owner’s deeding over a public right-of-way, for example, the government can pressure an owner into voluntarily giving up property for which the Fifth Amendment would otherwise require just compensation. So long as the building permit is more valuable than any just compensation the owner could hope to receive for the right-of-way, the owner is likely to accede to the government’s demand, no matter how unreasonable. Extortionate demands of this sort frustrate the Fifth Amendment right to just compensation, and the unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits them.</p>
<p id="c5f8cce5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second reality of the permitting process is that many proposed land uses threaten to impose costs on the public that dedications of property can offset. Where a building proposal would substantially increase traffic congestion, for example, officials might condition permit approval on the owner’s agreement to deed over the land needed to widen a public road. Respondent argues that a similar rationale justifies the exaction at issue here: petitioner’s proposed construction project, it submits, would destroy wetlands on his property, and in order to compensate for this loss, respondent demands that he enhance wetlands elsewhere. Insisting that landowners internalize the negative externalities of their conduct is a hallmark of responsible land-use policy, and we have long sustained such regulations against constitutional attack. See <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926).</p>
<p id="c5f8cce6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> accommodate both realities by allowing the government to condition approval of a permit on the dedication of property to the public so long as there is a “nexus” and “rough proportionality” between the property that the government demands and the social costs of the applicant’s proposal. <i>Dolan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 391; <i>Nollan</i>, 483 U.S., at 837. Our precedents thus enable permitting authorities to insist <span title="1268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1268">p. 1268</span>that applicants bear the full costs of their proposals while still forbidding the government from engaging in “out-and-out . . . extortion” that would thwart the Fifth Amendment right to just compensation. <i>Ibid</i>. Under <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> the government may choose whether and how a permit applicant is required to mitigate the impacts of a proposed development, but it may not leverage its legitimate interest in mitigation to pursue governmental ends that lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to those impacts.</p>
<p id="c5f8cce7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5f8cce8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principles that undergird our decisions in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> do not change depending on whether the government approves a permit on the condition that the applicant turn over property or denies a permit because the applicant refuses to do so. We have often concluded that denials of governmental benefits were impermissible under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. In so holding, we have recognized that regardless of whether the government ultimately succeeds in pressuring someone into forfeiting a constitutional right, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids burdening the Constitution’s enumerated rights by coercively withholding benefits from those who exercise them.</p>
<p id="c5f8cce9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A contrary rule would be especially untenable in this case because it would enable the government to evade the limitations of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> simply by phrasing its demands for property as conditions precedent to permit approval. [A] government order stating that a permit is “approved if” the owner turns over property would be subject to <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, but an identical order that uses the words “denied until” would not. Our unconstitutional conditions cases have long refused to attach significance to the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. To do so here would effectively render <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> a dead letter.</p>
<p id="c5f8ccea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Florida Supreme Court puzzled over how the government’s demand for property can violate the Takings Clause even though “ no property of any kind was ever taken,’ ” 77 So. 3d, at 1225, but the unconstitutional conditions doctrine provides a ready answer. Extortionate demands for property in the land-use permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because they take property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have property taken without just compensation. As in other unconstitutional conditions cases in which someone refuses to cede a constitutional right in the face of coercive pressure, the impermissible denial of a governmental benefit is a constitutionally cognizable injury.</p>
<p id="c5f8cceb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor does it make a difference, as respondent suggests, that the government might have been able to deny petitioner’s application outright without giving him the option of securing a permit by agreeing to spend money to improve public lands. <i>See Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). Virtually all of our unconstitutional conditions cases involve a gratuitous governmental benefit of some kind. Yet we have repeatedly rejected the argument that if the government need not confer a benefit at all, it can withhold the benefit because someone refuses to give up constitutional rights. Even if respondent would have been entirely within its rights in denying the permit for some other reason, that greater authority does not imply a lesser power <span title="1269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1269">p. 1269</span>to condition permit approval on petitioner’s forfeiture of his constitutional rights. See <i>Nollan</i>, 483 U.S., at 836-37 (explaining that “[t]he evident constitutional propriety” of prohibiting a land use “disappears . . . if the condition substituted for the prohibition utterly fails to further the end advanced as the justification for the prohibition”).</p>
<p id="c5f8ccec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That is not to say, however, that there is no relevant difference between a consummated taking and the denial of a permit based on an unconstitutionally extortionate demand. Where the permit is denied and the condition is never imposed, nothing has been taken. While the unconstitutional conditions doctrine recognizes that this burdens a constitutional right, the Fifth Amendment mandates a particular remedy —  just compensation — only for takings. In cases where there is an excessive demand but no taking, whether money damages are available is not a question of federal constitutional law but of the cause of action — whether state or federal — on which the landowner relies. Because petitioner brought his claim pursuant to a state law cause of action, the Court has no occasion to discuss what remedies might be available for a <i>Nollan</i>/<i>Dolan</i> unconstitutional conditions violation either here or in other cases.</p>
<p id="c5f8cced-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C</i></p>
<p id="c5f8ccee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent contends that we should affirm because petitioner sued for damages but is at most entitled to an injunction ordering that his permit issue without any conditions. But we need not decide whether federal law authorizes plaintiffs to recover damages for unconstitutional conditions claims predicated on the Takings Clause because petitioner brought his claim under state law. Florida law allows property owners to sue for “damages” whenever a state agency’s action is “an unreasonable exercise of the state’s police power constituting a taking without just compensation.” Fla. Stat. §373.617. Whether that provision covers an unconstitutional conditions claim like the one at issue here is a question of state law that the Florida Supreme Court did not address and on which we will not opine.</p>
<p id="c5f8ccef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For similar reasons, we decline to reach respondent’s argument that its demands for property were too indefinite to give rise to liability under <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. The Florida Supreme Court did not reach the question whether respondent issued a demand of sufficient concreteness to trigger the special protections of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. It relied instead on the Florida District Court of Appeals’ characterization of respondent’s behavior as a demand for <i>Nollan</i>/<i>Dolan</i> purposes. Whether that characterization is correct is beyond the scope of the questions the Court agreed to take up for review. If preserved, the issue remains open on remand for the Florida Supreme Court to address.</p>
<p id="c5f8f400-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, respondent argues that we need not decide whether its demand for offsite improvements satisfied <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> because it gave petitioner another avenue for obtaining permit approval. Specifically, respondent said that it would have approved a revised permit application that reduced the footprint of petitioner’s proposed construction site from 3.7 acres to 1 acre and placed a conservation easement on the remaining 13.9 acres of petitioner’s land. We agree with respondent that, so long as a permitting authority offers the landowner at least one alternative that would satisfy <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, the landowner has not been subjected to an unconstitutional <span title="1270" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1270">p. 1270</span>condition. But respondent’s suggestion that we should treat its offer to let petitioner build on 1 acre as an alternative to offsite mitigation misapprehends the governmental benefit that petitioner was denied. Petitioner sought to develop 3.7 acres, but respondent in effect told petitioner that it would not allow him to build on 2.7 of those acres unless he agreed to spend money improving public lands. Petitioner claims that he was wrongfully denied a permit to build on those 2.7 acres. For that reason, respondent’s offer to approve a less ambitious building project does not obviate the need to determine whether the demand for offsite mitigation satisfied <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>.</p>

<p id="c5f8f402-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn to the Florida Supreme Court’s alternative holding that petitioner’s claim fails because respondent asked him to spend money rather than give up an easement on his land. A predicate for any unconstitutional conditions claim is that the government could not have constitutionally ordered the person asserting the claim to do what it attempted to pressure that person into doing. For that reason, we began our analysis in both <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> by observing that if the government had directly seized the easements it sought to obtain through the permitting process, it would have committed a <i>per se</i> taking.</p>
<p id="c5f8f403-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note as an initial matter that if we accepted this argument it would be very easy for land-use permitting officials to evade the limitations of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. Because the government need only provide a permit applicant with one alternative that satisfies the nexus and rough proportionality standards, a permitting authority wishing to exact an easement could simply give the owner a choice of either surrendering an easement or making a payment equal to the easement’s value. Such so-called “in lieu of” fees are utterly commonplace, Rosenberg, <i>The Changing Culture of American Land Use Regulation: Paying for Growth with Impact Fees</i>, 59 S.M.U. L. Rev. 177, 202-03 (2006), and they are functionally equivalent to other types of land use exactions. For that reason and those that follow, we reject respondent’s argument and hold that so-called “monetary exactions” must satisfy the nexus and rough proportionality requirements of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>.</p>

<p id="c5f8f405-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), the United States retroactively imposed on a former mining company an obligation to pay for the medical benefits of retired miners and their families. A four-Justice plurality concluded that the statute’s imposition of retroactive financial liability was so arbitrary that it violated the Takings Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 529-37. Although Justice Kennedy concurred in the result on due process grounds, he joined four other Justices in dissent in arguing that the Takings Clause does not apply to government-imposed financial obligations that “d[o] not operate upon or alter an identified property interest.” <i>Id.</i> at 540 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part); <i>see id</i>. at 554-56 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“The private property’ upon which the [Takings] Clause traditionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or intellectual property”). Relying on the concurrence and dissent in Eastern Enterprises, respondent argues that a requirement that petitioner spend money improving public lands could not give rise to a taking.</p>
<p id="c5f8f406-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1271" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1271">p. 1271</span>Respondent’s argument rests on a mistaken premise. Unlike the financial obligation in <i>Eastern Enterprises</i>, the demand for money at issue here did “operate upon . . . an identified property interest” by directing the owner of a particular piece of property to make a monetary payment. <i>Id</i>. at 540 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). In this case, unlike <i>Eastern Enterprises</i>, the monetary obligation burdened petitioner’s ownership of a specific parcel of land. In that sense, this case bears resemblance to our cases holding that the government must pay just compensation when it takes a lien — a right to receive money that is secured by a particular piece of property. <i>See Armstrong v. United States</i>, 364 U.S. 40, 44-49 (1960); <i>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford</i>, 295 U.S. 555, 601-02 (1935); <i>United States v. Security Industrial Bank</i>, 459 U.S. 70, 77-78 (1982). The fulcrum this case turns on is the direct link between the government’s demand and a specific parcel of real property.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B1C_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11B1C_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">34</a></span> Because of that direct link, this case implicates the central concern of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>: the risk that the government may use its substantial power and discretion in land-use permitting to pursue governmental ends that lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to the effects of the proposed new use of the specific property at issue, thereby diminishing without justification the value of the property.</p>
<p id="c5f8f408-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, moreover, petitioner does not ask us to hold that the government can commit a regulatory taking by directing someone to spend money. As a result, we need not apply <i>Penn Central</i>’s “essentially ad hoc, factual inquir[y],” 438 U.S., at 124, at all, much less extend that “already difficult and uncertain rule” to the “vast category of cases” in which someone believes that a regulation is too costly. <i>Eastern Enterprises</i>, 524 U.S., at 542 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Instead, petitioner’s claim rests on the more limited proposition that when the government commands the relinquishment of funds linked to a specific, identifiable property interest such as a bank account or parcel of real property, a “<i>per se</i> [takings] approach” is the proper mode of analysis under the Court’s precedent. <i>Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash.</i>, 538 U.S. 216 (2003).</p>
<p id="c5f8f409-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5f8f40a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent and the dissent argue that if monetary exactions are made subject to scrutiny under <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, then there will be no principled way of distinguishing impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes. We think they exaggerate both the extent to which that problem is unique to the land-use permitting context and the practical difficulty of distinguishing between the power to tax and the power to take by eminent domain.</p>
<p id="c5f8f40b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is beyond dispute that “[t]axes and user fees . . . are not takings.’” <i>Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash.</i>, 538 U.S. 216, 243 n.2 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting). This case <span title="1272" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1272">p. 1272</span>therefore does not affect the ability of governments to impose property taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations that may impose financial burdens on property owners. At the same time, we have repeatedly found takings where the government, by confiscating financial obligations, achieved a result that could have been obtained by imposing a tax. Most recently, in <i>Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 232 we were unanimous in concluding that a State Supreme Court’s seizure of the interest on client funds held in escrow was a taking despite the unquestionable constitutional propriety of a tax that would have raised exactly the same revenue. Our holding in <i>Brown</i> followed from <i>Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation</i>, 524 U.S. 156 (1998), and <i>Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith</i>, 449 U.S. 155 (1980), two earlier cases in which we treated confiscations of money as takings despite their functional similarity to a tax. Perhaps most closely analogous to the present case, we have repeatedly held that the government takes property when it seizes liens, and in so ruling we have never considered whether the government could have achieved an economically equivalent result through taxation. <i>Armstrong</i>, 364 U.S. 40; <i>Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank</i>, 295 U.S. 555.</p>
<p id="c5f8f40c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two facts emerge from those cases. The first is that the need to distinguish taxes from takings is not a creature of our holding today that monetary exactions are subject to scrutiny under <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. Rather, the problem is inherent in this Court’s long-settled view that property the government could constitutionally demand through its taxing power can also be taken by eminent domain.</p>
<p id="c5f8f40d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, our cases show that teasing out the difference between taxes and takings is more difficult in theory than in practice. <i>Brown</i> is illustrative. Similar to respondent in this case, the respondents in <i>Brown</i> argued that extending the protections of the Takings Clause to a bank account would open a Pandora’s Box of constitutional challenges to taxes. But also like respondent here, the <i>Brown</i> respondents never claimed that they were exercising their power to levy taxes when they took the petitioners’ property. Any such argument would have been implausible under state law; in Washington, taxes are levied by the legislature, not the courts.</p>
<p id="c5f91b1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same dynamic is at work in this case because Florida law greatly circumscribes respondent’s power to tax. <i>See</i> Fla. Stat. §373.503 (authorizing respondent to impose ad valorem tax on properties within its jurisdiction); §373.109 (authorizing respondent to charge permit application fees but providing that such fees “shall not exceed the cost . . . for processing, monitoring, and inspecting for compliance with the permit”). If respondent had argued that its demand for money was a tax, it would have effectively conceded that its denial of petitioner’s permit was improper under Florida law. Far from making that concession, respondent has maintained throughout this litigation that it considered petitioner’s money to be a substitute for his deeding to the public a conservation easement on a larger parcel of undeveloped land.</p>
<p id="c5f91b1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not decide at precisely what point a land-use permitting charge denominated by the government as a “tax” becomes “so arbitrary . . . that it was not the exertion of taxation but a confiscation of property.” <i>Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co.</i>, 240 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1916). For present purposes, it suffices to say that despite having long recognized that “the power of taxation should not be confused with the power <span title="1273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1273">p. 1273</span>of eminent domain,” <i>Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist</i>., 239 U.S. 254, 264 (1915), we have had little trouble distinguishing between the two.</p>
<p id="c5f91b20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C</i></p>
<p id="c5f91b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we disagree with the dissent’s forecast that our decision will work a revolution in land use law by depriving local governments of the ability to charge reasonable permitting fees. Numerous courts — including courts in many of our Nation’s most populous States — have confronted constitutional challenges to monetary exactions over the last two decades and applied the standard from <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> or something like it. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Northern Ill. Home Builders Assn. v. County of Du Page</i>, 649 N.E.2d 384, 388-389 (Ill. 1995); <i>Home Builders Assn. v. Beavercreek</i>, 729 N.E.2d 349, 356 (Ohio 2000); <i>Flower Mound v. Stafford Estates Ltd. P’ship</i>, 135 S.W.3d 620, 640-641 (Tex. 2004). Yet the “significant practical harm” the dissent predicts has not come to pass. That is hardly surprising, for the dissent is correct that state law normally provides an independent check on excessive land use permitting fees.</p>
<p id="c5f91b22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent’s argument that land use permit applicants need no further protection when the government demands money is really an argument for overruling <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. After all, the Due Process Clause protected the Nollans from an unfair allocation of public burdens, and they too could have argued that the government’s demand for property amounted to a taking under the <i>Penn Central</i> framework. See <i>Nollan</i>, 483 U.S., at 838. We have repeatedly rejected the dissent’s contention that other constitutional doctrines leave no room for the nexus and rough proportionality requirements of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>. Mindful of the special vulnerability of land use permit applicants to extortionate demands for money, we do so again today.</p>
<p id="c5f91b23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice E<span class="epub-small-caps">LENA</span> K<span class="epub-small-caps">AGAN</span>, with whom Justice G<span class="epub-small-caps">INSBURG</span>, Justice B<span class="epub-small-caps">REYER</span>, and Justice S<span class="epub-small-caps">OTOMAYOR</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5f91b24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claims that government regulations violate the Takings Clause by unduly restricting the use of property are generally “governed by the standards set forth in <i>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).” <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</i>, 544 U.S. 528, 538. Our decisions in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> are different: They provide an independent layer of protection in “the special context of land-use exactions.” <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S., at 538. In that situation, the “government demands that a landowner dedicate an easement” or surrender a piece of real property “as a condition of obtaining a development permit.” <i>Id</i>. at 546. If the government appropriated such a property interest outside the permitting process, its action would constitute a taking, necessitating just compensation. <i>Id</i>. at 547. <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> prevent the government from exploiting the landowner’s permit application to evade the constitutional obligation to pay for the property. They do so, as the majority explains, by subjecting the government’s demand to heightened scrutiny: The government may condition a land-use permit on the relinquishment of real property only if it shows a “nexus” and “rough proportionality” between the demand made and “the impact of the proposed development.” <i>Dolan</i>, 512 U.S., at 386, 391. <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> thus serve not to address excessive regulatory burdens on land use (the function of <i>Penn Central</i>), but instead to stop the <span title="1274" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1274">p. 1274</span>government from imposing an “unconstitutional condition” — a requirement that a person give up his constitutional right to receive just compensation “in exchange for a discretionary benefit” having “little or no relationship” to the property taken. <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S., at 547.</p>
<p id="c5f91b25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the <i>Nollan</i>-<i>Dolan</i> test applies only when the property the government demands during the permitting process is the kind it otherwise would have to pay for — or, put differently, when the appropriation of that property, outside the permitting process, would constitute a taking. Only if that is true could the government’s demand for the property force a landowner to relinquish his constitutional right to just compensation.</p>
<p id="c5f91b26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, Koontz claims that the District demanded that he spend money to improve public wetlands, not that he hand over a real property interest. I assume for now that the District made that demand (although I think it did not.) The key question then is: Independent of the permitting process, does requiring a person to pay money to the government, or spend money on its behalf, constitute a taking requiring just compensation? Only if the answer is yes does the <i>Nollan</i>-<i>Dolan</i> test apply.</p>
<p id="c5f91b27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But we have already answered that question no. <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), as the Court describes, involved a federal statute requiring a former mining company to pay a large sum of money for the health benefits of retired employees. Five Members of the Court determined that the law did not effect a taking, distinguishing between the appropriation of a specific property interest and the imposition of an order to pay money. Justice Kennedy acknowledged in his controlling opinion that the statute “impose[d] a staggering financial burden” (which influenced his conclusion that it violated due process). <i>Id.</i> at 540 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). Still, Justice Kennedy explained, the law did not effect a taking because it did not “operate upon or alter” a “specific and identified propert[y] or property right[ ].” <i>Id.</i> at 540-41. Justice Breyer, writing for four more Justices, agreed. He stated that the Takings Clause applies only when the government appropriates a “specific interest in physical or intellectual property” or “a specific, separately identifiable fund of money”; by contrast, the Clause has no bearing when the government imposes “an ordinary liability to pay money.” <i>Id.</i> at 554-55 (dissenting opinion).</p>
<p id="c5f91b28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, a requirement that a person pay money to repair public wetlands is not a taking. Such an order does not affect a “specific and identified propert[y] or property right[ ]”; it simply “imposes an obligation to perform an act” (the improvement of wetlands) that costs money. <i>Id.</i> at 540-41 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). To be sure, when a person spends money on the government’s behalf, or pays money directly to the government, it “will reduce [his] net worth” — but that “can be said of any law which has an adverse economic effect” on someone. <i>Id</i>. at 543.</p>
<p id="c5f91b29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority tries to distinguish <i>Apfel</i> by asserting that the District’s demand here was “closely analogous” (and “bears resemblance”) to the seizure of a lien on property or an income stream from a parcel of land. But the majority’s citations succeed only in showing what this case is not. When the government dissolves a lien, or appropriates a determinate income stream from a piece of property — or, for that matter, seizes a particular “bank account or [the] accrued interest” on it — the government indeed takes a <span title="1275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1275">p. 1275</span>“specific” and “identified property interest.” <i>Apfel</i>, 524 U.S., at 540-41 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). But nothing like that occurred here. The District did not demand any particular lien, or bank account, or income stream from property. It just ordered Koontz to spend or pay money (again, assuming it ordered anything at all). Koontz’s liability would have been the same whether his property produced income or not — e.g., even if all he wanted to build was a family home. And similarly, Koontz could meet that obligation from whatever source he chose — a checking account, shares of stock, a wealthy uncle; the District was “indifferent as to how [he] elect[ed] to [pay] or the property [he] use[d] to do so.” <i>Id</i>. at 540.</p>
<p id="c5f91b2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority thus falls back on the sole way the District’s alleged demand related to a property interest: The demand arose out of the permitting process for Koontz’s land. But under the analytic framework that <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> established, that connection alone is insufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. As I have described, the heightened standard of <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> is not a freestanding protection for land-use permit applicants; rather, it is “a special application of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, which provides that the government may not require a person to give up a constitutional right — here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken” — in exchange for a land-use permit. <i>Lingle</i>, 544 U.S., at 547. As such, <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> apply only if . . . the demand would have constituted a taking when executed outside the permitting process. And here, under <i>Apfel</i>, it would not.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C64_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11C64_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">35</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f9423c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority’s approach, on top of its analytic flaws, threatens significant practical harm. By applying <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> to permit conditions requiring monetary payments — with no express limitation except as to taxes — the majority extends the Takings Clause, with its notoriously “difficult” and “perplexing” standards, into the very heart of local land-use regulation and service delivery. 524 U.S., at 541. Cities and towns across the nation impose many kinds of permitting fees every day. Some enable a government to mitigate a new development’s impact on the community, like increased traffic or pollution — or destruction of wetlands. Others cover the direct costs of providing services like sewage or water to the development. Still others are meant to limit the number of landowners who engage in a certain activity, as fees for liquor licenses do. All now must meet <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>’s nexus and proportionality tests. The Federal Constitution thus will decide whether one town is overcharging for sewage, or another is setting the price to sell liquor too high. And the flexibility of state and local governments to take the most routine actions to enhance their communities will diminish accordingly.</p>

The majority acknowledges, as it must, that taxes are not takings. But once the majority decides that a simple demand to pay money — the sort of thing often viewed as a tax — can count as an impermissible “exaction,” how is anyone to tell the two apart? How to separate orders to pay money from . . . well, orders to pay money, so that a locality knows what it can (and cannot) do. Because “[t]here is no set rule” by which to determine “in which category a particular” action belongs, <i>Eastern Diversified Properties, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty.</i>, 570 A.2d 850, 854 (Md. 1990), courts often reach opposite conclusions about classifying nearly identical fees. <i>Compare</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Coulter v. Rawlins</i>, 662 P.2d 888, 901-904 (Wyo. 1983) (holding that a fee to enhance parks, imposed as a permit condition, was a regulatory exaction), <i>with Home Builders Assn. v. West Des Moines</i>, 644 N.W.2d 339, 350 (Iowa 2002) (rejecting <i>Coulter</i> and holding that a nearly identical fee was a tax). Nor does the majority’s opinion provide any help with that issue: Perhaps its most striking feature is its refusal to say even a word about how to make the distinction that will now determine whether a given fee is subject to heightened scrutiny. [T]he majority’s refusal “to say more” about the scope of its new rule now casts a cloud on every decision by every local government to require a person seeking a permit to pay or spend money.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C93_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11C93_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">36</a></span></p>
<p id="c5f9423f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By extending <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>’s heightened scrutiny to a simple payment demand, the majority threatens the heartland of local land-use regulation and service delivery, at a bare minimum depriving state and local governments of “necessary predictability.” <i>Apfel</i>, 524 U.S., at 542 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). That decision is unwarranted — and deeply unwise. I would keep <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> in their intended sphere and affirm the Florida Supreme Court.</p>

A <i>Nollan</i>-<i>Dolan</i> claim therefore depends on a showing of government coercion, not relevant in an ordinary challenge to a permit denial. Before applying <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>, a court must find that the permit denial occurred because the government made a demand of the landowner, which he rebuffed. And unless <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> are to wreck land-use permitting throughout the country — to the detriment of both communities and property owners — that demand must be unequivocal. If a local government risked a lawsuit every time it made a suggestion to an applicant about <span title="1277" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1277">p. 1277</span>how to meet permitting criteria, it would cease to do so; indeed, the government might desist altogether from communicating with applicants. That hazard is to some extent baked into <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i>; observers have wondered whether those decisions have inclined some local governments to deny permit applications outright, rather than negotiate agreements that could work to both sides’ advantage. See W. Fischel, <i>Regulatory Takings</i> 346 (1995). But that danger would rise exponentially if something less than a clear condition — if each idea or proposal offered in the back-and-forth of reconciling diverse interests — triggered <i>Nollan</i>-<i>Dolan</i> scrutiny. At that point, no local government official with a decent lawyer would have a conversation with a developer.</p>
<p id="c5f94243-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Here,] the District never made a demand or set a condition — not to cede an identifiable property interest, not to undertake a particular mitigation project, not even to write a check to the government. Instead, the District suggested to Koontz several non-exclusive ways to make his applications conform to state law. The District’s only hard-and-fast requirement was that Koontz do something — anything — to satisfy the relevant permitting criteria. Koontz’s failure to obtain the permits therefore did not result from his refusal to accede to an allegedly extortionate demand or condition; rather, it arose from the legal deficiencies of his applications, combined with his unwillingness to correct them by any means. <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> were never meant to address such a run-of-the-mill denial of a land-use permit. As applications of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, those decisions require a condition; and here, there was none.</p>
<p id="c5f94244-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5f94245-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And finally, a third difficulty: Even if (1) money counted as “specific and identified propert[y]” under <i>Apfel</i> (though it doesn’t), and (2) the District made a demand for it (though it didn’t), (3) Koontz never paid a cent, so the District took nothing from him. The majority remands that question to the Florida Supreme Court, and given how it disposes of the other issues here, I can understand why. As the majority indicates, a State could decide to create a damages remedy not only for a taking, but also for an unconstitutional conditions claim predicated on the Takings Clause. And that question is one of state law, which we usually do well to leave to state courts.</p>
<p id="c5f94246-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But as I look to the Florida statute here, I cannot help but see yet another reason why the Florida Supreme Court got this case right. That statute authorizes damages only for “an unreasonable exercise of the state’s police power constituting a taking without just compensation.” Fla. Stat. §373.617 (2010). In what legal universe could a law authorizing damages only for a “taking” also provide damages when (as all agree) no taking has occurred? I doubt that inside-out, upside-down universe is the State of Florida. Certainly, none of the Florida courts in this case suggested that the majority’s hypothesized remedy actually exists; rather, the trial and appellate courts imposed a damages remedy on the mistaken theory that there had been a taking (although of exactly what neither was clear). So I would, once more, affirm the Florida Supreme Court, not make it say again what it has already said — that Koontz is not entitled to money damages.</p>

<p id="c5f94249-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Linkage ordinances and exactions.</b> Municipalities regularly enact ordinances that require developers to mitigate the impact of new development, or authorize local agencies to negotiate for such mitigation in the permitting process. This mitigation can come either through specific improvements or dedications or through payments in lieu of such mitigation, also called impact fees.</p>
<p id="c5f9424a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, new construction may exacerbate local shortages in low-income housing by increasing employment, and therefore the demand for housing, in the locality. If the increased demand is not entirely met by new construction, competition for existing housing both raises rents and pushes out lower-income tenants. It is not profitable to build low-income housing in the absence of governmental subsidies since poor persons cannot afford to pay even the minimum costs for housing; for this reason, the market does not respond to housing shortages by constructing new low-income housing. New development is therefore thought to create externalities — exacerbating shortages in low-income housing or pushing low-income persons out of the city or into undesirable neighborhoods. Linkage programs are intended to internalize these costs by requiring developers to account to the community for those externalities, again either by dedicating a portion of new development to affordable housing or by paying for such development off site. Linkage programs and exactions have been applied to a wide variety of negative externalities from development, including child care shortages, new demand for public education, increased use of public infrastructure such as roads and transit, and other burdens on existing community amenities.</p>
<p id="c5f9424b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land use regulation in recent years has increasingly shifted to a model of negotiation, see Chapter 7, §1.5, and exactions that seek to mitigate the negative impact of new development have been an important aspect of such negotiations. <i>Koontz</i> suggests that a proposal by a local agency in the context of negotiations over permit approval can give rise to liability under the doctrine announced in <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), and <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, 512 U.S. 374 (1994). As Justice Kagan’s dissent in <i>Koontz</i> points out, this has the potential to deter what might be mutually beneficial agreements between developers and public officials and may lead local governments to make permitting a less discretionary, and thus more blunt, process.</p>
<p id="c5f9424c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Impact fees and individualized determinations.</b> Prior to <i>Koontz</i>, some courts had held that the <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> unconstitutional conditions doctrine did not apply to impact fees because both cases had involved required dedications of land. <i>See, e.g., Garneau v. City of Seattle</i>, 147 F.3d 802 (9th Cir. 1998). <i>Koontz</i> has now settled the general question whether <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> applies to monetary exactions, but leaves open whether it applies only to individualized decisions or also applies to general legislative judgments about impact.</p>
<p id="c5f9424d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Koontz</i>, <i>Nollan</i>, and <i>Dolan</i>, a government agency made an individualized determination about a particular owner in the context of permit review. There was no <span title="1279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1279">p. 1279</span>general law or regulation requiring all owners to take similar steps. Many linkage laws, however, provide pre-set conditions that developers must meet. Such general laws may mitigate some concern over the risk of abuse by local officials and may also represent a general law affecting many or all parcels of land in an area. They may therefore create an “average reciprocity of advantage” like a general zoning law rather than an expropriation of property from an individual owner that is out of proportion to any harms caused by that owner.</p>
<p id="c5f9424e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have held that it is sufficient for a local government to make a general determination that particular types of development have particular impacts and impose fees reasonably related to those impacts. For example, a city might commission a study that demonstrates that new commercial development increases the need for housing and this need increases demand on the existing housing supply, bidding up prices and pushing out low-income families who cannot find affordable housing because the market does not find it profitable to build low-income housing. <i>San Remo Hotel L.P. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco</i>, 41 P.3d 87, 102-103 (Cal. 2002), <i>aff’d on other grounds</i>, 545 U.S. 323 (2005) (<i>Nollan-Dolan</i> test applies to a housing replacement fee that is determined on an <i>ad hoc</i> or individualized or “adjudicative” basis but not to general legislatively determined fees); <i>Home Builders Association of Dayton &amp; Miami Valley v. City of Beaver Creek</i>, 729 N.E.2d 349 (Ohio 2000) (upholding legislatively determined impact fee under <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> test); <i>Holmdel Builders Association v. Holmdel</i>, 583 A.2d 277 (N.J. 1990) (“We find a sound basis to support a legislative judgment that there is a reasonable relationship between unrestrained nonresidential development and the need for affordable residential development.”).</p>
<p id="c5f9424f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts have disagreed, noting that, because <i>Dolan</i> requires individualized determinations that impact fees bear a “rough proportionality” to the externalities of the development, studies might have to be conducted for each parcel subjected to the exaction. They have struck down impact fees that could not be shown to be related to the particular impacts of the development of particular parcels of land. <i>See</i>,<i> e.g., Volusia County v. Aberdeen at Ormond Beach, L.P.</i>, 760 So. 2d 126 (Fla. 2000) (uniform impact fee to fund schools was unconstitutional as applied to mobile home park only open to persons over 55).</p>
<p id="c5f96960-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>California Building Industry Association v. City of San Jose</i>, 351 P.3d 974 (2015), <i>cert. denied</i>, 136 S. Ct. 928 (2016), the California Supreme Court upheld San Jose’s inclusionary housing law that required developers of residential project of 20 or more units to sell at least 15 percent of those units at prices affordable to low- or moderate-income households. The court found this requirement to be a regulation of property that did not trigger exaction analysis and the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought review by the United States Supreme Court. Justice Thomas concurred in the denial of certiorari to note that for “at least two decades . . . lower courts have divided over whether the <i>Nollan</i>/<i>Dolan</i> test applies in cases where the alleged taking arises from a legislatively imposed condition rather than an administrative one.” 136 S. Ct. 928, 928 (2016). Because the case was a poor vehicle to resolve this issue, Justice Thomas concurred, but signaled that the Court should resolve the issue. <i>Id.</i> at 928-929 (“Until we decide this issue, property owners and local governments are left uncertain about what legal <span title="1280" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1280">p. 1280</span>standard governs legislative ordinances and whether cities can legislatively impose exactions that would not pass muster if done administratively. These factors present compelling reasons for resolving this conflict at the earliest practicable opportunity.”).</p>
<p id="c5f96961-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Essential nexus and rough proportionality.</b> <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> established two central federal constitutional requirements for any exaction: that there be an “essential nexus” between the exaction and the mitigation sought by the government and, if that threshold is crossed, that the mitigation have some reasonable relationship to the impact of the new development. Because the phrase “reasonable relationship,” which had been common in the state courts, was too similar to the term “rational basis” used in equal protection cases, the Supreme Court in <i>Dolan</i> adopted the phrase “rough proportionality.” 512 U.S. at 391. In <i>Nollan</i>, the Court found no essential nexus between the government’s interest in protecting the public’s view of a beach and the beach access that would facilitate and a requirement that beachfront owners applying for a building permit provide a right of way for the public to reach the beach. 483 U.S. at 836-837. In <i>Dolan</i>, a city was able to satisfy the threshold nexus requirement when it sought to condition an expansion of an owner’s commercial property on requirements that the owner dedicate land in a flood plain for a public greenway to facilitate storm drainage and allow a bike and pedestrian path on her property to offset the increased traffic the development would generate. 512 U.S. at 387. However, the owner prevailed because the city could not demonstrate the required relationship between the impact of the new building and the specific conditions imposed.</p>
<p id="c5f96962-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It can be difficult to evaluate “proportionality,” which, as the Utah Supreme Court has pointed out, is a term that does not suggest any particular ratio of harm and mitigation. <i>B.A.M. Development, L.L.C. v. Salt Lake County</i>, 196 P.3d 601 (Utah 2008) (“Of course, the [U.S. Supreme] Court did not mean rough <i>proportionality</i> at all. While 1 to 1 is a proportion, so is 1 to 1000, as any fifth-grade student will be happy to tell you. Any two numbers, measured by the same units, form a proportion. So to be roughly proportional literally means to be roughly related, not necessarily roughly <i>equivalent,</i> which is the concept the Court seemed to be trying to describe.”). As a result, exactions are often accompanied by studies, sometimes quite extensive, about the relationship between development impact and required mitigation. </p>
<p id="c5f96963-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Unconstitutional conditions and takings.</b> Most unconstitutional conditions cases involve situations where someone is being asked to give up a constitutional right in exchange for some government benefit. <i>See, e.g., United States Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.</i>, 133 S. Ct. 2321 (2013) (requirement that aid recipients have an anti-prostitution policy was an unconstitutional burden on free speech). However, the <i>Koontz</i> majority does not hold, although it appears to assume, that the underlying suggestion regarding funding offsite improvements to mitigate the harm of the proposed development would necessarily have been a taking if the District had imposed it directly as a regulatory requirement. This may signal an attempt by the Court to expand takings doctrine. The Court may alternatively have viewed its holding as a preventative measure to forestall <span title="1281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1281">p. 1281</span>even the threat of potentially unconstitutional action. If so, is that an appropriate role for the Court to take? </p>
<p id="c5f96964-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Money and takings.</b> The <i>Koontz</i> majority and dissent disagree about whether an obligation to pay a fungible amount of money can give rise to takings liability. The Court had previously addressed takings cases involving specific and identifiable funds. In <i>Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith</i>, 449 U.S. 155 (1980), for example, a company called Eckerd’s of College Park, Inc., had agreed to purchase Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. for over $1.8 million. When it came time to close on the purchase, however, it appeared that the pharmacy’s debts were greater than the purchase price. Eckerd’s filed an interpleader, which is an action to resolve claims to a limited pool of funds, bringing in the pharmacy and its numerous creditors. Eckerd’s deposited the amount of the purchase price with the court, which the court’s clerk then deposited in an interest-bearing account. Nearly a year later, the court appointed a receiver to process claims against this fund, which the court ordered transferred to the receiver. Interest on the fund by that point totaled more than $100,000, but was not included in the transfer. The receiver filed a motion seeking to have the court clerk transfer the interest, which the court granted. On appeal, however, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, relying on a state statute that provided that “[a]ll interest accruing from moneys deposited shall be deemed income of the office of the clerk of the circuit court investing such moneys,” Fla. Stat. §28.33.</p>
<p id="c5f96965-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court in turn reversed, reasoning that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f96966-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal sum deposited in the registry of the court plainly was private property, and was not the property of Seminole County. The deposited fund was the amount received as the purchase price for Webb’s assets. It was property held only for the ultimate benefit of Webb’s creditors, not for the benefit of the court and not for the benefit of the county. And it was held only for the purpose of making a fair distribution among those creditors. Eventually, and inevitably, that fund, less proper charges authorized by the court, would be distributed among the creditors as their claims were recognized by the court. The creditors thus had a state-created property right to their respective portions of the fund.</p>
<p id="c5f96967-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What would justify the county’s retention of that interest? It is obvious that the interest was not a fee for services, for any services obligation to the county was paid for and satisfied by [a separate] fee and described specifically in that statute as a fee “for services” by the clerk’s office. Section 28.33, in contrast, in no way relates the interest of which it speaks to “services rendered.” Indeed, if the county were entitled to the interest, its officials would feel an inherent pressure and possess a natural inclination to defer distribution, for that interest return would be greater the longer the fund is held; there would be, therefore, a built-in disincentive against distributing the principal to those entitled to it.</p>
<p id="c5f96968-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court has been permissive in upholding governmental action that may deny the property owner of some beneficial use of his property or that may restrict the owner’s full exploitation of the property, if such public action is justified as promoting the general welfare. Here, however, Seminole County has not merely “adjust[ed] the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.” [<i>Penn Central <span title="1282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1282">p. 1282</span>Transportation Co. v. New York City</i>, 438 U.S. 104, 125-129 (1978).] Rather, the exaction is a forced contribution to general governmental revenues, and it is not reasonably related to the costs of using the courts. No police power justification is offered for the deprivation. Neither the statute nor appellees suggest any reasonable basis to sustain the taking of the interest earned by the interpleader fund.</p>
<p id="c5f96969-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Neither the Florida Legislature by statute, nor the Florida courts by judicial decree, may accomplish the result the county seeks simply by recharacterizing the principal as “public money” because it is held temporarily by the court. The earnings of a fund are incidents of ownership of the fund itself and are property just as the fund itself is property. The state statute has the practical effect of appropriating for the county the value of the use of the fund for the period in which it is held in the registry. To put it another way: a State, by <i>ipse dixit</i>, may not transform private property into public property without compensation, even for the limited duration of the deposit in court. This is the very kind of thing that the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment was meant to prevent. That Clause stands as a shield against the arbitrary use of governmental power.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5f9696a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">449 U.S. at 160-164.</p>
<p id="c5f9696b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation</i>, 524 U.S. 156 (1998), a public interest organization challenged a Texas practice, used by almost every state, that requires lawyers to place client funds held by lawyers into a common pool managed by the state in order to generate interest on those funds so that the interest (so-called Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts or IOLTAs) could be used to help fund legal services for the poor. Texas had argued that the interest earned on the pooled account was not the client’s “property” because it was only earned as a result of the state mandating the pooling of funds and thus the client lost nothing that she would ever have earned. The Supreme Court held that interest earned on such accounts was “property” belonging to the client whose funds generated the interest even if the client’s account was so small and held for so short a time that it would not have generated any interest unless it were pooled with other such accounts.</p>
<p id="c5f9696c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a follow-up case several years later, <i>Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington</i>, 538 U.S. 216 (2003), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether IOLTA programs constitute unconstitutional takings of property. On remand in <i>Phillips</i>, the trial court had held that, even though the interest was <i>property</i> of the client, the IOLTA program did not constitute a <i>taking</i> of property because the program applied only to client funds that would not have earned interest absent the program and that the clients therefore “lost nothing of economically realizable value.” <i>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas Equal Access to Justice</i>, 86 F. Supp. 2d 624, 643 (D. Tex. 2000). The Supreme Court affirmed but on a different theory. It held by a 5-4 vote that the IOLTA program had indeed “taken property” belonging to the clients; on the other hand, the Court ruled that it had not done so “without just compensation.” Justice Stevens explained that no compensation was due because the clients would not have earned any interest on their funds absent the IOLTA program; thus their loss of this interest caused them no economic loss and just compensation is measured “by the property owner’s loss rather than the government’s gain,” <i>id.</i> at 235-236. Further, no compensation is due for <span title="1283" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1283">p. 1283</span>the “nonpecuniary consequences” of using the interest for purposes other than those that might have been chosen by the owner. <i>Id.</i> at 236-237.</p>
<p id="c5f9696d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These cases all involve some identifiable fund but, as the <i>Koontz</i> majority and dissent both note, <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), had seemed to resolve the question whether the takings clause applies to the obligation to pay money beyond that context. Five members of the Court agreed that the takings clause applies only to takings of specific property interests, such as interests in real property or interests in a particular identifiable fund of money; it does not apply to general obligations to pay money from whatever funds one possesses. Justice Alito distinguishes this approach by arguing that the demand for money in <i>Koontz</i> in fact operated on an identifiable property interest — not the funds themselves, but “petitioner’s ownership of a specific parcel of land.” Is that a meaningful distinction or is the <i>Koontz</i> dissent more convincing when it comes to <i>Apfel</i>?</p>
<p id="c5f9696e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If takings claims are not limited to specific funds, courts will be required to adjudicate not only the point at which a fee violates <i>Nollan-Dolan</i>, but also when fees and taxes more generally might constitute a taking. All taxation by its very nature arguably can be thought to “take” property by requiring payments of money to the government but if every tax were a taking of property then the taxing power would be meaningless. The Court in <i>Koontz</i> argued that it will not be difficult to distinguish between taxes and claims for fund that trigger takings liability. Is that argument convincing?</p>
<p id="c5f9907f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. The denominator in another guise?</b> <i>Koontz</i> does not explicitly discuss the Court’s varying approaches since <i>Mahon</i> to determining the relevant parcel for purposes of the takings clause. The majority, however, appears to find that the right to build on a 3.7-acre portion of Koontz’s property to be a distinct property interest. The Court indicates that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f99080-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">respondent’s suggestion that we should treat its offer to let petitioner build on 1 acre as an alternative to offsite mitigation misapprehends the governmental benefit that petitioner was denied. Petitioner sought to develop 3.7 acres, but respondent in effect told petitioner that it would not allow him to build on 2.7 of those acres unless he agreed to spend money improving public lands. Petitioner claims that he was wrongfully denied a permit to build on those 2.7 acres.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5f99081-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If this were a straightforward takings claim, would the denial of the right to build on a portion of an owner’s property be treated as a distinct property interest? </p>
<p id="c5f99082-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>7. Government benefits.</b> <i>Koontz</i> holds that <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> applies even where the underlying governmental benefit is entirely discretionary, given that the Water District would have been entitled to deny the permit outright. In <i>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.</i>, 467 U.S. 986 (1984), the Supreme Court held that the takings clause was not violated by a federal law requiring that businesses applying for government permission to use an insecticide disclose trade secrets to the government and consent to government use and disclosure of those trade secrets. In a footnote in <i>Nollan</i>, Justice Scalia distinguished <i>Monsanto</i> by arguing that a right to register and sell an insecticide was a “valuable government benefit” and not an established property right, whereas <span title="1284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1284">p. 1284</span>the “right to build on one’s own property — even though its exercise can be subjected to legitimate permitting requirements — cannot remotely be described as a government benefit.’” <i>Nollan</i>, 483 U.S. at 833 n.2. Thus, Justice Scalia concluded, the “announcement that the application for (or granting of) the permit will entail the yielding of a property interest cannot be regarded as establishing the voluntary exchange,’ that we found to have occurred in <i>Monsanto</i>.” <i>Id.</i> Justice Brennan disagreed, arguing that <i>Nollan</i> was indistinguishable from <i>Monsanto</i>, 483 U.S. at 860 n.10:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5f99083-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both Monsanto and the Nollans hold property whose use is subject to regulation; Monsanto may not sell its property without obtaining government approval and the Nollans may not build new development on their property without government approval. Obtaining such approval is as much a “government benefit” for the Nollans as it is for Monsanto. If the Court is somehow suggesting that “the right to build on one’s own property” has some privileged natural rights status, the argument is a curious one. By any traditional labor theory of value justification for property rights.<i> See, e.g.</i>, J.

James</i>, 400 U.S. 309 (1971), the Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures was not violated by a New York law requiring that welfare recipients agree, as a condition of receiving benefits, to home inspections. The Court concluded that the home visits were not coerced because the family could avoid them by declining to agree to accept welfare benefits. <i>See Sanchez v. San Diego</i>, 464 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2006) (mandated home visits are reasonable under fourth amendment). Suppose Barbara James, the public assistance recipient in <i>Wyman</i>, had characterized the home visits as a taking of her property rights rather than a violation of the fourth amendment. Is <i>Wyman</i> covered by <i>Monsanto</i> or by the <i>Nollan-Dolan</i> line of cases? Is welfare simply a “government benefit” rather than a vested property right or does the condition in <i>Wyman</i> constitute a physical invasion of property (the home visit)? Consider further than the “permanent” invasion of the cable box in <i>Loretto</i> was required by law only so long as the property was held for residential rental purposes. Is greater coercion involved in <i>Wyman</i> or in <i>Dolan</i>? Is the intrusion greater in <i>Wyman</i> or in <i>Loretto</i>? Can you reconcile all these cases? <i>See</i> Steven D.

The ordinance prohibited the conversion of residential hotels to tourist hotels without replacing the lost units on a one-for-one basis or paying a fee to the city to allow it to replace the lost units. The ordinance was intended to “benefit the general public by minimizing adverse impact on the housing supply and on displaced low-income, elderly, and disabled persons resulting from the loss of residential hotel units through their conversion and demolition.” It was accompanied by findings that the city had recently lost thousands of such units, that many low-income, elderly, and disabled persons reside in such units, and these conversions had created a low-income housing “emergency” in San Francisco.</p>

The dream has a history. The idea that property ownership is the essential prerequisite of liberty has long been “a fundamental tenet of Anglo-American constitutional thought.” (Ely, <i>The Guardian of Every Other Right</i> (1998) p. 43.) “Indeed, the framers saw property ownership as a buffer protecting individuals from government coercion. Arbitrary redistribution of property destroyed liberty, and thus the framers hoped to restrain attacks on property rights.” (<i>Ibid</i>.) “Property must be secured, or liberty cannot exist” (Adams, <i>A Balanced Government</i> (1790) <i>in Discourses on Davila</i> (1805), <i><span title="1286" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1286">p. 1286</span>reprinted in</i> 6 <i>The Works of John Adams</i> (1851 ed.) p. 280), because property and liberty are, upon examination, one and the same thing.</p>
<p id="c5f9b79e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But private property, already an endangered species in California, is now entirely extinct in San Francisco. The City and County of San Francisco has implemented a neo-feudal regime where the nominal owner of property must use that property according to the preferences of the majorities that prevail in the political process or, worse, the political powerbrokers who often control the government independently of majoritarian preferences. San Francisco has redefined the American dream. Where once government was closely constrained to increase the freedom of individuals, now property ownership is closely constrained to increase the power of government. Where once government was a necessary evil because it protected private property, now private property is a necessary evil because it funds government programs.</p>
<p id="c5f9b79f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The express purpose of the [ordinance] was to preserve the City’s stock of low-income residential housing by requiring hotel owners to continue leasing their rooms as residences, or to replace those residential units if they chose to convert the rooms to tourist use. Obviously, the [ordinance] is facially unconstitutional. If a person took my car and asked a ransom for its return, he or she would be guilty of theft. But what if the City, seeking to provide transportation to the poor, orders me to operate an informal carpool, or if I prefer, to buy the City a replacement car?</p>
<p id="c5f9b7a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the City has essentially said to 500 unlucky hotel owners: We lack the public funds to fill the need for affordable housing in San Francisco, so you should solve the problem for us by using your hotels to house poor people. The City might as well have ordered the owners of small grocery stores to give away food at cost.</p>
<p id="c5f9b7a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once again a majority of this court has proved that “If enough people get together and act in concert, they can take something and not pay for it.” <i>Landgate, Inc. v.

Theft is theft even when the government approves of the thievery. Turning a democracy into a kleptocracy does not enhance the stature of the thieves; it only diminishes the legitimacy of the government. The right to express one’s individuality and essential human dignity through the free use of property is just as important as the right to do so through speech, the press, or the free exercise of religion. Nevertheless, the property right is now — in California, at least — a hollow one.</p>

The public use described in <i>Berman</i> extended beyond that to encompass the purpose of developing that area to create conditions that would prevent a reversion to blight in the future. <i>See</i> 348 U.S., at 34-35 (“It was not enough, [the experts] believed, to remove existing buildings that were insanitary or unsightly. It was important to redesign the whole area so as to eliminate the conditions that cause slums. . . . The entire area needed redesigning so that a balanced, integrated plan could be developed for the region, including not only new homes, but also schools, churches, parks, streets, and shopping centers. In this way it was hoped that the cycle of decay of the area could be controlled and the birth of future slums prevented”).

By focusing on a property’s future use, as opposed to its past use, our cases are faithful to the text of the Takings Clause. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 5. (“Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation”). Justice O’Connor’s intimation that a “public purpose” may not be achieved by the action of private parties, confuses the purpose of a taking with its mechanics, a mistake we warned of in <i>Midkiff</i>, 467 U.S., at 244. <i>See also Berman</i>, 348 U.S., at 33-34 (“The public end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of government”).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f264c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN101E1_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N101E1_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span>&nbsp;Courts have viewed such aberrations with a skeptical eye. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> 99 Cents Only Stores v.

But a landlord’s ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation. Teleprompter’s broad “use-dependency” argument proves too much. For example, it would allow the government to require a landlord to devote a substantial portion of his building to vending and washing machines, with all profits to be retained by the owners of these services and with no compensation for the deprivation of space. It would even allow the government to requisition a certain number of apartments as permanent government offices. The right of a property owner to exclude a stranger’s physical occupation of his land cannot be so easily manipulated.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f60dbf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10FA9_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10FA9_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">22</a></span>&nbsp;In <i>Arkansas Game and Fish Commission v. United States</i>, 133 S. Ct. 511 (2012), the Court faced the question whether the fact that a physical invasion was temporary created an exemption from takings liability, and held that there is no such exemption. Temporary physical invasions, the Court held, must be evaluated under the <i>Penn Central</i> test, with the duration of the invasion “a factor in determining the existence <i>vel non</i> of a compensable taking.” <i>Id.</i> at 522. The Court also clarified that “the degree to which the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action” can influence the <i>Penn Central</i> analysis. <i>Id.</i></p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f65c11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN111C4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N111C4_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">23</a></span>&nbsp;Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our “deprivation of all economically feasible use” rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does not make clear the “property interest” against which the loss of value is to be measured. When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave 90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically beneficial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as one in which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tract as a whole. The answer to this difficult question may lie in how the owner’s reasonable expectations have been shaped by the State’s law of property — i.e., whether and to what degree the State’s law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In any event, we avoid this difficulty in the present case, since the “interest in land” that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas found that the <i>Beachfront Management Act</i> left each of Lucas’s beachfront lots without economic value.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f65c1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN11237_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N11237_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">24</a></span>&nbsp;In Justice Blackmun’s view, even with respect to regulations that deprive an owner of all developmental or economically beneficial land uses, the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited a harm-preventing justification for its action. Since such a justification can be formulated in practically every case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupid staff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insist upon artful harm-preventing characterizations.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f6832e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1124F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N1124F_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">25</a></span>&nbsp;After accusing us of “launch[ing] a missile to kill a mouse,” Justice Blackmun expends a good deal of throw-weight of his own upon a noncombatant, arguing that our description of the “understanding” of land ownership that informs the Takings Clause is not supported by early American experience. That is largely true, but entirely irrelevant. The practices of the States prior to incorporation of the Takings and Just Compensation Clauses, see<i> Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago</i>, 166 U.S. 226 (1897) — which, as Justice Blackmun acknowledges, occasionally included outright physical appropriation of land without compensation — were out of accord with any plausible interpretation of those provisions. Justice Blackmun is correct that early constitutional theorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of property at all, but even he does not suggest (explicitly, at least) that we renounce the Court’s contrary conclusion in <i>Mahon</i>. Since the text of the Clause can be read to encompass regulatory as well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposed by Madison) (“No person shall be . . . obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without a just compensation”), we decline to do so as well.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f68330-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN11267_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N11267_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">26</a></span>&nbsp;The principal “otherwise” that we have in mind is litigation absolving the State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of “real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading of a fire” or to forestall other grave threats to the lives and property of others. <i>Bowditch v.

Cnty. of Los Angeles</i>, 482 U.S. 304, 321 (1987).

There is no doubt some leeway in a court’s interpretation of what existing state law permits — but not remotely as much, we think, as in a legislative crafting of the reasons for its confiscatory regulation. We stress that an affirmative decree eliminating all economically beneficial uses may be defended only if an objectively reasonable application of relevant precedents would exclude those beneficial uses in the circumstances in which the land is presently found.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f6aa53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN11301_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N11301_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">29</a></span>&nbsp;On remand, the California court found no taking in part because the zoning regulation “involves this highest of public interests — the prevention of death and injury.” <i>First Lutheran Church v.

The Court today effectively establishes a form of insurance against certain changes in land-use regulations. Like other forms of insurance, the Court’s rule creates a “moral hazard” and inefficiencies: In the face of uncertainty about changes in the law, developers will overinvest, safe in the knowledge that if the law changes adversely, they will be entitled to compensation. <i>See generally</i> Farber, <i>Economic Analysis and Just Compensation</i>, 12 Int’l Rev. of Law &amp; Econ. 125 (1992).</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5f7bc05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN115FA_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N115FA_ceeadfb1-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">31</a></span>&nbsp;Takings claims against the federal government, as opposed to claims against states or local governments, can be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under a statute called the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. §1491(a)(1).

That doctrine applies only if imposing a condition directly — i.e., independent of an exchange for a government benefit — would violate the Constitution. Here, <i>Apfel</i> makes clear that the District’s condition would not do so: The government may (separate and apart from permitting) require a person — whether Koontz or anyone else — to pay or spend money without effecting a taking.
