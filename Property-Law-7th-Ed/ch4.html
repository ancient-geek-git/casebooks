<p id="c55cdb54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What limits should the legal system impose on the conversion of human interests into exchangeable property rights? Does it make sense to use the vocabulary of property and market exchange to describe interests in human bodies and in people themselves? Is anything lost by using the imagery of property to evaluate these kinds of issues? Should there be a presumption that all interests are exchangeable? In recent years, law and economics scholars have used market and property images to analyze almost every imaginable legal problem. <i>See</i> Richard Posner, <i>Economic Analysis of Law</i> (9th ed. 2014). Professor Margaret Jane Radin has argued that the use of market rhetoric to analyze all legal issues has the effect of wrongfully “commodifying” human experience by conceptualizing all human relationships in terms of market exchange. She argues that certain types of property interests are so crucial to individual dignity, self-fulfillment, the ability to form essential human relationships, and the ability to participate as a member of political society, that they should be treated as personal rights rather than as exchangeable interests in a market. Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Market-Inalienability</i>, 100 Harv. L. Rev. 1849 (1987).</p>

Scott based federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship between the parties, raising the question in the court’s mind whether Scott was in fact a citizen of Missouri. In 1834, Scott’s former owner had taken him from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state, where they lived for two years before moving to Minnesota, then part of the Louisiana Territory, before returning to Missouri in 1838. Scott was then sold to Sanford. Slavery was illegal in Illinois under state law and in Minnesota under the federal statute called the <i>Missouri Compromise Act</i> of March 6, 1820, 3 Stat. 545. Sanford argued that Scott was not a citizen of Missouri and hence could not bring a lawsuit in federal court based on diversity of citizenship. Scott claimed to be both a Missouri citizen and a free man, based on his having obtained freedom by domicile for a long period in a state and a territory that did not recognize the status of slavery for its domiciliaries. Sanford claimed that neither Illinois nor the <i>Missouri Compromise</i> could constitutionally act to deprive him of his property interest in Scott when they returned to a state that recognized property interests in slaves.]</p>

<p id="c55d2981-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The first question concerned whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the case. Such jurisdiction existed in federal court over suits between “Citizens of different States,” U.S. Const. art. III, §2, cl. 1.

The issue that had to be decided was whether the plaintiff was a “citizen” as defined in the Constitution.]</p>
<p id="c55d2982-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question simply is this: Can a negro, whose ancestors were imported into this country, and sold as slaves, become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the United States, and as such become entitled to all the rights, and privileges, and immunities, guarantied by that instrument to the citizen? One of which rights is the privilege of suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="c55d2983-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It will be observed, that the plea applies to that class of persons only whose ancestors were negroes of the African race, and imported into this country, and sold and held as slaves. The only matter in issue . . . is, whether the descendants of such slaves, <span title="249" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-249">p. 249</span>when they shall be emancipated, or who are born of parents who had become free before their birth, are citizens of a State, in the sense in which the word “citizen” is used in the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="c55d2984-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words “people of the United States” and “citizens” are synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call the “sovereign people,” and every citizen is one of this people, and a constituent member of this sovereignty. The question before us is, whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty? We think they are not, and that they are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word “citizens” in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.</p>

[P]revious to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, every State had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever it pleased the character of citizen, and to endow him with all its rights. But this character of course was confined to the boundaries of the State, and gave him no rights or privileges in other States beyond those secured to him by the laws of nations and the comity of States.</p>
<p id="c55d2986-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is very clear, therefore, that no State can, by any act or law of its own, passed since the adoption of the Constitution, introduce a new member into the political community created by the Constitution of the United States. It cannot make him a member of this community by making him a member of its own. And for the same reason it cannot introduce any person, or description of persons, who were not intended to be embraced in this new political family, which the Constitution brought into existence, but were intended to be excluded from it.</p>
<p id="c55d2987-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question then arises, whether the provisions of the Constitution, in relation to the personal rights and privileges to which the citizen of a State should be entitled, embraced the negro African race, at that time in this country, or who might afterwards be imported, who had then or should afterwards be made free in any State; and to put it in the power of a single State to make him a citizen of the United States, and endue him with the full rights of citizenship in every other State without their consent? Does the Constitution of the United States act upon him whenever he shall be made free under the laws of a State, and raised there to the rank of a citizen, and immediately clothe him with all the privileges of a citizen in every other State, and in its own courts?</p>
<p id="c55d2988-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court thinks the affirmative of these propositions cannot be maintained.</p>

<p id="c55d298a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[African Americans] had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was bought and sold, and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever a profit could be made by it. This opinion was at that time fixed and universal in the civilized portion of the white race. It was regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in politics, which no one thought of disputing, or supposed to be open to dispute; and men in every grade and position in society daily and habitually acted upon it in their private pursuits, as well as in matters of public concern, without doubting for a moment the correctness of this opinion.</p>
<p id="c55d298b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language of the Declaration of Independence . . . would seem to embrace the whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood. But it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this declaration; for if the language, as understood in that day, would embrace them, the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation.</p>
<p id="c55d298c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet the men who framed this declaration were great men — high in literary acquirements — high in their sense of honor, and incapable of asserting principles inconsistent with those on which they were acting. They perfectly understood the meaning of the language they used, and how it would be understood by others; and they knew that it would not in any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the negro race, which, by common consent, had been excluded from civilized Governments and the family of nations, and doomed to slavery. They spoke and acted according to the then established doctrines and principles, and in the ordinary language of the day, and no one misunderstood them. The unhappy black race were separated from the white by indelible marks, and laws long before established, and were never thought of or spoken of except as property, and when the claims of the owner or the profit of the trader were supposed to need protection.</p>
<p id="c55d298d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This state of public opinion had undergone no change when the Constitution was adopted.</p>
<p id="c55d509e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]here are two clauses in the Constitution which point directly and specifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons, and show clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the Government then formed.</p>
<p id="c55d509f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of these clauses reserves to each of the thirteen States the right to import slaves until the year 1808, if it thinks proper. And the importation which it thus sanctions was unquestionably of persons of the race of which we are speaking, as the traffic in slaves in the United States had always been confined to them. And by the other <span title="251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-251">p. 251</span>provision the States pledge themselves to each other to maintain the right of property of the master, by delivering up to him any slave who may have escaped from his service, and be found within their respective territories. By the first above-mentioned clause, therefore, the right to purchase and hold this property is directly sanctioned and authorized for twenty years by the people who framed the Constitution. And by the second, they pledge themselves to maintain and uphold the right of the master in the manner specified, as long as the Government they then formed should endure. And these two provisions show, conclusively, that neither the description of persons therein referred to, nor their descendants, were embraced in any of the other provisions of the Constitution; for certainly these two clauses were not intended to confer on them or their posterity the blessings of liberty, or any of the personal rights so carefully provided for the citizen.</p>
<p id="c55d50a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And upon a full and careful consideration of the subject, the court is of opinion, that, upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement, Dred Scott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and not entitled to sue in its courts.</p>

And the difficulty which meets us at the threshold of this part of the inquiry is, whether Congress was authorized to pass this law under any of the powers granted to it by the Constitution; for if the authority is not given by that instrument, it is the duty of this court to declare it void and inoperative, and incapable of conferring freedom upon any one who is held as a slave under the laws of any one of the States.</p>

And no word can be found in the Constitution which gives Congress a greater power over slave property, or which entitles property of that kind to less protection than property of any other description. The only power conferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting the owner in his rights.</p>

The morality of slavery and the duty of the law.</b> When a pirate ship captured three vessels (one each from the United States, Spain, and Portugal) off the coast of Africa and took Africans from each ship, and one of those vessels was later captured off the coast of the United States with many of the captured Africans aboard, the Supreme <span title="253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-253">p. 253</span>Court had to determine whether to treat the captured Africans as slaves and return them to their “owners” or to treat them as free persons. Because the United States had outlawed the slave trade (but not slavery) in 1808, the Court in <i>The Antelope</i>, 23 U.S. 66 (1825), ruled that the persons taken from the American ship should be freed. No owner claimed the Africans aboard the Portuguese ship, so they were freed as well. But the Court ordered the persons aboard the Spanish ship to be returned to their owners if they could prove their claims of title.</p>
<p id="c55d77c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice John Marshall explained that this was a case “in which the sacred rights of liberty and of property come in conflict with each other.” <i>Id.</i> at 114. Quoting John Locke, Marshall easily concluded that slavery violated natural law. “That it is contrary to the law of nature will scarcely be denied. That every man has a natural right to the fruits of his own labour, is generally admitted; and that no other person can rightfully deprive him of those fruits, and appropriate them against his will, seems to be the necessary result of this admission.” <i>Id.</i> at 120. However, the slave trade had long been engaged in by the “Christian and civilized nations of world” and “claimed all the sanction which could be derived from long usage, and general acquiescence.” <i>Id.</i> at 115. The Court thus concluded that the slave trade was not contrary to the law of nations. Given a conflict between natural law and the positive law adopted by the nations of the world, the Court held that the positive law must prevail. “Slavery, then, has its origin in force; but as the world has agreed that it is a legitimate result of force, the state of things which is thus produced by general consent, cannot be pronounced unlawful.” <i>Id.</i> at 121. Marshall explained, <i>id.</i> at 121-122:</p>

If we resort to this standard as the test of international law, the question, as has already been observed, is decided in favour of the legality of the trade. Both Europe and America embarked in it; and for nearly two centuries, it was carried on without opposition, and without censure. A jurist could not say, that a practice thus supported was illegal, and that those engaged in it might be punished, either personally, or by deprivation of property.</p>

Mrs. Whitehead’s husband, Richard, was also a party to the contract; Mrs. Stern was not. Although Mrs. Stern was not a party to the surrogacy agreement, the contract gave her sole custody of the child in the event of Mr. Stern’s death.

She told them that she could not live without her baby, that she must have her, even if only for one week, that thereafter she would surrender her child. The Sterns, concerned that Mrs. Whitehead might indeed commit suicide, not wanting under any circumstances to risk that, and in any event believing that Mrs. Whitehead would keep her word, turned the child over to her. It was not until four months later, after a series of attempts to regain possession of the child, that Melissa was returned to the Sterns, having been forcibly removed from the home where she was then living with Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead, the home in Florida owned by Mary Beth Whitehead’s parents.</p><p id="c55dc5f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The struggle over Baby M began when it became apparent that Mrs. Whitehead could not return the child to Mr. Stern. Due to Mrs. Whitehead’s refusal to relinquish the baby, Mr. Stern filed a complaint seeking enforcement of the surrogacy contract. . . . [The court issued an ex parte order to Mrs. Whitehead to hand the child over to the Sterns. When the Sterns appeared at the Whiteheads’ house with the process server and the police to enforce the order,] Mr. Whitehead fled with the child, who had been handed to him through a window while those who came to enforce the order were thrown off balance by a dispute over the child’s current name.</p><p id="c55dc5f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually the Sterns discovered where the Whiteheads were staying, commenced supplementary proceedings in Florida, and obtained an order requiring the Whiteheads to turn over the child.

The child is sold without regard for whether the purchasers will be suitable parents. The natural mother does not receive the benefit of counseling and guidance to assist her in making a decision that may affect her for a lifetime. In fact, the monetary incentive to sell her child may, depending on her financial circumstances, make her decision less voluntary.</p><p id="c55ded11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Baby-selling potentially results in the exploitation of all parties involved. Conversely, adoption statutes seek to further humanitarian goals, foremost among them the best interests of the child.

Our law, recognizing the finality of any termination of parental rights, provides for such termination only where there has been a voluntary surrender of a child to an approved agency or to the Division of Youth and Family Services (“DYFS”), accompanied by a formal document acknowledging termination of parental rights, N.J. Stat. §§9:2-16, -17; N.J. Stat. §9:3-41; N.J.

[A] contractual agreement to abandon one’s parental rights, or not to contest a termination action, will not be enforced in our courts. The Legislature would not have so carefully, so consistently, and so substantially restricted termination of parental rights if it had intended to allow termination to be achieved by one short sentence in a contract.</p><p id="c55ded14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the termination was invalid, it follows, as noted above, that adoption of Melissa by Mrs. Stern could not properly be granted.</p><p id="c55ded15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) The provision in the surrogacy contract stating that Mary Beth Whitehead agrees to “surrender custody . . . and terminate all parental rights” contains no clause <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>giving her a right to rescind.

Because of those consequences, the Legislature severely limited the circumstances under which such consent would be irrevocable. The legislative goal is furthered by regulations requiring approved agencies, prior to accepting irrevocable consents, to provide advice and counseling to women, making it more likely that they fully understand and appreciate the consequences of their acts.

The contract’s basic premise, that the natural parents can decide in advance of birth which one is to have custody of the child, bears no relationship to the settled law that the child’s best interests shall determine custody.</p><p id="c55ded1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The surrogacy contract violates the policy of this State that the rights of natural parents are equal concerning their child, the father’s right no greater than the mother’s. “The parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent, regardless of the marital status of the parents.” N.J. Stat. §9:17-40. . . . The whole purpose and effect of the surrogacy contract was to give the father the exclusive right to the child by destroying the rights of the mother.</p><p id="c55e142d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only legal advice Mary Beth Whitehead received regarding the surrogacy contract was provided in connection with the contract that she previously entered into with another couple.

His services consisted of spending one hour going through the contract with the Whiteheads, section by section, and answering their questions. Mrs. Whitehead received no further legal advice prior to signing the contract with the Sterns.</p><p id="c55e142e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the contract, the natural mother is irrevocably committed before she knows the strength of her bond with her child. She never makes a totally voluntary, informed decision, for quite clearly any decision prior to the baby’s birth is, in the most important sense, uninformed, and any decision after that, compelled by a pre-existing contractual commitment, the threat of a lawsuit, and the inducement of a $10,000 payment, is less than totally voluntary. Her interests are of little concern to those who controlled this transaction.</p><p id="c55e142f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Worst of all, however, is the contract’s total disregard of the best interests of the child. There is not the slightest suggestion that any inquiry will be made at any time to determine the fitness of the Sterns as custodial parents, of Mrs. Stern as an adoptive parent, their superiority to Mrs. Whitehead, or the effect on the child of not living with her natural mother.</p><p id="c55e1430-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is the sale of a child, or, at the very least, the sale of a mother’s right to her child, the only mitigating factor being that one of the purchasers is the father. Almost every evil that prompted the prohibition on the payment of money in connection with adoptions exists here.</p><p id="c55e1431-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The differences between an adoption and a surrogacy contract should be noted, since it is asserted that the use of money in connection with surrogacy does not pose the risks found where money buys an adoption.</p><p id="c55e1432-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, and perhaps most important, all parties concede that it is unlikely that surrogacy will survive without money. Despite the alleged selfless motivation of surrogate mothers, if there is no payment, there will be no surrogates, or very few. That conclusion contrasts with adoption; for obvious reasons, there remains a steady supply, albeit insufficient, despite the prohibitions against payment. The adoption itself, relieving the natural mother of the financial burden of supporting an infant, is in some sense the equivalent of payment.</p><p id="c55e1433-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the use of money in adoptions does not produce the problem — conception occurs, and usually the birth itself, before illicit funds are offered. With surrogacy, the “problem,” if one views it as such, consisting of the purchase of a woman’s procreative capacity, at the risk of her life, is caused by and originates with the offer of money.</p><p id="c55e1434-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, with the law prohibiting the use of money in connection with adoptions, the built-in financial pressure of the unwanted pregnancy and the consequent support obligation do not lead the mother to the highest paying, ill-suited, adoptive parents. She is just as well-off surrendering the child to an approved agency. In surrogacy, the highest bidders will presumably become the adoptive parents regardless of suitability, so long as payment of money is permitted.</p><p id="c55e1435-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, the mother’s consent to surrender her child in adoptions is revocable, even after surrender of the child, unless it be to an approved agency, where by regulation there are protections against an ill-advised surrender. In surrogacy, consent occurs so early that no amount of advice would satisfy the potential mother’s need, yet the consent is irrevocable.</p><p id="c55e1436-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-259">p. 259</span>In the scheme contemplated by the surrogacy contract in this case, a middleman, propelled by profit, promotes the sale. Whatever idealism may have motivated any of the participants, the profit motive predominates, permeates, and ultimately governs the transaction. The demand for children is great and the supply small. The availability of contraception, abortion, and the greater willingness of single mothers to bring up their children has led to a shortage of babies offered for adoption. The situation is ripe for the entry of the middleman who will bring some equilibrium into the market by increasing the supply through the use of money.</p><p id="c55e1437-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intimated, but disputed, is the assertion that surrogacy will be used for the benefit of the rich at the expense of the poor. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Market-Inalienability</i>, 100 Harv. L. Rev. 1849, 1930 (1987). In response it is noted that the Sterns are not rich and the Whiteheads not poor. Nevertheless, it is clear to us that it is unlikely that surrogate mothers will be as proportionately numerous among those women in the top twenty percent income bracket as among those in the bottom twenty percent. Put differently, we doubt that infertile couples in the low-income bracket will find upper income surrogates.</p><p id="c55e1438-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The point is made that Mrs. Whitehead agreed to the surrogacy arrangement, supposedly fully understanding the consequences. Putting aside the issue of how compelling her need for money may have been, and how significant her understanding of the consequences, we suggest that her consent is irrelevant. There are, in a civilized society, some things that money cannot buy. In America, we decided long ago that merely because conduct purchased by money was “voluntary” did not mean that it was good or beyond regulation and prohibition. Employers can no longer buy labor at the lowest price they can bargain for, even though that labor is “voluntary,” 29 U.S.C. §206 (1982), or buy women’s labor for less money than paid to men for the same job, 29 U.S.C. §206(d), or purchase the agreement of children to perform oppressive labor, 29 U.S.C. §212, or purchase the agreement of workers to subject themselves to unsafe or unhealthful working conditions, 29 U.S.C. §§651 to 678 (<i>Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970</i>). There are, in short, values that society deems more important than granting to wealth whatever it can buy, be it labor, love, or life. Whether this principle recommends prohibition of surrogacy, which presumably sometimes results in great satisfaction to all of the parties, is not for us to say. We note here only that, under existing law, the fact that Mrs. Whitehead “agreed” to the arrangement is not dispositive.</p><p id="c55e1439-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The surrogacy contract is based on principles that are directly contrary to the objectives of our laws. It guarantees the separation of a child from its mother; it looks to adoption regardless of suitability; it totally ignores the child; it takes the child from the mother regardless of her wishes and her maternal fitness; and it does all of this, it accomplishes all of its goals, through the use of money.</p><p id="c55e143a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond that is the potential degradation of some women that may result from this arrangement. In many cases, of course, surrogacy may bring satisfaction, not only to the infertile couple, but to the surrogate mother herself. The fact, however, that many women may not perceive surrogacy negatively but rather see it as an opportunity does not diminish its potential for devastation to other women.</p><p id="c55e3b4b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="260" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-260">p. 260</span>In sum, the harmful consequences of this surrogacy arrangement appear to us all too palpable. In New Jersey the surrogate mother’s agreement to sell her child is void. Its irrevocability infects the entire contract, as does the money that purports to buy it.</p></div>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c55e3b4d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="c55e3b4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Baby-selling.</b> The contract in <i>Baby M</i> raises a host of legal questions. It is important to distinguish several issues. One question is whether the arrangement constitutes a criminal act in violation of state law prohibiting baby-selling. If it does, the mere fact of entering the contractual arrangement may subject the parties to criminal penalties. A second, and quite different, question is whether the contract is enforceable. It may very well be that the legislature did not intend to impose criminal penalties for surrogacy arrangements — such as those imposed on persons who buy and sell drugs or controlled substances — but that these agreements were unenforceable as a matter of contract law. As the law currently stands, the states do not seem to be treating surrogacy as a crime that would subject the parties to punishment by fine or imprisonment.</p>
<p id="c55e3b4f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Enforcement of surrogacy agreements.</b> The enforceability of surrogacy contracts raises a series of issues.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c55e3b50-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Void or voidable?</b> One possibility is that the courts could hold the contract <b>void as against public policy</b>. This is what the Supreme Court of New Jersey did in <i>Baby M</i>. Under this approach, the court approaches the case as if there were no agreement; the standard rule for settling a custody dispute is “the best interests of the child.” A second possibility is to hold the contract <b>voidable</b> by the birth mother rather than absolutely void. Under this approach, the birth mother — but not the biological father — has the right to reject the contract. If she rejects the contract, custody is determined by the best interests of the child. A mother who was willing to hand over her child pursuant to the surrogacy agreement would be able to do so and would be able to obtain a court judgment ordering the contract parents to pay her the money owed on the agreement.</p>
<p id="c55e3b51-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Damages or specific performance?</b> If the contract is enforceable, then the appropriate remedy for breach must be determined. One possibility is <b>specific performance</b> through an injunction ordering the mother to hand over the child in accordance with the contract terms. Such a result might comport with traditional law in that specific performance is often ordered when an item being sold is unique, such as land or artwork. Children are obviously unique, but should they be considered items for sale? If specific performance is denied, courts may enforce the contract by damages only.</p>
</div>
<p id="c55e3b52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Disagreement in the courts.</b> Like the Supreme Court of New Jersey, other state courts have refused to enforce surrogacy arrangements. <i>See Doe v. Kelley</i>, 307 N.W.2d 438 (Mich. Ct. App. 1981) (interpreting the <i>Michigan Adoption Law</i> to prohibit the exchange of money for surrogacy); <i>R.R. v. M.H.</i>, 689 N.E.2d 790 (Mass. 1998) (contract is void to the extent that it provides compensation to surrogate beyond costs <span title="261" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-261">p. 261</span>incurred in pregnancy and surrogate’s consent to relinquish parental rights not valid until time for effectively granting consent to adoption, four days after the child’s birth).</p>
<p id="c55e3b53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts have held that surrogacy contracts are voidable rather than void per se. The Supreme Court of Kentucky has held that the birth mother in a surrogacy arrangement has the right to void the contract if she changes her mind during pregnancy or immediately after birth. <i>Surrogate Parenting Associates v. Commonwealth ex rel. Armstrong</i>, 704 S.W.2d 209 (Ky. 1986). <i>See also Matter of Adoption of Baby Girl, L.J.</i>, 505 N.Y.S.2d 813 (Surr. Ct. 1986) (holding that surrogate parenting agreements are not void but are voidable if they do not conform with state adoption statutes).</p>
<p id="c55e6164-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of California has held, in contrast, that surrogate mother contracts are specifically enforceable, at least where both the egg and sperm are donated by individuals other than the surrogate mother who bears the child. <i>Johnson v. Calvert</i>, 851 P.2d 776 (Cal. 1993). More broadly, however, the court held that “she who intended to procreate the child — that is, she who intended to bring about the birth of a child that she intended to raise as her own — is the natural mother under California law,” suggesting that such contracts might be enforceable even if the egg were that of the surrogate mother. <i>Id.</i> at 782; <i>see also In re F.T.R.</i>, 833 N.W.2d 634 (Wis. 2013) (enforcing — in a case involving a surrogate who was also the egg donor — custody provisions of surrogacy contract, declining to enforce provisions of contract terminating surrogate’s parental rights, and pleading with the Wisconsin state legislature to address the issue of surrogacy); <i>Doe v. Roe</i>, 717 A.2d 706 (Conn. 1998) (enforcing surrogacy contract over objections of surrogate who was not the egg donor). Should surrogacy arrangements be enforced? If so, by specific performance or by damages? If they should not be enforced, should they be void or voidable? Does the increasing acceptance of same-sex marriage have any bearing on the debate over surrogacy?</p>
<p id="c55e6165-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Surrogacy statutes.</b> A number of states have adopted statutes concerning surrogacy agreements. Some states criminalize the agreements, particularly where they involve the payment of money. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Mich. Comp. Laws §722.859 (prohibiting surrogacy contracts and making it a felony for anyone other than the participating parties to assist in the formation of the contract); <i>see also</i> D.C. Code Ann. §§16-401 to -402; N.Y. Dom. Rel. L. §§121-124 (providing civil penalties for commercial surrogacy contracts); Wash. Rev. Code. §§26.26.101, .210-.260. Numerous countries also ban the practice, including Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Turkey. <i>See</i> Pamela Laufer-Ukeles, <i>Mothering for Money: Regulating Commercial Intimacy</i>, 88 Ind. L.J. 1223, 1225 n.11 (2013). Some statutes merely declare the contracts voidable. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.D. Code §13-18-05. Finally, other states permit the practice, but they typically regulate it very tightly. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Fla. Stat. §63.213 (permitting surrogacy contracts but limiting surrogate to reimbursement for expenses, including living expenses during pregnancy, and permitting surrogate to void promise to give up custody during the 48 hours after birth); N.H. Stat. §§168-B:1-32; Va. Code §20-156. For a comprehensive survey of state surrogacy laws, see Darra L. Hofman, <i>Mama’s Baby, Daddy’s Maybe</i>, 35 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 449 (2009).</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c55e6167-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Anna [Johnson] and some commentators have expressed concern that surrogacy contracts tend to exploit or dehumanize women, especially women of lower economic status. Anna’s objections center around the psychological harm she asserts may result from the gestator’s relinquishing the child to whom she has given birth. Some have also cautioned that the practice of surrogacy may encourage society to view children as commodities, subject to trade at their parents’ will.</p>
<p id="c55e6168-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are unpersuaded that gestational surrogacy arrangements are so likely to cause the untoward results Anna cites as to demand their invalidation on public policy grounds. Although common sense suggests that women of lesser means serve as surrogate mothers more often than do wealthy women, there has been no proof that surrogacy contracts exploit poor women to any greater degree than economic necessity in general exploits them by inducing them to accept lower-paid or otherwise undesirable employment. We are likewise unpersuaded by the claim that surrogacy will foster the attitude that children are mere commodities; no evidence is offered to support it. The limited data available seem to reflect an absence of significant adverse effects of surrogacy on all participants.</p>
<p id="c55e6169-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument that a woman cannot knowingly and intelligently agree to gestate and deliver a baby for intending parents carries overtones of the reasoning that for centuries prevented women from attaining equal economic rights and professional status under the law. To resurrect this view is both to foreclose a personal and economic choice on the part of the surrogate mother, and to deny intending parents what may be their only means of procreating a child of their own genetic stock. Certainly in the present case it cannot seriously be argued that Anna, a licensed vocational nurse who had done well in school and who had previously borne a child, lacked the intellectual wherewithal or life experience necessary to make an informed decision to enter into the surrogacy contract.</p>

Field, <i>Surrogate Motherhood: The Legal and Human Issues</i> 151 (1990) (arguing that either surrogate mother contracts should not be enforceable at all or the surrogate mother should have a right to change her mind for some time after the child is born); Patricia J. Williams, <i>The Alchemy of Race and Rights</i> 217-219, 224-226 (1991) (arguing that enforcing a contract signed at a discrete point of time may wind up “enslav[ing]” the one who signed it by depriving a surrogate mother of the power to exit an arrangement she comes to understand as extraordinarily harmful to her).</p>
<p id="c55e616f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others have argued that such contracts should be presumptively enforceable. For example, Professor Pamela Laufer-Ukeles has offered a qualified defense of surrogacy arrangements:</p>

<p id="c55e8880-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="263" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-263">p. 263</span>[T]he vast majority of surrogate mothers do not attest to bonding with the babies they gestate to the extent that many predicted and was evident in the case of Baby M. While most surrogates assert that parting with the baby is a difficult separation, it does not appear to be as traumatic as expected. Indeed, given the thousands of surrogacy contracts that are entered into each year, “ ‘the lack of litigation is remarkable.’ ” When asked, surrogate mothers do not generally indicate that the babies belong to them; rather, they feel they are providing a meaningful and valuable service for the intended parents. While this appears to be true for both gestational and traditional surrogates, it seems especially true for gestational surrogates who do not have a genetic connection to the fetus. Gestational surrogates report to heavily emphasize genetics and consider the baby in the womb to be someone else’s based on genetic affiliation. Whether or not one believes that genetic affiliation between intended parents and the baby does or should make a significant difference in the permissibility of surrogacy or in identifying legal motherhood, studies suggest that the lack of genetic affiliation matters to gestational surrogates (but apparently not to traditional surrogates) and facilitates the process for them. . . . </p>
<p id="c55e8881-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Selling one’s gestational services seems to be . . . more personal, involved, and implicating of bodily integrity than housekeeping, but not as potentially harmful as agreeing to undergo unproven drug therapies for high levels of compensation. Gestation is a condition, not an irreplaceable body part. And, with modern medicine, gestation is no more dangerous than many other activities that are legal. Still, it is a commitment of a bodily function, long-term and involved, that does not mirror typical jobs. Thus, there is room to be concerned about the autonomy of the surrogate without paternalistically denying her right to engage in their services altogether.</p>

Because the failure rate of the procedure is very high, the practice is to attempt to fertilize a number of eggs, allow them to begin dividing, and to implant some of the fertilized ova. Those that are not used initially are preserved for later use if the current implantation fails to result in a pregnancy. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there are more than 600,000 frozen embryos in the United States. <i>See</i> Anna Stolley Persky, <i>Deep Freeze</i>, A.B.A. J., June 2016, at 47, 49.

<p id="c55eaf9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Competing rights.</b> Courts that have ruled on the matter usually characterize disputes over preembryos as conflicts between the right of one party to procreate and the right of the other party not to be forced to become a parent against his or her will. The latter right usually trumps. </p>
<p id="c55eafa0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Davis</i>, the court of appeals reversed on rights grounds. “It would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional principles to order Mary Sue to implant these fertilized ova against her will. It would be equally repugnant to order Junior to bear the psychological, if not the legal, consequences of paternity against his will.” 1990 WL 130807, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990). Do you agree that it would be <i>equally</i> repugnant?</p>
<p id="c55eafa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the time <i>Davis</i> reached the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mary Sue Davis (now Mary Sue Stowe) had remarried and no longer wanted to use the preembryos herself but sought authority to donate them to a childless couple. Her ex-husband, also now remarried, vehemently opposed such a donation and preferred to see the preembryos destroyed. Agreeing with the appeals court’s resolution of the conflict between the right to procreate and the right to avoid procreation, the court held that Junior Davis’s interest in avoiding unwanted parenthood should prevail over Mary Sue Stowe’s interest in donating the preembryos to avoid the burden of knowing that the lengthy and invasive procedures she had undergone were futile. The court further noted that the case would be closer if she were seeking to use the preembryos herself, “but only if she could not achieve parenthood by any other reasonable means.” The court concluded, 842 S.W.2d at 604:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c55eafa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinarily, the party wishing to avoid procreation should prevail, assuming that the other party has a reasonable possibility of achieving parenthood by means other than use of the preembryos in question. If no other reasonable alternatives exist, then the argument in favor of using the preembryos to achieve pregnancy should be considered. However, if the party seeking control of the preembryos intends merely to donate them to another couple, the objecting party obviously has the greater interest and should prevail.</p>
</div>
<p id="c55eafa3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>J.B. v. M.B.</i>, 751 A.2d 613 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000), the ex-husband in a divorce proceeding sought control of preembryos for the purpose of impregnating a woman if he later developed a new relationship or for donation to an infertile couple. The ex-wife objected and wanted the preembryos destroyed. In ruling for the ex-wife, the court relied on a rights analysis mirroring that in <i>Davis, id.</i> at 618-619:</p>

The conflict, however, is more apparent than real. Recognition and enforcement of the wife’s right would not seriously impair the husband’s right to procreate. Though his right to procreate using the wife’s egg would be terminated, he retains the capacity to father children.</p>
<p id="c55ed6b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, enforcing the husband’s right to procreate using the embryos at issue in this case could result in the birth of the wife’s biological child. Even if the wife were relieved of the financial and custodial responsibility for her child, the fact that her biological child would exist in an environment controlled by strangers is understandably unacceptable to the wife.</p>
</div>
<p id="c55ed6b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On review, 783 A.2d 707 (N.J. 2001), the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s rights analysis, <i>id.</i> at 717:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c55ed6b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">M.B.’s right to procreate is not lost if he is denied an opportunity to use or donate the preembryos. M.B. is already a father and is able to become a father to additional children, whether through natural procreation or further in vitro fertilization. In contrast, J.B.’s right not to procreate may be lost through attempted use or through donation of the preembryos. Implantation, if successful, would result in the birth of her biological child and could have life-long emotional and psychological repercussions.</p>
</div>
<p id="c55ed6b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike the courts in <i>Davis</i> and <i>J.B.</i>, the trial court in <i>Kass</i> expressed a different conception of the rights involved. Under this analysis, the woman would always have control of the preembryos in a divorce proceeding despite her husband’s objection, on the ground that once the eggs were fertilized, the husband had no right to force the wife to stop the pregnancy, <i>id.</i> at *3:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c55ed6b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Just as an in vivo husband’s “right to avoid procreation” is waived and ceases to exist after intercourse in a coital reproduction, such right should be deemed waived and non-existent after his participation in an in vitro program. Upon entering he knows, or should have known, that technology is such that the possibility and probability of a delayed implantation are very real. Absent some indication of a contrary intent, the agreement to participate, if it does not expressly provide for such an eventuality, must be deemed an agreement to permit a delayed implantation.</p>
</div>
<p id="c55ed6ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In reversing, the appellate division stated that the trial court “committed a fundamental error in equating a prospective mother’s decision whether to undergo implantation of prezygotes which are the product of her participation in an [in vitro fertilization] procedure with a pregnant woman’s right to exercise exclusive control over the fate of her []fetus.” 663 N.Y.S.2d 581, 585 (App. Div. 1997), <i>aff’d</i>, 696 N.E.2d 174 (N.Y. 1998). </p>
<p id="c55ed6bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, while generally favoring the right not to procreate over the right to procreate, some courts have carved out an exception in situations where the frozen embryos would constitute the last opportunity for the party to procreate. In <i>Szafranski v. Dunston</i>, 34 N.E.3d 1132 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015), for example, the Illinois Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s grant of custody of frozen embryos to the plaintiff’s ex-girlfriend because, among other things, the embryos represented her “last and only opportunity to have a biological child with her own eggs.” <i>Id.</i> at 1137. </p>

In recent cases, the Thomas More Society, an anti-abortion group, has filed amicus briefs arguing that embryos are human lives and should be treated as such. Accordingly, it argues, courts should decide custody in the same way they would for any other child-custody case: by considering what decision would be in the child’s best interests. <i>See</i> Persky, <i>supra</i>, at 53. Which rights analysis do you agree with? Can you think of an alternative way to frame the issue? </p>
<p id="c55ed6bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Biological parenthood is central to the prevailing rights analysis described above. For instance, in <i>Litowitz v. Litowitz</i>, 10 P.3d 1086 (Wash. Ct. App.), <i>rev’d</i>, 48 P.3d 261 (Wash. 2000), Becky Litowitz could not provide the eggs herself because of a hysterectomy. The couple hired a third party to donate eggs, subsequently fertilized by David Litowitz’s sperm. After a divorce, Becky sought to have the eggs implanted in a surrogate to produce a child she would raise. However, the court awarded control to David, who wanted to donate the eggs to an infertile couple in another state. Because Becky’s own eggs had not been used to produce the preembryos, the court reasoned that David’s disposing of the preembryos as he wished would not infringe on her right not to procreate. Conversely, the court ruled that Becky’s desired implantation of the preembryos in a surrogate to produce a child Becky would raise <i>would</i> infringe on David’s right not to procreate. Do you agree with this result? Is it fair to allow one party to invoke his or her right not to procreate to prevent the other party from using the preembryos to beget a child, and then donate the preembryos to a couple in another state? Should the right not to procreate govern only when the party invoking it actually seeks <i>not</i> to procreate, rather than to procreate elsewhere? What rights should the woman who donated the eggs have if she chooses to assert them? Note that the trial court’s decision was reversed on appeal because the parties’ contract with the agency provided for destruction of the preembryos if they were not implanted within five years.</p>
<p id="c55ed6be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Contracts regarding preembryos.</b> If the parties sign an agreement regarding disposition of the preembryos in the event of a dispute, should the agreement be enforced? Courts have generally held that the wishes of the parties should be honored if ascertainable. <i>See, e.g., Kass</i>, 663 N.Y.S.2d at 590 (“where the parties have indicated their mutual intent regarding the disposition of the pre-zygotes in the event of the occurrence of a contingency that decision must be scrupulously honored”); In re <i>Marriage of Dahl</i>, 194 P.3d 834 (Or. Ct. App. 2008) (treating right to dispose of embryos as marital property and looking to prior agreement by the couple regarding disposition of the embryos); <i>In re Litowitz</i>, 48 P.3d 261 (Wash. 2002) (enforcing contract between husband and wife that fertilized embryos would be thawed out and destroyed if they were not implanted within five years); <i>Roman v. Roman</i>, 193 S.W.3d 40 (Tex. Ct. App. 2006) (enforcing an agreement to dispose of frozen embryos entered into by a divorcing couple before they created the embryos and refusing to allow the wife to keep the embryos as part of the division of community property).</p>
<p id="c55efdcf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does it make sense to “scrupulously honor” the intent of the parties in this context? Is the court truly refraining from interfering with the parties’ expressed wishes? Isn’t the court interfering with one party’s wishes no matter how it decides? </p>

Should all contracts regarding the disposition of preembryos be invalid? Or should they be enforced when they do not result in one party becoming a parent against his or her will?</p>
<p id="c55efdd1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a lower New Jersey court agreed with the Massachusetts rule, <i>J.B. v. M.B.</i>, 751 A.2d 613 (N.J. Super.

How is this rule different from the one promulgated in <i>A.Z. v. B.Z.</i>? Is the “right of either party to change his or her mind” tantamount to a blanket invalidation of all contracts regarding the disposition of preembryos?</p>
<p id="c55efdd2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As with surrogacy contracts, some states have stepped in with legislation. A few states prohibit the sale of human embryos under any circumstances. <i>See</i> Fla. Stat. §873.05; Ind. Stat. §35-46-5-3(a); La. Stat. §122. Others single out the sale of embryos for research for legal prohibition. <i>See</i> Conn. Stat. §19a-32d; Mass. Gen. Laws §111L-8. Why might a state prohibit the sale of embryos for research but allow their sale for other purposes? A number of states also have enacted statutes that attempt to prevent disputes over preembryos. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code §125315 (requiring fertility treatment providers to present patients with a form setting forth options for the disposition of stored embryos in the event of, for example, death or divorce); Tex.

Consider the fact that the <i>result</i> in all the cases is the same: none of the courts have allowed preembryos to be implanted over the objection of a party who wants the preembryos discarded. Are the courts using different arguments to achieve the same result? Is there some underlying or hidden reason for this uniform result? Or is the uniformity of result a coincidence?</p>

<p id="c55efddd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff is John Moore (Moore), who underwent treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA Medical Center). The five defendants are: (1) Dr. David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who <span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-269">p. 269</span>attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; (2) the Regents of the University of California (Regents), who own and operate the university; (3) Shirley G. Quan [(Quan)], a researcher employed by the Regents; (4) Genetics Institute, Inc. (Genetics Institute); and (5) Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).</p>
<p id="c55efdde-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, shortly after he learned that he had hairy-cell leukemia. After hospitalizing Moore and “withdraw[ing] extensive amounts of blood, bone marrow aspirate, and other bodily substances,” Golde confirmed that diagnosis. At this time all defendants, including Golde, were aware that “certain blood products and blood components were of great value in a number of commercial and scientific efforts” and that access to a patient whose blood contained these substances would provide “competitive, commercial, and scientific advantages.”</p>
<p id="c55efddf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 8, 1976, Golde recommended that Moore’s spleen be removed. Golde informed Moore “that he had reason to fear for his life, and that the proposed splenectomy operation . . . was necessary to slow down the progress of his disease.” Based upon Golde’s representations, Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the splenectomy.</p>
<p id="c55f24f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the operation, Golde and Quan “formed the intent and made arrangements to obtain portions of [Moore’s] spleen following its removal” and to take them to a separate research unit. Golde gave written instructions to this effect on October 18 and 19, 1976. These research activities “were not intended to have . . . any relation to [Moore’s] medical . . . care.” However, neither Golde nor Quan informed Moore of their plans to conduct this research or requested his permission. Surgeons at UCLA Medical Center, whom the complaint does not name as defendants, removed Moore’s spleen on October 20, 1976.</p>
<p id="c55f24f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore returned to the UCLA Medical Center several times between November 1976 and September 1983. He did so at Golde’s direction and based upon representations “that such visits were necessary and required for his health and well-being, and based upon the trust inherent in and by virtue of the physician-patient relationship. . . .” On each of these visits Golde withdrew additional samples of “blood, blood serum, skin, bone marrow aspirate, and sperm.” On each occasion Moore travelled to the UCLA Medical Center from his home in Seattle because he had been told that the procedures were to be performed only there and only under Golde’s direction.</p>
<p id="c55f24f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court then quoted plaintiff’s complaint:] “In fact, [however,] throughout the period of time that [Moore] was under [Golde’s] care and treatment, . . . the defendants were actively involved in a number of activities which they concealed from [Moore]. . . .” Specifically, defendants were conducting research on Moore’s cells and planned to “benefit financially and competitively . . . [by exploiting the cells] and [their] exclusive access to [the cells] by virtue of [Golde’s] on-going physician-patient relationship. . . .”</p>
<p id="c55f24f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sometime before August 1979, Golde established a cell line from Moore’s T-lymphocytes. On January 30, 1981, the Regents applied for a patent on the cell line, listing Golde and Quan as inventors. “[B]y virtue of an established policy . . . , [the] Regents, Golde, and Quan would share in any royalties or profits . . . arising out of [the] patent.” The patent issued on March 20, 1984, naming Golde and Quan as the <span title="270" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-270">p. 270</span>inventors of the cell line and the Regents as the assignee of the patent.

<p id="c55f24f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Regents’ patent also covers various methods for using the cell line to produce lymphokines. Moore admits in his complaint that “the true clinical potential of each of the lymphokines . . . [is] difficult to predict, [but] . . . competing commercial firms in these relevant fields have published reports in biotechnology industry periodicals predicting a potential market of approximately 3.01 Billion Dollars by the year 1990 for a whole range of [such lymphokines]. . . .”</p>
<p id="c55f24f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the Regents’ assistance, Golde negotiated agreements for commercial development of the cell line and products to be derived from it. Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde “became a paid consultant” and “acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock.” Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the Regents “at least $330,000 over three years, including a pro-rata share of [Golde’s] salary and fringe benefits, in exchange for . . . exclusive access to the materials and research performed” on the cell line and products derived from it. On June 4, 1982, Sandoz “was added to the agreement,” and compensation payable to Golde and the Regents was increased by $110,000. “[T]hroughout this period, . . . Quan spent as much as 70 [percent] of her time working for [the] Regents on research” related to the cell line.</p>

<p id="c55f24f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Lack of Informed Consent</i></p>
<p id="c55f24f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore repeatedly alleges that Golde failed to disclose the extent of his research and economic interests in Moore’s cells before obtaining consent to the medical procedures by which the cells were extracted. These allegations, in our view, state a cause of action against Golde for invading a legally protected interest of his patient. This cause of action can properly be characterized either as the breach of a fiduciary duty to disclose facts material to the patient’s consent or, alternatively, as the performance of medical procedures without first having obtained the patient’s informed consent.</p>
<p id="c55f24f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B. Conversion</i></p>
<p id="c55f24fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore also attempts to characterize the invasion of his rights as a conversion — a tort that protects against interference with possessory and ownership interests in personal property. He theorizes that he continued to own his cells following their removal from his body, at least for the purpose of directing their use, and that he never consented to their use in potentially lucrative medical research. Thus, to complete Moore’s argument, defendants’ unauthorized use of his cells constitutes a conversion. As a result of the alleged conversion, Moore claims a proprietary interest in each of the products that any of the defendants might ever create from his cells or the patented cell line.</p>

<p id="c55f4c0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since Moore clearly did not expect to retain possession of his cells following their removal, to sue for their conversion he must have retained an ownership interest in them.</p>

One line of cases involves unwanted publicity. These opinions hold that every person has a proprietary interest in his own likeness and that unauthorized, business use of a likeness is redressible as a tort.</p>
<p id="c55f4c0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moore . . . argues that “[i]f the courts have found a sufficient proprietary interest in one’s persona, how could one not have a right in one’s own genetic material, something far more profoundly the essence of one’s human uniqueness than a name or a face?” However, . . . the goal and result of defendants’ efforts has been to manufacture lymphokines. Lymphokines, unlike a name or a face, have the same molecular structure in every human being and the same, important functions in every human being’s immune system. Moreover, the particular genetic material which is responsible for the natural production of lymphokines, and which defendants use to manufacture lymphokines in the laboratory, is also the same in every person; it is no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin.</p>
<p id="c55f4c0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Moore also appeals to privacy cases holding that patients have the right to refuse medical treatment because each person has a right to determine what shall be done with his or her own body. However, we can protect privacy and personal dignity by requiring disclosure under fiduciary duty and informed consent doctrines, rather than] accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those interests amounts to a conversion of personal property.</p>
<p id="c55f4c10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next consideration that makes Moore’s claim of ownership problematic is California statutory law, which drastically limits a patient’s control over excised cells [by regulating disposal of human tissues to protect public health and safety. <i>Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code</i> §§7001, 7054.4]. By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to “property” or “ownership” for purposes of conversion law.</p>
<p id="c55f4c11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the subject matter of the Regents’ patent — the patented cell line and the products derived from it — cannot be Moore’s property. This is because the patented cell line is both factually and legally distinct from the cells taken from Moore’s body. Federal law permits the patenting of organisms that represent the product of “human ingenuity,” but not naturally occurring organisms. <i>Diamond v. Chakrabarty</i>, 447 U.S. 303, 309-310 (1980). Human cell lines are patentable because “[l]ong-term adaptation and growth of human tissues and cells in culture is difficult — often considered an art . . . ,” and the probability of success is low. It is this inventive effort that patent law rewards, not the discovery of naturally occurring raw materials. Thus, Moore’s allegations that he owns the cell line and the products derived from it are inconsistent with the patent, which constitutes an authoritative determination that the cell line is the product of invention.</p>
<p id="c55f4c12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>2. Should Conversion Liability Be Extended?</i></p>
<p id="c55f4c13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the relevant policy considerations, two are of overriding importance. The first is protection of a competent patient’s right to make autonomous medical decisions. . . . This policy weighs in favor of providing a remedy to patients when physicians act with <span title="272" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-272">p. 272</span>undisclosed motives that may affect their professional judgment. The second important policy consideration is that we not threaten with disabling civil liability innocent parties who are engaged in socially useful activities, such as researchers who have no reason to believe that their use of a particular cell sample is, or may be, against a donor’s wishes.</p>
<p id="c55f4c14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Research on human cells plays a critical role in medical research. This is so because researchers are increasingly able to isolate naturally occurring, medically useful biological substances and to produce useful quantities of such substances through genetic engineering. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Products developed through biotechnology that have already been approved for marketing in this country include treatments and tests for leukemia, cancer, diabetes, dwarfism, hepatitis-B, kidney transplant rejection, emphysema, osteoporosis, ulcers, anemia, infertility, and gynecological tumors, to name but a few.</p>
<p id="c55f4c15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extension of conversion law into this area will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials. Thousands of human cell lines already exist in tissue repositories, such as the American Type Culture Collection and those operated by the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society. These repositories respond to tens of thousands of requests for samples annually. Since the patent office requires the holders of patents on cell lines to make samples available to anyone, many patent holders place their cell lines in repositories to avoid the administrative burden of responding to requests. At present, human cell lines are routinely copied and distributed to other researchers for experimental purposes, usually free of charge. This exchange of scientific materials, which still is relatively free and efficient, will surely be compromised if each cell sample becomes the potential subject matter of a lawsuit.</p>
<p id="c55f4c16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To expand liability by extending conversion law into this area would have a broad impact. The House Committee on Science and Technology of the United States Congress found that “49 percent of the researchers at medical institutions surveyed used human tissues or cells in their research.” Many receive grants from the National Institutes of Health for this work. In addition, “there are nearly 350 commercial biotechnology firms in the United States actively engaged in biotechnology research and commercial product development and approximately 25 to 30 percent appear to be engaged in research to develop a human therapeutic or diagnostic reagent. . . . Most, but not all, of the human therapeutic products are derived from human tissues and cells, or human cell lines or cloned genes.”</p>

Although in this case defendants did not disregard a specific directive from plaintiff with regard to the future use of his body part, the complaint alleges that, before the body part was removed, defendants intentionally withheld material information that they were under an obligation to disclose to plaintiff and that was necessary for his exercise of control over the body part; the complaint also alleges that defendants withheld such information in order to appropriate the control over the future use of such body part for their own economic benefit. If these allegations are true, defendants clearly improperly interfered with plaintiff’s right in his body part at a time when he had the authority to determine the future use of such part, thereby misappropriating plaintiff’s right of control for their own advantage. Under these circumstances, the complaint fully satisfies the established requirements of a conversion cause of action.</p>
<p id="c55f732f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he majority’s fear that the availability of a conversion remedy will restrict access to existing cell lines is unrealistic.

If, as the majority suggests, the great bulk of the value of a cell line patent and derivative products is attributable to the efforts of medical researchers and drug companies, rather than to the “raw materials” taken from a patient, the patient’s damages will be correspondingly limited, and innocent medical researchers and drug manufacturers will retain the considerable economic benefits resulting from their own work.</p>

But the majority’s rejection of plaintiff’s conversion cause of action does not mean that body parts may not be bought or sold for research or commercial purposes or that no private individual or entity may benefit economically from the fortuitous value of plaintiff’s diseased cells. Far from elevating these biological materials above the marketplace, the majority’s holding simply bars plaintiff, the source of the cells, from obtaining the benefit of the cells’ value, but permits defendants, who allegedly obtained the cells from plaintiff by improper means, to retain and exploit the full economic value of their ill-gotten gains free of their ordinary common law liability for conversion.</p>

But the same bundle of rights does not attach to all forms of property. For a variety of policy reasons, the law limits or even forbids the exercise of certain rights over certain forms of property. For example, both law and contract may limit the right of an owner of real property to use his parcel as he sees fit. Owners of various forms of personal property may likewise be subject to restrictions on the time, place, and manner of their use.

<p id="c55f9a47-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In each of the foregoing instances, the limitation or prohibition diminishes the bundle of rights that would otherwise attach to the property, yet what remains is still deemed in law to be a protectible property interest. [Moore] at least had the right to do with his own tissue whatever the defendants did with it: <i>i.e.</i>, he could have contracted <span title="275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-275">p. 275</span>with researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the vast commercial potential of his tissue and its products. Defendants certainly believe that their right to do the foregoing is not barred by section 7054.4 and is a significant property right. . . . The Court of Appeal summed up the point by observing that “Defendants’ position that plaintiff cannot own his tissue, but that they can, is fraught with irony.” It is also legally untenable.</p>
<p id="c55f9a48-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Nor does the patent on the cell line preclude plaintiff’s property claim.] To be sure, the patent granted defendants the exclusive right to make, use, or sell the invention for a period of 17 years. But Moore does not assert any such right for himself. Rather, he seeks to show that he is entitled, in fairness and equity, to some share in the profits that defendants have made and will make from their commercial exploitation of the Mo cell line. I do not question that the cell line is primarily the product of defendants’ inventive effort. Yet likewise no one can question Moore’s crucial contribution to the invention — an invention named, ironically, after him: but for the cells of Moore’s body taken by defendants, there would have been no Mo cell line.</p>

First, our society acknowledges a profound ethical imperative to respect the human body as the physical and temporal expression of the unique human persona. One manifestation of that respect is our prohibition against direct abuse of the body by torture or other forms of cruel or unusual punishment. Another is our prohibition against indirect abuse of the body by its economic exploitation for the sole benefit of another person. The most abhorrent form of such exploitation, of course, was the institution of slavery. Lesser forms, such as indentured servitude or even debtor’s prison, have also disappeared. Yet their specter haunts the laboratories and boardrooms of today’s biotechnological research-industrial complex. It arises wherever scientists or industrialists claim, as defendants claim here, the right to appropriate and exploit a patient’s tissue for their sole economic benefit — the right, in other words, to freely mine or harvest valuable physical properties of the patient’s body: “. . . Such research tends to treat the human body as a commodity — a means to a profitable end. The dignity and sanctity with which we regard the human whole, body as well as mind and soul, are absent when we allow researchers to further their own interests without the patient’s participation by using a patient’s cells as the basis for a marketable product.” Danforth, <i>Cells, Sales, &amp; Royalties: The Patient’s Right to a Portion of the Profits</i>, 6 Yale L. &amp; Pol’y Rev. 179, 190 (1988).</p>

Our society values fundamental fairness in dealings between its members, and condemns the unjust enrichment of any member at the expense of another. This is particularly true when, as here, the parties are not in equal bargaining positions. We are repeatedly told that the commercial products of the biotechnological revolution “hold the promise of tremendous profit.” In the case at bar, for example, the complaint alleges that the market for the kinds of proteins produced by the Mo cell line was predicted to exceed $3 billion by 1990. These profits are currently shared exclusively between the biotechnology industry and the universities that support that industry.</p>

While he may be a silent partner, his contribution to the venture is absolutely crucial: . . . but for the cells of Moore’s body taken by defendants there would have been no Mo cell line at all. Yet defendants deny that Moore is entitled to any share whatever in the proceeds of this cell line. This is both inequitable and immoral.</p>

Cleveland</i>, 923 F.2d 477 (6th Cir. 1991), plaintiff Deborah Brotherton alleged that defendants, in the course of performing an autopsy, removed her deceased husband’s corneas for use as anatomical gifts without her consent. The court noted that “Ohio Rev. Code §2108.02(B), as part of the <i>Uniform Anatomical Gift Act</i> governing gifts of organs and tissues for research or transplants, granted her the right to control the disposal of Steven Brotherton’s body.” It held that “the aggregate of rights granted by the state of Ohio to Deborah Brotherton rises to the level of a ‘legitimate claim of entitlement’ in Steven Brotherton’s body, including his corneas,” and that this was sufficient to establish a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment’s prohibition on deprivations of property without due process of law. <i>See also Whaley v. County of Tuscola</i>, 58 F.3d 1111 (6th Cir. 1991) (recognizing a property interest in body parts and refusing to dismiss lawsuits by relatives of deceased persons whose eyeballs and corneas had been removed without permission by a pathology assistant at a county hospital).

Lacks’s surviving family members were not told about the use of her cells, and did not even discover that the cells were in widespread use until two decades later. Lacks’s entire genetic code was even sequenced and published without the knowledge or approval of surviving family members.

<p id="c55fe87d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complaint challenges the constitutionality of the ban on compensation for human organs in the National Organ Transplant Act, as applied to bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p id="c55fe87e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some plaintiffs are parents of sick children who have diseases such as leukemia and a rare type of anemia, which can be fatal without bone marrow transplants. Another plaintiff is a physician and medical school professor, and an expert in bone marrow <span title="278" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-278">p. 278</span>transplantation. He says that at least one out of five of his patients dies because no matching bone marrow donor can be found, and many others have complications when scarcity of matching donors compels him to use imperfectly matched donors. One plaintiff is a parent of mixed race children, for whom sufficiently matched donors are especially scarce, because mixed race persons typically have the rarest marrow cell types. One plaintiff is an African-American man suffering from leukemia who received a bone marrow transplant from his sister. She was an imperfect match and, though the transplant saved his life, he continues to suffer from life-threatening and disabling complications on account of the slight genetic mismatch.</p>
<p id="c55fe87f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another plaintiff is a California nonprofit corporation that seeks to operate a program incentivizing bone marrow donations. The corporation proposes to offer $3,000 awards in the form of scholarships, housing allowances, or gifts to charities selected by donors, initially to minority and mixed race donors of bone marrow cells, who are likely to have the rarest marrow cell type. The corporation, MoreMarrowDonors.org, alleges that it cannot launch this program because the National Organ Transplant Act criminalizes payment of compensation for organs, and classifies bone marrow as an organ.</p>
<p id="c55fe880-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We generally use the word “marrow” to refer to the soft, fatty material in the central cavities of big bones, what some people suck out of beef bones. Bone marrow is the body’s blood manufacturing factory. Bone marrow transplants enable sick patients, whose own blood cells need to be killed to save their lives, to produce new blood cells. For example, patients with leukemia, which is cancer of the blood or bone marrow, may need chemotherapy or radiation to kill the cancer cells in their blood. The treatments kill the white blood cells essential to their immune systems. The patients will die if the killed cells are not quickly replaced with healthy cells. And they cannot be replaced without the stem cells, which we describe below, that can mature into white blood cells. These stem cells can only be obtained through bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p id="c55fe881-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until about twenty years ago, bone marrow was extracted from donors’ bones by “aspiration.” Long needles, thick enough to suck out the soft, fatty marrow, were inserted into the cavities of the anesthetized donor’s hip bones. These are large bones with big central cavities full of marrow. Aspiration is a painful, unpleasant procedure for the donor. It requires hospitalization and general or local anesthesia, and involves commensurate risks.</p>
<p id="c55fe882-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most blood stem cells stay in the bone marrow cavity and grow into mature blood cells there, before passing into the blood vessels. But some blood stem cells flow into and circulate in the bloodstream before they mature. These are called “peripheral” blood stem cells, “peripheral” meaning outside the central area of the body. [A] new bone marrow donation technique, developed during the past twenty years, is called “peripheral blood stem cell apheresis.” “Apheresis” means the removal or separation of something. [W]ith no need for sedatives or anesthesia, a needle is inserted into the donor’s vein. Blood is withdrawn from the vein and filtered through an apheresis machine to extract the blood stem cells. The remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor’s vein. The blood stem cells extracted in the apheresis method are replaced by the donor’s bone marrow in three to six weeks. Complications for the donor are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p id="c55fe883-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-279">p. 279</span>The main difference between an ordinary blood donation and apheresis is that instead of just filling up a plastic bag with whole blood, the donor sits for some hours in a recliner while the blood passes through the apheresis machine. When used to separate out and collect hematopoietic stem cells from the donor’s bloodstream, apheresis is called “peripheral blood stem cell apheresis” or a “bone marrow donation.”</p>
<p id="c55fe884-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All donations from another person, except for one’s identical twin, produce at least some graft-versus-host disease in the recipient, but the closer the genetic match, the less disease. Matching is easy in ordinary blood transfusions, because there are only four basic blood types. But there are millions of marrow cell types, so good matches are hard to find. The more diverse the patient’s genetic heritage, the rarer the match. For example, African-Americans have especially great difficulty finding a compatible unrelated donor, as they tend to have a mix of African, Caucasian, and Native-American genes, and fewer potential donors are registered in the national civilian registry.</p>
<p id="c55fe885-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The establishment of this registry, the National Marrow Donor Program, which is funded by the federal government to assist in finding matches, was an important aspect of the statute at issue here. But even with this registry, good matches often cannot be found. And even when a good match is found in the registry, tracking down the potential donor from what may be an outdated address may be impossible to accomplish in time to save the patient’s life — assuming the potential donor is willing to go through with the process when found.</p>
<p id="c55fe886-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff nonprofit proposes to mitigate this matching problem by using a financial incentive. The idea is that the financial incentive will induce more potential donors to sign up, stay in touch so that they can be located when necessary, and go through with the donations. The nonprofit plans to focus its attention initially on minority and mixed race donors, because their marrow cell types are rarer. The financial incentives would be $3,000 in scholarships, housing allowances, or gifts to charities of the donor’s choice, which the nonprofit acknowledges would be “valuable consideration” under the statutory prohibition.</p>
<p id="c55fe887-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue that the National Organ Transplant Act, as applied to  the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p id="c5600f98-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Analysis</i></p>
<p id="c5600f99-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The core of plaintiffs’ argument is that there is no rational basis for allowing compensation for blood, sperm, and egg donations, while disallowing compensation for bone marrow donations, because bone marrow donations can now be accomplished through apheresis without removing marrow, and the donor’s body quickly regenerates the donated stem cells. Since the distinction, they argue, is without a rational basis, it violates the Equal Protection Clause, despite highly deferential “rational basis” review.</p>
<p id="c5600f9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Attorney General responds that the statute plainly classifies “bone marrow” as an organ for which compensation is prohibited, and that the congressional determination is indeed rational. The statute makes it a felony “to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation.” And it defines the term “human organ” to include “bone marrow.” Ergo, the statute expressly prohibits compensating bone marrow donors. According <span title="280" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-280">p. 280</span>to the government’s brief, Congress took the view that “human body parts should not be viewed as commodities,” and had several policy reasons for disallowing compensation to donors, which suffice to serve as a rational basis for the prohibition.</p>
<p id="c5600f9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs address their arguments largely to the peripheral blood stem cell apheresis method of extracting hematopoietic stem cells, but their complaint appears to challenge the prohibition on bone marrow transplants regardless of method. They do not, in their complaint or their brief, confine their challenge to transplants by means of apheresis. They apparently propose to give compensated donors the choice between aspiration and apheresis. To the extent that plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the compensation ban on bone marrow donation by the old aspiration method — where a long needle is inserted into the cavity of the hip bone to extract the soft, fatty marrow — the challenge must fail.</p>
<p id="c5600f9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statute says that the term “human organ” includes “bone marrow.” It is irrelevant that the legislative history indicates that Congress viewed certain types of regenerable tissue, such as blood, as falling outside the statutory definition of “human organ.” [T]he statute does not say that compensation is permitted for organs or body parts that regenerate and prohibited for those that do not. Nor is the statute consistent with such a construction. The statute defines the liver “or any subpart thereof” as an organ for which compensation is prohibited. The drafters doubtless knew that a partial resection of a liver can yield a donation that will save the recipient’s life, and that the donor’s liver will grow back. So the statute does expressly prohibit compensation for at least one explicitly denoted “human organ” that will regenerate.</p>
<p id="c5600f9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for whether the distinction between the organs or other body substances for which compensation is permitted and those for which it is prohibited has a rational basis, there are two classes of rational basis here: policy concerns and philosophical concerns. The policy concerns are obvious. Congress may have been concerned that if donors could be paid, rich patients or the medical industry might induce poor people to sell their organs, even when the transplant would create excessive medical risk, pain, or disability for the donor. Or, looking from the other end, Congress might have been concerned that every last cent could be extracted from sick patients needful of transplants, by well-matched potential donors making “your money or your life” offers. The existing commerce in organs extracted by force or fraud by organ thieves might be stimulated by paying for donations. Compensation to donors might also degrade the quality of the organ supply, by inducing potential donors to lie about their medical histories in order to make their organs marketable. Plaintiffs argue that a $3,000 housing subsidy, scholarship, or charitable donation is too small an amount to create a risk of any of these evils, but for a lot of people that could amount to three to six months’ rent.</p>
<p id="c5600f9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress may have had philosophical as well as policy reasons for prohibiting compensation. People tend to have an instinctive revulsion at denial of bodily integrity, particularly removal of flesh from a human being for use by another, and most particularly “commodification” of such conduct, that is, the sale of one’s bodily tissue. While there is reportedly a large international market for the buying and selling of human organs, in the United States, such a market is criminal and the commerce is <span title="281" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-281">p. 281</span>generally seen as revolting. Leon Kass examines the philosophical issue of commodification with his observation that nonprofit hospitals, donor registries, and physicians are permitted to make a lot of money from organ transplants, and the only people who get nothing are those whose organs are donated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5600f9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]lthough we allow no commerce in organs, transplant surgeons and hospitals are making handsome profits from the organ-trading business, and even the not-for-profit transplant registries and procurement agencies glean for their employees a middleman’s livelihood. Why . . . should everyone be making money from this business except the person whose organ makes it possible? Could it be that [the] real uneasiness [lies] with organ donation or with transplantation itself, for if not, what would be objectionable about its turning a profit?</p>
</div>
<p id="c5600fa0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Leon R. Kass, <i>Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics</i> 177 (2002). Kass suggests that the revulsion for commodification of human flesh is reflected in our language, see<i> id.</i> at 195: we call donors who are paid for their organs “donors” rather than “sellers” or “vendors.” To account for why most of us are revolted by the notion of a poor person selling a kidney to feed his family, Kass cites the taboos we have against cannibalism, defilement of corpses, and necrophilia. <i>Id</i>. at 183. Kass points to the idea of “psychophysical unity, a position that regards a human being as largely, if not wholly, self-identical with his enlivened body,” so that, as Kant put it, to “ ‘dispose of oneself as a mere means to some end of one’s own liking is to degrade the humanity in one’s person.’” <i>Id</i>. at 181-82, 185. In this view, “organ transplantation . . . is — once we strip away the trappings of the sterile operating rooms and their astonishing technologies — simply a noble form of cannibalism.” <i>Id</i>. at 185.</p>
<p id="c5600fa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These reasons are in some respects vague, in some speculative, and in some arguably misplaced. There are strong arguments for contrary views. But these policy and philosophical choices are for Congress to make, not us. The distinctions made by Congress must have a rational basis, but do not need to fit perfectly with that rational basis, and the basis need merely be rational, not persuasive to all. Here, Congress made a distinction between body material that is compensable and body material that is not. The distinction has a rational basis, so the prohibition on compensation for bone marrow donations by the aspiration method does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>

<p id="c5600fa3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The focus, though, of plaintiffs’ arguments is compensation for “bone marrow donations” by the peripheral blood stem cell apheresis method. For this, we need not answer any constitutional question, because the statute contains no prohibition. Such donations of cells drawn from blood flowing through the veins may sometimes anachronistically be called “bone marrow donations,” but none of the soft, fatty marrow is donated, just cells found outside the marrow, outside the bones, flowing through the veins.</p>
<p id="c5600fa4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress could not have had an intent to address the apheresis method when it passed the statute, because the method did not exist at that time. We must construe <span title="282" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-282">p. 282</span>the words of the statute to see what they imply about extraction of hematopoietic stem cells by this method. This issue has not been addressed by any of our sister circuits.</p>
<p id="c5600fa5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since payment for blood donations has long been common, the silence in the National Organ Transplant Act on compensating blood donors is loud. The statute says “human organ” is defined as a human “kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone, and skin or any subpart thereof and any other human organ . . . specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by regulation.” 42 U.S.C. §274e(c)(1). The government concedes that the common practice of compensating blood donors is not prohibited by the statute.</p>
<p id="c5600fa6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government argues that hematopoietic stem cells in the veins should be treated as “bone marrow” because “bone marrow” is a statutory organ, and the statute prohibits compensation not only for donation of an organ, but also “any subpart thereof.” We reject this argument, because it proves too much, and because it construes words to mean something different from ordinary usage. If the government’s argument that what comes from the marrow is a subpart of the marrow were correct, then the statute would prohibit compensating blood donors. The red and white blood cells that flow through the veins come from the bone marrow, just like hematopoietic stem cells. But the government implicitly concedes that these red and white blood cells are not “subparts” of bone marrow under the statute, because it explicitly concedes that the statute does not prohibit compensation for blood donations.</p>
<p id="c56036b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for ordinary usage, the bloodstream consists of plasma containing red cells, white cells, platelets, stem cells that will mature into one of these, and other material. We call this liquid as a whole “blood.” No one calls it “bone marrow,” even though these cells come from the marrow. There is no reason to think that Congress intended “bone marrow” to mean something so different from ordinary usage.</p>
<p id="c56036b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Likewise, every blood draw includes some hematopoietic stem cells. The word “subpart” refers to the organ from which the material is taken, not the organ in which it was created. Taking part of the liver for a liver donation would violate the statute because of the “subpart thereof” language. But taking something from the blood that is created in the marrow takes only a subpart of the blood.</p>
<p id="c56036b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III. Conclusion</i></p>
<p id="c56036ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be that “bone marrow transplant” is an anachronism that will soon fade away, as peripheral blood stem cell apheresis replaces aspiration as the transplant technique, much as “dial the phone” is fading away now that telephones do not have dials. Or it may live on, as “brief” does, even though “briefs” are now lengthy arguments rather than, as they used to be, brief summaries of authorities. Either way, when the “peripheral blood stem cell apheresis” method of “bone marrow transplantation” is used, it is not a transfer of a “human organ” or a “subpart thereof” as defined by the statute and regulation, so the statute does not criminalize compensating the donor.</p>

But wealthier people can already more easily register at distant centers with short lists. They’re also more likely to have friends and relatives who can afford the nonmedical expenses that living donation often entails, including time off from work, child care, hotel rooms, or cross-country travel. (It is legal for recipients or third parties to pay such expenses, but, unlike medical costs, they are not covered by insurance.)</p>
<p id="c56036bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Patients with enough money and the right networks have yet another option. They can go abroad, to countries where the authorities sanction or ignore payments to living donors.</p>
<p id="c56036c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such “transplant tourism” is growing. Laparoscopic surgery is a First World luxury, as are desk jobs to which donors can safely return soon after surgery. With few protections beyond the surgeon’s need to maintain a good reputation among potential donors, kidney vendors may not receive the full payments they’re promised. In China[,] organs may come not only from paid living vendors but also from executed prisoners. Transplant tourism is, in short, an ethical morass.</p>
<p id="c56036c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also a completely predictable byproduct of the current system, willed into being by policy makers who ignore the plight of kidney patients and by doctors who see above-board payments — and the protections of contract and malpractice law that would go with them — as pollution. Living donation is a low-risk procedure for the donor that offers life-changing rewards for the recipient. Yet the donor is the only person involved in the process who receives no compensation. To people who like to celebrate living donors as heroes, payment seems terribly crass. But the vicarious thrill of someone else’s altruism comes at a terrible cost.</p>

The impact of markets.</b> In defending the rationality of Congress’s distinction between blood and organs, the court in <i>Flynn</i> notes that “[c]ompensation to donors might also degrade the quality of the organ supply, by inducing potential donors to lie about their medical histories in order to make their organs marketable.” The court may have had in mind a famous argument by Richard Titmuss that, because blood donation is altruistic behavior, offering to pay for it discourages those motivated by altruism from donating, leading to a degradation in both quantity and quality of blood donated. <i>See</i> Richard Titmuss, <i>The Gift Relationship</i> (1970).</p>
<p id="c56036c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Economists find this claim puzzling, because, in their view, offering a financial incentive should attract those who would not donate absent the incentive without changing the cost-benefit calculus of those who are willing to donate without the incentive. But social scientists have found that monetary incentives can sometimes change the social meaning of a civic or charitable act into a commercial one. This deprives altruists of the benefit of acting for the sake of duty and may cause the incentive to backfire. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Uri Gneezy &amp; Aldo Rustichini, <i>A Fine Is a Price</i>, 29 J. Legal Stud. 1 (2000) (finding that the introduction of a fine for late pick-ups at an Israeli daycare increased late pick-ups); Bruno S. Frey &amp; Felix Oberholzer-Gee, <i>The Cost of Price Incentives: An Empirical Investigation of Motivation Crowding Out</i>, 87 Am.

The economist Fred Hirsch calls this transformation of social meaning the “commercialization effect.” Michael Sandel, <i>What Money Can’t Buy</i> 120 (2012) (citing Fred Hirsch, <i>The Social Limits to Growth</i> (1976)).</p>
<p id="c5605dd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For decades, the World Health Organization has affirmed Titmuss’s views about the superior safety of donated blood, arguing that all blood donation should be uncompensated. <i>See</i> World Health Organization, <i>Towards 100% Voluntary Blood Donation</i> (2010) (<i>available at http://www.who.int/bloodsafety/ publications/9789241599696_eng.pdf</i>). But recent empirical studies have tended to contradict Titmuss. According to a recent summary of the research in the journal <i>Science</i>, the availability of incentives for blood donation increases both the overall quantity and quality of donated blood. <i>See</i> Nicola Lacetera et al., <i>Economic Rewards to Motivate Blood Donations</i>, 340 Science 927 (May 24, 2013); <i>see also</i> Lorenz Goette &amp; Alois Stutzer, <i>Blood Donations and Incentives</i>, IZA Working Paper 3580, July 2008 (<i>available for download at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1158977</i>). Others have found differences in how men and women respond to incentives, with women displaying a greater “crowding out” effect. <i>See</i> Carl Mellstrom &amp; Magnus Johannesson, <i>Crowding Out in Blood Donation</i>, 6 J. Eur. Econ. Assn. 845 (2010). Does this argument about crowding out relate to the distinction between blood and organs? If Titmuss was wrong, might there still be reasons to oppose the sale of organs?</p>

It is also legal to engage in a “paired donation.” In a <b>paired donation</b>, the first donor is incompatible with the person to whom she wants to donate her organ but is compatible with another person who has a willing donor who is compatible with the first donor’s recipient. The statute exempts from its coverage an agreement between the two donor/recipient pairs to swap organs (giving the second donor’s organ to the first recipient and the first donor’s organ to the second recipient). The law also allows for several pairs of donors and recipients to link together in a daisy chain of “paired donations” in order to move organs from donors to compatible recipients. Sometimes, chains can grow to include dozens of donors and recipients. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Byron Pitts et al., <i>Donating a Kidney to a Complete Stranger in Order to Save a Loved One</i>, <i>http://abcnews.go.com/Health/donating-kidney-complete-stranger-order-save-loved/story?id=30288400</i> (describing a chain of paired donations that grew to include 34 recipients). Although paired donations began in 2000, Congress amended the law in 2007 to make it clear that they are legal. Do you see why the express exemption for paired donations was necessary?</p>
