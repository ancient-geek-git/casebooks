<p id="c540522b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property serves many policy goals, and parties justify their claims with many arguments. Some of the core justifications for property claims include sovereign allocation of rights; efficiency or social welfare maximization; distributive justice or equality; settled expectations; labor and investment; and possession or occupancy of the property. You will see courts and litigants invoking various arguments along these lines throughout the materials in this book. In arguing for and evaluating legal claims, lawyers need to be able to identify and employ these arguments to support their legal assertions. This chapter provides an introduction to some of these justifications.</p>
<p id="c540522c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justifications may point in different directions: one could argue that the first to occupy the property is not the one who will use it most efficiently, for example, or that the government-sanctioned distribution is unequal and therefore unjust. Different justifications may also support each other: awarding rights to the current possessor might encourage investment in the property; or correcting distributive inequalities may facilitate full and efficient use. Some may argue that particular justifications are more compelling than others. Today, for example, much scholarship focuses on economic efficiency, while early American common law placed more emphasis on protecting established expectations. But almost everyone recognizes multiple justifications for property rights. Although the sections below are divided among different kinds of arguments for property rights, you will see litigants and courts making multiple arguments within each section.</p>

<p id="c540522f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property and sovereignty are inextricably linked. First, property is the product of sovereignty: without authoritative enforcement of rights to things — without, that is, a sovereign — many argue that there is no property. Second, property in effect delegates sovereign rights to owners — by creating control over use of valuable resources, property gives owners legal control over other individuals. Morris Cohen, <i>Property and Sovereignty</i>, 13 Cornell L.Q. 8 (1928).</p>
<p id="c5405230-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="88" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-88">p. 88</span>What justifies sovereign power to allocate and set rules for control of valuable resources? What if there is conflict over which sovereign has that authority? What if the rules set by the sovereign violate justice, equality, efficiency, or expectations founded on other sources? As you will see, while sovereign allocation is a powerful source of property rights, governmental actors (whether judicial, legislative, or executive) sometimes enforce rights acquired in violation of official rules.</p>

<p id="c5405233-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, all land held by non-Indians theoretically can be traced to title ultimately derived from the U.S. government or a prior colonial power, which in turn obtained title from an American Indian nation. In the mid-fifteenth century, an estimated five to ten million native inhabitants occupied the land mass that is now the United States. By a process of cultural extermination and diseases such as measles and smallpox, the population of American Indians shrank to about 200,000 by 1910. Louise Erdrich notes that this “is proportionately as if the population of the United States were to decrease from its present level to the population of Cleveland.” Louise Erdrich, <i>Where I Ought to Be: A Writer’s Sense of Place</i>, N.Y. Times Book Rev., July 28, 1985, at 1, 23.</p>
<p id="c5405234-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">European nations colonizing the Americas initially distributed the land without regard to Indian property rights. Asserting divine authority, they granted charters to the Americas from sea to sea and pole to pole. But in North America, both colonial and British law soon required Indian consent to acquire rights in Indian lands. This “consent” was often coerced, forged, or misunderstood. Land acquisition created intense conflict, both between American Indian nations and settlers and among the settlers themselves, who disagreed both about whether a government could regulate their acquisition of Indian land and which government could do so.</p>
<p id="c5405235-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i>, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823), involves a conflict between non-Indians over the acquisition of Indian land. The plaintiffs claimed to have obtained title directly from the Illinois and Piankeshaw Indians. The defendant was later granted title by the United States after the government entered into treaties with a number of Indian tribes. In adjudicating this dispute, the Supreme Court had the unenviable task of justifying the process by which American Indian nations were robbed of their ancestral lands. At the same time, Chief Justice John Marshall’s opinion provided the basis for substantial legal protection of Indian possessions. How well did the Chief Justice do in attempting to reconcile the demands of justice and power?</p>

<p id="c540794a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Joshua Johnson and Thomas Graham sued to eject William M’Intosh from certain lands in Illinois. Johnson and Graham claimed the lands by purchase from the Piankeshaw Indians, and M’Intosh claimed it under a grant from the United States. The parties stipulated to the following facts.</p>
<p id="c540794b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-89">p. 89</span>The lands were within those that the King of England had originally granted the Virginia Company in 1609. At the time of the grant this territory was “held, occupied, and possessed, in full sovereignty, by various independent tribes or nations of Indians, who were the sovereigns of their respective portions of the territory, and the absolute owners and proprietors of the soil.” In 1624, the Virginia Company was dissolved, and it and its lands became the British colony of Virginia.</p>
<p id="c540794c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On October 7, 1763, the King of England issued the Royal Proclamation, reserving for the Indians all lands west of the Appalachians, and forbidding British subjects from purchasing or settling on any of those lands. In 1773, chiefs of the Illinois Nation sold William Murray and others two tracts of land west of the Appalachians for 24,000 dollars. The lands were within the limits of Virginia, east of the Mississippi and northwest of the Ohio Rivers. In 1775, certain chiefs of the Piankeshaw Nation sold Louis Viviat and others lands in the same area for $31,000.</p>
<p id="c540794d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1776, the colony of Virginia declared its independence from Great Britain. In 1779, the new State of Virginia decreed that it had the sole right to purchase lands from the Indians within its territory, and that any past or future purchases by individuals from the Indians were void. In 1783, Virginia conveyed all its lands northwest of the Ohio River to the United States. The lands ultimately became part of the State of Illinois. In 1803 and 1809 treaties, the United States acquired parts of the same territory previously purchased by Murray and Viviat from various Indian tribes. In 1818, the United States sold 11,560 acres of this territory to William M’Intosh.</p>
<p id="c540794e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joshua Johnson and Thomas J. Graham inherited a portion of the lands purchased from the Piankeshaw in 1775 from one of the original private grantees. Neither they nor any of the grantees claiming under the 1773 and 1775 sales had ever had actual possession of the lands. The private grantees had, between 1781 and 1816, repeatedly petitioned the Congress of the United States to acknowledge and confirm their title to those lands without success.]</p>
<p id="c540794f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the part of the plaintiffs, it was contended,</p>
<p id="c5407950-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. That the Piankeshaw Indians were the owners of the lands in dispute, at the time of executing the deed of October 10th, 1775, and had power to sell. But as the United States had [later] purchased the same lands of the same Indians, both parties claim from the same source. [The Indian] title by occupancy is to be respected, as much as that of an individual, obtained by the same right, in a civilized state. The circumstance, that the members of the society held in common, did not affect the strength of their title by occupancy. In short, all, or nearly all, the lands in the United States, is holden under purchases from the Indian nations; and the only question in this case must be, whether it be competent to individuals to make such purchases, or whether that be the exclusive prerogative of government.</p>
<p id="c5407951-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. That the British king’s proclamation of October 7th, 1763, could not affect this right of the Indians to sell; because they were not British subjects, nor in any manner bound by the authority of the British government, legislative or executive. And, because, even admitting them to be British subjects, absolutely, or sub modo, they were still proprietors of the soil, and could not be devested of their rights of property, or any of its incidents, by a mere act of the executive government, such as this proclamation.</p>
<p id="c540a062-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>3. That the proclamation of 1763 could not restrain the purchasers under these deeds from purchasing. [T]he establishment of a government establishes a system of laws, and excludes the power of legislating by proclamation. The proclamation could not have the force of law within the chartered limits of Virginia. A proclamation, that no person should purchase land in England or Canada, would be clearly void.</p>
<p id="c540a063-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. That the act of Assembly of Virginia, passed in May, 1779, cannot affect the right of the plaintiffs, and others claiming under these deeds; because, on general principles, and by the constitution of Virginia, the legislature was not competent to take away private, vested rights, or appropriate private property to public use, under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p id="c540a064-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the part of the defendants, it was insisted, that the uniform understanding and practice of European nations, and the settled law, as laid down by the tribunals of civilized states, denied the right of the Indians to be considered as independent communities, having a permanent property in the soil, capable of alienation to private individuals. They remain in a state of nature, and have never been admitted into the general society of nations. Even if it should be admitted that the Indians were originally an independent people, they have ceased to be so. A nation that has passed under the dominion of another, is no longer a sovereign state. The same treaties and negotiations, before referred to, show their dependent condition. Or, if it be admitted that they are now independent and foreign states, the title of the plaintiffs would still be invalid: as grantees from the Indians, they must take according to their laws of property, and as Indian subjects. The law of every dominion affects all persons and property situate within it; and the Indians never had any idea of individual property in lands. It cannot be said that the lands conveyed were disjoined from their dominion; because the grantees could not take the sovereignty and eminent domain to themselves.</p>
<p id="c540a065-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the law of nature, [American Indians] had not acquired a fixed property capable of being transferred. The measure of property acquired by occupancy is determined, according to the law of nature, by the extent of men’s wants, and their capacity of using it to supply them. It is a violation of the rights of others to exclude them from the use of what we do not want, and they have an occasion for. Upon this principle the North American Indians could have acquired no proprietary interest in the vast tracts of territory which they wandered over; and their right to the lands on which they hunted, could not be considered as superior to that which is acquired to the sea by fishing in it. The use in the one case, as well as the other, is not exclusive. According to every theory of property, the Indians had no individual rights to land; nor had they any collectively, or in their national capacity; for the lands occupied by each tribe were not used by them in such a manner as to prevent their being appropriated by a people of cultivators. All the proprietary rights of civilized nations on this continent are founded on this principle. </p>
<p id="c540a066-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Chief Justice J<span class="epub-small-caps">OHN</span> M<span class="epub-small-caps">ARSHALL</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c540a067-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs in this cause claim the land, in their declaration mentioned, under two grants, purporting to be made, the first in 1773, and the last in 1775, by the chiefs of certain Indian tribes, constituting the Illinois and the Piankeshaw nations; and the question is, whether this title can be recognized in the Courts of the United States?</p>

The inquiry, therefore, is, in a great measure, confined to the power of Indians to give, and of private individuals to receive, a title which can be sustained in the Courts of this country.</p>
<p id="c540a069-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the right of society, to prescribe those rules by which property may be acquired and preserved is not, and cannot be drawn into question; as the title to lands, especially, is and must be admitted to depend entirely on the law of the nation in which they lie; it will be necessary, in pursuing this inquiry, to examine, not singly those principles of abstract justice, which the Creator of all things has impressed on the mind of his creature man, and which are admitted to regulate, in a great degree, the rights of civilized nations, whose perfect independence is acknowledged; but those principles also which our own government has adopted in the particular case, and given us as the rule for our decision.</p>
<p id="c540a06a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it as they could respectively acquire. Its vast extent offered an ample field to the ambition and enterprise of all; and the character and religion of its inhabitants afforded an apology for considering them as a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might claim an ascendency. The potentates of the old world found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the inhabitants of the new, by bestowing on them civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited independence. But, as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle, which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was, that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.</p>
<p id="c540a06b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exclusion of all other Europeans, necessarily gave to the nation making the discovery the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it. It was a right with which no Europeans could interfere. It was a right which all asserted for themselves, and to the assertion of which, by others, all assented.</p>
<p id="c540a06c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those relations which were to exist between the discoverer and the natives, were to be regulated by themselves. The rights thus acquired being exclusive, no other power could interpose between them.</p>
<p id="c540a06d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the establishment of these relations, the rights of the original inhabitants were, in no instance, entirely disregarded; but were necessarily, to a considerable extent, impaired. They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion; but their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil at their own will, to whomsoever they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it.</p>
<p id="c540c77e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="92" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-92">p. 92</span>While the different nations of Europe respected the right of the natives, as occupants, they asserted the ultimate dominion to be in themselves; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil, while yet in possession of the natives. These grants have been understood by all, to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.</p>
<p id="c540c77f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.</p>
<p id="c540c780-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one of the powers of Europe gave its full assent to this principle, more unequivocally than England. The documents upon this subject are ample and complete. So early as the year 1496, her monarch granted a commission to the Cabots, to discover countries then unknown to Christian people, and to take possession of them in the name of the king of England. Two years afterwards, Cabot proceeded on this voyage, and discovered the continent of North America, along which he sailed as far south as Virginia. To this discovery the English trace their title.</p>

<p id="c540c782-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the treaty which concluded the war of our revolution, Great Britain relinquished all claim, not only to the government, but to the “propriety and territorial rights of the United States,” whose boundaries were fixed in the second article. By this treaty, the powers of government, and the right to soil, which had previously been in Great Britain, passed definitively to these States. We had before taken possession of them, by declaring independence; but neither the declaration of independence, nor the treaty confirming it, could give us more than that which we before possessed, or to which Great Britain was before entitled. It has never been doubted, that either the United States, or the several States, had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and that the exclusive power to extinguish that right, was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it.</p>
<p id="c540c783-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The States, having within their chartered limits different portions of territory covered by Indians, ceded that territory, generally, to the United States, on conditions expressed in their deeds of cession, which demonstrate the opinion, that they ceded the soil as well as jurisdiction, and that in doing so, they granted a productive fund to the government of the Union. The lands in controversy lay within the chartered limits of Virginia, and were ceded with the whole country northwest of the river Ohio.</p>
<p id="c540c784-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ceded territory was occupied by numerous and warlike tribes of Indians; but the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish their title, and to grant the soil, has never, we believe, been doubted.</p>
<p id="c540c785-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The magnificent purchase of Louisiana, was the purchase from France of a country almost entirely occupied by numerous tribes of Indians, who are in fact independent. Yet, any attempt of others to intrude into that country, would be considered as an aggression which would justify war.</p>

<p id="c540c787-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States, then, have unequivocally acceded to that great and broad rule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty, as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise.</p>
<p id="c540c788-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power now possessed by the government of the United States to grant lands, resided, while we were colonies, in the crown, or its grantees. The validity of the titles given by either has never been questioned in our Courts. It has been exercised uniformly over territory in possession of the Indians. The existence of this power must negative the existence of any right which may conflict with, and control it. An absolute title to lands cannot exist, at the same time, in different persons, or in different governments. An absolute, must be an exclusive title, or at least a title which excludes all others not compatible with it. All our institutions recognise the absolute title of the crown, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and recognise the absolute title of the crown to extinguish that right. This is incompatible with an absolute and complete title in the Indians.</p>
<p id="c540c789-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will not enter into the controversy, whether agriculturists, merchants, and manufacturers, have a right, on abstract principles, to expel hunters from the territory they possess, or to contract their limits. Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be, respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted. The British government, which was then our government, and whose rights have passed to the United States, asserted title to all the lands occupied by Indians, within the chartered limits of the British colonies. It asserted also a limited sovereignty over them, and the exclusive right of extinguishing the title which occupancy gave to them. These claims have been maintained and established as far west as the river Mississippi, by the sword. The title to a vast portion of the lands we now hold, originates in them. It is not for the Courts of this country to question the validity of this title, or to sustain one which is incompatible with it.</p>
<p id="c540c78a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we do not mean to engage in the defence of those principles which Europeans have applied to Indian title, they may, we think, find some excuse, if not justification, in the character and habits of the people whose rights have been wrested from them.</p>
<p id="c540c78b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The title by conquest is acquired and maintained by force. The conqueror prescribes its limits. Humanity, however, acting on public opinion, has established, as a general rule, that the conquered shall not be wantonly oppressed, and that their condition shall remain as eligible as is compatible with the objects of the conquest. Most usually, they are incorporated with the victorious nation, and become subjects or citizens of the government with which they are connected. The new and old members of the society mingle with each other; the distinction between them is gradually lost, and <span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-94">p. 94</span>they make one people. Where this incorporation is practicable, humanity demands, and a wise policy requires, that the rights of the conquered to property should remain unimpaired; that the new subjects should be governed as equitably as the old, and that confidence in their security should gradually banish the painful sense of being separated from their ancient connexions, and united by force to strangers.</p>
<p id="c540c78c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the conquest is complete, and the conquered inhabitants can be blended with the conquerors, or safely governed as a distinct people, public opinion, which not even the conqueror can disregard, imposes these restraints upon him; and he cannot neglect them without injury to his fame, and hazard to his power.</p>
<p id="c540c78d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness; to govern them as a distinct people, was impossible, because they were as brave and as high spirited as they were fierce, and were ready to repel by arms every attempt on their independence.</p>
<p id="c540ee9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What was the inevitable consequence of this state of things? The Europeans were under the necessity either of abandoning the country, and relinquishing their pompous claims to it, or of enforcing those claims by the sword, and by the adoption of principles adapted to the condition of a people with whom it was impossible to mix, and who could not be governed as a distinct society, or of remaining in their neighbourhood, and exposing themselves and their families to the perpetual hazard of being massacred.</p>
<p id="c540ee9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frequent and bloody wars, in which the whites were not always the aggressors, unavoidably ensued. European policy, numbers, and skill, prevailed. As the white population advanced, that of the Indians necessarily receded. The country in the immediate neighbourhood of agriculturists became unfit for them. The game fled into thicker and more unbroken forests, and the Indians followed. The soil, to which the crown originally claimed title, being no longer occupied by its ancient inhabitants, was parcelled out according to the will of the sovereign power, and taken possession of by persons who claimed immediately from the crown, or mediately, through its grantees or deputies.</p>
<p id="c540eea0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That law which regulates, and ought to regulate in general, the relations between the conqueror and conquered, was incapable of application to a people under such circumstances. The resort to some new and different rule, better adapted to the actual state of things, was unavoidable. Every rule which can be suggested will be found to be attended with great difficulty.</p>
<p id="c540eea1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However extravagant the pretension of converting the discovery of an inhabited country into conquest may appear; if the principle has been asserted in the first instance, and afterwards sustained; if a country has been acquired and held under it; if the property of the great mass of the community originates in it, it becomes the law of the land, and cannot be questioned. So, too, with respect to the concomitant principle, that the Indian inhabitants are to be considered merely as occupants, to be protected, indeed, while in peace, in the possession of their lands, but to be deemed incapable of transferring the absolute title to others. However this restriction may be opposed to <span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span>natural right, and to the usages of civilized nations, yet, if it be indispensable to that system under which the country has been settled, and be adapted to the actual condition of the two people, it may, perhaps, be supported by reason, and certainly cannot be rejected by Courts of justice.</p>
<p id="c540eea2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The absolute ultimate title has been considered as acquired by discovery, subject only to the Indian title of occupancy, which title the discoverers possessed the exclusive right of acquiring. Such a right is no more incompatible with a seisin in fee, than a lease for years, and might as effectually bar an ejectment.</p>

</div>
<p id="c5413cd0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another view has been taken of this question, which deserves to be considered. The title of the crown, whatever it might be, could be acquired only by a conveyance from the crown. If an individual might extinguish the Indian title for his own benefit, or, in other words, might purchase it, still he could acquire only that title. Admitting their power to change their laws or usages, so far as to allow an individual to separate a portion of their lands from the common stock, and hold it in severalty, still it is a part of their territory, and is held under them, by a title dependent on their laws. The grant derives its efficacy from their will; and, if they choose to resume it, and make a different disposition of the land, the Courts of the United States cannot interpose for the protection of the title. The person who purchases lands from the Indians, within their territory, incorporates himself with them, so far as respects the property purchased; holds their title under their protection, and subject to their laws. If they annul the grant, we know of no tribunal which can revise and set aside the proceeding. We know of no principle which can distinguish this case from a grant made to a native Indian, authorizing him to hold a particular tract of land in severalty.</p>
<p id="c5413cd1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As such a grant could not separate the Indian from his nation, nor give a title which our Courts could distinguish from the title of his tribe, as it might still be conquered from, or ceded by his tribe, we can perceive no legal principle which will authorize a Court to say, that different consequences are attached to this purchase, because it was made by a stranger. By the treaties concluded between the United States and the Indian nations, whose title the plaintiffs claim, the country comprehending the lands in controversy has been ceded to the United States, without any reservation of their title. These <span title="96" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-96">p. 96</span>nations had been at war with the United States, and had an unquestionable right to annul any grant they had made to American citizens. Their cession of the country, without a reservation of this land, affords a fair presumption, that they considered it as of no validity. They ceded to the United States this very property, after having used it in common with other lands, as their own, from the date of their deeds to the time of cession; and the attempt now made, is to set up their title against that of the United States.</p>
<p id="c5413cd2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has never been contended, that the Indian title amounted to nothing. Their right of possession has never been questioned. The claim of government extends to the complete ultimate title, charged with this right of possession, and to the exclusive power of acquiring that right.</p>
<p id="c5413cd3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After bestowing on this subject a degree of attention which was more required by the magnitude of the interest in litigation, and the able and elaborate arguments of the bar, than by its intrinsic difficulty, the Court is decidedly of opinion, that the plaintiffs do not exhibit a title which can be sustained in the Courts of the United States.</p>

<p id="c5413cd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Role of doctrine of discovery.</b> What was the purpose of the doctrine of discovery according to Justice Marshall? To whom did it apply?</p>
<p id="c5413cd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Indian property rights under doctrine.</b> What property rights did Indian nations have under the doctrine? What rights do they lack? Imagine, for example, that a non-Indian individual without federal consent forced an Indian off her land. Does the Indian have a cause of action to remove him? <i>See Fellows v. Blacksmith</i>, 60 U.S. 366 (1856) (deciding whether non-Indian state grantees have right to forcibly dispossess Seneca Indian landowners).</p>
<p id="c5413cd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. United States property rights under doctrine.</b> What rights did the United States get in Indian lands under the doctrine of discovery? What property rights did they lack? Imagine, for example, that the United States grants an individual a right to lands subject to the Indian title of occupancy. What has to happen before the individual can legally move onto the land and start farming?</p>
<p id="c5413cd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. The courts of the conqueror.</b> At the beginning of the opinion, the court reporter summarizes the arguments made by the parties. Note that the opinion does not adopt either of these arguments. Instead, Justice Marshall declared, “Conquest gives a title which the Courts of the conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be, respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted.” What does this mean? Can you tell what Justice Marshall’s “private and speculative opinion” is of the original justice of the loss of Indian property rights through the doctrine of discovery?</p>
<p id="c54163ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Role of public opinion.</b> Justice Marshall states that “[h]umanity” has established “as a general rule” that the property rights of a conquered people remain unchanged after conquest, declaring that “public opinion, which not even the conqueror <span title="97" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-97">p. 97</span>can disregard, imposes these restraints upon him; and he cannot neglect them without injury to his fame, and hazard to his power.” In <i>United States v. Percheman</i>, 32 U.S. 51 (1833), the Supreme Court followed this rule in interpreting various laws to validate titles to private citizens granted by Spain before the United States acquired Florida. Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion explained, “The modern usage of nations, which has become law, would be violated; that sense of justice and of right which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world would be outraged, if private property should be generally confiscated, and private rights annulled.” <i>Percheman</i> at 86-87. Why does public opinion limit governmental actions? What are the costs to a government of ignoring public opinion? Why did the general rule not apply to Indian lands?</p>
<p id="c54163eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Later Supreme Court statements on Indian land.</b> <i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i> was among the earliest of many Supreme Court statements regarding Indian land. In 1831, Justice Marshall described the discovery doctrine in these words: “The extravagant and absurd idea, that the feeble settlements made on the sea coast, or the companies under whom they were made, acquired legitimate power by them to govern the people, or occupy the lands from sea to sea, did not enter the mind of any man. [All they gained] was the exclusive right of purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell.” <i>Worcester v. Georgia</i>, 31 U.S. 515, 544-545 (1832). In 1835, the Court stated that “it [is] a settled principle, that [American Indians’] right of occupancy is considered as sacred as the fee simple of the whites.” <i>Mitchel v. United States</i>, 34 U.S. 711, 746 (1835). Are these statements consistent with <i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i>?</p>
<p id="c54163ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States</i>, 348 U.S. 272 (1955), the Supreme Court rejected a claim by Alaska Native tribes against the United States for compensation for millions of acres of land. The Court held that although the fifth amendment provides that property shall not be taken without just compensation, U.S. Const., amdt. V, the Constitution did not protect tribal property unless the federal government had formally affirmed title to the land. The Court claimed to base its holding on “the rule derived from <i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i> that the taking by the United States of unrecognized Indian title is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c54163ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The line of cases adjudicating Indian rights on American soil leads to the conclusion that Indian occupancy, not specifically recognized as ownership by action authorized by Congress, may be extinguished by the Government without compensation. Every American schoolboy knows that the savage tribes of this continent were deprived of their ancestral ranges by force and that, even when the Indians ceded millions of acres by treaty in return for blankets, food and trinkets, it was not a sale but the conquerors’ will that deprived them of their land.</p>
<p id="c54163ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the light of the history of Indian relations in this Nation, no other course would meet the problem of the growth of the United States. Our conclusion does not uphold harshness as against tenderness toward the Indians, but it leaves with Congress, where it belongs, the policy of Indian gratuities for the termination of Indian occupancy of Government-owned land rather than making compensation for its value a rigid constitutional principle.</p>
</div>
<p id="c54163ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="98" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-98">p. 98</span>In 1884 and 1900, laws for the acquisition and settlement of the Alaska Territory, the United States had provided that the Indians “shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them,” but the Court found these laws did not recognize any property rights in the Alaska Natives, but simply reserved the question for another day. Therefore the Alaska Natives had no legal protection — besides the “Indian gratuities” Congress was willing to provide — for the acquisition of the lands they had occupied for centuries. Is <i>Tee-Hit-Ton</i> consistent with <i>Johnson</i>?</p>

<p id="c54163f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. First possession or occupancy.</b> One of the most common arguments for property rights is that one is the first possessor or occupier of the property. <i>See</i> Carol Rose, <i>Possession as the Origin of Property</i>, 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 73 (1985). What interests does a rule according title to first possessors serve? Well, it might prevent disputes about title, by preventing latecomers from challenging those there first, and encourage individuals to quickly find and claim useful property. What objections can you think of to these justifications? More importantly, why don’t these arguments work in <i>Johnson</i>? As the plaintiffs argue, the Indians were clearly the first occupants of the land in question. Justice Marshall acknowledges that “converting the discovery of an inhabited country into conquest” is an “extravagant pretension.” So why don’t the Indians have full property rights?<span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-99">p. 99</span></p>

Labor and investment.</b> The defendants counter that the Indians never acquired property rights because as hunters rather than farmers, “the lands occupied by each tribe were not used by them in such a manner as to prevent their being appropriated by a people of cultivators.” Does this mean I can demand my neighbor’s land if I intend to farm it, while he simply occasionally picnics on it? Recent scholarship shows that in fact Indians had transformed the North American landscape by their work before non-Indians arrived; and as the facts stipulate, neither of the parties in <i>Johnson</i> had ever set foot on the land. Regardless, Justice Marshall rejects that as a basis for deciding the case as well, saying, “We will not enter into the controversy, whether agriculturists, merchants, and manufacturers, have a right, on abstract principles, to expel hunters from the territory they possess, or to contract their limits.”</p>
<p id="c5418b15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Efficiency and maximization of social welfare.</b> The farmers over hunters argument is also an efficiency argument that the farmers maximize overall social welfare by engaging in the most productive use of the land. Marshall’s opinion does not turn on this argument, but he acknowledges it with his statement that part of the “excuse” for the discovery doctrine is that “[t]o leave [the Indians] in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness.” Two central tenets in efficiency-based arguments for property rules are (1) that property rights should be protected, to “assure to the cultivator the fruits of his industry,” and so encourage productive labor, and (2) that property should be freely alienable because “[e]very alienation imports advantage” by transferring property from one who values it less to one who values it more. Jeremy Bentham, <i>Principles of the Civil Code</i>, chs. 3 &amp; 19 (1802). Can you think of challenges to these principles? Does the rule in <i>Johnson</i> further these principles?</p>
<p id="c541b226-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Distributive justice.</b> The defendants also raise a distributive justice argument, by claiming that the Indians do not have property rights in their lands because “[i]t is a violation of the rights of others to exclude them from the use of what we do not want, and they have occasion for.” The desire to prevent gross inequality and ensure distribution to those in great need has also been influential in American law and policy, influencing, for example, the passage of the <i>Homestead Act</i> in 1862, and the <i>Social Security Act</i> in 1934. Thomas Jefferson urged James Madison in 1785, “I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property.” Does inequality justify redistribution of property? Under which circumstances, if any?</p>
<p id="c541b227-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Sovereign authority or might makes right?</b> That brings us back to Marshall’s central point: the discovery doctrine is the law because the government in charge said so, and the government has to have the power to say who can acquire property rights and how. One could see this as a simple statement that property arises from law: in order to prevent constant insecurity of property rights and to facilitate transfers, we have agreed to governmental rules regarding what property rights are and how they are acquired. To settle a vast continent, and prevent settlers from getting the United States into wars it could not handle, the government needed authority over when Indian land was acquired and how.</p>
<p id="c541b228-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-101">p. 101</span>For the Indians, however, the doctrine that they lacked rights to transfer their land based on the decree of foreigners who had never set foot on that land must have felt like a subtly different rule: that property rights are created by and favor those in power. U.S. history provides other support for such a perception. African slaves not only were property, but were prevented from owning property. <i>See, e.g., Graves v. Allan</i>, 52 Ky. 190 (Ky. App. 1852). <i>But see</i> Dylan C. Penningroth, <i>The Claims of Kinfolk: African American Property and Community in the Nineteenth-Century South</i> (2003) (describing the well-established ownership networks slaves developed with the consent of their masters). Married women’s property became that of their husbands until the late nineteenth century. <i>See</i> Chapter 9, §3.1.B; Reva Siegel, <i>Home as Work: The First Women’s Rights Claims Concerning Wives’ Household Labor: 1850-1880</i>, Yale L.J. 1073, 1082 (1994) (“[A] wife negotiated marriage as a dependent: without property or the legal prerogative to earn it.”). And “immigrants ineligible for citizenship,” a category that included almost all Asian immigrants until well into the twentieth century, were prevented from owning property up and down the West Coast and in many other states. <i>See</i> Keith Aoki, <i>No Right to Own? The Early Twentieth-Century “Alien Land Laws” as a Prelude to Internment</i>, 40 B.C. L. Rev. 37 (1998); Rose Cuison Villazor, <i>Oyama v. California: At the Intersection of Property, Race, and Citizenship</i>, 87 Wash. U. L. Rev. 979 (2010). At the same time, these laws clashed with another fundamental precept of property: that the system works better when everyone can participate in property ownership.</p>

<p id="c541b22b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1790, the year after the U.S. Constitution was ratified, Congress codified the prohibition on purchasing Indian land without federal consent. The <i>Trade and Intercourse Act</i>, also called the <i>Nonintercourse Act</i>, remains in effect with slight amendments today:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c541b22c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.</p>
</div>
<p id="c541b22d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">25 U.S.C. §177. Despite the statute, both states and private parties continued to acquire Indian land without federal consent. New York, for example, purchased most of the treaty lands of the Iroquois Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Federal officials urged New York to comply with the <i>Nonintercourse Act</i>, but the state ignored them. Rather than enforcing the restriction, the United States tried to convince the tribes to exchange their remaining land for lands west of the Mississippi River. Although the tribes challenged the state purchases (including by arguing that they were fraudulent), procedural obstacles made it difficult for tribes to sue the states directly. State law prohibited tribes from bringing suit regarding Indian lands except through state-appointed guardians. Until 1875, federal courts lacked general jurisdiction to review questions of federal law. Even after 1875, state sovereign immunity barred suits <span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>against the state to acquire their lands. <i>See</i> Robert N. Clinton &amp; Margaret Tobey Hotopp, <i>Judicial Enforcement of the Federal Restraints on the Alienation of Indian Land: The Origins of the Indian Land Claims</i>, 31 Me. L. Rev. 17 (1979-1980); Joseph William Singer, <i>Nine-Tenths of the Law: Title, Possession &amp; Sacred Obligations</i>, 38 Conn. L. Rev. 605 (2006). In the meantime, non-Indians bought and sold the acquired lands, cities and towns developed, and homes and businesses were built. The federal treaties guaranteeing the land to the Iroquois Nations seemed a thing of the past.</p>
<p id="c541b22e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1966, however, the United States enacted a statute allowing tribes to bring actions against third parties in federal court without federal consent. In 1969, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sued Oneida County seeking rent for occupation between 1968 and 1969 of 100,000 acres of land. The United States had guaranteed the land to the Oneidas in a 1794 treaty, but New York purchased the treaty land in 1795. In 1974, the Supreme Court held that the <i>Nonintercourse Act</i> granted the tribes a federal common law right to sue for violations of the act. <i>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida</i>, 414 U.S. 661 (1974) (<i>Oneida I</i>). On remand, the district court and court of appeals held that the 1795 purchase was void, and ordered the county to pay rent for the land. <i>Oneida Indian Nation v. Oneida County</i>, 719 F.2d 525 (2d Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, holding that no federal statute of limitations barred the tribal claims. <i>County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation</i>, 470 U.S. 226 (1985) (<i>Oneida II</i>).</p>
<p id="c541b22f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While this litigation was pending, the Oneidas brought an additional claim for possession of all of their original treaty land. Over the course of the 1970s, other tribes in New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut brought <i>Nonintercourse Act</i> claims challenging state and private acquisitions of their land. Some of these claims were defeated or delayed by arguments that the plaintiffs were not really Indian tribes. Other claims were settled, usually with agreements that the tribe would cede most of its original land in exchange for the guarantee of some publicly owned lands as a reservation and funds to purchase additional reservation lands from willing sellers in a specified area. <i>E.g</i>., <i>Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act</i>, 25 U.S.C. §1701 <i>et seq</i>.; <i>Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act</i>, 25 U.S.C. §1721 <i>et seq</i>.; <i>Mashantucket Pequot Indian Claims Settlement Act</i>, 25 U.S.C.A. §1751 <i>et seq</i>.; <i>Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claims Settlement Act</i>, 25 U.S.C. §1755 <i>et seq</i>. In order to secure the settlements, the tribes also agreed to significant state jurisdiction over the new lands.</p>
<p id="c541b230-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But New York and the Iroquois Nations did not settle. The ongoing litigation created concern among landowners, who feared ejectment from the land, and hostility against the tribes. Signs reading “no sovereign nation, no reservation” appeared along county roads. In 1999, in a case concerning land claims by the Cayuga Indian Nation, the U.S. district court held that the parties could not join private landowners to the litigation or seek to eject them, finding that such a remedy was impossible given the passage of time. <i>Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Cuomo</i>, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10579 (N.D.N.Y. 1999). The district judge found that “the loss of their homeland has had an immeasurable impact upon the Cayuga culture and Cayuga society as a whole,” <i>id.</i> at *77, and that the tribes had continuously tried to get back the land but that the “systems which theoretically should have assisted the Cayugas seemingly thwarted their <span title="103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-103">p. 103</span>efforts.” <i>Id.</i> at *77 &amp; *83. Nevertheless, ejectment of private landowners would “potentially displace literally thousands of private landowners and several public landowners” and would “prove all too vividly the old axiom: Two wrongs don’t make a right.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at *90-*91; <i>see also Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. County of Oneida</i>, 199 F.R.D. 61 (N.D.N.Y. 2000). In a later opinion, the court awarded the Cayuga Indian Nation approximately $247 million in damages for the lost rental value of their land, <i>Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki</i>, 165 F. Supp. 2d 266 (N.D.N.Y. 2002), <i>rev’d,</i> 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005), but, as you will see, the Second Circuit later held the Cayuga could not claim even that.</p>
<p id="c541b231-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the legal battle continued, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York bought back some of the lands within the boundaries laid out by its 1794 treaty with the United States. It began to operate businesses on the lands, arguing that because the treaty had never been legally terminated, the lands were part of a reservation and free from state taxation. The district court and Second Circuit agreed, but Supreme Court reversed. <i>Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York</i>, 544 U.S. 197 (2005), held that laches, acquiescence, and impossibility barred the claim to freedom from state jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c541b232-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Laches is an equitable doctrine barring actions by those whose unreasonable delay in suing has resulted in prejudice to their opponents in defending the claim. <i>See</i> Kathryn E. Fort,<i> The New Laches: Creating Title Where None Existed</i>, 16 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 357 (2009). The Court did not discuss whether the Oneidas could have brought the suit earlier, or find that the passage of time would prejudice the defendants. Nevertheless, it held, laches applied because the state and counties had long exercised sovereignty over the territory, the Oneida Indian Nation had acquiesced in this state of affairs, and it would be disruptive now to alter the jurisdiction with respect to these parcels of land. The Second Circuit has applied the <i>Sherrill</i> decision to other ongoing land claims, reversing the aforementioned damages award in favor of the Cayugas as barred by laches as well. <i>Cayuga Indian Nation v. Pataki</i>, 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005); <i>see also Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. County of Oneida</i>, 617 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>

<p id="c541d945-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> No one today argues that unauthorized state acquisitions of tribal lands were legal in 1795, and few still argue that they were justified at the time. But uncorrected injustice in allocations of property often leads to justifiable expectations by those who later purchase and improve the lands. How should these conflicting expectations — between Indian nations deprived of their homelands and those who later built homes and towns on those lands — be resolved? Do you agree with Judge McCurn that while states may be held liable today for the illegal acquisition of land, private landowners cannot be? Do you agree with the Supreme Court that even when tribes purchase land within their treaty boundaries from private sellers, it is too disruptive for tribes to assert immunity from state jurisdiction on those lands?</p>
<p id="c541d946-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> Many nations face the conflict between past injustice and present land possession. In South Africa, for example, apartheid segregated the races and concentrated all political and economic power in a white minority until the 1990s. Even after the <span title="104" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-104">p. 104</span>formal end of apartheid in 1994, the same white minority owned most of the productive land in the country. Although the country began a voluntary land distribution program, the program stalled because funds that might have been used to pay landowners were necessary for other social and economic programs. In addition, the existing landowners, who could take advantage of economies of scale and had far more capital and experience, were often more productive farmers. In the meantime, some landless black South Africans left desperately overcrowded townships to occupy lands they believed were unowned, or at least unneeded by their owners. <i>See</i> Sharon LaFraniere &amp; Michael Wines,<i> Africa Quandary: Whites’ Land v. the Landlessness of Blacks</i>, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 2004, at A-1.</p>
<p id="c541d947-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one case, over 40,000 squatters moved onto a portion of the Modderklip-Boerdery farm, building a makeshift town with thousands of shacks and streets. Although the lower courts granted Modderklip-Boerdery an order of eviction, when the residents refused to leave voluntarily, the sheriff demanded that Modderklip-Boerdery provide a deposit of 1.8 million rand (about 200,000 dollars) to cover the costs of the security firm the sheriff would need to hire to assist with the removal. The owner appealed, and the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa held that because government enforcement of property rights is an essential part of property, denying enforcement was therefore the equivalent of a taking of property. Eviction without provision of alternate housing, however, would violate the right to housing provided by the South African Constitution. The court found that Modderklip-Boerdery was entitled to damages for the loss of the land, and that the squatters were entitled to stay until the state provided them with other housing. <i>Modder East Squatters v. Modderklip Boerdery (PTY), Ltd.</i>, 2004 (8) BCLR 821 (SCA) (S. Afr.). How should the government respond to such conflicts? What are the potential costs of different courses of action?</p>

<p id="c541d94c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once lands were taken from American Indian nations, they were held by the U.S. government as public lands. How were those lands distributed? The United States adopted a mixed strategy. Although the federal government retained a substantial amount, especially in the western states, it also sold or gave away millions of acres. “A whole continent was sold or given away — to veterans, settlers, squatters, railroads, states, colleges, speculators, and land companies.” Lawrence M. Friedman, <i>A History of American Law</i> 231 (2d ed. 1985). The main reason for getting rid of the land was the promotion of the “basic postulate of American social structure. The ideal was a country of free citizens, small-holders living on their own bits of land.” <i>Id</i>. at 232. Much of the land was granted as a gift under specific conditions rather than sold. A great deal of land was given to colleges and railroads, and other lands were granted to the state governments themselves. At least 130 million acres were granted to railroads. <i>Id</i>. at 415.</p>
<p id="c541d94d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="105" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-105">p. 105</span>Beginning in 1796, land was sold in large tracts for relatively high prices. This policy provoked fears of land monopoly and seemed to favor speculators over farmers. Demands for cheaper, more available land prompted passage of an 1820 law reducing the price of land. Yet many settlers resisted federal policy, occupying federal lands before formally purchasing them. Bowing to settler demands, laws were repeatedly passed giving preferences (preemption rights) to actual settlers, including illegal settlers, culminating in a general law in 1841. That law gave the head of a family who had settled “in person” on land and “improved” it the first claim to buy the land, up to a maximum of 160 acres, at the minimum government price. <i>Id</i>. at 233-234.</p>
<p id="c542005e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Civil War, the <i>Morrill Act</i> of 1862 gave away vast tracts of land to the states: 30,000 acres for each senator and representative the state was entitled to under the 1860 census. The land was to be used to establish “Colleges for the Benefit of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts” — the land grant colleges existing in every state are the result. In addition, the <i>Homestead Act</i> of 1862 granted most heads of families, persons over 21, and veterans (except those who had “borne arms against the United States or given aid and comfort to its enemies”) the right to “enter one quarter section or a less quantity of unappropriated public lands” if they would certify that they wanted the land for their own “exclusive use and benefit” and “for the purpose of actual settlement.” <i>Id</i>. at 416. After five years of settlement, the government would issue a patent for the land. An actual settler who qualified could, however, buy up the land at the minimum price (generally $1.25 an acre) before the end of the five-year period.</p>
<p id="c542005f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The land laws were, in Friedman’s words, “hopelessly inconsistent.” A variety of policies were followed. “Some land was free for settlers; other land was for sale. The government proposed to sell some land to the highest bidder; proposed using other land to induce private enterprise to build railroads; gave other land to the state to fund their colleges.” <i>Id</i>. at 417. The “homestead principle” of “giving land free to the landless poor” was the “weakest of all, and the first to go. The government continued to sell land for cash; and the best land was snapped up’ by speculators.” <i>Id</i>.</p>

<p id="c5420062-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite emphasis on governmental allocation of property rights, individuals and groups often assert property rights inconsistent with the law, and perhaps more surprising, the government often recognizes these assertions by granting formal rights. Eduardo Moises Peňalver and Sonia K.

<p id="c5420067-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The settlers whose Union this was had begun to move into the lands about Pike Creek beginning in the summer of 1835. They were squatters; put less sympathetically, they were trespassers. They might not lawfully come upon the lands before the federal survey was made, and this was not completed in this area until about February 1, 1836; they might not make formal entry and buy until the President proclaimed a sale day, and Presidents Jackson and Van Buren withheld proclaiming these newly surveyed lands until 1839; they might not establish claims by pre-emption, for the existing pre-emption law expired by limitation in June, 1836, and was not immediately renewed because of objections to speculators’ abuses.</p>
<p id="c5420068-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jason Lothrop recalled twenty years later: “Before the lands were surveyed, this often brought confusion and disputes with reference to boundary lines, and still greater confusion followed when the Government surveys were made in the winter of 1835-36. These contentions often led to bitter quarrels and even bloodshed.”</p>

At government auctions, they assembled in force unlawfully to frighten off free outside bidding and prevent competition from forcing any of their company to pay the public land office more than the legal minimum to regularize his holdings. But, as at Pike Creek, while they waited for the public sale day, these settlers all over the central and midwestern states set up local governments in the form of “claims associations,” elected officers with whom to record their land claims and from whom to obtain decisions of conflicts, and then generally abided among themselves by these records and decisions. Often unlawful in origin, settlement nevertheless quickly brought effective demand for law.</p>

News of the proclamation helped fuel a rumor that the president had revoked the Emancipation Proclamation. Some refused to abandon their land. In Norfolk County, Virginia, ex-slave Richard Parker urged his fellow freedmen to fight to defend their lands together, arguing that “the white man had secured this land only by forcibly expelling the Indians and he suggested that they now exercise the same prerogative.

<p id="c5424e9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Contemporary implications.</b> <i>Johnson v. M’Intosh</i> discussed the acquisition of vast amounts of land from American Indian nations. A great deal of this land was given to the railroads for free. In the middle of the nineteenth century, land grants to railroads encompassed 155 million acres, “or more than one fourth of the Louisiana purchase, one ninth of what was then the nation’s entire land area.” Dee Brown, <i>Hear That Lonesome Whistle Blow</i> 176-177 (1977). Other land in the West was sold or distributed by the government at below-market prices. Still other land was sold at fair market value; some of this land went to speculators who resold it. James Willard Hurst notes that squatters often defeated federal land policies by trespassing on public lands; many of their claims were later recognized by the federal government. Leon Litwack recounts how freed slaves were denied not only access to land but also compensation for their years of unpaid labor; they were often constrained by economic necessity to continue working that same land, sometimes for the same master.</p>
<p id="c5424e9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Together, these historical reports suggest an activist government taking and distributing land for a variety of purposes. They also suggest a fair amount of self-help and creation of law by communities of settlers who squatted on government land. What implications does such government policy have for us today?</p>

Squatters on tribal land.</b> A perennial problem was what to do about squatters who illegally entered tribal or federal lands without a permit from the federal government or a federal patent. Sometimes the United States used force to remove such trespassers. It might do so to ensure an orderly transfer of property and to give each person an equal chance to acquire the best lands. But politics often caused the government to look away when illegal settlements occurred. Pressure from illegal squatters also often led the United States to pressure tribes to sign new treaties giving up yet more land. The famous legal battle between the Cherokee Nation and the State of Georgia resulted from Cherokee refusal to bow to this pressure; the Cherokees won an initial legal victory in <i>Worcester v. Georgia</i>, 31 U.S. 515 (1832), but the United States ultimately forced the Cherokees off the land in what has become known as the Trail of Tears.</p>

<p id="c5424ea5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The constitutions of some countries, such as South Africa, contain a right to housing and basic welfare needs. <i>See, e.g</i>., S. Afr. Const. ch. 2, §26 (“Everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing”); S. Afr. Const. ch. 2, §27(1) (“Everyone has the right to have access to a. health care services, including reproductive health care; b. sufficient food and water; and c. social security, including, if they are unable to support themselves and their dependants, appropriate social assistance”). The U.S. Constitution does not contain such a guarantee. In 1969, Professor Frank Michelman argued that the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted to require the states to provide minimum levels of government financial assistance sufficient to enable the poor to provide for their basic needs and to avoid severe deprivation. In effect, he suggested that individuals have a constitutional right to minimum protection to obtain access to the means necessary for human life. Frank Michelman, <i>Foreword: On Protecting the Poor Through the Fourteenth Amendment</i>, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 7 (1969); <i>see also</i> Frank <span title="110" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-110">p. 110</span>Michelman, <i>In Pursuit of Constitutional Welfare Rights: One View of Rawls’ Theory of Justice</i>, 121 U.

<p id="c54275b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York Constitution requires provision of social welfare for the needy, but its enforcement is subject to legislative discretion. N.Y. Const. art. XVII, §1 (“The aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state and by such of its subdivisions, and in such manner and by such means, as the legislature may from time to time determine”); <i>Tucker v. Toia</i>, 371 N.E.2d 449, 451 (N.Y. 1977) (although the legislature has the discretion to determine the means and amount of aid to the needy, the constitution prohibits the legislature from refusing to aid those it has classified as needy). Some courts have interpreted their state welfare statutes to impose obligations on the legislature to provide sufficient funding to enable families to live with their children and avoid placing their children in foster care. <i>See, e.g., Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless v. Secretary of Human Services</i>, 511 N.E.2d 603 (Mass. 1987); <i>Jiggetts v. Grinker</i>, 553 N.E.2d 570 (N.Y. 1990); <i>Hodge v. Ginsberg</i>, 303 S.E.2d 245 (W. Va. 1983). Such rulings are subject to legislative amendment; the Massachusetts legislature overruled the <i>Massachusetts Coalition</i> case by inserting the words “subject to appropriation” in the statute. <i>See, e.g</i>., Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 18, §2. Most state courts have agreed with a New Jersey court that ruled that “the extent to which funds are to be made available to meet the standard of need under New Jersey statutes is a political question to be decided by the representatives of the people.” <i>In re Petitions for Rulemaking</i>, 538 A.2d 1302 (N.J.

However, in 1996, Congress passed the <i>Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§601-619. This “welfare reform” bill abolished the old <i>Aid to Families with Dependent Children</i> (AFDC) program and replaced it with <i>Temporary Assistance to Needy Families</i> (TANF). The new law abolishes the welfare entitlement and replaces it with a more limited right to temporary assistance with a five-year lifetime limit on such government benefits and a requirement that recipients start working within two years in order to continue receiving benefits. States are empowered to apply even more stringent requirements, such as requiring recipients to go to work immediately, a policy that was originally adopted in Wisconsin. Wis.

<p id="c54275be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">John Locke famously asserted that labor and investment were the basis for property rights: “Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.” John Locke, <i>Second Treatise on Government</i>, ch. 5 §27 (1690). But labor only sometimes results in property rights. Even Locke immediately qualified his statement with the proviso that it would only apply “at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.” <i>Id.</i> What role should labor and investment play in claims to property? What kinds of labor are sufficient? Must the labor increase the objective value of the resource? How much does the individual’s labor have to contribute to the final product as compared to the raw materials?

<p id="c5429cd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice M<span class="epub-small-caps">AHLON</span> P<span class="epub-small-caps">ITNEY</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5429cd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties are competitors in the gathering and distribution of news and its publication for profit in newspapers throughout the United States. The Associated Press, which was complainant in the District Court, is a co-operative organization, incorporated under the <i>Membership Corporations Law</i> of the state of New York, its members being individuals who are either proprietors or representatives of about 950 daily newspapers published in all parts of the United States. Complainant gathers in all parts of the world, by means of various instrumentalities of its own, by exchange with its members, and by other appropriate means, news and intelligence of current and recent events of interest to newspaper readers and distributes it daily to its members for publication in their newspapers. The cost of the service, amounting approximately to $3,500,000 per annum, is assessed upon the members and becomes a part of their costs of operation, to be recouped, presumably with profit, through the publication of their several newspapers. Under complainant’s by-laws each member agrees upon assuming membership that news received through complainant’s service is received exclusively for publication in a particular newspaper, language, and place specified in the certificate of membership, that no other use of it shall be permitted, and that no member shall furnish or permit any one in his employ or connected with his newspaper to furnish any of complainant’s news in advance of publication to any person not a member. And each member is required to gather the local news of his district and supply it to the Associated Press and to no one else.</p>
<p id="c5429cd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant [International News Service] is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey, whose business is the gathering and selling of news to its customers and clients, consisting of newspapers published throughout the United States, under contracts by which they pay certain amounts at stated times for defendant’s service. It has widespread news-gathering agencies; the cost of its operations amounts, it is said, to more than $2,000,000 per annum; and it serves about 400 newspapers located in the various cities of the United States and abroad, a few of which are represented, also, in the membership of the Associated Press.</p>
<p id="c5429cd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties are in the keenest competition between themselves in the distribution of news throughout the United States; and so, as a rule, are the newspapers that they serve, in their several districts.</p>
<p id="c5429cda-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The value of the service, and of the news furnished, depends upon the promptness of transmission, as well as upon the accuracy and impartiality of the news; it being essential that the news be transmitted to members or subscribers as early or earlier than similar information can be furnished to competing newspapers by other news services, and that the news furnished by each agency shall not be furnished to newspapers which do not contribute to the expense of gathering it. And further, to quote from the answer:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5429cdb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prompt knowledge and publication of worldwide news is essential to the conduct of a modern newspaper, and by reason of the enormous expense incident to the gathering <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>and distribution of such news, the only practical way in which a proprietor of a newspaper can obtain the same is, either through co-operation with a considerable number of other newspaper proprietors in the work of collecting and distributing such news, and the equitable division with them of the expenses thereof, or by the purchase of such news from some existing agency engaged in that business.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5429cdc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bill was filed to restrain the pirating of complainant’s news by defendant in three ways: First, by bribing employees of newspapers published by complainant’s members to furnish Associated Press news to defendant before publication, for transmission by telegraph and telephone to defendant’s clients for publication by them; second, by inducing Associated Press members to violate its by-laws and permit defendant to obtain news before publication; and, third, by copying news from bulletin boards and from early editions of complainant’s newspapers and selling this, either bodily or after rewriting it, to defendant’s customers.</p>
<p id="c542c3ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only matter that has been argued before us is whether defendant may lawfully be restrained from appropriating news taken from bulletins issued by complainant or any of its members, or from newspapers published by them, for the purpose of selling it to defendant’s clients. Complainant asserts that defendant’s admitted course of conduct in this regard both violates complainant’s property right in the news and constitutes unfair competition in business. And notwithstanding [that] the case has proceeded only to the stage of a preliminary injunction, we have deemed it proper to consider the underlying questions, since they go to the very merits of the action and are presented upon facts that are not in dispute. As presented in argument, these questions are: (1) Whether there is any property in news; (2) Whether, if there be property in news collected for the purpose of being published, it survives the instant of its publication in the first newspaper to which it is communicated by the news-gatherer; and (3) Whether defendant’s admitted course of conduct in appropriating for commercial use matter taken from bulletins or early editions of Associated Press publications constitutes unfair competition in trade.</p>
<p id="c542c3ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Complainant’s news matter is not copyrighted. It is said that it could not, in practice, be copyrighted, because of the large number of dispatches that are sent daily; and, according to complainant’s contention, news is not within the operation of the copyright act. Defendant, while apparently conceding this, nevertheless invokes the analogies of the law of literary property and copyright, insisting as its principal contention that, assuming complainant has a right of property in its news, it can be maintained (unless the copyright act be complied with) only by being kept secret and confidential, and that upon the publication with complainant’s consent of uncopyrighted news of any of complainant’s members in a newspaper or upon a bulletin board, the right of property is lost, and the subsequent use of the news by the public or by defendant for any purpose whatever becomes lawful.</p>
<p id="c542c3ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering the general question of property in news matter, it is necessary to recognize its dual character, distinguishing between the substance of the information and the particular form or collocation of words in which the writer has communicated it.</p>
<p id="c542c3f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-114">p. 114</span>No doubt news articles often possess a literary quality, and are the subject of literary property at the common law; nor do we question that such an article, as a literary production, is the subject of copyright by the terms of the act as it now stands.</p>
<p id="c542c3f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the news element — the information respecting current events contained in the literary production — is not the creation of the writer, but is a report of matters that ordinarily are <i>publici juris</i>; it is the history of the day. It is not to be supposed that the framers of the Constitution, when they empowered Congress “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries” (Const. art. I, §8, par. 8), intended to confer upon one who might happen to be the first to report a historic event the exclusive right for any period to spread the knowledge of it.</p>
<p id="c542c3f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need spend no time, however, upon the general question of property in news matter at common law, or the application of the copyright act, since it seems to us the case must turn upon the question of unfair competition in business. And, in our opinion, this does not depend upon any general right of property analogous to the common-law right of the proprietor of an unpublished work to prevent its publication without his consent; nor is it foreclosed by showing that the benefits of the copyright act have been waived. We are dealing here not with restrictions upon publication but with the very facilities and processes of publication. The peculiar value of news is in the spreading of it while it is fresh; and it is evident that a valuable property interest in the news, as news, cannot be maintained by keeping it secret. Besides, except for matters improperly disclosed, or published in breach of trust or confidence, or in violation of law, none of which is involved in this branch of the case, the news of current events may be regarded as common property. What we are concerned with is the business of making it known to the world, in which both parties to the present suit are engaged. That business consists in maintaining a prompt, sure, steady, and reliable service designed to place the daily events of the world at the breakfast table of the millions at a price that, while of trifling moment to each reader, is sufficient in the aggregate to afford compensation for the cost of gathering and distributing it, with the added profit so necessary as an incentive to effective action in the commercial world. The service thus performed for newspaper readers is not only innocent but extremely useful in itself, and indubitably constitutes a legitimate business. The parties are competitors in this field; and, on fundamental principles, applicable here as elsewhere, when the rights or privileges of the one are liable to conflict with those of the other, each party is under a duty so to conduct its own business as not unnecessarily or unfairly to injure that of the other.</p>
<p id="c542c3f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question here is not so much the rights of either party as against the public but their rights as between themselves. And, although we may and do assume that neither party has any remaining property interest as against the public in uncopyrighted news matter after the moment of its first publication, it by no means follows that there is no remaining property interest in it as between themselves. For, to both of them alike, news matter, however little susceptible of ownership or dominion in the absolute sense, is stock in trade, to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization, skill, labor, and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay money for it, as <span title="115" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-115">p. 115</span>for any other merchandise. Regarding the news, therefore, as but the material out of which both parties are seeking to make profits at the same time and in the same field, we hardly can fail to recognize that for this purpose, and as between them, it must be regarded as <i>quasi</i> property, irrespective of the rights of either as against the public.</p>
<p id="c542c3f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only do the acquisition and transmission of news require elaborate organization and a large expenditure of money, skill, and effort; not only has [news] an exchange value to the gatherer, dependent chiefly upon its novelty and freshness, the regularity of the service, its reputed reliability and thoroughness, and its adaptability to the public needs; but also, as is evident, the news has an exchange value to one who can misappropriate it.</p>
<p id="c542c3f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The peculiar features of the case arise from the fact that, while novelty and freshness form so important an element in the success of the business, the very processes of distribution and publication necessarily occupy a good deal of time. Complainant’s service, as well as defendant’s, is a daily service to daily newspapers; most of the foreign news reaches this country at the Atlantic seaboard, principally at the city of New York, and because of this, and of time differentials due to the earth’s rotation, the distribution of news matter throughout the country is principally from east to west; and, since in speed the telegraph and telephone easily outstrip the rotation of the earth, it is a simple matter for defendant to take complainant’s news from bulletins or early editions of complainant’s members in the eastern cities and at the mere cost of telegraphic transmission cause it to be published in western papers issued at least as early as those served by complainant. Besides this, and irrespective of time differentials, irregularities in telegraphic transmission on different lines, and the normal consumption of time in printing and distributing the newspaper, result in permitting pirated news to be placed in the hands of defendant’s readers sometimes simultaneously with the service of competing Associated Press papers, occasionally even earlier.</p>
<p id="c542c3f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant insists that when, with the sanction and approval of complainant, and as the result of the use of its news for the very purpose for which it is distributed, a portion of complainant’s members communicate it to the general public by posting it upon bulletin boards so that all may read, or by issuing it to newspapers and distributing it indiscriminately, complainant no longer has the right to control the use to be made of it; that when it thus reaches the light of day it becomes the common possession of all to whom it is accessible; and that any purchaser of a newspaper has the right to communicate the intelligence which it contains to anybody and for any purpose, even for the purpose of selling it for profit to newspapers published for profit in competition with complainant’s members.</p>
<p id="c542c3f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fault in the reasoning lies in applying as a test the right of the complainant as against the public, instead of considering the rights of complainant and defendant, competitors in business, as between themselves. The right of the purchaser of a single newspaper to spread knowledge of its contents gratuitously, for any legitimate purpose not unreasonably interfering with complainant’s right to make merchandise of it, may be admitted; but to transmit that news for commercial use, in competition with complainant — which is what defendant has done and seeks to justify — is a very different matter. In doing this defendant, by its very act, admits that it is taking material that <span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-116">p. 116</span>has been acquired by complainant as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by complainant for money, and that defendant in appropriating it and selling it as its own is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers that are competitors of complainant’s members is appropriating to itself the harvest of those who have sown. Stripped of all disguises, the process amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal operation of complainant’s legitimate business precisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped, in order to divert a material portion of the profit from those who have earned it to those who have not; with special advantage to defendant in the competition because of the fact that it is not burdened with any part of the expense of gathering the news. The transaction speaks for itself and a court of equity ought not to hesitate long in characterizing it as unfair competition in business.</p>
<p id="c542c3f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contention that the news is abandoned to the public for all purposes when published in the first newspaper is untenable. Abandonment is a question of intent, and the entire organization of the Associated Press negatives such a purpose. The cost of the service would be [prohibitive] if the reward were to be so limited. No single newspaper, no small group of newspapers, could sustain the expenditure. Indeed, it is one of the most obvious results of defendant’s theory that, by permitting indiscriminate publication by anybody and everybody for purposes of profit in competition with the news-gatherer, it would render publication profitless, or so little profitable as in effect to cut off the service by rendering the cost prohibitive in comparison with the return.</p>
<p id="c542c3f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is to be observed that the view we adopt does not result in giving to complainant the right to monopolize either the gathering or the distribution of the news, or, without complying with the copyright act, to prevent the reproduction of its news articles, but only postpones participation by complainant’s competitor in the processes of distribution and reproduction of news that it has not gathered, and only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant’s efforts and expenditure, to the partial exclusion of complainant, and in violation of the principle that underlies the maxim <i>sic utere tuo</i>, etc.</p>
<p id="c542c3fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice O<span class="epub-small-caps">LIVER</span> W<span class="epub-small-caps">ENDELL</span> H<span class="epub-small-caps">OLMES</span>, J<span class="epub-small-caps">R</span>., dissenting.</p>
<p id="c542c3fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an uncopyrighted combination of words is published there is no general right to forbid other people repeating them — in other words there is no property in the combination or in the thoughts or facts that the words express. Property, a creation of law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable — a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference, and a person is not excluded from using any combination of words merely because some one has used it before, even if it took labor and genius to make it. If a given person is to be prohibited from making the use of words that his neighbors are free to make some other ground must be found. One such ground is vaguely expressed in the phrase unfair trade. This means that the words are repeated by a competitor in business in such a way as to convey a misrepresentation that materially injures the person who first used them, by appropriating <span title="117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-117">p. 117</span>credit of some kind which the first user has earned. The ordinary case is a representation by device, appearance, or other indirection that the defendant’s goods come from the plaintiff. But the only reason why it is actionable to make such a representation is that it tends to give the defendant an advantage in his competition with the plaintiff and that it is thought undesirable that an advantage should be gained in that way. Apart from that the defendant may use such unpatented devices and uncopyrighted combinations of words as he likes. The ordinary case, I say, is palming off the defendant’s product as the plaintiff’s but the same evil may follow from the opposite falsehood — from saying whether in words or by implication that the plaintiff’s product is the defendant’s, and that, it seems to me, is what has happened here.</p>
<p id="c542eb0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fresh news is got only by enterprise and expense. To produce such news as it is produced by the defendant represents by implication that it has been acquired by the defendant’s enterprise and at its expense. When it comes from one of the great news collecting agencies like the Associated Press, the source generally is indicated, plainly importing that credit; and that such a representation is implied may be inferred with some confidence from the unwillingness of the defendant to give the credit and tell the truth. If the plaintiff produces the news at the same time that the defendant does, the defendant’s presentation impliedly denies to the plaintiff the credit of collecting the facts and assumes that credit to the defendant. If the plaintiff is later in Western cities it naturally will be supposed to have obtained its information from the defendant. The falsehood is a little more subtle, the injury, a little more indirect, than in ordinary cases of unfair trade, but I think that the principle that condemns the one condemns the other. It is a question of how strong an infusion of fraud is necessary to turn a flavor into a poison. The dose seems to me strong enough here to need a remedy from the law. But as, in my view, the only ground of complaint that can be recognized without legislation is the implied misstatement, it can be corrected by stating the truth; and a suitable acknowledgment of the source is all that the plaintiff can require. I think that within the limits recognized by the decision of the Court the defendant should be enjoined from publishing news obtained from the Associated Press for hours after publication by the plaintiff unless it gives express credit to the Associated Press; the number of hours and the form of acknowledgment to be settled by the District Court.</p>
<p id="c542eb0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice L<span class="epub-small-caps">OUIS</span> D. B<span class="epub-small-caps">RANDEIS</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c542eb0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are published in the United States about 2,500 daily papers. More than 800 of them are supplied with domestic and foreign news of general interest by the Associated Press — a corporation without capital stock which does not sell news or earn or seek to earn profits, but serves merely as an instrumentality by means of which these papers supply themselves at joint expense with such news. Papers not members of the Associated Press depend for their news of general interest largely upon agencies organized for profit. Among these agencies is the International News Service which supplies news to about 400 subscribing papers. It has, like the Associated Press, bureaus and correspondents in this and foreign countries; and its annual expenditures in gathering and distributing news is about $2,000,000. Ever since its organization in 1909, it has included among the sources from which it gathers news, copies (purchased in the <span title="118" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-118">p. 118</span>open market) of early editions of some papers published by members of the Associated Press and the bulletins publicly posted by them.</p>
<p id="c542eb0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No question of statutory copyright is involved. The sole question for our consideration is this: Was the International News Service properly enjoined from using, or causing to be used gainfully, news of which it acquired knowledge by lawful means (namely, by reading publicly posted bulletins or papers purchased by it in the open market) merely because the news had been originally gathered by the Associated Press and continued to be of value to some of its members, or because it did not reveal the source from which it was acquired? . . . </p>
<p id="c542eb10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An essential element of individual property is the legal right to exclude others from enjoying it. If the property is private, the right of exclusion may be absolute; if the property is affected with a public interest, the right of exclusion is qualified. But the fact that a product of the mind has cost its producer money and labor, and has a value for which others are willing to pay, is not sufficient to ensure to it this legal attribute of property. The general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productions — knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and ideas — become, after voluntary communication to others, free as the air to common use. Upon these incorporeal productions the attribute of property is continued after such communication only in certain classes of cases where public policy has seemed to demand it. These exceptions are confined to productions which, in some degree, involve creation, invention, or discovery. But by no means all such are endowed with this attribute of property. The creations which are recognized as property by the common law are literary, dramatic, musical, and other artistic creations; and these have also protection under the copyright statutes. The inventions and discoveries upon which this attribute of property is conferred only by statute, are the few comprised within the patent law. There are also many other cases in which courts interfere to prevent curtailment of plaintiff’s enjoyment of incorporeal productions; and in which the right to relief is often called a property right, but is such only in a special sense. In those cases, the plaintiff has no absolute right to the protection of his production; he has merely the qualified right to be protected as against the defendant’s acts, because of the special relation in which the latter stands or the wrongful method or means employed in acquiring the knowledge or the manner in which it is used. Protection of this character is afforded where the suit is based upon breach of contract or of trust or upon unfair competition.</p>
<p id="c542eb11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff contended that defendant’s practice constitutes unfair competition, because there is “appropriation without cost to itself of values created by” the plaintiff; and it is upon this ground that the decision of this court appears to be based. To appropriate and use for profit, knowledge and ideas produced by other men, without making compensation or even acknowledgment, may be inconsistent with a finer sense of propriety; but, with the exceptions indicated above, the law has heretofore sanctioned the practice. Thus it was held that one may ordinarily make and sell anything in any form, may copy with exactness that which another has produced, or may otherwise use his ideas without his consent and without the payment of compensation, and yet not inflict a legal injury; and that ordinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then <span title="119" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-119">p. 119</span>use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce.</p>

<p id="c542eb18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The means by which the International News Service obtains news gathered by the Associated Press is also clearly unobjectionable. It is taken from papers bought in the open market or from bulletins publicly posted. No breach of contract or of trust, and neither fraud nor force, is involved. The manner of use is likewise unobjectionable. No reference is made by word or by act to the Associated Press, either in transmitting the news to subscribers or by them in publishing it in their papers. Neither the International News Service nor its subscribers is gaining or seeking to gain in its business a benefit from the reputation of the Associated Press. They are merely using its product without making compensation. That they have a legal right to do, because the product is not property, and they do not stand in any relation to the Associated Press, either of contract or of trust, which otherwise precludes such use. The argument is not advanced by characterizing such taking and use a misappropriation.</p>
<p id="c542eb19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The great development of agencies now furnishing country-wide distribution of news, the vastness of our territory, and improvements in the means of transmitting intelligence, have made it possible for a news agency or newspapers to obtain, without paying compensation, the fruit of another’s efforts and to use news so obtained gainfully in competition with the original collector. The injustice of such action is obvious. But to give relief against it would involve more than the application of existing rules of law to new facts. It would require the making of a new rule in analogy to existing ones. The unwritten law possesses capacity for growth; and has often satisfied new demands for justice by invoking analogies or by expanding a rule or principle. This process has been in the main wisely applied and should not be discontinued. Where the problem is relatively simple, as it is apt to be when private interests only are involved, it generally proves adequate. But with the increasing complexity of society, the public interest tends to become omnipresent; and the problems presented by new demands for justice cease to be simple. Then the creation or recognition by courts of a new private right may work serious injury to the general public, unless the boundaries of the right are definitely established and wisely guarded. In order to reconcile the new private right with the public interest, it may be necessary to prescribe limitations and <span title="120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-120">p. 120</span>rules for its enjoyment; and also to provide administrative machinery for enforcing the rules. It is largely for this reason that, in the effort to meet the many new demands for justice incident to a rapidly changing civilization, resort to legislation has latterly been had with increasing frequency.</p>
<p id="c543122a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule for which the plaintiff contends would effect an important extension of property rights and a corresponding curtailment of the free use of knowledge and of ideas; and the facts of this case admonish us of the danger involved in recognizing such a property right in news, without imposing upon news-gatherers corresponding obligations. A large majority of the newspapers and perhaps half the newspaper readers of the United States are dependent for their news of general interest upon agencies other than the Associated Press. The channel through which about 400 of these papers received, as the plaintiff alleges, “a large amount of news relating to the European war of the greatest importance and of intense interest to the newspaper reading public” was suddenly closed. The closing to the International News Service of these channels for foreign news (if they were closed) was due not to unwillingness on its part to pay the cost of collecting the news, but to the prohibitions imposed by foreign governments upon its securing news from their respective countries and from using cable or telegraph lines running therefrom. For aught that appears, all of the 400 subscribers of the International News Service would gladly have then become members of the Associated Press, if they could have secured election thereto.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105F7_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N105F7_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span></p>
<p id="c543122c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another, would consider such facts and possibilities and others which appropriate inquiry might disclose. Legislators might conclude that it was impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied. Or legislators dealing with the subject might conclude, that the right to news values should be protected to the extent of permitting recovery of damages for any unauthorized use, but that protection by injunction should be denied.</p>
<p id="c543122d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Or again, a Legislature might conclude that it was unwise to recognize even so limited a property right in published news as that above indicated; but that a news agency should, on some conditions, be given full protection of its business; and to that end a remedy by injunction as well as one for damages should be granted, where news collected by it is gainfully used without permission. If legislators reached that conclusion, they would probably go further, and prescribe the conditions under which and the extent to which the protection should be afforded; and they might also provide the administrative machinery necessary for insuring to the public, the press, and the news agencies, full enjoyment of the rights so conferred.</p>
<p id="c543122e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts are ill-equipped to make the investigations which should precede a determination of the limitations which should be set upon any property right in news or of the circumstances under which news gathered by a private agency should be deemed <span title="121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-121">p. 121</span>affected with a public interest. Courts would be powerless to prescribe the detailed regulations essential to full enjoyment of the rights conferred or to introduce the machinery required for enforcement of such regulations. Considerations such as these should lead us to decline to establish a new rule of law in the effort to redress a newly disclosed wrong, although the propriety of some remedy appears to be clear.</p>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5431230-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="c5431231-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Copying and property.</b> The case for labor as a justification for property rights is easiest when the claimants claim ownership of tangible objects. But what if the competitor doesn’t want the physical thing, but simply wants to copy the result? Generally, the law poses no obstacle. If my neighbor discovers through much experiment and research that a valuable food crop grows abundantly in the area, there is no barrier to me planting the same crop, with the same methods, next door. Indeed, at early common law, there would be nothing to stop anyone from copying the text of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and selling the reproductions without giving J.K. Rowling a cent. <i>INS v. AP</i> discusses some of the policy tensions involved in the choice to give creators a right to consent to copying. What are the arguments in favor of giving creators the right to consent before others can copy their works? What are the arguments against giving creators rights?</p>
<p id="c5431232-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Property or unfair competition?</b> <i>INS v. AP</i> resolves these tensions by creating what has been called “quasi property.” Note the limits on this protection. If I read an AP story in the newspaper, nothing prevents me from telling all my friends about what I just read. Nor does the holding prevent INS from using the facts reported in the story in another story published several months later. AP’s rights extend only against competitors in the news business, and only for the limited time necessary to allow it to profit from its labor. Some have argued that the <i>INS v. AP</i> rule is not really about property at all, but is instead a rule against unfair competition. <i>See</i> Shyamkrishna Balganesh, <i>“Hot News”: The Enduring Myth of Property in News</i>, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 419 (2011). One could also see the case as an example of the property doctrine of “relativity of title” — the question is not whether plaintiff would win against everyone in the world but only whether plaintiff’s title is better than defendant’s title.</p>
<p id="c5431233-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Institutional competence.</b> Justice Brandeis’s dissent focuses less on what, if any, rights AP should have than on which institution, the legislature or the courts, should determine those rights. Why does he argue that this dispute is particularly ill suited to judicial resolution? Are you convinced? If you were representing AP, how would you rebut his argument?</p>
<p id="c5431234-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Which comes first — exchangeable value or exclusive rights to exchange?</b> Justice Pitney suggests that there is a property right in fresh news because it has “exchange value, dependent on its novelty and freshness.” <i>Id.</i> at 238. Because it is valuable, it should be protected as a property right with rules against misappropriation by a competitor. But Justice Pitney also states that the news will have no value unless it is legally protected; allowing INS to disseminate information collected by AP <span title="122" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-122">p. 122</span>would render news collection “profitless, or so little profitable as in effect to cut off the service by rendering the cost prohibitive in comparison with the return.” So is news valuable or isn’t it?</p>
<p id="c5431235-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Holmes dissents, arguing that there is no property in fresh news. “Property, a creation of law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable — a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference.” Well, yes, but this doesn’t establish that there shouldn’t be a property right in news. Do you see why?</p>
<p id="c5433846-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all valuable interests are privately owned; many of the most valuable pieces of information, such as scientific truths or historical facts, are the common property of humankind. News does have value to many people. At the same time, its market value will vary depending on how much legal protection the courts grant for the news as against competitors. The greater the legal protection granted the plaintiff’s interest, the more valuable the property interest to the plaintiff. Is there a way out of this circle?</p>
<p id="c5433847-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. The common law hot news tort.</b> The precedential value of <i>INS v. AP</i> was abrogated by <i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins</i>, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), which held that federal courts could not create common law where state law created the rule of decision. But state courts have adopted the doctrine as a matter of state law. In <i>National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc</i>., 105 F.3d 841, 853 (2d Cir. 1997), the Second Circuit summarized New York’s common law hot news tort as requiring three elements:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-parenlistlcroman">
<li><p id="c5433848-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">time-sensitive factual information,</p></li>
<li><p id="c5433849-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">free-riding by a defendant, and </p></li>
<li><p id="c543384a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">a threat to “the very existence of the product or service provided by the plaintiff.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="c543384b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that case, the NBA brought a complaint against the manufacturer of handheld pagers that provided “real-time” information about professional basketball games, including updated scores and statistics as the games were in process. How do the three factors above apply to the NBA claim? Why do you think the Second Circuit rejected it?</p>
<p id="c543384c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Intellectual property statutes.</b> Part of the argument that the courts should not grant relief to AP is that federal statutes already provided significant protection for creative works, and those statutes did not prohibit the INS conduct. Copyright, patent, and trademark law are the core areas of federal intellectual property protection. Copyright and patent law are designed to fulfill the constitutional authorization to “promote the Progress of Science and the useful arts,” U.S. Const. art. 1, §8, while trademark law is an outgrowth of common law protection. Chapter 3 provides a more detailed discussion of these laws.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c543384d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Copyright.</b> Copyright applies to “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,” including literary, musical, dramatic, and pictorial works. 17 U.S.C. §102. It gives owners of the copyright the exclusive right to use or authorize the use of the work for a limited time. After that, the work enters the <span title="123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-123">p. 123</span>public domain and can be copied by anyone. Interestingly, John Locke, associated in property theory with the idea that labor gives rise to property rights, strongly advocated for time limits on the rights accorded by the Statute of Anne (1710), the original English copyright statute. The Statute of Anne granted authors rights for 14 years after publication, with the option of a single additional 14-year term; rights did not continue after the death of the author. In the United States, the period of exclusive copyright has progressively lengthened, and is now generally the author’s life plus 70 years after the date of publication, or 95 years after publication or 120 years after creation for works made for hire. 17 U.S.C. §302.</p>
<p id="c543384e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that although AP could have copyrighted its articles, the law as it existed at the time required registration of the work, which was impracticable given the volume and time sensitivity of its articles. Copyright also would not have protected the news itself, only the “medium of expression,” <i>i.e.</i>, the writing used to convey the news.</p>
<p id="c543384f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Patent.</b> Patents may be issued to anyone who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” 35 U.S.C. §101. Unlike modern copyright law, protection in patent law depends on registration of the invention; before issuing a patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that the subject of the patent is both new and non-obvious. (These decisions are sometimes questionable; in 2002, the PTO issued a patent to Ross E. Long, III for “an apparatus for use as a toy by an animal, for example a dog, to either fetch carry or chew . . . that resembles a branch in appearance . . . formed of any of a number of materials including . . . wood.” U.S. Patent No. 6,360,693. That’s right, he patented a stick for dogs.) Patents generally last 20 years from the date of issuance before they enter the public domain. 35 U.S.C. §154. What explains the shorter period for patent as opposed to copyright protection?</p>
<p id="c5433850-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Trademark.</b> Trademark law protects non-functional words, symbols, names, and devices used to identify one’s goods and services. 15 U.S.C. §1127. Trademark does not bar uses of the mark that would not deceive consumers or dilute the value of the mark for the owner. 15 U.S.C. §1125. In particular, parodies and comparisons to existing products are fair game. 15 U.S.C. §1125(c)(3). So Haute Diggity Dog did not infringe Louis Vuitton’s trademark with its Chewy Vuiton plush chew toys, <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC</i>, 507 F.3d 252 (4th Cir. 2007), nor did Saxony Products infringe Guerlain’s trademark by telling consumers that its “Fragrance S” was like Shalimar (although it might have been liable for false advertising). <i>Saxony Products, Inc. v. Guerlain, Inc.</i>, 513 F.2d 716, 185 U.S.P.Q. 474 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>

<p id="c5435f63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> Several lawsuits have challenged practices of “media aggregators,” web sites that provide snippets, photos, or links to content created by others. Most have settled without a reported decision. One that did not settle is <i>Barclays Capital v. Theflyonthewall<span title="124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-124">p. 124</span>.com</i>, 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011). The plaintiffs, Barclays Capital, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley, were firms providing investment and asset management recommendations and brokerage services to their clients.  They all engaged in extensive research in order to advise their clients, and wrote up this research and investment recommendations in reports that they provided to clients and prospective clients before the start of business. One reason for writing the reports was to encourage recipients to purchase the recommended stocks using the firms’ brokerage services. Theflyonthewall.com, which sends a daily e-mail with investment information to subscribers for a fee, obtained these reports and distributed the recommendations (but not the reports themselves) to their subscribers, often before the brokerage firms were able to do so. This reduced the investment advantage of the plaintiffs’ clients, and made it less likely that they would use the plaintiffs’ brokerage services. The district court found the defendant guilty of the hot news tort, <i>Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com</i>, 700 F. Supp. 2d 310 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), but the Second Circuit reversed.

<p id="c5435f67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without intellectual property rights, inventions and artistic creations are, in effect, common property. The physical manifestation of the creation may be owned, but the right to copy and use it belongs to everyone. Common property may be physical as well — public parks, oceans, and highways are in many respects also common property. Much of property law is organized around the idea that common ownership of property results in “tragedy.” As described by ecologist Garrett Hardin,</p>

<p id="c5435f68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tragedy of the commons develops in this way. Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a reality. At this point, the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.</p>
<p id="c5435f69-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, “What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?” This utility has one negative and one positive component.</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-decimal">
<li class=""><p id="c5435f6a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1.</p></li>

<p id="c5435f6c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another; and another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit — in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.</p>

<p id="c5435f6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Garrett Hardin, <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i>, 162 Science 1243 (1968).</p>
<p id="c5435f6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Hardin was an ecologist, tragedy of the commons arguments are common in law and economics analysis. Law and economics undertakes cost-benefit analysis of legal rules to determine whether a change from one legal rule to another will increase or decrease social wealth. Writing a year before Hardin, Harold Demsetz identified the same dynamic, arguing that “communal property results in great externalities. The full costs of the activities of an owner of a communal property right are not borne directly by him, nor can they be called to his attention easily by the willingness of others to pay him an appropriate sum.” Harold Demsetz, <i>Toward a Theory of Property Rights</i>, 57 Am. Econ. Rev. 347, 354-358 (1967).</p>
<p id="c543867f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hardin emphasized governmental controls as a solution to the tragedy of the commons. He even supported forcing individuals to “relinquish[] the freedom to breed” in order to limit the environmental impact of an increasing population. Law and economics scholars more frequently argue for property rights as a solution to the tragedy of the commons. Demsetz argued that creating individual property in valuable resources, where cost-effective, leads to more efficient use because individuals experience a greater share of the costs and benefits of their use. <i>See</i> Demsetz, <i>supra</i>, at 350-353. What are the advantages of property rights over governmental controls? What might the objection of an environmentalist be? More generally, what are the costs of individual property regimes? <i>See</i> Duncan Kennedy &amp; Frank Michelman, <i>Are Property and Contract Efficient?</i>, 8 Cardozo L. Rev. 711 (1980).</p>
<p id="c5438680-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hardin, Demsetz, and classic economic analysis assume that individuals are perfectly rational actors and that rational actors pursue the course of action that will yield them the greatest individual wealth. Contrary to this assumption, experimental studies have shown that people demonstrate far more cooperative and even altruistic behavior than the rational actor model would predict. Interestingly, for certain sorts of interactions, this deviation from self-interested behavior seems to be especially strong among those living in advanced capitalist economies. <i>See</i> Joseph Henrich et al., <i>The Weirdest People in the World,</i> 33 Behavioral and Brain Sciences 61 (2010). People living in such societies frequently demonstrate more cooperative and sharing behavior (at least with respect to certain tasks, such as dividing a pot of money) than those living in less economically developed societies. Why might that be? Henrich <span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>and his collaborators suggest that “norms and institutions for exchange in ephemeral interactions culturally coevolved with markets and expanding larger-scale sedentary populations.”</p>
<p id="c5438681-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is the consequence of modifying the rational actor model for the predictions of the tragedy of the commons? Nobel Prize winning economist Elinor Ostrom and others have pointed out there are many instances of communally created and owned commons property, and that where they exist they are often more productive than neighboring individually owned property systems. <i>See</i> Elinor Ostrom, <i>Governing the Commons</i> (1990). Many of the fastest growing forms of property rely on common ownership and governance. Condominiums and residential subdivisions, where 62 million Americans now live, usually have significant common elements, such as lobbies, streets, and pools, and unit owners have the power to regulate these external elements of the development as a collective. Corporations and partnerships, important drivers of the modern economy, also depend on collective ownership of assets and profits. <i>See</i> Chapter 9, §4.</p>
<p id="c5438682-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>The Comedy of the Commons</i>, Carol Rose argued that for some kinds of property, open access actually increases its value. Rose identified a long history in English and American common law of recognizing public rights in private paths and roads, navigable waterways, and even recreational beaches or maypoles. These public access rights were justified in part by the danger of holdouts, or refusal to sell rights of access, and the difficulty of organizing a diffuse public to bargain with the property owner. More important, they reflected instances where use by more people actually increased the productivity of the property, by creating economies of scale and opportunities for trade and interaction with diverse individuals:</p>

<p id="c5438687-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">John Locke rested his labor theory of acquisition on the grounds that although the resources of the world were given to humanity in common, each individual owned her own labor. In mixing the labor one owned with commonly owned natural resources, one made them one’s own. But the relationship between labor and goods is rarely so direct. Locke himself quickly obscured the relationship between labor and property by asserting that “the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut . . . [t]he <span title="127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-127">p. 127</span>labour that was mine . . . hath fixed my property in them.” Locke, <i>Two Treatises on Government</i>, ch. 5, §29.</p>
<p id="c5438688-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, most of us work to create goods or services for other individuals in exchange for money from yet other individuals, which we then exchange with other individuals for the goods and services we want. Most agree that, in general, this works out better for all concerned. Our clothes and cars, for example, are much more functional and plentiful than they would be if we had to make them for ourselves. Slavery is now illegal, so, in general, today’s workers consent to this exchange. But given that few can be self-sufficient in an exchange-based economy, for most, the consent to work for others is made in the face of few meaningful alternatives. How much control do or should we have over the conditions of our labor? How much should the law intervene to regulate labor conditions?</p>
<p id="c5438689-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Upton v. JWP Businessland,</i> 682 N.E.2d 1357 (Mass. 1997), an employer fired an at-will employee when she refused to work long hours because of her need to be with her young son. “The general rule is that an at-will employee may be terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. Liability may be imposed on an employer, however, if an at-will employee is terminated for a reason that violates a clearly established public policy.” <i>Id.</i> at 1358. Examples of such policies are being “terminated for asserting a legal right (<i>e.g.,</i> filing a workers’ compensation claim), for doing what the law requires (<i>e.g.,</i> serving on a jury), or for refusing to disobey the law (<i>e.g.,</i> refusing to commit perjury).” <i>Id.</i> The question was whether refusing to work overtime in order to take care of one’s child was a public policy that justified denying the employer the right to terminate the employee. The court held that it was not:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c543ad9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no clearly established public policy which requires employers to refrain from demanding that their adult employees work long hours. Nor is any public policy directly served by an employee’s refusal to work long hours. Because no public purpose is served by the conduct for which the plaintiff asserts she was discharged, this case is unlike those cases in which we have held that the employer may be liable for the discharge of an at-will employee.</p>
<p id="c543ad9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To advance her claim that her termination violated public policy, the plaintiff relies on the Commonwealth’s strong policy favoring the care and protection of children. Her theory is that an employer may not properly discharge an employee whose refusal to work long hours is based on her sense of obligation to be with her young child. She argues that meeting the defendant’s demands regarding work hours would cause her to neglect her child in contravention of public policy.</p>
<p id="c543ad9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no public policy which mandates that an employer must adjust its expectations, based on a case-by-case analysis of an at-will employee’s domestic circumstances, or face liability for having discharged the employee. Construing the public policy exception to cover terminations of employees in the plaintiff’s situation would tend to convert the general rule into a rule that requires just cause to terminate an at-will employee. Liability to an at-will employee for a discharge in violation of public policy must be based on general principles, and not on the special domestic circumstances of any particular employee.</p>

It is still the case that more women than men engage in this uncompensated labor. This affects the ability of women to enter the workforce full time and is a primary reason for the continued disparity in incomes between men and women. In 2015, the median income of men who worked full time was $51,212, while the median income of women who worked full time was only $40,742, or 80 percent of male earnings. Bernadette D. Proctor, Jessica L. Semega &amp; Melissa A. Kollar, U.S. Census Bureau, <i>Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015</i> (Sept. 2016), <i>https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.pdf</i>. Most women now work outside the home. The 1996 federal welfare reform statute, the <i>Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§601-619, requires most women with children to do so as a condition of receiving welfare benefits. Despite this fact, the organization of work remains hostile to parents and makes it difficult to meet the challenges of reconciling market work with care of one’s children.

These familial endowments often determine our ability to get and keep other property. In an earlier time, economic status was largely determined by one’s participation in the family business or residence in a family home; today, economic status is significantly determined by familial support for education and skill development. John Langbein, <i>The Twentieth-Century Revolution in Family Wealth Transmission</i>, 86 Mich. L. Rev. 722, 732-734 (1988). While most familial property transfers are voluntary, in many places the law sets a floor that relatives cannot sink below. Both custodial and noncustodial parents, for example, are required to support their children, at least to the age of majority, and all states require some division of property between spouses on divorce or death. The materials below concern debates about how far the obligation of familial support should extend.</p>

<p id="c543d4ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court does have that jurisdiction. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or a modification of a divorce judgment, a trial court may award sums of money out of the property and income of either or both parents for the post-minority education of a child of that dissolved marriage, when application is made there for, as in the case at issue, before the child attains the age of majority. In doing so, the trial court shall consider all relevant factors that shall appear reasonable and necessary, including primarily the financial resources of the parents and the child and the child’s commitment to, and aptitude for, the requested education. The trial court may consider, also, the standard of living that the child would have enjoyed if the marriage had not been dissolved and the family unit had been preserved and the child’s relationship with his parents and responsiveness to parental advice and guidance.</p>

In <i>Ex parte Brewington</i>, 445 So. 2d 294 (Ala. 1983), this Court held that the term “children” in §30-3-1 did not apply only to “minor” children.

<p id="c543d4bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule in <i>Middlebury v. Chandler</i>, <i>supra</i> was clearly based upon conditions which existed at that time. An opportunity at that early date for a common school education was small, for a high school education less, and for a college education was almost impossible to the average family, and was generally considered as being only within the reach of the most affluent citizens. . . . But conditions have changed greatly in almost a century that has elapsed since that time. Where the college graduate of that day was the exception, today such a person may almost be said to be the rule.

It cannot be doubted that the minor who is unable to secure a college education is generally handicapped in pursuing most of the trades or professions of life, for most of those with whom he is required to compete will be possessed of that greater skill and ability which comes from such an education. 244 P. at 266-267.</p>

<p id="c543fbd0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until <i>Ex parte Brewington</i>, 445 So. 2d 294 (Ala. 1983), our cases and the cases of the Court of Civil Appeals held that a trial court had no continuing equitable jurisdiction over the issues or parties to a divorce to require that a noncustodial parent provide support of any kind to any child that had reached the legislatively prescribed age of majority. In <i>Brewington</i>, we expanded our interpretation of the word “children” in the Alabama child support statute, to impose a duty on a divorced, noncustodial parent to support his children who continue to be disabled beyond the legislatively prescribed age of majority. We have previously interpreted the word “education” in the Alabama child support statute to include a college education as a necessary. We now expand the exception to the general rule — <i>i.e.</i>, the rule that a divorced, noncustodial parent has no duty to contribute to the support of his or her child after that child has reached the legislatively prescribed age of majority — beyond <i>Brewington</i>, <i>supra</i> (dealing with a physically or mentally disabled child) to include the college education exception.</p>
<p id="c543fbd1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In expanding the exception to the general rule (that a divorced, noncustodial parent has no duty to support his child after that child reaches majority) to include the college education exception, we are merely refusing to limit the word “children” to minor children, because of what we perceive to be just and reasonable in 1989. The Latin phrase <i>stare decisis et non quieta movere</i> (stare decisis) expresses the legal principle of certainty and predictability; for it is literally translated as “to adhere to precedents, and not to unsettle things which are established.” <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> (5th ed. 1979). By this opinion, we are unsettling things that have been established by the appellate court of this State. However, we are persuaded that the ground or reason of those prior decisions by the Court of Civil Appeals would not be consented to today by the conscience and the feeling of justice of all those whose obedience is required by the rule on which the ratio decidendi of those prior decisions was logically based.</p>

It is a duty which the parent not only owes to his child, but to the state as well, since the stability of our government must depend upon a well-equipped, a well-trained, and well-educated citizenship. We can see no good reason why this duty should not extend to a college education. Our statutes do not prohibit it, but they are rather susceptible of an interpretation to allow it. The fact is that the importance of a college education is being more and more recognized in matters of commerce, society, government, and all human relations, and the college graduate is being more and more preferred over those who are not so fortunate.

At the time of the divorce they had one adult child and two children under the age of majority, a son C.C. and a daughter Ca.C. On April 18, 2011, four days before C.C.’s 19th birthday, Phillip petitioned the trial court to order Carolyn to pay a portion of C.C.’s college expenses.

<p id="c54422ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Alabama child-custody statute is functionally unchanged from its origin in 1852. “Upon granting a divorce, the court may give the custody and education of the children of the marriage to either father or mother, as may seem right and proper. . . .” §30-3-1, Ala. Code 1975. The statute neither defines “children” nor designates when a child becomes an adult and thus ineligible for parental support.</p>
<p id="c54422ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“When interpreting a statute, a court must first give effect to the intent of the legislature. . . .

<p id="c54422f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “plain and ordinary meaning” of statutory language may often be found in a dictionary. The term “children” in §30-3-1, referring to giving “the custody and education of the children of the marriage to either father or mother” appears in the context of the parent-child relationship. The “parent-child relationship,” according to a leading legal dictionary, is “[t]he association between an adult and <i>a minor</i> in the adult’s care, esp. an offspring or an adoptee. The relationship imposes a high duty of care on the adult, including the duties to support, to rescue, to supervise and control, and to educate.” <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> 1402 (9th ed. 2009). The dictionary not only defines “child” in the parent-child context as a minor, but also refers to the fact of custody (“in the adult’s care”) and to the responsibility of the parent to “educate,” both of which §30-3-1 expressly addresses. Therefore, the plain meaning of “children” as that term is used in §30-3-1 unambiguously means “minors.”</p>
<p id="c54422f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law the parental-support obligation ceased at the age of majority. Before the 1980s, this Court uniformly defined “child” in the context of divorce as a minor. In 1983 this Court recognized an exception to the ordinary and common-law definition of “child” as a minor in favor of a “majority trend” in courts of other states to require a noncustodial parent to support a disabled child past the age of majority. <i>Ex parte Brewington</i>, 445 So. 2d 294, 296 (Ala. 1983).</p>
<p id="c54422f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Using as a springboard the substitution of “dependents” for “children” in <i>Brewington,</i> the Court in <i>Ex parte Bayliss</i>, 550 So. 2d 986 (Ala. 1989), “expanded” the <i>Brewington</i> exception to require a noncustodial parent to pay college expenses for children who had passed the age of majority. Regardless of whether the common law might have recognized an obligation to support disabled children past their majority, an issue not before us, it certainly never contemplated granting a divorce court the power to require payment for postminority educational expenses. The common law recognized no such obligation, nor does §30-3-1. </p>
<p id="c54422f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the legislature reduced the age of majority from 21 to 19 in 1975, this Court did not acquire the privilege to raise it back to 21 or higher to serve a “public policy” it thought desirable. By reducing the age of majority by two years, the legislature not only bestowed the burdens and privileges of adulthood upon persons not formerly entitled to them, but also relieved their parents of responsibility for their support during the same period. By reweighing and altering that balance as it pertains to college education, the <i>Bayliss</i> Court improperly overrode the statutory designation of the age of majority.</p>
<p id="c54422f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stare decisis is the principle that, all things being equal, cases should be decided as they have been in the past. The <i>Bayliss</i> Court openly confessed its departure from this principle. Reversing <i>Bayliss</i> and returning to the legislature the power to decide if postminority educational support should be authorized in a divorce case does not make new law but, instead, “vindicate[s] the old one from misrepresentation.” 1 Sir William Blackstone, <i>Commentaries</i> *70. Thus, our decision in this case is remedial, returning the stream of judicial power to its proper channel. </p>

<p id="c5444a0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> A college education has only grown more important in determining life chances since 1983. <i>See</i> Pew Research Center, The Rising Cost of <i>Not</i> Going to College 5 (2014) (high school graduates had 77 percent of the income of college graduates in 1979, but only 62 percent in 2013). What explains the shift between <i>Bayliss</i> and <i>Christopher</i>? What are the differences in legal reasoning between the three opinions?</p>
<p id="c5444a0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> Courts generally hold that children of divorced parents are entitled “to be supported at least according to the standard of living to which they had grown accustomed prior to the separation of their parents.” <i>Pascale v. Pascale</i>, 660 A.2d 485 (N.J. 1995). Does this include an obligation to pay for college? As a general rule, the duty to provide child support does not usually continue past the age of majority. Ironically, the age of majority was reduced from 21 to 18 just as college education was becoming more common. The reduction had nothing to do with family law, but instead was a response to the Vietnam War intended to ensure that 18-year-olds subject to the draft could also vote on the leaders deciding war policy.</p>
<p id="c5444a0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About 14 states permit judges to order noncustodial parents to pay for post-minority education expenses if they find that the parent would have paid for such expenses if not for the divorce. The rest do not permit involuntary orders of support for post-secondary education. <i>See</i> Monica Hoff Wallace, <i>A Federal Referendum: Extending Child Support for Higher Education</i>, U. Kan. L. Rev. 665, 674-676 (2010). Even states that do not permit orders of support for higher education often require child support past the age of majority if the child has significant disabilities that prevent economic self-sufficiency. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Hastings v. Hastings</i>, 841 So. 2d 484 (Fla. Ct. App. 2003).</p>
<p id="c5444a0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3.</b> In holding that divorced parents have no legal duty to pay for their children’s college education, the Florida Supreme Court explained that “[w]hile most parents <span title="134" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-134">p. 134</span>willingly assist their adult children in obtaining a higher education that is increasingly necessary in today’s fast-changing world, any duty to do so is a moral rather than a legal one.” <i>Grapin v. Grapin</i>, 450 So. 2d 853, 854 (Fla. 1984). In Florida, the court noted, married parents have no legal obligation to pay for their children’s college education; thus, the imposition of higher obligations on divorced parents would deny them equal protection under the law.</p>
<p id="c5444a0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should support orders replicate the legal obligations of the parent or the expectations of the child in the absence of divorce? One longitudinal study found that although 88 percent of all college students received parental financial support, only 29 percent of college students with divorced parents received such support from either parent, and only 10 percent of noncustodial fathers provided such support. <i>See</i> Judith Wallerstein et al., <i>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study</i> 335-336 n.6 (2000). Another study found that divorced fathers did contribute to college expenses when they shared legal custody with the mother, but were far less likely to when they lacked legal custody. William V. Fabricius, <i>Listening to Children of Divorce: New Findings That Diverge from Wallerstein, Lewis and Blakelee,</i> 52 Family Relations 385 (2003).</p>

<p id="c5444a12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A gift is a transfer of property from one person to another without payment. <i>Inter vivos</i> gifts are transfers from one living person to another, while <i>testamentary transfers</i> are those effectuated at death through a valid will or inheritance.</p>
<p id="c5444a13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law of gifts requires (1) <i>intent</i> to transfer title, (2) <i>delivery</i> of the property, and (3) <i>acceptance</i> by the donee. <i>See In re Irrevocable Trust Agreement of 1979</i>, 331 P.3d 881, 885 (Nev. 2014). Delivery requires either physical transfer of the object itself or constructive or symbolic delivery. For example, constructive delivery would be recognized if the owner of a locked box gave the only key to the donee. Some courts, however, recognize constructive delivery only if physical delivery is inconvenient or impossible. Today, the delivery requirement may be accomplished by a writing rather than physical delivery. Many states allow a gift to be made through a formal deed or even a more informal writing that indicates a present intent to relinquish possession and to transfer title to the donee.</p>
<p id="c5444a14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To make a gift, the donor must have a <i>present intent</i> to transfer ownership rights in the object. However, this does not mean that actual possession of the gift must be transferred to the donee. For example, a mother could give her daughter a piano but retain the right to keep it in her house until her death. In effect, the mother has retained a life estate in the piano and presently transferred a vested remainder to the daughter. <i>See Gruen v. Gruen</i>, 496 N.E.2d 869 (N.Y. 1986).</p>
<p id="c5444a15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At death, people usually leave their property to a surviving spouse, although they may reserve a portion of the property for the children. If there is no surviving spouse, parents generally leave their property to surviving children with some portion reserved for charitable donations. Property is transferred either by a written will or, in the absence of a will, by the terms of state law, called the <i>intestacy statute.</i> <span title="135" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-135">p. 135</span>Although the law allows individuals to determine who owns property after they die by writing a will, it limits their ability to completely disinherit a spouse. Laws in every state grant surviving spouses some portion of the property owned by the deceased spouse (called the <i>decedent</i>) at death. This topic is covered in Chapter 9, §3.2.B. However, the law in the United States allows parents to completely disinherit their children, leaving them nothing. Most European nations take a different tack, guaranteeing children some portion of the family assets when their parents die, thereby extending to children the same rights granted in the United States to surviving spouses.</p>

Traditionally, donors were not allowed to impose conditions on gifts. Delivery of a gift with intent to transfer title would be held to be irrevocable. <i>Albinger v. Harris</i>, 48 P.3d 711, 719 (Mont. 2002). However, some courts have begun to abandon this rule, and most will do so in the context of gifts given in contemplation of marriage. Because a wedding ring is clearly given under the understanding that the parties would be married, most courts will require the ring to be returned if the engagement is called off. <i>Lipton v. Lipton</i>, 514 N.Y.S.2d 158 (Sup. Ct. 1986); <i>Lindh v. Surman</i>, 742 A.2d 643 (Pa. 1999); <i>Crippen v. Campbell,</i> 2007 WL 2768076 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007).</p>

Div. 1987); <i>Cooper v. Smith</i>, 800 N.E.2d 372 (Ohio Ct.

The government has often distributed property based on possession even when possessors were violating prior law. Yet just as often, possessors’ claims will be defeated in favor of a superior claim. What is necessary to legally possess a wild animal? A home run baseball? Oil or gas?

<p id="c5449848-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cause was argued with much ability by the counsel on both sides, and presents for our decision a novel and nice question. It is admitted that a fox is an animal <i>ferae naturae</i> and that property in such animals is acquired by occupancy only. These admissions narrow the discussion to the simple question of what acts amount to occupancy, applied to acquiring right to wild animals?</p>
<p id="c5449849-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we have recourse to the ancient writers upon general principles of law, the judgment below is obviously erroneous. Justinian’s Institutes, lib. 2, tit. 1, s.13, and Fleta, lib. 3, c.2, p.175, adopt the principle, that pursuit alone vests no property or right in the huntsman; and that even pursuit, accompanied with wounding, is equally ineffectual for that purpose, unless the animal be actually taken. The same principle is recognised by Bracton, lib. 2, c.1, p.8.</p>
<p id="c544984a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Puffendorf, lib. 4, c.6, s.2 and 10, defines occupancy of beasts <i>ferae naturae</i>, to be the actual corporal possession of them, and Bynkershoek is cited as coinciding in this definition. It is indeed with hesitation that Puffendorf affirms that a wild beast mortally wounded, or greatly maimed, cannot be fairly intercepted by another, whilst the pursuit of the person inflicting the wound continues. The foregoing authorities are decisive to show that mere pursuit gave Post no legal right to the fox, but that he became the property of Pierson, who intercepted and killed him.</p>
<p id="c544984b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It therefore only remains to inquire whether there are any contrary principles, or authorities, to be found in other books, which ought to induce a different decision.</p>
<p id="c544984c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Barbeyrac, in his notes on Puffendorf, does not accede to the definition of occupancy by the latter, but, on the contrary, affirms, that actual bodily seizure is not, in all <span title="137" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-137">p. 137</span>cases, necessary to constitute possession of wild animals. He does not, however, <i>describe</i> the acts which, according to his ideas, will amount to an appropriation of such animals to private use, so as to exclude the claims of all other persons, by title of occupancy, to the same animals; and he is far from averring that pursuit alone is sufficient for that purpose. To a certain extent, and as far as Barbeyrac appears to me to go, his objections to Puffendorf’s definition of occupancy are reasonable and correct. That is to say, that actual bodily seizure is not indispensable to acquire right to, or possession of, wild beasts; but that, on the contrary, the mortal wounding of such beasts, by one not abandoning his pursuit, may, with the utmost propriety, be deemed possession of him; since, thereby, the pursuer manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use, has deprived him of his natural liberty, and brought him within his certain control. So also, encompassing and securing such animals with nets and toils, or otherwise intercepting them in such a manner as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and render escape impossible, may justly be deemed to give possession of them to those persons who, by their industry and labor, have used such means of apprehending them. Barbeyrac seems to have adopted, and had in view of his notes, the more accurate opinion of Grotius, with respect to occupancy. The case now under consideration is one of mere pursuit, and presents no circumstances or acts which can bring it within the definition of occupancy by Puffendorf, or Grotius, or the ideas of Barbeyrac upon that subject.</p>
<p id="c544984d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case cited [<i>Keeble v. Hickeringill</i>], I think clearly distinguishable from the present; inasmuch as there the action was for maliciously hindering and disturbing the plaintiff in the exercise and enjoyment of a private franchise; and . . . that the ducks were in the plaintiff’s decoy pond, and <i>so in his possession</i>, from which it is obvious that the court laid much stress in the opinion upon the plaintiff’s possession of the ducks.</p>
<p id="c544984e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are the more readily inclined to confine possession or occupancy of beasts <i>ferae naturae</i>, within the limits prescribed by the learned authors above cited, for the sake of certainty, and preserving peace and order in society.

In a court thus constituted, the skin and carcass of poor <i>reynard</i> would have been properly disposed of, and a precedent set, interfering with no usage or custom which the experience of ages has sanctioned, and which must be so well known to every votary of Diana. But the parties have referred the question to our judgment, and we must dispose of it as well as we can, from the partial lights we possess, leaving to a higher tribunal, the correction of any mistake which we may be so unfortunate as to make. By the pleadings it is admitted that a fox is a “wild and noxious beast.” Both parties have regarded him, as the law of nations does a pirate, <i>hostem humani generis</i>, and although <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>, be a maxim of our profession, the memory of the deceased has not been spared. His depredations on farmers and on barn yards have not been forgotten; and to put him to death wherever found, is allowed to be meritorious, and of public benefit. Hence it follows, that our decision should have in view the greatest possible encouragement to the destruction of an animal, so cunning and ruthless in his career. But who would keep a pack of hounds; or what gentleman, at the sound of the horn, and at peep of day, would mount his steed, and for hours together, <i>sub jove frigido</i>, or a vertical sun, pursue the windings of this wily quadruped, if, just as night came on, and his stratagems and strength were nearly exhausted, a saucy intruder, who had not shared in the honours or labours of the chase, were permitted to come in at the death, and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit? Whatever Justinian may have thought of the matter, it must be recollected that his code was compiled many hundred years ago, and it would be very hard indeed, at the distance of so many centuries, not to have a right to establish a rule for ourselves. In his day, we read of no order of men who made it a business, in the language of the declaration in this cause, “with hounds and dogs to find, start, pursue, hunt and chase,” these animals, and that, too, without any other motive than the preservation of Roman poultry; if this diversion had been then in fashion, the lawyers who composed his institutes would have taken care not to pass it by, without suitable encouragement. If any thing, therefore, in the digests or pandects shall appear to militate against the defendant in error, who, on this occasion, was the foxhunter, we have only to say <i>tempora mutantur</i>; and if men themselves change with the times, why should not laws also undergo an alteration?</p>
<p id="c544bf63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be expected, however, by the learned counsel, that more particular notice be taken of their authorities. I have examined them all, and feel great difficulty in determining, whether to acquire dominion over a thing, before in common, it be sufficient that we barely see it, or know where it is, or wish for it, or make a declaration of our will respecting it; or whether, in the case of wild beasts, setting a trap, or lying in wait, or starting, or pursuing, be enough; or if an actual wounding, or killing, or bodily tact and occupation be necessary. Writers on general law, who have favoured us with their speculations on these points, differ on them all; but, great as is the diversity of sentiment among them, some conclusion must be adopted on the question immediately before us. After mature deliberation, I embrace that of Barbeyrac, as the most <span title="139" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-139">p. 139</span>rational, and least liable to objection. If at liberty, we might imitate the courtesy of a certain emperor, who, to avoid giving offence to the advocates of any of these different doctrines, adopted a middle course, and by ingenious distinctions, rendered it difficult to say (as often happens after a fierce and angry contest) to whom the palm of victory belonged. He ordained, that if a beast be followed with <i>large dogs and hounds</i>, he shall belong to the hunter, not to the chance occupant; and in like manner, if he be killed or wounded with a lance or sword; but if chased with <i>beagles only</i>, then he passed to the captor, not to the first pursuer. If slain with a dart, a sling, or a bow, he fell to the hunter, if still in chase, and not to him who might afterwards find and seize him.</p>
<p id="c544bf64-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now, as we are without any municipal regulations of our own, and the pursuit here, for aught that appears on the case, being with dogs and hounds of <i>imperial stature</i>, we are at liberty to adopt one of the provisions just cited, which comports also with the learned conclusion of Barbeyrac, that property in animals <i>ferae naturae</i> may be acquired without bodily touch or manucaption, provided the pursuer be within reach, or have a <i>reasonable</i> prospect (which certainly existed here) of taking, what he has <i>thus</i> discovered an intention of converting to his own use.</p>
<p id="c544bf65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we reflect also that the interest of our husbandmen, the most useful of men in any community, will be advanced by the destruction of a beast so pernicious and incorrigible, we cannot greatly err, in saying, that a pursuit like the present, through waste and unoccupied lands, and which must inevitably and speedily have terminated in corporal possession, or bodily <i>seisin</i>, confers such a right to the object of it, as to make any one a wrongdoer, who shall interfere and shoulder the spoil. The justice’s judgment ought, therefore, in my opinion, to be affirmed.</p>

<p id="c544bf68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Fairness and justice.</b> The court suggested that Pierson’s conduct in seizing the fox at the last moment was “uncourteous or unkind” but not unlawful. Was Pierson’s conduct unfair? And if so, why should it be lawful? If it was not fair, what was unfair about it? Do you need to know more about the social customs of hunters to answer this question? Or can it be answered without looking into social practice?</p>
<p id="c544e679-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Who do you think had a right to take possession of the fox? Suppose Post had been hunting the fox for a week, and Pierson had been outside for a few minutes before coming upon it and seizing it. Does the principle of rewarding labor suggest giving property rights to Post — who worked for a week toward the goal of getting the fox? Or does it suggest that one who took a week was a poor hunter and deserved to lose the fox to Pierson?</p>
<p id="c544e67a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Social utility.</b> What rule of law would best encourage productive labor? Justice Livingston notes that wild foxes were “noxious beasts” who preyed on barnyards. He suggested that the rules of law should encourage people to hunt them. How could you argue that the rule of law promulgated by the court in Justice Tompkins’s opinion achieved that end? What reasons did Justice Livingston give for believing that his proposed rule would better serve this purpose? With current fears about extinction of <span title="140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-140">p. 140</span>species, how do we determine whether social welfare will be best advanced by promoting hunting of wild animals or by preserving them?</p>
<p id="c544e67b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fox-hunting, as Justice Livingston pictured it, cost hundreds of pounds and countless hours training dogs and horses. Andrea McDowell, <i>Legal Fictions in</i> Pierson v. Post, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 735, 752, 762-763 (2006). The town of Bridgehampton was interested in reducing the fox population, but only paid four shillings as a reward for dead foxes to encourage their extermination. Bethany R. Berger, <i>It’s Not About the Fox: The Untold History of</i> Pierson v. Post, 55 Duke L.J. 1089, 1130 (2006). What does this suggest about Livingston’s argument?</p>
<p id="c544e67c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Certainty.</b> Which rule of law — Tompkins’s or Livingston’s — creates the most certainty about ownership rights? What are the advantages of certainty in property rules? Will the simplest rule necessarily discourage litigation or quarrels between parties or result in the most predictable application by the courts? <i>See</i> Carol Rose, <i>Crystals and Mud in Property Law</i>, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 577 (1988); Joseph William Singer, <i>The Rule of Reason in Property Law</i>, 46 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1375 (2013).</p>
<p id="c544e67d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4.  Trespassing.</b> How would the case have been resolved if Pierson had caught the fox on Post’s land? Should the rule of capture still apply? Would it make a difference if Pierson had begun hunting the fox on his own land and chased it onto Post’s land to make the capture? <i>See</i> Chapter 1, §1.1 (discussing hunting on private land).</p>
<p id="c544e67e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Custom.</b> Justice Livingston’s dissent declares that the dispute should have been “submitted to the arbitration of sportsmen” and decided according to the customs of “votaries of Diana,” <i>i.e</i>., hunters. What would be the advantages of applying the customs prevailing among hunters to resolve the dispute? What would be the potential risks? For an early empirical study examining the prevalence of custom over law in resolving trespass disputes between farmers and ranchers in California, see Robert Ellickson, <i>Of Coase and Cattle: Dispute Resolution Among Neighbors in Shasta County</i>, 38 Stan. L. Rev. 623 (1986).</p>
<p id="c544e67f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the nineteenth century, the customs of the whaling industry were used to resolve a series of cases involving rights to whales. In <i>Swift v. Gifford</i>, 23 F. Cas. 558 (D. Mass. 1872), whalers on the ship <i>Rainbow</i> had harpooned a whale, and continued the chase after the whale broke free with the harpoon still in its side. Whalers on the ship <i>Hercules</i>, however, had spotted and killed the whale shortly before the <i>Rainbow</i> caught up with it. Following the custom that a whale belonged to those whose harpoon remained in the whale, so long as they continued the chase, the court awarded the whale to the <i>Rainbow</i>. In <i>Ghen v. Rich</i>, 8 F. 159 (D. Mass. 1881), the whale had been killed with a bomb lance and immediately sank to the bottom of the sea, rising a few days later to wash ashore on Cape Cod, where it was found and sold to others. In a dispute between the whalers and the finder, the court followed the Cape Cod custom to hold that the whale belonged to the ship that had shot it. Was it more appropriate to apply custom in such cases than to the dispute between Pierson and Post? Why or why not?</p>
<p id="c544e680-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-141">p. 141</span><b>6.</b> Why a lawsuit about a fox? The costs of suit alone would be greater than any possible recovery. Bethany Berger argues that the dispute was really about control of the village common. <i>See</i> Bethany R. Berger, <i>It’s Not About the Fox: The Untold History of</i> Pierson v. Post, 55 Duke L.J. 1089 (2006). Although the New York Court of Appeals treated the land as “waste and unoccupied lands,” the town of Southampton on Long Island had long endured conflicts over control of the common lands in the town and had attempted to solve them by dividing ownership among various interest groups. These included the investors in the original settlement, those who purchased land in the first decade of settlement, the Shinnecock Tribe that had reserved rights in the lands, and all the town residents. Pierson was among the “proprietors” who inherited from the town’s original settlers special rights in undivided lands, while Post’s father was a wealthy merchant who had profited from the West India trade after the Revolutionary War. Professor Berger argues that “Post’s elaborate fox hunt over the commons would have been perceived as [a] display of conspicuous wealth, inimical to the town’s agricultural traditions . . . of puritan thrift,” and the lawsuit may have been “part of this growing conflict over who could regulate and use the common resources of the town, and over whether commerce and wealth would define its social organization.” <i>Id.</i><span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AE4_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10AE4_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span></p>

<p id="c54534ad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1927, Babe Ruth hit sixty home runs. That record stood for thirty four years until Roger Maris broke it in 1961 with sixty one home runs. Mark McGwire hit seventy in 1998. On October 7, 2001, at PacBell Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit number seventy three. That accomplishment set a record which, in all probability, will remain un-broken for years into the future.</p>
<p id="c54534ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The event was widely anticipated and received a great deal of attention. The ball that found itself at the receiving end of Mr. Bond’s bat garnered some of that attention. Baseball fans in general, and especially people at the game, understood the importance of the ball. It was worth a great deal of money<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B4A_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B4A_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> and whoever caught it would bask, for a brief period of time, in the reflected fame of Mr. Bonds.</p>
<p id="c54534b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With that in mind, many people who attended the game came prepared for the possibility that a record setting ball would be hit in their direction. Among this group were plaintiff Alex Popov and defendant Patrick Hayashi. They were unacquainted at the time. Both men brought baseball gloves, which they anticipated using if the ball came within their reach.</p>
<p id="c54534b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Barry Bonds came to bat in the first inning. With nobody on base and a full count, Bonds swung at a slow knuckleball. He connected. The ball sailed over the right-field fence and into the arcade. When the seventy-third home run ball went into the arcade, it landed in the upper portion of the webbing of a softball glove worn by Alex Popov. While the glove stopped the trajectory of the ball, it is not at all clear that the ball was secure. Popov had to reach for the ball and in doing so, may have lost his balance.</p>
<p id="c54534b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even as the ball was going into his glove, a crowd of people began to engulf Mr. Popov. He was tackled and thrown to the ground while still in the process of attempting to complete the catch. Some people intentionally descended on him for the purpose of taking the ball away, while others were involuntarily forced to the ground by the momentum of the crowd.</p>
<p id="c54534b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Eventually, Mr. Popov was buried face down on the ground under several layers of people. At one point he had trouble breathing. Mr. Popov was grabbed, hit and kicked. People reached underneath him in the area of his glove. Neither the tape nor the testimony is sufficient to establish which individual members of the crowd were responsible for the assaults on Mr. Popov.</p>
<p id="c5455bc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The videotape clearly establishes that this was an out of control mob, engaged in violent, illegal behavior. Although some witnesses testified in a manner inconsistent with this finding, their testimony is specifically rejected as being false on a material point. At some point the ball left his glove and ended up on the ground. It is impossible to establish the exact point in time that this occurred or what caused it to occur.</p>
<p id="c5455bc5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-143">p. 143</span>Mr. Hayashi was standing near Mr. Popov when the ball came into the stands. He, like Mr. Popov, was involuntarily forced to the ground. He committed no wrongful act. While on the ground he saw the loose ball. He picked it up, rose to his feet and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p id="c5455bc6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will never know if Mr. Popov would have been able to retain control of the ball had the crowd not interfered with his efforts to do so. Resolution of that question is the work of a psychic, not a judge.</p>
<p id="c5455bc7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The deciding question in this case is whether Mr. Popov achieved possession or the right to possession as he attempted to catch and hold on to the ball.</p>
<p id="c5455bc8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties have agreed to a starting point for the legal analysis. Prior to the time the ball was hit, it was possessed and owned by Major League Baseball. At the time it was hit it became intentionally abandoned property. The first person who came in possession of the ball became its new owner.</p>
<p id="c5455bc9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties fundamentally disagree about the definition of possession. In order to assist the court in resolving this disagreement, four distinguished law professors participated in a forum to discuss the legal definition of possession. The professors also disagreed.</p>
<p id="c5455bca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The disagreement is understandable. Although the term possession appears repeatedly throughout the law, its definition varies depending on the context in which it is used. Various courts have condemned the term as vague and meaningless.</p>
<p id="c5455bcb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While there is a degree of ambiguity built into the term possession, that ambiguity exists for a purpose. Courts are often called upon to resolve conflicting claims of possession in the context of commercial disputes. A stable economic environment requires rules of conduct which are understandable and consistent with the fundamental customs and practices of the industry they regulate. Without that, rules will be difficult to enforce and economic instability will result. Because each industry has different customs and practices, a single definition of possession cannot be applied to different industries without creating havoc.</p>
<p id="c5455bcc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ome cases recognize possession even before absolute dominion and control is achieved. Those cases require the actor to be actively and ably engaged in efforts to establish complete control. Moreover, such efforts must be significant and they must be reasonably calculated to result in unequivocal dominion and control at some point in the near future.</p>
<p id="c5455bcd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule is applied in cases involving the hunting or fishing of wild animals or the salvage of sunken vessels.</p>
<p id="c5455bce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These rules are contextual in nature. They are crafted in response to the unique nature of the conduct they seek to regulate. Moreover, they are influenced by the custom and practice of each industry. The reason that absolute dominion and control is not required to establish possession in the cases cited by Mr. Popov is that such a rule would be unworkable and unreasonable. The “nature and situation” of the property at issue does not immediately lend itself to unequivocal dominion and control. It is impossible to wrap ones arms around a whale, a fleeing fox or a sunken ship.</p>
<p id="c5455bcf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The opposite is true of a baseball hit into the stands of a stadium. Not only is it physically possible for a person to acquire unequivocal dominion and control of an <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>abandoned baseball, but fans generally expect a claimant to have accomplished as much. The custom and practice of the stands creates a reasonable expectation that a person will achieve full control of a ball before claiming possession. There is no reason for the legal rule to be inconsistent with that expectation.</p>
<p id="c54582e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central tenant of [the] Rule [advocated by Professor Brian Gray] is that the actor must retain control of the ball after incidental contact with people and things. Mr. Popov has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have retained control of the ball after all momentum ceased and after any incidental contact with people or objects. Consequently, he did not achieve full possession.</p>
<p id="c54582e1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That finding, however, does not resolve the case. The reason we do not know whether Mr. Popov would have retained control of the ball is not because of incidental contact. It is because he was attacked. His efforts to establish possession were interrupted by the collective assault of a band of wrongdoers.</p>
<p id="c54582e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of fundamental fairness, Mr. Popov should have had the opportunity to try to complete his catch unimpeded by unlawful activity. To hold otherwise would be to allow the result in this case to be dictated by violence. That will not happen.</p>
<p id="c54582e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court sitting in equity has the authority to fashion rules and remedies designed to achieve fundamental fairness. Consistent with this principle, the court adopts the following rule. Where an actor undertakes significant but incomplete steps to achieve possession of a piece of abandoned personal property and the effort is interrupted by the unlawful acts of others, the actor has a legally cognizable pre-possessory interest in the property. That pre-possessory interest constitutes a qualified right to possession which can support a cause of action for conversion.</p>
<p id="c54582e4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]his does not, however, address the interests of Mr. Hayashi. Mr. Hayashi was not a wrongdoer. He was a victim of the same bandits that attacked Mr. Popov. The difference is that he was able to extract himself from their assault and move to the side of the road. It was there that he discovered the loose ball. When he picked up and put it in his pocket he attained unequivocal dominion and control.</p>
<p id="c54582e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If Mr. Popov had achieved complete possession before Mr. Hayashi got the ball, those actions would not have divested Mr. Popov of any rights, nor would they have created any rights to which Mr. Hayashi could lay claim. Mr. Popov, however, was able to establish only a qualified pre-possessory interest in the ball. That interest does not establish a full right to possession that is protected from a subsequent legitimate claim.</p>
<p id="c54582e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An award of the ball to Mr. Popov would be unfair to Mr. Hayashi. It would be premised on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have caught the ball. That assumption is not supported by the facts. An award of the ball to Mr. Hayashi would unfairly penalize Mr. Popov. It would be based on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have dropped the ball. That conclusion is also unsupported by the facts.</p>
<p id="c54582e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both men have a superior claim to the ball as against all the world. Each man has a claim of equal dignity as to the other. We are, therefore, left with something of a dilemma. Thankfully, there is a middle ground.</p>
<p id="c54582e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of equitable division was fully explored in a law review article authored by Professor R.H. Helmholz in the December 1983 edition of the Fordham Law Review. As Helmholz points out, it is useful in that it “provides an equitable way to <span title="145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-145">p. 145</span>resolve competing claims which are equally strong.” Moreover, “[i]t comports with what one instinctively feels to be fair.”</p>
<p id="c54582e9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Hayashi’s claim is compromised by Mr. Popov’s pre-possessory interest. Mr. Popov cannot demonstrate full control. Albeit for different reasons, they stand before the court in exactly the same legal position as did the five boys [in <i>Keron v. Cashman</i>, 33 A. 1055 (N.J. 1896), who found an old sock and played with the sock together until it broke open, spilling out $775. Here, as in <i>Keron</i>, Popov and Hayashi’s] legal claims are of equal quality and they are equally entitled to the ball.</p>
<p id="c54582ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court therefore declares that both plaintiff and defendant have an equal and undivided interest in the ball. Plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion is sustained only as to his equal and undivided interest. In order to effectuate this ruling, the ball must be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties.</p>

<p id="c54582ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Aftermath.</b> The full story of the battle for Barry Bonds’s home run ball is captured in the documentary <i>Up for Grabs</i>. The ball ultimately sold only for $450,000, far less than was expected. (The same collector had purchased Mark McGwire’s record-breaking ball for $3.2 million in 1999.) Popov’s lawyer later sued Popov for his attorneys’ fees, which he claimed at an hourly rate amounted to $473,000. Hayashi, who was an engineering student at the time of the suit, had retained his attorney on a contingency basis and so did not have a legal bill that dwarfed his gains. David Kravets, <i>Lawyer Sues Client Who Caught Bond’s Ball: Fan Owes $473,000</i>, National Journal (Canada), July 9, 2003.</p>
<p id="c54582ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Custom.</b> Ownership of the ball was only up for grabs because the original owner, Major League Baseball, had a policy of intentionally abandoning any balls hit into the stands. Major League Baseball only provides balls in games that are likely to have record-breaking hits, but home teams provide balls for other games and universally follow the same fan-friendly policy. This policy has been a matter of custom and practice for more than 60 years. Could a ball club reverse this policy? In 2001, Raphael Vasquez caught Mike Piazza’s three-hundredth career home run and gave it to his six-year old daughter, Denise. Mets security guards surrounded the father and daughter and forced them to give up the ball, apparently because Piazza wanted it as a souvenir. Could Vasquez successfully sue the ball club?</p>
<p id="c545a9ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about balls that stay in the field? In 2004, backup Boston Red Sox first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz caught the ball that won the World Series for the team, breaking the “curse of the Bambino” of Red Sox lore. When he kept the ball, the Red Sox sued, claiming that Mientkiewicz’s possession was only the result of his employment for the team. Who should win? Does it matter that the stadium was owned by the St. Louis Cardinals, which also supplied the ball? The suit was ultimately settled with the agreement that the ball would go to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. For more on ball ownership, see Paul Finkelman, <i>Fugitive Baseballs and Abandoned Property: Who Owns the Home Run Ball?</i>, 23 Cardozo L. Rev. 1609 (2002). For its surprisingly complicated tax consequences, see Andrew Appleby, <i>Ball Busters: How the IRS Should Tax <span title="146" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-146">p. 146</span>Record-Setting Baseballs and Other Found Property Under the Treasure Trove Regulation</i>, 33 Vt.

<p id="c545aa00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Constructive possession.</b> What would have happened had Popov been able to prove that he got the ball firmly in his glove and was walking away, but the “gang of bandits” subsequently made him lose it? He would win against Hayashi. This illustrates that the doctrine of acquisition by possession does not require continual possession, but rather clear marking of ownership without abandonment of the property. Major League Baseball having abandoned the ball, once Popov had reduced it to his possession it remained in his constructive possession, and he could claim it against all others.</p>
<p id="c545aa01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Equitable division.</b> Scholars have advocated equitable division resolutions to different categories of cases. A 2007 article advocates their use in the case of what the authors call “windfalls,” gains or losses that neither party could reasonably predict, so that the possibility of the windfall would not change the behavior of either party. In such cases, they assert, equitable division is efficient, because a normally risk-averse person would ex ante choose the equal division remedy as insurance against total loss; it is more just because it does not place the unforeseen loss entirely on any one party; and it furthers judicial integrity because it does not force courts into judicial contortions to justify choosing one party or the other. <i>See</i> Gideon Parchomovsky, Peter Siegelman &amp; Steve Thel, <i>Of Equal Wrongs and Half Rights</i>, 82 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 738 (2007). Is this correct? If it is, why aren’t split-the-difference remedies more common?</p>

<p id="c545aa0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a suit by the petitioners, Mrs. Mabel Elliff, Frank Elliff, and Charles C. Elliff, against the respondents, Texon Drilling Company, a Texas corporation, Texon Royalty Company, a Texas corporation, Texon Royalty Company, a Delaware corporation, and John L. Sullivan, for damages resulting from a “blowout” gas well drilled by respondents in the Agua Dulce Field in Nueces County.</p>
<p id="c545aa0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioners owned the surface and certain royalty interests in 3054.9 acres of land in Nueces County, upon which there was a producing well known as Elliff No. <span title="147" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-147">p. 147</span>1. They owned all the mineral estate underlying the west 1500 acres of the tract, and an undivided one-half interest in the mineral estate underlying the east 1554.9 acres. Both tracts were subject to oil and gas leases, and therefore their royalty interest in the west 1500 acres was one-eighth of the oil or gas, and in the east 1554.9 acres was one-sixteenth of the oil and gas.</p>
<p id="c545aa0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was alleged that these lands overlaid approximately fifty per cent of a huge reservoir of gas and distillate and that the remainder of the reservoir was under the lands owned by Mrs. Clara Driscoll, adjoining the lands of petitioners on the east. Prior to November 1936, respondents were engaged in the drilling of Driscoll-Sevier No. 2 as an offset well at a location 466 feet east of petitioners’ east line. On the date stated, when respondents had reached a depth of approximately 6838 feet, the well blew out, caught fire and cratered. Attempts to control it were unsuccessful, and huge quantities of gas, distillate and some oil were blown into the air, dissipating large quantities from the reservoir into which the offset well was drilled. When the Driscoll-Sevier No. 2 well blew out, the fissure or opening in the ground around the well gradually increased until it enveloped and destroyed Elliff No. 1. The latter well also blew out, cratered, caught fire and burned for several years. Two water wells on petitioners’ land became involved in the cratering and each of them blew out. Certain damages also resulted to the surface of petitioners’ lands and to their cattle thereon. The cratering process and the eruption continued until large quantities of gas and distillate were drained from under petitioners’ land and escaped into the air, all of which was alleged to be the direct and proximate result of the negligence of respondents in permitting their well to blow out. The extent of the emissions from the Driscoll-Sevier No. 2 and Elliff No. 1, and the two water wells on petitioners’ lands, was shown at various times during the several years between the blowout in November 1936, and the time of the trial in June 1946. There was also expert testimony from petroleum engineers showing the extent of the losses from the underground reservoir, which computations extended from the date of the blowout only up to June 1938. It was indicated that it was not feasible to calculate the losses subsequent thereto, although lesser emissions of gas continued even up to the time of the trial. All the evidence with reference to the damages included all losses from the reservoir beneath petitioners’ land without regard to whether they were wasted and dissipated from above the Driscoll land or from petitioners’ land.</p>
<p id="c545aa0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found that respondents were negligent in failing to use drilling mud of sufficient weight in drilling their well, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the well blowing out.</p>
<p id="c545aa0e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the findings of the jury the trial court rendered judgment for petitioners for $154,518.19, which included $148,548.19 for the gas and distillate, and $5970 for damages to the land and cattle. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the cause.</p>
<p id="c545aa0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reversal by the Court of Civil Appeals rests [on the ground] that since substantially all of the gas and distillate which was drained from under petitioners’ lands was lost through respondents’ blowout well, petitioners could not recover because under the law of capture they had lost all property rights in the gas or distillate which had migrated from their lands.</p>
<p id="c545aa10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="148" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-148">p. 148</span>[T]he sole question [is] whether the law of capture absolves respondents of any liability for the negligent waste or destruction of petitioners’ gas and distillate, though substantially all of such waste or destruction occurred after the minerals had been drained from beneath petitioners’ lands.</p>
<p id="c545aa11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the more recent trend of the decisions of our state, with the growth and development of scientific knowledge of oil and gas, it is now recognized “that when a[n] oil field has been fairly tested and developed, experts can determine approximately the amount of oil and gas in place in a common pool, and can also equitably determine the amount of oil and gas recoverable by the owner of each tract of land under certain operating conditions.” <i>Brown v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co</i>., 83 S.W.2d 935, 940 (Tex. 1935).</p>
<p id="c545aa12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our state the landowner is regarded as having absolute title in severalty to the oil and gas in place beneath his land. The only qualification of that rule of ownership is that it must be considered in connection with the law of capture and is subject to police regulations. The oil and gas beneath the soil are considered a part of the realty. Each owner of land owns separately, distinctly and exclusively all the oil and gas under his land and is accorded the usual remedies against trespassers who appropriate the minerals or destroy their market value.</p>
<p id="c545d123-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conflict in the decisions of the various states with reference to the character of ownership is traceable to some extent to the divergent views entertained by the courts, particularly in the earlier cases, as to the nature and migratory character of oil and gas in the soil. In the absence of common law precedent, and owing to the lack of scientific information as to the movement of these minerals, some of the courts have sought by analogy to compare oil and gas to other types of property such as wild animals, birds, subterranean waters and other migratory things, with reference to which the common law had established rules denying any character of ownership prior to capture. However, as was said by Professor A.W. Walker, Jr., of the School of Law of the University of Texas: “There is no oil or gas producing state today which follows the wild-animal analogy to its logical conclusion that the landowner has no property interest in the oil and gas in place.” 16 Tex. L. Rev. 370, 371. In the light of modern scientific knowledge these early analogies have been disproven, and courts generally have come to recognize that oil and gas, as commonly found in underground reservoirs, are securely entrapped in a static condition in the original pool, and, ordinarily, so remain until disturbed by penetrations from the surface. It is further established, nevertheless, that these minerals will migrate across property lines towards any low pressure area created by production from the common pool. This migratory character of oil and gas has given rise to the so-called rule or law of capture. That rule simply is that the owner of a tract of land acquires title to the oil or gas which he produces from wells on his land, though part of the oil or gas may have migrated from adjoining lands. He may thus appropriate the oil and gas that have flowed from adjacent lands without the consent of the owner of those lands, and without incurring liability to him for drainage. The non-liability is based upon the theory that after the drainage the title or property interest of the former owner is gone. </p>
<p id="c545d124-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-149">p. 149</span>Thus it is seen that, notwithstanding the fact that oil and gas beneath the surface are subject both to capture and administrative regulation, the fundamental rule of absolute ownership of the minerals in place is not affected in our state. In recognition of such ownership, our courts, in decisions involving well-spacing regulations of our Railroad Commission, have frequently announced the sound view that each landowner should be afforded the opportunity to produce his fair share of the recoverable oil and gas beneath his land, which is but another way of recognizing the existence of correlative rights between the various landowners over a common reservoir of oil or gas.</p>
<p id="c545d125-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must be conceded that under the law of capture there is no liability for reasonable and legitimate drainage from the common pool. The landowner is privileged to sink as many wells as he desires upon his tract of land and extract therefrom and appropriate all the oil and gas that he may produce, so long as he operates within the spirit and purpose of conservation statutes and orders of the Railroad Commission. These laws and regulations are designed to afford each owner a reasonable opportunity to produce his proportionate part of the oil and gas from the entire pool and to prevent operating practices injurious to the common reservoir. In this manner, if all operators exercise the same degree of skill and diligence, each owner will recover in most instances his fair share of the oil and gas. This reasonable opportunity to produce his fair share of the oil and gas is the landowner’s common law right under our theory of absolute ownership of the minerals in place. But from the very nature of this theory the right of each land holder is qualified, and is limited to legitimate operations. Each owner whose land overlies the basin has a like interest, and each must of necessity exercise his right with some regard to the rights of others. No owner should be permitted to carry on his operations in reckless or lawless irresponsibility, but must submit to such limitations as are necessary to enable each to get his own.</p>
<p id="c545d126-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we are cognizant of the fact that there is a certain amount of reasonable and necessary waste incident to the production of oil and gas to which the non-liability rule must also apply, we do not think this immunity should be extended so as to include the negligent waste or destruction of the oil and gas.</p>
<p id="c545d127-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 85 A.L.R. 1156, the annotator states: “The fact that the owner of the land has a right to take and to use gas and oil, even to the diminution or exhaustion of the supply under his neighbor’s land, does not give him the right to waste the gas. His property in the gas underlying his land consists of the right to appropriate the same, and permitting the gas to escape into the air is not an appropriation thereof in the proper sense of the term.”</p>
<p id="c545d128-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In like manner, the negligent waste and destruction of petitioners’ gas and distillate was neither a legitimate drainage of the minerals from beneath their lands nor a lawful or reasonable appropriation of them. Consequently, the petitioners did not lose their right, title and interest in them under the law of capture. At the time of their removal they belonged to petitioners, and their wrongful dissipation deprived these owners of the right and opportunity to produce them. That right is forever lost, the same cannot be restored, and petitioners are without an adequate legal remedy unless we allow a recovery under the same common law which governs other actions for <span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-150">p. 150</span>damages and under which the property rights in oil and gas are vested. This remedy should not be denied.</p>
<p id="c545d129-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In common with others who are familiar with the nature of oil and gas and the risks involved in their production, the respondents had knowledge that a failure to use due care in drilling their well might result in a blowout with the consequent waste and dissipation of the oil, gas and distillate from the common reservoir. In the conduct of one’s business or in the use and exploitation of one’s property, the law imposes upon all persons the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid injury or damage to the property of others. Thus under the common law, and independent of the conservation statutes, the respondents were legally bound to use due care to avoid the negligent waste or destruction of the minerals imbedded in petitioners’ oil and gas-bearing strata. This common-law duty the respondents failed to discharge. For that omission they should be required to respond in such damages as will reasonably compensate the injured parties for the loss sustained as the proximate result of the negligent conduct. The fact that the major portion of the gas and distillate escaped from the well on respondents’ premises is immaterial. Irrespective of the opening from which the minerals escaped, they belonged to the petitioners and the loss was the same. They would not have been dissipated at any opening except for the wrongful conduct of the respondents. Being responsible for the loss they are in no position to deny liability because the gas and distillate did not escape through the surface of petitioners’ lands.</p>
<p id="c545d12a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are therefore of the opinion the Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding that under the law of capture the petitioners cannot recover for the damages resulting from the wrongful drainage of the gas and distillate from beneath their lands.</p>

Is the rule fair? Does it promote or inhibit investment in producing oil and gas? The effect of the rule has been diminished by the correlative rights recognized in cases like <i>Elliff</i> as well as spacing and drilling regulations designed to conserve the resource.

<p id="c545f84d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Plaintiff Thomas Law Willcox found 444 documents from the administrations of two governors of South Carolina during the Civil War in a shopping bag in a closet at his late stepmother’s home. The documents concern Confederate military reports, correspondence, and telegrams between various Confederate generals, officers, servicemen, and government officials, and related materials and have an appraised value of $2.4 million. Willcox allowed the papers to be microfilmed for the state archives. When he tried to sell the papers, Rodger Stroup, director of the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, obtained a temporary restraining order preventing the sale. Willcox then sued Stroup and the State of South Carolina for a declaratory judgment that he owned the papers.]</p>
<p id="c545f84e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The papers seem to have come into Willcox’s family through his great-great-uncle, Confederate Major General Evander McIver Law, who most likely came into possession of them during the February 1865 attack on the South Carolina capital by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman. On February 15, 1865, in anticipation of imminent attack, Governor A.G. Magrath declared martial law in Columbia and appointed <span title="152" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-152">p. 152</span>General Law the Provost Marshal of the city. On February 16, 1865, a large number of State archives and records were removed from Columbia for safekeeping. On February 17, 1865, General Law was relieved of his duties as Provost Marshal, and General Sherman took control of Columbia. The parties submit no direct evidence of how General Law came into possession of the papers, nor is there any suggestion that he did so illegally.</p>
<p id="c545f84f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 16, 1896, General Law wrote a letter to a New York book dealer regarding the sale of some letters which, both parties agree, appear to belong to the collection at issue here. By the 1940s, Mrs. Annie J. Storm, the granddaughter of General Law, was in possession of the papers and attempted to sell them to both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (“UNC”) and the South Caroliniana Library of the University of South Carolina. Mrs. Storm described the documents as “original State House papers entrusted to [her] grandfather at the time of the surrender.” No sale resulted, but the papers were placed on microfilm at the Southern Historical Collection at UNC.</p>
<p id="c545f850-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No evidence has been submitted of the papers’ movements between the time of the Storm correspondence and plaintiff Willcox’s discovery more than fifty years later. The point for present purposes is simply that, while the precise route by which Civil War-era gubernatorial papers arrived in a shopping bag in Thomas Law Willcox’s stepmother’s closet remains a mystery, it appears that the papers have been in the possession of the Law and Willcox families for over one hundred and forty years.</p>
<p id="c545f851-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exceptional nature of the papers in dispute — their early vintage, their unknown history — presents issues distinct from those of the typical personal property case. Without the benefit of clear chain of title, evidence of original ownership, eyewitness testimony, and any number of documentary aids usually helpful in the determination of ownership, the court must utilize the legal tools that remain at its disposal. In this situation, tenets of the common law that usually remain in the background of ownership determinations come to the forefront, their logic and utility revealed anew.</p>
<p id="c545f852-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That possession is nine-tenths of the law is a truism hardly bearing repetition. The importance of possession gave rise to the principle that “[p]ossession of property is indicia of ownership, and a rebuttable presumption exists that those in possession of property are rightly in possession.” 73 C.J.S. <i>Property</i> §70 (2004). The common law has long recognized that “actual possession is, prima facie, evidence of a legal title in the possessor.” William Blackstone, 2 <i>Commentaries</i> *196. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Edward Coke, 1 <i>Commentary upon Littleton</i> 6.b. (19th ed. 1832) (strong presumption of ownership created by “continuall and quiet possession”); <i>Jeffries v. Great W. Ry. Co.</i> (1856) 119 Eng. Rep. 680 (K.B.) (“[T]he presumption of law is that the person who has possession has the property.”).</p>
<p id="c5461f63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This presumption has been a feature of American law almost since its inception. “Undoubtedly,” noted the Supreme Court, “if a person be found in possession . . . it is prima facie evidence of his ownership.” <i>Ricard v. Williams,</i> 20 U.S. 59, 105 (1822). Almost eighty years later, the Court reaffirmed, “If there be no evidence to the contrary, proof of possession, at least under a color of right, is sufficient proof of title.” <i>Bradshaw <span title="153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-153">p. 153</span>v. Ashley,</i> 180 U.S. 59, 63 (1901). In this case, the possession of the Law and Willcox families triggers the presumption of their ownership of the papers.</p>
<p id="c5461f64-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unusual circumstances of this case provide a notable illustration of why such a presumption exists in the first place.</p>
<p id="c5461f65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First and foremost, the presumption operates to resolve otherwise impenetrable difficulties. Where neither party can establish title by a preponderance of the evidence, the presumption cuts the Gordian knot, determining ownership in favor of the possessor. This case shows the need for such a default rule. It presents questions the answers to which remain a mystery. Little is known of the papers’ whereabouts, status, or movements from their creation to their acquisition by General Law. There is no evidence of how General Law acquired the papers. Not even the chain of possession within the Law and Willcox families has yet been determined with any certainty. In fact, in over one hundred and forty years of existence, these papers have apparently surfaced in the historical record only three times: in General Law’s 1896 correspondence, in Annie Storm’s 1940’s correspondence, and in the current litigation.</p>
<p id="c5461f66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case thus poses questions which we are ill equipped to answer. Fortunately, however, the common law reveals its usefulness even in the acknowledgment of its limitations. The presumption of ownership from possession locates the parties’ burdens. Where the party not in possession is able to establish superior title by satisfactory evidence, the presumption gives way in favor of this evidence. But where no such evidence is produced — where, as here, the events at issue are impossible to reconstruct — the presumption recognizes and averts the possibility of a court’s presiding over a historical goose chase.</p>
<p id="c5461f67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the presumption of ownership in the possessor promotes stability. The presumption of ownership from possession is one of an array of legal principles designed to this end. The presumption means that, absent proof to the contrary, settled distributions and expectations will continue undisturbed. Even where evidence overcomes the presumption, other principles work to protect settled expectations, including the statute of limitations, the doctrine of adverse possession, and equitable defenses such as laches, staleness, abandonment, and waiver.</p>
<p id="c5461f68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such principles, working in concert, favor status-quo distributions over great upsets in property rights. At the most basic level, this fosters “the policy of protecting the public peace against violence and disorder.” <i>See Sabariego v. Maverick,</i> 124 U.S. 261, 297 (1888). In contemporary commercial society, it protects the expectations of those in possession, thus encouraging them to make improvements that increase social wealth. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Richard A. Posner, <i>Economic Analysis of Law</i> 80-84 (6th ed. 2003); Thomas W. Merrill &amp; Henry E. Smith, <i>What Happened to Property in Law and Economics?,</i> 111 Yale L.J. 357, 398 (2001) (“[T]he refined problems of concern in advanced economies exist at the apex of a pyramid, the base of which consists of the security of property rights.”). Without rules such as the presumption of ownership, whether public or private, such valuable goals would give way to uncertainty.</p>
<p id="c5461f69-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the resulting confusion is not difficult to imagine. If the State were not required to defeat the presumption in order to gain title, a whole system of archival practice could be thrown into question. The State could claim ownership of other <span title="154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-154">p. 154</span>papers of Governors Pickens and Bonham held by the Library of Congress and Duke University, as well as papers of other South Carolina governors currently at institutions other than the State Archives. The result would be immense litigation over papers held by private owners, universities, historical societies, and federal depositories. It would upset settled archival arrangements and the expectations of institutions and historical scholars alike. Disregard of possession as presumptive evidence of ownership would throw the whole of this important area into turmoil.</p>
<p id="c5461f6a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, while it has never been the practice of federal courts to ignore the law in favor of equitable considerations, it is worth noting that the employment of the presumption in this case in no way frustrates the public interest. Here, private possession does not shut the papers off from access by scholars or, indeed, by the interested public. They have been available for study for decades on microfilm at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and through the permission of plaintiff Willcox the South Carolina Department of Archives and History now also has a copy on microfilm. The papers are thus freely available for perusal and study regardless of who owns the originals. And, of course, if the State values possession of the original documents, it may acquire them on the open market.</p>
<p id="c5461f6b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In short, the common law, through the presumption of ownership in the possessor, resolves otherwise insoluble historical puzzles in favor of longstanding distributions and long-held expectations. Such a rule both protects the private interests of longtime possessors and increases social utility. Of course, this presumption will not always cut in one direction. In many instances, the State will possess the papers, and it will then be entitled to the strong presumption that the private party claims here. In this case, however, where the Law and Willcox families have been in possession for well over a century, the presumption favors plaintiff Willcox.</p>
<p id="c5461f6c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having recognized the presumption in favor of Willcox’s ownership, the court must consider whether the State has rebutted this presumption. In this case, the State has been unable to provide such evidence. There is no documentary evidence of the State’s title, nor is there evidence of its recent possession. While there is no suggestion that the Law and Willcox families are bona fide purchasers, since no purchase was involved, there is also no indication that they acquired the papers in bad faith. In any case, the State’s burden may not be met by challenging the sufficiency of the possessor’s title but only by proving the superior strength of its claim.</p>
<p id="c5461f6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the insufficient factual evidence, the State’s remaining argument for ownership is that, under the law at the time of the documents’ creation (1860-64) or their acquisition by General Law (1865), they were public property. South Carolina law of the relevant time period provides no basis for the State’s claim of ownership.</p>
<p id="c5461f6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he practice in South Carolina accords with common law practice more generally. Presidential papers, for example, were considered private property from the time of George Washington, who following his second term removed his papers to Mount Vernon and bequeathed them in his will to his nephew, Supreme Court Justice Bushrod Washington. <i>See Nixon v. United States,</i> 978 F.2d 1269, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe also bequeathed their papers as private property by will. <i>See id.</i> When Congress first provided public funding for presidential libraries, such <span title="155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-155">p. 155</span>libraries depended upon former presidents to deposit their papers voluntarily. <i>See Presidential Libraries Act of 1955,</i> Pub. L. No. 84-373, 69 Stat. 695 (<i>codified as amended</i> at 44 U.S.C. §2112 (2000)).</p>
<p id="c5461f6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For Congress to change this private ownership regime required a law prospectively granting the United States “complete ownership, possession, and control” of official presidential records. <i>See Presidential Records Act of 1978,</i> 44 U.S.C. §2201 <i>et seq.</i> (implementing process for archiving records and making them publicly available as soon as possible, subject to exceptions for confidential and privileged materials). A previous law, the <i>Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974</i>, Pub. L. 93-526, 88 Stat. 1695, which exerted federal control over former President Nixon’s papers in the wake of the Watergate scandal, was determined to have effected a per se taking of President Nixon’s property interest in his papers. <i>See Nixon,</i> 978 F.2d at 1284.</p>
<p id="c5461f70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the State has failed to establish that South Carolina law at the relevant time treated gubernatorial papers as public property. This conclusion leaves the State with no basis upon which to rebut the strong presumption of possession in the Law and Willcox families and no basis upon which to claim title superior to that of plaintiff Willcox.</p>

<p id="c5464583-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property does not just concern things, it concerns relationships among people with respect to things. Blackstone famously wrote that property conveys rights against “any other individual in the universe.” This image conveys an important insight: unlike most contract rights, many property rights are not simply good against those we have entered into agreement with, but against a wide array of perfect strangers. <i>See</i> Thomas W. Merrill &amp; Henry E. Smith, <i>The Property/Contract Interface,</i> 101 Colum. L. Rev. 773, 780-790 (2001). But it hides an important truth as well: property rights are often <i>relative</i>, good against some under certain circumstances, but not against others. Rights to exclude, for example, do not hold in the face of emergency; it is not trespass to crash your plane on the land of another. <i>See</i> Chapter 1, §1.3. More important here, finding lost property or possessing land, even without official title to the property, will create rights against subsequent possessors, but not against the title owner. This concept, illustrated in materials below, is called <b>relativity of title</b>.</p>

<p id="c5466ca5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Conflicts between finders and subsequent possessors.</b> <i>Armory v. Delamirie</i> illustrates the basic rule: finders will generally prevail against all subsequent possessors of property. What justifies the rule? Is it intended to reward the finder? But the chimney sweep did not go down the chimney in hopes of finding a “jewel of the finest water,” any more than most of us walk down the street in hopes of finding a stray hundred dollar bill. What behaviors, by the finder or others, does the rule encourage or discourage?</p>
<p id="c5466ca6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Conflicts between finders and “rightful owners.”</b> “Finders keepers, losers weepers,” may be the law on the playground, but it is not the law anywhere else. Instead, conflicts between finders and original owners will be decided according to whether the property is considered lost, mislaid, or abandoned. Property is <b>lost</b> when the owner accidentally misplaced it; it is <b>mislaid</b> when the owner intentionally left it somewhere — and then forgets where she put it; it is <b>abandoned</b> when the owner forms an intent to relinquish all rights in the property. Property that has been lost or mislaid may subsequently be abandoned if the owner intends to give up any claim to the property. Finders will lose against original owners of lost or mislaid property; but will win against original owners of abandoned property since the original owner relinquished her rights to it.</p>
<p id="c5466ca7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-157">p. 157</span>Are rights against finders confined to “rightful owners” as <i>Armory v. Delamirie</i> states? Imagine that our chimney sweep forgets the bag with the jewel in it in the fireplace at his next job — can the maid who finds it while sweeping the grate claim it from him? No. The doctrine is not confined to those who have “true” title, but rather those who have better title. Even thieves of personal property may prevail against those who wrongfully take it from them. One decision held that a man who had taken $3,000 from his cousin’s bank account to purchase a car fraudulently using his cousin’s name could sue the car dealership for return of the stolen down payment, stating “the well-settled common-law rule that a thief in possession of stolen goods has an ownership interest superior to the world at large, save one with a better claim to the property.” <i>Payne v. TK Autowholesalers</i>, 911 A.2d 747, 751 (Conn. App. 2006) (citations omitted).</p>
<p id="c5466ca8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Conflicts between the finder and the owner of the premises where the property was found.</b> What happens if a person finds a lost, mislaid, or abandoned object on someone else’s property? In a dispute between the landowner and the finder, the landowner will win if the finder was trespassing at the time she found the object.</p>
<p id="c5466ca9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the finder is on the property with the landowner’s permission, the courts are wildly divided. If an object is found in a private home, it is ordinarily awarded to the homeowner, but if the object is found in a place open to the public, some courts grant ownership to the finder and others to the landowner. Many courts distinguish between lost and mislaid property, awarding lost property to the finder and mislaid property to the owner of the premises, considering the landowner to have been unknowingly entrusted with the property by the person that mislaid it. The rule has been criticized for making much rest on determinations of the unknown owner’s intent, and on perverse incentives it may create for finders. In <i>Benjamin v. Lindner Aviation</i>, a mechanic found $18,000 in old bills carefully rolled up and hidden in the wing of the plane, and turned it in to the police in hopes of claiming it if the owner did not appear, or recovering a statutory finders’ fee. The court, however, found that the money was mislaid, and not lost, and therefore belonged to the bank that had repossessed the plane, and was not covered by the finders’ fee statute. 534 N.W.2d 400 (Iowa 1995); <i>see also Terry v. Lock Hospitality, Inc</i>., 37 S.W.3d 202 (Ark. 2001) (motel owners, rather than renovators, were entitled to $38,000 in old currency found by renovators in the ceiling tiles). <i>But see In re Seizure of $82,000</i>, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1013 (W.D. Mo. 2000) ($82,000 found in gas tank of car seized in drug bust was not mislaid but abandoned, as owners likely chose not to claim it for fear of prosecution). Which rule, one that awarded the money to the finder or to the bank, is more likely to generate return of the money to the true owner? Why were these finds deemed mislaid rather than lost or abandoned?</p>
<p id="c5466caa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If personal property is found <b>embedded</b> in the soil, courts ordinarily award the property — whether lost, mislaid, or abandoned — to the landowner rather than the finder, in the absence of agreement or statute to the contrary, on the ground that it is, in effect, part of the real property. <i>See United States v. Shivers</i>, 96 F.3d 120 (5th Cir. 1996) (old metal tokens found at an old mill site in Angelina National Forest belonged to the United States, not the coin collector who found them); <i>Klein v. Unidentified Wrecked and Abandoned Sailing Vessel</i>, 758 F.2d 511 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that eighteenth-century shipwreck found in Biscayne National Park belonged to United <span title="158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-158">p. 158</span>States, rather than diver who found it). An exception to this principle applies in courts that adopt the doctrine of <b>treasure trove</b>, which is gold or silver (and some courts say paper money) buried or concealed in “antiquity” or at least “so long as to indicate that the owner is probably dead or unknown.” <i>Corliss v. Wenner</i>, 34 P.3d 1100, 1104 (Idaho 2001) (refusing to adopt doctrine). In England, ownership of treasure trove was historically given to the Crown, while in the United States ownership was given to the finder rather than the owner of the land, as long as the finder was not trespassing at the time it was found.</p>
<p id="c5466cab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4.  Restating the rule.</b> The court in <i>Armory v. Delamirie</i> states that a finder gains “such a property as will enable him to keep it against all but the rightful owner.” Is this an accurate statement of the doctrine? How would you rephrase it?</p>
<p id="c54693bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Finders statutes.</b> Many states have legislation concerning lost property. These laws seek to get rid of the distinction between lost, mislaid, and abandoned property. They generally require the finder to report the find to the police and generally award the property to the finder if it is not claimed after a reasonable period, often requiring the true owner to pay some percentage of the object’s value as a reward to the finder. <i>See, e.g</i>., Fla. Stat. §§705.102-705.104 (awarding lost or abandoned property to finder after 90 days if true owner unidentified); Del. Code tit. 11, §8307(c) (lost money is returned to finder, if, after reasonable efforts, police are unable to locate owner). <i>But see</i> Del. Code tit. 11, §8307(a) (property other than money that comes to the police is sold after one year for police benefit). These statutes, however, are little understood and haphazardly implemented, and only a tiny fraction of lost property is turned in to the police or claimed there. In contrast, Japan has extremely high rates of return of lost property via the police. One author explains this phenomenon as a result of well-known policies, including a guaranteed reward from the true owner, effective institutions for implementation, and criminalizing failure to report found property.

<p id="c54693c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff is a former Corrections Officer at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, who describes himself as an “amateur archeologist.” After researching colonial maps, records and texts, he concluded that Trudeau Plantation, near Angola, was the possible site of an ancient village of the Tunica Indians. He alleges that in 1967 he obtained the permission of Mr. Frank Hoshman, Sr., who he believed was the owner of Trudeau Plantation, to survey the property with a metal detector for possible burial locations. After locating and excavating approximately 30 to 40 burial plots lying in a circular pattern, plaintiff notified Mr. Hoshman that he had located the Tunica village. Although the evidence is contradictory, plaintiff contends that it was at that <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>time that Mr. Hoshman first advised that he was the caretaker, not the owner, of the property.</p>

</div>
<p id="c54693c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff continued to excavate the area for the next three years until he had located and excavated approximately 150 burial sites containing beads, European ceramics, stoneware, glass bottles; iron kettles, vessels and skillets; knives, muskets, gunflints, balls and shots; crucifixes, rings and bracelets; and native pottery. The excavated artifacts are estimated to weigh two to two and one-half tons.</p>
<p id="c54693c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In search of a buyer for the collection, plaintiff talked to Dr. Robert S. Neitzel of Louisiana State University, who, in turn, informed Dr. Jeffrey D. Brain of Harvard University. Dr. Brain, who was involved in a survey of archeology along the lower Mississippi River, viewed the artifacts and began discussions of their sale to the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. The discussions resulted in the lease of the artifacts to the Museum, where they were inventoried, catalogued and displayed.</p>
<p id="c54693c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff initially informed Dr. Neitzel and Dr. Brain that he had found the artifacts in a cave in Mississippi, so as to conceal their source; later he did disclose the actual site of the find to Dr. Brain, who had expressed his concern over the title of the artifacts. Dr. Brain then obtained permission from the landowners to do further site testing and confirmed that it was the true source of the artifacts.</p>
<p id="c54693c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Confronted with the inability to sell the collection because he could not prove ownership, plaintiff filed suit against the six nonresident landowners of Trudeau Plantation, requesting declaratory relief confirming that he was the owner of the artifacts. Alternatively, plaintiff requested that he be awarded compensation under the theory of unjust enrichment for his time and expenses.</p>
<p id="c54693ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Louisiana intervened in the proceeding on numerous grounds, including its duty to protect its citizens in the absence of the lawful heirs of the artifacts. In 1978, the State purchased Trudeau Plantation and the artifacts from the six landowners and agreed to defend, indemnify and hold the prior owners harmless from any and all actions.</p>
<p id="c54693cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1981 the Tunica and Biloxi Indians were recognized as an American Indian Tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p id="c54693cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge held that the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe is the lawful owner of the artifacts, finding that plaintiff was not entitled to the artifacts under La. Civ. Code art. 3423 as it read prior to amendment by Act No. 187 of 1982, which required discovery “by chance.” The judge also found that plaintiff had no claim to the artifacts on the basis of abandonment under La. Civ. Code art. 3421, as it read prior to the amendment by Act No. 187 of 1982, because the legal concept of abandonment does not extend to burial goods.</p>
<p id="c546badd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court also denied relief under the theory of unjust enrichment, finding that any impoverishment claimed by plaintiff was a result of his attempts “for his own gain” and that his presence and actions on the property of a third party placed him in a “precarious position, if not in legal bad faith.”</p>
<p id="c546bade-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues before this court are the adequacy of proof that the Tunica-Biloxi Indians are descendants of the inhabitants of Trudeau, the ownership of the artifacts, and the applicability of the theory of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p id="c546badf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-160">p. 160</span>Plaintiff first argues that the evidence that the members of the Tunica-Biloxi Indians of Louisiana, Inc., are legal descendants of the inhabitants of Trudeau Plantation was insufficient to entitle them to the artifacts.</p>
<p id="c546bae0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that members of other tribes are intermixed with the Tunicas does not negate or diminish the Tunicas’ relationship to the historical tribe. Despite the fact that the Tunicas have not produced a perfect “chain of title” back to those buried at Trudeau Plantation, the tribe is an accumulation of the descendants of former Tunica Indians and has adequately satisfied the proof of descent.</p>
<p id="c546bae1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff next argues that the Indians abandoned the artifacts when they moved from Trudeau Plantation, and the artifacts became <i>res nullius</i> until found and reduced to possession by plaintiff who then became the owner.</p>
<p id="c546bae2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff contends that he has obtained ownership of the property through occupancy, which is a “mode of acquiring property by which a thing which belongs to nobody, becomes the property of the person who took possession of it, with the intention of acquiring a right of ownership upon it.” La. Civ. Code art. 3412.</p>
<p id="c546bae3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the five methods of acquiring property by occupancy is “By finding (that is, by discovering precious stones on the sea shore, or things abandoned, or a treasure).” La. Civ. Code art. 3414. Plaintiff contends that the artifacts were abandoned by the Tunicas and that by finding them he became the owner.</p>
<p id="c546bae4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he fact that the descendants or fellow tribesmen of the deceased Tunica Indians resolved, for some customary, religious or spiritual belief, to bury certain items along with the bodies of the deceased, does not result in a conclusion that the goods were abandoned. While the relinquishment of immediate possession may have been proved, an objective viewing of the circumstances and intent of the relinquishment does not result in a finding of abandonment. Objects may be buried with a decedent for any number of reasons. The relinquishment of possession normally serves some spiritual, moral, or religious purpose of the descendant/owner, but is not intended as a means of relinquishing ownership to a stranger. Plaintiff’s argument carried to its logical conclusion would render a grave subject to despoliation either immediately after interment or definitely after removal of the descendants of the deceased from the neighborhood of the cemetery.</p>
<p id="c546bae5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although plaintiff has referred to the artifacts as <i>res nullius</i>, under French law, the source of Louisiana’s occupancy law, that term refers specifically to such things as wild game and fish, which are originally without an owner. The term <i>res derelictae</i> refers to “things voluntarily abandoned by their owner with the intention to have them go to the first person taking possession.” P. Esmein, Aubry &amp; Rau, <i>Droit Civil Francais</i>, Vol. II, §168, at 46 (7th ed. 1966). Some examples of <i>res derelictae</i> given by Aubry and Rau include things left on public ways, in the cities or to be removed by garbage collectors.</p>
<p id="c546bae6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The artifacts fall into the category of <i>res derelictae</i>, if subject to abandonment. The intent to abandon <i>res derelictae</i> must include the intent to let the first person who comes along acquire them. Obviously, such is not the case with burial goods.</p>
<p id="c546bae7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">French sources have generally held that human remains and burial goods located in cemeteries or burial grounds are not “treasure” under article 716 of the French Civil Code and thereby not subject to occupancy upon discovery. The reasoning has been <span title="161" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-161">p. 161</span>that any contrary decision would lead to and promote commercial speculation and despoilment of burial grounds. The French commentator Demolombe noted the special treatment that should be given to burial goods, stating that such objects “have not been placed underground with the same intention which informs the deposit of what is called treasure, which in the latter case is, for a temporary period. Rather, they are an emplacement for a perpetual residence therein.” 13 C. Demolombe, <i>Cours de Code Napoleon</i> §37, at 45-46 (2d ed. 1862).</p>
<p id="c546bae8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same reasoning that the French have used to treat burial goods applies in determining if such items can be abandoned. The intent in interring objects with the deceased is that they will remain there perpetually, and not that they are available for someone to recover and possess as owner.</p>
<p id="c546bae9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, we do not uphold the transfer of ownership to some unrelated third party who uncovers burial goods. The trial court concluded that La. Civ. Code art. 3421 was not intended to require that objects buried with the dead were abandoned or that objects could be acquired by obtaining possession over the objections of the descendants. We agree with this conclusion.</p>
<p id="c546baea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff next argues that he is entitled to recover a sum of money to compensate his services and expenses on the basis of an <i>actio de in rem verso</i>.</p>
<p id="c546e1fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The five criteria of such a claim <i>de in rem verso</i> are: (1) there must be an enrichment, (2) there must be an impoverishment, (3) there must be a connection between the enrichment and resulting impoverishment, (4) there must be an absence of justification or cause for the enrichment and impoverishment, and (5) there must be no other remedy at law available to plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c546e1fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first question whether there has been an enrichment. While the nonresident landowners were “enriched” by the sale of the property to the state, the ultimate owners of the artifacts presented substantial evidence that the excavation caused substantial upset over the ruin of “ancestrial burial grounds,” rather than any enrichment.</p>
<p id="c546e1fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the Indians have been enriched, plaintiff has failed to prove that he has sustained the type [of] impoverishment for which <i>de in rem verso</i> may be used. His alleged loss resulted from the hours he spent excavating the artifacts, the greater portion of which activity was done at a time when plaintiff knew he was on property without the consent of the landowner. While contradictory testimony was presented regarding whether plaintiff initially had permission to go on the property, and whether that permission was adequate, by his own admission, plaintiff was informed by Hoshman that he did not own the property before the cessation of the excavating. Plaintiff’s knowledge is further evidenced by his attempts to keep the location of his work secret; he did not identify Trudeau Plantation as the location of the find for almost five years after his discovery and he failed to seek out the landowners of the property until it was required for sale negotiations, although he removed two and one half tons of artifacts from their property. Plaintiff further acknowledges that he knew that the Tunica Indians might object to his excavations.</p>
<p id="c546e1fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impoverishment element in French law is met only when the factual circumstances show that it was not a result of the plaintiff’s own fault or negligence or was not undertaken at his own risk. Obviously the intent is to avoid awarding one who has <span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>helped another through his own negligence or fault or through action taken at his own risk. Plaintiff was acting possibly out of his own negligence, but more probably knowingly and at his own risk. Under these circumstances, plaintiff has not proven the type of impoverishment necessary for a claim of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p id="c546e1ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, plaintiff has failed to show that any enrichment was unjustified, entitling him to an action to recover from the enriched party. An enrichment will be unjustified “only if no legal justification for it exists.” Any enrichment received by the Tribe was justified.</p>
<p id="c546e200-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons the judgment of the trial court is affirmed at appellant’s costs.</p>

<p id="c546e203-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Aftermath.</b> The 1989 return of the artifacts to the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe should have been a joyous homecoming. Instead it was a shock. Harvard had transferred the collection to the State of Louisiana in 1981. Rather than preserving the centuries-old ceramics in a climate-controlled setting, the state had stored them carelessly in cardboard boxes, even keeping them in historic cabins behind the old French Quarter. The tribe was told it would cost $1.5 to 2 million to restore the collection. Patching together grants and donations, the tribe purchased two refrigerated trucks and slowly began the process. Profits from the tribe’s Grand Casino Avoyelles, opened in 1991, funded completion of the restoration. <i>See</i> Jefferson Hennessy, <i>The Legend of the Tunica Treasure</i>, May 7, 2005, <i>available at http://jeffersonhennessy.blogspot.com/2005/05/legend-of-tunica-treasure.html</i>. Today, the goods are displayed in a museum in the Tunica-Biloxi Cultural and Educational Resources Center. The center is designed to resemble a sixteenth-century Tunica burial mound.</p>
<p id="c546e204-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.</b> The casual pillaging of Tunica graves was one of many stories that contributed to passage of the <i>Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990</i> (NAGPRA), discussed further in Chapter 3, §7.2. Although criminal and common law protections in all states punish grave desecration, many states limit such protections to clearly bounded cemeteries, or restrict standing to enforce the protection to a limited set of relatives. <i>See, e.g., Hairston v. General Pipeline Construction, Inc.</i>, 704 S.E.2d 663 (W. Va. 2010) (common law only protected “clearly marked” cemeteries and only relatives designated by state intestacy statutes could enforce rights); Danny R. Veilleux, <i>Liability for Desecration of Graves and Tombstones</i>, 77 A.L.R.4th 108 (1990). While public sentiment generally condemns grave desecration, such sentiments only protected some burial grounds. Cities filled in and paved over slave burial grounds with little hesitation. Digging up and collecting bones and burial goods from Native American graves was almost a national pastime, avidly engaged in by Thomas Jefferson among many others. NAGPRA seeks to correct the gaps in law and morality that left Native American graves unprotected.</p>
<p id="c546e205-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">NAGPRA prevents removal or disturbance of Native human remains and burial goods from federal or tribal land without tribal consent. 25 U.S.C. §3002. It also <span title="163" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-163">p. 163</span>requires federal agencies and museums receiving federal funds to repatriate such objects to the lineal descendants of the Native individuals or, if the descendants cannot be identified, to the tribe with a connection to the objects. 25 U.S.C. §§3002-3005. NAGPRA’s prohibition on grave disturbance only applies on federal and tribal land. Many states also now have laws that prohibit knowing disturbance of Native burial grounds, but these laws vary widely.</p>
<p id="c546e206-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Cultural property.</b> The claims of the Tunica-Biloxi bear resemblance to demands for return of culturally important artifacts by nations across the world. Casual acquisition of such objects by foreign collectors — whether sarcophagi from Egypt or Khmer statues in Cambodia — has long been the norm. The international and domestic laws governing such claims are discussed in Chapter 3, §6.1.</p>

These questions involve and depend upon the interpretation of the Colonization Laws of the Republic of Mexico, and their practical administration; the relative rights and powers of the central government, and of the State of Coahuila and Texas, in reference to the public domain; the modes of declaring and vindicating those rights, and exercising those powers under the constitution of the Mexican Republic; the effect of the separation of the State of Coahuila and Texas from Mexico, by the revolution of 1836, upon titles made by the State authorities before the revolution, and alleged to be defective for want of the sanction of the central government; as well as several important laws of the Republic of Texas, framed for the protection of the public domain, and for the repose of titles in that country.</p>

The petition avers a seisin in fee, on a particular day, and an ouster by the defendant. The defendant shows no title in himself to the land demanded, but asserts that the plaintiff claims title by a pretended grant, made on the 20th day of September, 1835; that the land was within the twenty frontier leagues bordering on the United States; that the approbation of the executive of the national government of Mexico was not given; and, in other pleas, avers other facts, to show that if any such grant had been made it would not have been valid.</p>

The plaintiff says he was seised in fee, and the defendant ejected him from the possession. The defendant, not denying this, answers, that if the plaintiff had any paper title, it was under a certain grant which was not valid. He shows no title whatever in himself. But a mere intruder cannot enter on a person actually seised, and eject him, and then question his title, or set up an outstanding title in another. The maxim that the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title, and not on the weakness of the defendant’s, is applicable to all actions for the recovery of property. But if the plaintiff had actual prior possession of the land, this is strong enough to enable him to recover it from a mere trespasser, who entered without any title.</p>

The Supreme Court avoided deciding these questions by following the principle of relativity of title: one who does not have legal title to the land may still protect her rights against a later intruder. What justifies the doctrine? A Kentucky case adopting this principle explained it as follows:</p>

Although <i>O</i> would have had the right to get the car back from <i>A</i>, does <i>O</i> have the right to get the car back from <i>B</i>? The law resolves this conflict between two innocent persons by sometimes vesting title in the original “true owner” and sometimes granting title to the innocent or “bona fide” purchaser. This result again illustrates the concept of the relativity of title<i> — O</i> may have title as against <i>A</i>, but not as against <i>B</i>.</p>

If someone does not own Radio City Music Hall but attempts to sell it to you by granting you a deed, you get exactly what your “grantor” had — nothing. Similarly, if I steal your personal property and then resell it to an innocent purchaser who has no knowledge that the property is stolen (a “bona fide purchaser”), the innocent buyer generally is out of luck. A thief ordinarily has no right to transfer title to a third party. In <i>Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg &amp; Feldman Fine Arts, Inc</i>., 717 F. Supp. 1374 (S.D. Ind. 1989), valuable Christian mosaics were stolen from a church on the island of Cyprus after it was invaded by Turkey. Years later, they wound up, through a series of transactions, in the hands of defendant art dealers. The court held that “a thief never obtains title to stolen items, and one can pass no greater title than one has. Therefore, one who obtains stolen items from a thief never obtains title to or right to possession of the item.” <i>Id</i>. at 1398. The thief “cannot pass any title to any subsequent transferees, including subsequent purchasers” even if they are bona fide purchasers who have no notice of the theft. <i>Id</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1108C_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1108C_cee9ce2f-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span> <i>See also</i> Ray Andrews Brown, <i>The Law of Personal Property</i> §9.4, at 194 (3d ed. 1975).</p>

<p id="c5477e6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in <i>Carlsen v. Rivera</i>, 382 So. 2d 825 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1980), Coradino Rivera, owner of a Canadian car rental agency, leased a car to James McEnroe, who forged a title to the car in the name of a business he owned and sold it to a third party who obtained a facially valid title certificate in Florida. The car was then sold again to a fourth party, who finally sold it to defendant Carlsen. Rivera sued Carlsen to get his car back. The court applied the Florida version of the <i>Uniform Commercial Code</i>, U.C.C. §2-403(2), which provides that a bona fide purchaser will prevail over the true owner when the true owner has entrusted the property to a merchant who regularly deals in such goods. Fla. Stat. §672.403. Similarly, if an owner is induced to sell his property by fraud or duress, the seller may recover the property from the buyer unless the buyer has subsequently transferred the property to a bona fide purchaser. U.C.C. §2-403(1). On the other hand, when a thief takes property away from an owner, such that the initial transfer of possession is involuntary, neither the thief nor subsequent purchasers are entitled to keep title as against the true owner from whom the property was stolen even if those later possessors are bona fide purchasers. <i>Candela v. Port Motors, Inc</i>., 617 N.Y.S.2d 49 (App. Div. 1994).</p>

<p id="c547a593-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Patients who had been on a given ward for several months tended to develop personal territories in the day room, at least to the degree that some inmates developed favorite sitting or standing places and would make some effort to dislodge anybody who usurped them. Thus, on one continued treatment ward, one elderly patient in contact was by mutual consent accorded a free-standing radiator; by spreading paper on top, he managed to be able to sit on it, and sit on it he usually did. Behind the radiator he kept some of his personal effects, which further marked off the area as his place. A few feet from him, in a corner of the room, a working patient had what amounted to his “office,” this being the place where staff knew they could find him when he was wanted. He had sat so long in this corner that there was a soiled dent in the plaster wall where his head usually came to rest. On the same ward, another patient laid claim to a chair that was directly in front of the TV set; although a few patients would contest this place, he generally could sustain his claim upon it.</p>
<p id="c547a594-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Territory formation on wards has a special relation to mental disorder. In many civilian situations an equalitarian rule such as “first come, first served” prevails, and some disguise conceals another organizing principle, “strongest takes what he wants.” This last rule operated to some extent on bad wards, just as the first rule did on good wards. Another dimension must be introduced, however. The alignment to ward life <span title="170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-170">p. 170</span>that many back-ward patients took, for whatever voluntary reason or from whatever involuntary cause, led them to remain silent and unprotesting and to move away from any commotion involving themselves. Such a person could be dislodged from a seat or place regardless of his size or strength. Hence, on the bad wards, a special pecking order of a sort occurred, with vocal patients in good contact taking favorite chairs and benches from those not in contact. This was carried to a point where one patient might force a mute one off a footrest, leaving the vocal patient with a chair and a footrest, and the mute patient with nothing at all — a difference that is not negligible considering the fact that except for breaks at mealtime some patients spent the whole of the day on these wards doing nothing but sitting or standing in one place.</p>
<p id="c547a595-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the minimum space that was built into a personal territory was that provided by a patient’s blanket. In some wards, a few patients would carry their blankets around with them during the day and, in an act thought to be highly regressive, each would curl up on the floor with his blanket completely covering him; within this covered space each had some margin of control.</p>
<p id="c547a596-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As may be expected, a personal territory can develop within a free place or group territory. For example, in the recreation room of a chronic male service one of the two large wooden armchairs favorably situated close to the light and the radiator was regularly taken by an elderly respected patient, both patients and staff recognizing his right to it.</p>
<p id="c547cca7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In some cases, an assignment provided a personal territory. For example, the working patients who looked after their ward’s clothing and supply room were allowed to stay in this room when no chores were to be done; and there they could sit or lie on the floor away from the alterations of commotion and pall in the day room.</p>
<p id="c547cca8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In everyday life, legitimate possessions employed in primary adjustments are typically stored, when not in use, in special places of safekeeping which can be gotten to at will. When patients entered Central Hospital, especially if they were excited or depressed on admission, they were denied a private, accessible place to store things. If people were selfless, or were required to be selfless, there would of course be a logic to having no private storage place. But all have some self. Given the curtailment implied by loss of places of safekeeping, it is understandable that patients in Central Hospital developed places of their own.</p>
<p id="c547cca9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seemed characteristic of hospital life that the most common form of stash was one that could be carried on one’s person wherever one went. One such device for female patients was a large handbag; a parallel technique for a man was a jacket with commodious pockets, worn even in the hottest weather. While these containers are quite usual ones in the wider community, there was a special burden placed upon them in the hospital: books, writing materials, washcloths, fruit, small valuables, scarves, playing cards, soap, shaving equipment (on the part of men), containers of salt, pepper, and sugar, bottles of milk — these were some of the objects sometimes carried in this manner. So common was this practice that one of the most reliable symbols of patient status in the hospital was bulging pockets. Another portable storage device was a shopping bag lined with another shopping bag. (When partly full, this frequently employed stash also served as a cushion and back rest.) Among men, a small stash was sometimes created out of a long sock: by knotting the open end <span title="171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-171">p. 171</span>and twisting this end around his belt, the patient could let a kind of moneybag inconspicuously hang down inside his trouser leg. Individual variations of these portable containers were also found. One young engineering graduate fashioned a purse out of a discarded oilcloth, the purse being stitched into separate, well-measured compartments for comb, toothbrush, cards, writing paper, pencil, soap, small face cloth, toilet paper — the whole attached by a concealed clip to the underside of his belt. The same patient had also sewn an extra pocket on the inside of his jacket to carry a book. Another male patient, an avid newspaper reader, invariably wore a suit jacket, apparently to conceal his newspapers, which he carried folded over his belt. Still another made effective use of a cleaned-out tobacco pouch for transporting food; whole fruit, unpeeled, could easily be put in one’s pocket to be taken back to the ward from the cafeteria, but cooked meat was better carried in a grease-proof stash.</p>

<p id="c547ccac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Functions of property.</b> Why do total institutions strip inmates of their property?

<p id="c547ccad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. “Property” formation.</b> What are the various ways that inmates seek to replace some of the property that they have lost? What makes other inmates and staff members recognize these rights? What characteristics do these rights share with property as you understand it?</p>
<p id="c547ccae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Personhood and property.</b> Goffman writes, “If people were selfless . . . there would of course be a logic to having no private storage place.” But because “all have some self” they needed to create private stashes. What does this mean? Is that really why people create stashes?</p>
<p id="c547ccaf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scholars have argued that one justification for property rights is the importance of property to people’s sense of self and their identity. <i>See</i> Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Property and Personhood</i>, 34 Stan. L. Rev. 957 (1982). Professor Radin argues that the legal system can distinguish between property that is “bound up with the holder,” such as a wedding ring or a home, and more fungible property that is held “for purely instrumental reasons.” <i>Id</i>. at 959-960. Just as rewarding labor and recognizing possession influence the texture of property rights, the legal system might likewise provide greater protection for property that is more constitutive of people’s identity. Do you agree? What concerns might this justification for property rights raise?</p>
<p id="c547ccb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Property formation in your life.</b> Goffman pioneered sociological research through the close study of everyday interactions. What aspects of property formation do you see in your life? Consider your regular seat in your Property classroom. Do you have some kind of property right in it? What would be the sources of your claim?</p>
<p id="c547ccb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Property and homelessness.</b> Like Goffman’s mental patients, homeless people lack a private place to store things. The City of Los Angeles has lost several lawsuits <span title="172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-172">p. 172</span>challenging its practice of seizing and destroying the belongings of homeless people on city sidewalks. In <i>Lavan v. City of Los Angeles</i>, 797 F. Supp. 2d 1005 (C.D. Cal. 2011), the court rejected claims that the contents of unattended shopping carts and other belongings were “abandoned,” and found that it was unconstitutional to destroy them without providing notice and an opportunity to be heard. Several years before, neighborhood business owners had organized a warehouse for homeless people to securely store their belongings, but many individuals were unable to manage its simple rules:</p>

<p id="c547f3c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sidewalk is public property, but the possessions are hers and her neighbors, setting up a conflict between the homeless and a city trying to bring order where chaos reigns. Since a federal judge ordered the city four months ago to stop seizing property from Skid Row streets, sidewalks already teeming with people are now crammed with stuff.</p>
<p id="c547f3c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For Benz, who’s been homeless for three years, keeping track of her belongings, along with her health and legal problems, has been overwhelming.</p>
