<p id="c5a4928c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property may be held by more than one person in many different ways. Property rights may be divided, with specific sticks in the bundle of rights that make up property allocated to different persons or groups, or with the right to all the sticks divided over time. Leaseholds provide an example of both divisions: the tenant has the right to possess and control the property during her lease, while the landlord has both the right to establish conditions for use during the lease period and the future right to possess the property after the lease ends. Property rights may be shared as well as divided. In other words, more than one person may have the right to control the same thing at the same time. This is called <b>concurrent ownership</b><i>.</i> For example, a wife and husband may together own a condominium apartment in an urban building. In this arrangement each has a concurrent right to possess the entire condominium unit. They have to agree how the property will be used — whether they will live in the condominium or rent it out to others, how they will use each room, whom they will invite to dinner, and so on. They also share with other condominium owners the right to use common areas of the building. Disputes about the use and condition of common areas — such as whether to pay for a new roof — must be worked out in conjunction with the other condominium owners.</p>
<p id="c5a4928d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Family members often share property through one of the concurrent tenancies. But familial relationships also give rise to distinctive <b>family property</b> rights. Minor children, for example, have a right to support from their noncustodial parents. Marriage also has many consequences for property. In community property states, rights to most property individually acquired during marriage is shared equally with one’s spouse. In separate property states, spouses have rights to each other’s property on divorce and death. Such rules also raise questions of the property rights of people in family-like relationships that are not recognized by the state, whether same-sex couples, same- or opposite-sex unmarried cohabitants, or non-sexual long-time live-in companions.</p>

Perhaps the predominant form of entity property is the corporation, in which vast numbers of shareholders own shares in entities managed by others. Another important form of entity property is the common interest development, discussed in detail in Chapter 8, in which hundreds or thousands of individuals and families own units in developments managed by property owners associations. The growth and increasing influence of these forms of ownership require reconsideration of the meaning of property and the line between private and public action.</p>

<p id="c5a49293-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three common law concurrent tenancies are the <b>tenancy in common</b>, the <b>joint tenancy</b>, and the <b>tenancy by the entirety</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1005E_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1005E_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> In all concurrent tenancies each tenant, no matter how small her fractional interest, has the right to possess the entire parcel — unless all the co-tenants agree otherwise. Absent agreement, all co-tenants also have the right to share the profits from the property, such as rents and royalties, and the obligation to contribute to basic costs of maintaining the property, such as mortgage and property taxes. The three tenancies, however, differ in four key dimensions: first, how they are <i>created</i>; second, whether there is a <i>right of survivorship</i>, meaning that surviving co-tenants automatically inherit a deceased co-tenant’s share of the property; third, whether tenants can unilaterally <i>sever</i> or <i>terminate</i> their tenancy; and fourth, whether tenants can unilaterally <i>encumber</i> the property, such as by leasing it, pledging it as security, or having it levied to pay a debt. A fourth form of concurrent ownership, the<b> partnership</b> for business purposes, is similar in some respects to the concurrent tenancies, but is now classified as a form of entity property and is discussed in §4 of this chapter.</p>

<p id="c5a4b9a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenancies in common may be created explicitly, by conveying property to more than one party as “tenants in common.” Tenancies in common are also usually the default form of concurrent tenancy in face of ambiguity; if property is conveyed or devised to multiple owners, the law will presume that they are tenants in common. For example:</p>

</div>
<p id="c5a4b9aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each co-tenant has the right to transfer or encumber the interest unilaterally and devise it or have it inherited in case of intestacy on death. Of course, each co-tenant only has the authority to transfer her own interest, and buyers may be unwilling to share ownership with a stranger. Tenants may also file to terminate the co-tenancy and divide the property or its proceeds by bringing an action for <b>partition</b>. In partition proceedings, a court may order the property physically divided among the co-owners. If this is not feasible or appropriate, the court will order the property to be sold and the proceeds divided among the co-owners in proportion to their ownership shares.</p>
<p id="c5a4b9ab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenancies in common are often used divide rights in timeshares or fractional interests in vacation property. The property is held in concurrent ownership, but the individual owners have contractual rights to exclusively occupy the property during their allocated time. Tenancies in common may also be used to create a less-regulated alternative to condominiums, in which the co-owners have contractual rights to exclusively occupy their units. Both kinds of tenancies in common are often financed by a single mortgage, which created a number of problems during the recent housing crisis. Individual financing of one’s share has become more available today.</p>

<p id="c5a4b9ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main difference between joint tenancy and tenancy in common is the <b>right of survivorship</b>. When a joint tenant dies, her property interest is immediately transferred to the remaining joint tenants in equal shares. Thus, in a joint tenancy owned by <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>, each with a one-third undivided interest, <i>A</i>’s interest when she dies goes to <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> (that is, half to <i>B</i> and half to <i>C</i>). The result is that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> own the property as joint tenants, each possessing a one-half undivided interest, in the property. If <i>A</i> tries to devise her one-third interest, her will would have no effect; she has no right to devise her interest. Although joint tenancies are no longer the default form of concurrent ownership, they continue to be popular, particularly for family property and joint bank accounts. The right of survivorship consolidates property among the parties, simplifying use and ownership. Importantly, it also avoids probate, which is expensive and can tie up property for long periods. For this reason, a joint tenancy with right of survivorship is sometimes called the “poor man’s will.”</p>
<p id="c5a4e0bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditionally, joint tenancies could only be created if they shared the <b>four unities</b> of time, title, interest, and possession. This means that (1) the interest of each joint tenant must be created at the same moment in <i>time</i>; (2) all joint tenants must acquire title by the same instrument or <i>title</i> (joint tenancy does not ordinarily arise by intestate succession); (3) all joint tenants must possess equal fractional undivided <i>interests</i> in the property and their interest must last the same amount of time; and (4) all joint tenants must have the right to <i>possess</i> the entire parcel. Although the four unities remain in force in many states, others have rejected them in favor of a test considering the <span title="668" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-668">p. 668</span>intent of the parties. <i>See In re Estate of Johnson</i>, 739 N.W.2d 493 (Iowa 2007) (adopting intent-based approach and discussing trend); R.H. Helmholz, <i>Realism and Formalism in Severance of Joint Tenancies</i>, 77 Neb. L. Rev. 1, 21-22 (1998) (discussing retreat from four unities when they contravene intent). Although a number of states have statutes that appear to abolish joint tenancies entirely, these states will often find joint tenancies with a right of survivorship if the intent to create them is clearly expressed. <i>See</i> 1 Joyce D. Palomar &amp; Robert Wilcox, <i>Patton and Palomar on Land Titles</i> §223 (3d ed. 2003); <i>see</i>,<i> e.g.</i>,<i> McLeroy v. McLeroy</i>, 40 S.W.2d 1027 (Tenn. 1931) (interpreting Tenn. Code §66-1-107). Because of the presumption against joint tenancy and survivorship in many states, however, drafters are well advised to be explicit:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a4e0c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>O</i> conveys Blackacre to <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.</p>

</div>
<p id="c5a4e0c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, the right of survivorship is highly contingent because a joint tenant who transfers her property interest can destroy the right of survivorship of her fellow owners with respect to her share. For example, if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> own property as joint tenants, each owner has the right to obtain full ownership of the property when the other co-tenant dies (the right of survivorship). If <i>A</i> sells her one-half undivided interest to <i>C</i>, however, the joint tenancy is<b> severed</b>, and <i>B</i>’s right of survivorship is destroyed. The result is that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> will own the property as tenants in common. As with tenancy in common, joint tenants may also file for partition of the property. A few states prohibit severance by statute. S.C. Code §27-7-40 (prohibiting unilateral severance of joint tenancy); Nev. Const. art. IV §30 (prohibiting conveyance of homestead property without consent of both husband and wife). Many states will also deem a joint tenancy to be converted to a tenancy in common if married co-tenants divorce. Courts have also held that a joint tenancy is converted to a tenancy in common and the right of survivorship destroyed if one joint tenant murders the other. <i>See In re Estate of Thomann</i>, 649 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2002) (interpreting effect of Iowa Code §633.535 on property rights after murder-suicide).</p>
<p id="c5a4e0c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can an owner sever a joint tenancy and destroy the right of survivorship by conveying her interest from herself as joint tenant to herself as tenant in common? Traditionally, this could not be done because it did not break the four unities, but most states now permit such “self-severance.” <i>See Taylor v. Canterbury</i>, 92 P.3d 961 (Colo. 2004); <i>Sathoff v. Sutterer,</i> 869 N.E.2d 354 (Ill. Ct. App. 2007) (applying 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 1005/1b); <i>In re Estate of Johnson</i>, 739 N.W.2d 493, 499 n.9 (Iowa 2007). The procedure creates the possibility of fraud. Consider a husband who secretly signs such a document and gives it to his daughter for safekeeping. If he survives his wife, he can claim her interest because the attempted severance was secret. If he predeceases her, however, his daughter can claim to inherit his 50-percent interest on the grounds that his wife’s right of survivorship has been destroyed by severance. To address this possibility, some states require that conveyances be publicly recorded to sever a joint tenancy; this would prevent a co-tenant from benefiting from the right to survivorship after conveying the interest to himself. <i>See</i> Cal. Civ. Code §683.2(c); Colo. Rev. Stat. <span title="669" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-669">p. 669</span>§38-31-101 (5)(a); <i>see</i> John V. Orth, <i>The Perils of Joint Tenancies</i>, 44 Real Prop. Tr. &amp; Est. L.J. 427 (2009).</p>
<p id="c5a4e0c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Severance occurs only between the selling owner and the remaining owners; it does not change the relations of the remaining owners among themselves. <i>Sathoff,</i> 869 N.E.2d at 356-357<i>.</i> For example, if <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> own property as joint tenants, and <i>A</i> conveys his interest to <i>D</i>, the result is that <i>D</i> owns a one-third interest as a tenant in common with <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, who each own a one-third interest as joint tenants with each other. When <i>D</i> dies, her one-third interest will go to her heirs or devisees. However, when <i>B</i> dies, his interest goes to <i>C</i> as a surviving joint tenant, who will then own a two-thirds interest as a tenant in common with <i>D</i>.</p>
<p id="c5a507d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, joint tenants are free to encumber their interests during their lives, such as by renting them or pledging them as security for a debt. <i>But see</i> S.C. Code §27-7-40 (prohibiting unilateral encumbrance). So long the property is not actually sold, however, these encumbrances generally do not survive the death of the encumbering co-tenant.</p>
<p id="c5a507d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Joint bank accounts.</b> Many, perhaps most, personal joint bank accounts are joint tenancies with rights of survivorship. The right of survivorship is often provided by the bank’s signature form and may even be presumed absent contrary evidence. <i>See Estate of Ostlund</i>, 918 A.2d 649, 656-658 (N.J. 2007) (holding that despite evidence that ailing father added his son to his account so that he could pay his bills, the evidence did not clearly and convincingly rebut presumption of survivorship); <i>Uniform Probate Code</i> §6-212 (2010) (survivorship presumed absent clear and convincing evidence). The four unities are rarely required. Absent other evidence, during their lives tenants are usually entitled only to the right to withdraw funds according to their contributions to the account, although some states and the revised Uniform Probate Code provide that married couples are presumed to have contributed equally. <i>See Uniform Probate Code</i> §6-211; Lisa R. Mahle, <i>A Purse of Her Own: The Case Against Joint Bank Accounts</i>, 16 Tex. J. Women &amp; Law 45 (2006). Much litigation concerns whether elderly people creating joint accounts intended to create a right of survivorship and <i>inter vivos</i> use of the account, or simply intended a “convenience account” to permit a child or other helper to write checks on their behalf during life.</p>

<p id="c5a507dc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenancies by the entirety are available only to legally married couples. <i>See Baker v. Speaks</i>, 295 P.3d 847, 859-860 (Wyo. 2013) (holding that whether the defendants had a tenancy by the entirety depended on whether they had contracted a common law marriage in another state). The tenancy by the entirety originated in the idea that the married couple was one legal person; it was linked to the doctrine of coverture, which gave the husband the sole power to manage and control his wife’s property. As a result, many states abolished tenancies by the entirety when they abolished coverture. Today, however, the tenancy by the entirety is recognized in more than half the states and in the District of Columbia. 7 <i>Powell on Real Property</i> §52.01. Some of these states presume that conveyances to married couples are tenancies by the entirety absent contrary evidence, see Alaska Stat. §34.15.110; Ind. Code §32-17-3-1; <i>Beal Bank, SSB v. Almand &amp; Associates</i>, 780 So. 2d 45 (Fla. 2001); <i>In re VanConett Estate</i>, 687 N.W.2d 167 (Mich. App. 2004), while others apply the usual presumption in favor of tenancies in common, Haw. Rev. Stat. §509-1; 4 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §33.06(e)).</p>
<p id="c5a507dd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like a joint tenancy, the tenancy by the entirety includes a right of survivorship. This right is much more stable than in a joint tenancy, however, because absent agreement of both parties the tenancy by the entirety is only severed on divorce or death.</p>
<p id="c5a507de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the law varies from state to state, in most states, spouses cannot encumber their interest in property held by the entirety without each other’s consent, and creditors cannot attach property held through tenancy by the entirety to satisfy debts of one of the spouses. <i>See Sawada v. Endo</i>, §2.2.D, below;<i> Beal Bank, SSB v. Almand &amp; Associates</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Baker v. Speaks</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 859 (Wyo. 2013); <i>Bunker v.

During the father’s life, the daughter draws from the account only to write checks for her father’s rent, medical bills, and other expenses. When the father dies, $300,000 is left in the account. His will divides his estate equally among the daughter and his two children from his second marriage. The daughter claims that she is entitled to the proceeds of the account by right of survivorship. This would leave assets worth about $15,000 to be divided among the children under the will. What should the court do?</p>

More than half of Americans die without a will; this proportion is much larger for African Americans, Latinos, and for middle- to lower-income people of all races. When individuals die intestate, their property goes to their intestate heirs. This frequently means shared ownership. For example, if the decedent leaves multiple children and no spouse, or a spouse who is not a parent of the children, the property will be divided among them. Following the usual default rule, the estate descends to the intestate heirs as tenants in common. If those heirs also die intestate, the property is divided among yet more heirs and so on exponentially. In a few generations, the number of co-tenants in such “heirs property” may become so large that joint management of the property is impossible. Two much-discussed examples of this dynamic involve African American farmers and Native Americans.</p>
<p id="c5a52ef5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">African American rural landownership dropped by more than 90 percent between 1920 and 1999 and continues to decline. There are many causes of this phenomenon — discrimination and violence against black landowners, African Americans’ “Great Migration” to the North, and the general decline of small farms — but one cause may be the frequency of heirs property, estimated to constitute one-quarter to 40 percent of Black-owned rural property. A typical parcel of heirs property has eight or more co-owners but may have many more, and many of the co-owners live outside the Southeast where the property is located. Such property is harder to manage and vulnerable to loss through forced partition sale or foreclosure. <i>See</i> Thomas W. Mitchell,<i> From Reconstruction to Deconstruction: Undermining Black Landownership, Political Independence, and Community Through Partition Sales of Tenancies in Common</i>, 95 Nw. U. L.

<p id="c5a52ef6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, much tribal land was forcibly divided among individual Indians pursuant to the federal allotment acts. One impact of the acts was to apply state probate laws, including intestacy laws, to allotment holders who rarely made wills. As a result, by 1934 “[o]n allotted reservations, numerous cases exist where the shares of each individual heir from lease money may be 1 cent a month. Or one heir may own minute fractional shares in 30 or 40 different allotments. The cost of leasing, bookkeeping, and distributing the proceeds in many cases far exceeds the total income.” 78 Cong. Rec. 11728 (1934) (Rep. Edgar Howard). By 2004, some interests amounted to only 0.0000001 percent, or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub> millionth, of the undivided allotment. Testimony of Ross O. Swimmer, Special Trustee for American Indians, House Resources Comm. Hearing on S. 1721 (AIPRA) (June 23, 2004). While much of this land is in trust and cannot be sold or foreclosed upon, this fractionation means that the owners get almost no value from their land.</p>

<div class="epub-heading  left"><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5a5560b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">A.&nbsp;Division of Benefits and Expenses</p></div>
<p id="c5a5560c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unless they agree otherwise by contract, co-tenants are entitled to share the benefits of the property and obligated to share its burdens. If there is a dispute regarding these, a tenant can seek a judicial <b>accounting</b>, either during co-ownership or in determining division of proceeds in a partition action or voluntary sale, to require their co-owners to pay their portions of required expenses or to force co-owners to hand over profits from the property.</p>
<p id="c5a5560d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Possession.</b> The right of possession is a key benefit. Each co-owner has the right to possess the entire parcel. If one co-owner chooses to live in the commonly owned property and the other co-owner chooses not to live there, in most states the tenant in possession has no duty to pay rent to the non-possessing tenant. Joint tenants and tenants in common only have a duty to pay rent to their co-owners if they have committed <b>ouster</b>, an explicit act by which one co-owner excludes others from the jointly owned property. Note that the amount of rent owed is the fractional share of the rental value owned by the co-owners out of possession; a co-owner with a one-third interest in possession would have to pay only two-thirds of the fair rental value of the property to her co-owners out of possession.</p>
<p id="c5a5560e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Profits.</b> In addition to sharing the right to possess the property, co-owners are entitled to share any rents or other profits from the property. The share of profits belonging to each co-owner is based on that owner’s fractional interest in the property. For example, suppose <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> own a condominium unit as tenants in common, with a one-quarter interest in <i>A</i> and a three-quarters interest in <i>B</i>. They rent the unit to <i>C. A</i> has a right to one-quarter of the rents paid by <i>C</i>, and <i>B</i> has a right to three-quarters of the rents paid by <i>C</i>, unless <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> agree otherwise. Tenants also share profits on sale or partition of the property according to their respective fractional interests.</p>
<p id="c5a5560f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Burdens.</b> Co-owners generally have a duty to share basic expenses needed to keep the property, including <i>mortgage</i> payments, property <i>taxes</i> and other assessments, and property <i>insurance</i>, in accordance with their respective shares. Co-owners generally also have a duty to share basic <i>maintenance</i> and <i>necessary repairs</i> of the premises. <i>See Palanza v. Lufkin</i>, 804 A.2d 1141 (Me. 2002), <i>abrogated on other grounds</i>, <i>Wicks v. Conroy</i>, 77 A.3d 479 (Me. 2013) (approving contribution toward necessary repairs, even though some had cosmetic effects). Some jurisdictions, however, require a tenant to provide co-tenants with notice and opportunity to object to the repairs in order to demand contribution. <i>See Anderson v. Joseph</i>, 26 A.3d 1050, 1056-1057 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2011) (denying contribution for basement repairs to deal with “massive flooding” because of failure to provide notice). Co-owners have no duty to share the costs of <i>improvements</i> to the property unless they agree to do so.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102D6_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102D6_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> Improving tenants may only <span title="673" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-673">p. 673</span>claim the amount by which the improvement increases the value of the property at partition or sale. Thus tenants paying for work on a property that is determined not to be necessary may only demand contribution on sale or partition, and then only up to the amount the work is shown to improve the value of the property.</p>
<p id="c5a55611-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, a co-owner who exclusively possesses the premises must bear the entire burden of expenses (including taxes, repairs, and mortgage payments) if the value of her occupation of the premises exceeds those payments. If the share of expenses that would ordinarily be borne by the tenants out of possession is less than the rental value belonging to the tenants out of possession, no action for contribution may be brought. <i>Barrow v. Barrow</i>, 527 So. 2d 1373 (Fla. 1988); William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §5.9, at 209 (3d ed. 2000). This principle substantially qualifies the rule that co-tenants who are occupying the premises have no duty to pay rent to the co-owners who are not occupying the property. Although a co-tenant out of possession cannot sue a co-tenant in possession for rent, a tenant in possession can sue her co-tenants out of possession only for their share of expenses that exceeds the fair rental value to which they would be entitled if the property were leased out to a third party. <i>See Esteves v. Esteves</i>, 775 A.2d 163 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001) (holding that in accounting after house was sold, parents who occupied the house for 18 years were entitled to be reimbursed by son for one-half of expenses of mortgage and maintenance but son was allowed a credit against that amount equal to the reasonable value of his parents’ sole occupancy of the property).</p>

<p id="c5a57d2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Husband and wife separated in June 1983, about two months before wife filed her petition for dissolution of marriage. The district court found that husband “chose to move out of the family home, and he then maintained another home where he also had his office for his business.” Husband contends that the district court erred in failing to find that he had been constructively ousted from the family home. He requested findings and conclusions that the constructive ouster by his wife entitled him to half of the reasonable rental value of the home from the time of the initial separation.</p>
<p id="c5a57d2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Husband and wife held the family home as community property during the marriage and as tenants in common after dissolution. Although wife was the exclusive occupant of the house after the separation, ordinarily a co-tenant incurs no obligation to fellow co-tenants by being the exclusive occupant of the premises.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a57d30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is a well-settled principle of the common law that the mere occupation by a tenant of the entire estate does not render him liable to his co-tenant for the use and occupation of any part of the common property. The reason is easily found. The right of each to occupy the premises is one of the incidents of a tenancy in common. Neither tenant can lawfully exclude the other. The occupation of one, so long as he does not exclude the other, is but the exercise of a legal right. If, for any reason, one does not choose to assert the right of common enjoyment, the other is not obliged to stay out; and if the sole occupation of one could render him liable there for to the other, his legal right to the occupation would be dependent upon the caprice or indolence of his co-tenant, and this the law would not tolerate. <i>Williams v. Sinclair Refining Co.</i>, 47 P.2d 910, 912 (N.M. 1935).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a57d31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The result is otherwise, however, when the occupant has ousted the other co-tenants. Although the term “ouster” suggests an affirmative physical act, even a reprehensible act, the obligation of the occupying co-tenant to pay rent may arise in the absence of “actual” ouster when the realities of the situation, without there being any fault by either co-tenant, prevent the co-tenants from sharing occupancy. 4 G. Thompson, <i>Real Property</i> §1805, at 189 (J. Grimes Repl. 1979), states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a57d32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[B]efore a tenant in common can be liable to his co-tenants for rent for the use and occupation of the common property, his occupancy must be such as amounts to a denial of the right of his co-tenants to occupy the premises jointly with him, or <i>the character of the property must be such as to make such joint occupancy impossible or impracticable.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a5a443-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe that it was this latter type of situation — an “ouster” in effect, without any physical act and perhaps without any fault — to which the New Mexico Supreme Court was referring when it recognized the doctrine of “constructive ouster” in the marital context in <i>Hertz v. Hertz</i>, 657 P.2d 1169 (N.M. 1983). The court wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a5a444-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]f one of the parties in a divorce case remains in possession of the community residence between the date of the divorce and the date of the final judgment dividing the community assets, then there <i>may</i> be a form of constructive ouster, exclusion, or an <span title="675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-675">p. 675</span>equivalent act which is created as to the right of common enjoyment by the divorced spouse not in possession. This exclusion may render the divorced spouse in possession of the community residence liable to the divorced spouse not in possession for the use and occupation of the residence between the date of the divorce and the date of the final judgment. To hold otherwise would mean that both divorced spouses should have continued to live with each other during the eighteen month interim or that both should have abandoned the property. 657 P.2d at 1179.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a5a445-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the notion of constructive ouster in the marital context is simply another way of saying that when the emotions of a divorce make it impossible for spouses to continue to share the marital residence pending a property division, the spouse who — often through mutual agreement — therefore departs the residence may be entitled to rent from the remaining spouse. Although one can say that the departing spouse has been constructively “ousted,” the term should not suggest physical misconduct, or any fault whatsoever, on the part of the remaining spouse.</p>
<p id="c5a5a446-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common law precedents support the proposition that the remaining spouse should pay rent to the co-tenant when both cannot be expected to live together on the property. For example, when it is impractical for all co-tenants to occupy the premises jointly, it is unnecessary that those claiming rent from the co-tenant in possession first demand the right to move in and occupy the premises. <i>See Oechsner v. Courcier</i>, 155 S.W.2d 963 (Tex. Civ. App. 1941) (applying that principle when five heirs, with separate families totalling twenty-two members, were co-tenants of a five-room cottage being occupied by one of the families). The impracticality of joint occupancy by the co-tenants may result from the relations between the co-tenants becoming “so strained and bitter that they could not continue to reside together in peace and concord.” <i>Maxwell v. Eckert</i>, 109 A. 730, 731 (N.J. Eq. 1920). If, however, hostility flows only from the co-tenant out of possession, ordinarily there would be no constructive ouster. <i>See O’Connell v. O’Connell</i>, 117 A. 634 (N.J. Eq. 1922) (wife left home and refused to return despite solicitation by husband). In that circumstance the departing spouse has “abandoned” his or her interest in possession, rather than being excluded.</p>
<p id="c5a5a447-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One jurisdiction has gone so far as to create a rebuttable presumption of ouster of the spouse who moves out of the former marital residence upon divorce. <i>See Stylianopoulos v. Stylianopoulos</i>, 455 N.E.2d 477 (Mass. App. Ct. 1983).</p>
<p id="c5a5a448-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Husband had the burden of proving constructive ouster in this case. Therefore, we must sustain the district court’s ruling against husband unless the evidence at trial was such as to <i>compel</i> the district court to find ouster. Although the evidence of hostility between the spouses may have sustained a finding by the district court of constructive ouster, there was substantial evidence to support the inference that husband’s purpose in leaving the community residence was to live with a girlfriend and his departure was the reason wife filed for divorce; he was not pushed out but pulled. Also, the delay of several years before husband demanded any rent from wife supports an inference of abandonment of his interest in occupancy. In short, the evidence was conflicting and did not compel a finding of constructive ouster.</p>
<p id="c5a5a449-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize the ambiguity in the district court’s finding that defendant “chose to move out.” Such language could be consistent with husband’s departure being the <span title="676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-676">p. 676</span>result of marital friction, in which case there generally would be constructive ouster. On the other hand, the language could also be construed as referring to husband’s abandoning the home to live with another woman. We choose the second construction of the finding, because “[i]n the case of uncertain, doubtful or ambiguous findings, an appellate court is bound to indulge every presumption to sustain the judgment.” <i>Ledbetter v. Webb</i>, 711 P.2d 874, 879 (N.M. 1985). Moreover, it appeared from oral argument before this court that the issue of constructive ouster was framed in the district court in essentially the same manner as treated in this opinion. Therefore, we are comfortable in assuming that the district court applied the proper rule of law and in construing the district court’s finding compatibly with its rejection of husband’s proposed conclusion of law that there was a constructive ouster.</p>

<p id="c5a5a44c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Different approaches to occupancy after divorce.</b> Like the New Mexico courts, some courts adopt a version of the constructive ouster doctrine to require separated spouses to pay rent (equal to one-half the fair rental value) to the spouse who is no longer living at home. <i>In re Marriage of Watts</i>, 217 Cal. Rptr. 301 (Ct. App. 1985) (court may order husband to reimburse community for exclusive use of residence after separation); <i>Palmer v. Protrka</i>, 476 P.2d 185, 190 (Or. 1970) (when marital difficulties make co-occupancy impossible, requiring occupant to pay one-half of rental value seems closest to parties’ intentions when they took title). Other courts, however, refuse to make an exception for marital property and hold that co-tenants in possession have no duty to pay rent unless they have affirmatively ousted their spouse by notifying them of an intent to exclude them from the joint property. <i>See Hughes v. Krueger</i>, 67 So. 2d 279 (Fla. 2011) (although divorced spouses “did not think highly of each other,” husband never affirmatively excluded his ex-wife); <i>Kahnovsky v. Kahnovsky</i>, 21 A.2d 569 (R.I. 1941) (finding no ouster, although “separation was the result of marital difference”); <i>cf. Curtis v. Dorn</i>, 234 P.3d 682 (Haw. 2010) (absent explicit ouster, tenant who left residence after his relationship with his partner ended could not claim rent).</p>
<p id="c5a5a44d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which approach is preferable? As the attorney for one of the parties in a divorce setting, how can you avoid this problem?</p>
<p id="c5a5cb5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Property impracticable for occupancy by all co-tenants.</b> Some courts also hold that co-owners in possession have a duty to pay rent if the property is too small or otherwise impracticable to be physically occupied by all the co-owners. This situation is sometimes described as “constructive ouster” because the co-owners out of possession have been effectively excluded from the property. <i>See Capital Financial Co. Delaware Valley, Inc. v. Asterbadi</i>, 942 A.2d 21 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2008) (bank that had become co-tenant through foreclosure with wife of defaulting mortgagor was constructively ousted from single-family residence).</p>
<p id="c5a5cb5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Rent without ouster.</b> Absent constructive ouster, most states require some affirmative act by which one party excludes the other. <i>Parker v. Shecut</i>, 562 S.E.2d 620 <span title="677" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-677">p. 677</span>(S.C. 2002) (ouster shown when brother changed the locks on the door and refused to give his sister a key). A few courts, however, permit tenants out of possession to receive rent without proving ouster. <i>Modic v. Modic</i>, 633 N.E.2d 1151 (Ohio App. 1993) (construing Ohio Rev. Code §5307.21 to permit rent to co-tenant out of possession of jointly owned business); <i>see also Lerman v. Levine</i>, 541 A.2d 523 (Conn. App. 1988) (construing Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-404(b)) (mother was entitled to set off for use and occupancy by her daughter and son-in-law after she voluntarily left the property).Which is the better rule?</p>
<p id="c5a5cb60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Adverse possession.</b> Because each tenant is legally entitled to occupy the property, one co-tenant cannot obtain adverse possession against another unless the possessing tenant makes clear to the nonpossessory tenant that he is asserting full ownership rights in the property to the exclusion of the other co-tenants. The courts generally require some affirmative act by which the nonpossessory tenant is put on notice that her co-owner is claiming adversely to the nonpossessory tenant’s interests. <i>See O’Connor v. Laroque</i>, 31 A.3d 1 (Conn. 2011) (no adverse possession despite 27 years of sole possession in the absence of “unequivocal” evidence of ouster).</p>
<p id="c5a5cb61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Trespass.</b> May one owner prevent another from receiving visitors in jointly owned property? Since each co-tenant possesses the whole, each is entitled to invite others onto the premises even if their co-owners object. But in <i>Georgia v. Randolph</i>, 547 U.S. 103 (2006), the Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment prohibited admission of evidence found after a wife gave the police permission to search the house for drugs, but her husband refused to allow them to enter. The Court held that the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure prohibits entry over the objections of a physically present resident, even if his co-owner consents. Justice Souter explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a5cb62-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of shared premises would have no confidence that one occupant’s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, “stay out.” Without some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside under those conditions.</p>
<p id="c5a5cb63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the co-tenant wishing to open the door to a third party has no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail over a present and objecting co-tenant, his disputed invitation, without more, gives a police officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the absence of any consent at all.</p>

<p id="c5a5f281-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joel Carr and his father, George Carr, now deceased, owned a parcel of land in Lincoln County as tenants in common. From 1974 through 1986 the Carrs leased the land to Richard Deking pursuant to a year-to-year oral agreement receiving one-third of the annual crop as rent. The Carrs paid for one-third of the fertilizer. In 1986, Joel Carr informed Mr. Deking he wanted cash rent beginning with the 1987 crop year. Mr. Deking was not receptive to this proposal.</p>
<p id="c5a5f282-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In February 1987 Joel Carr wrote a letter to Mr. Deking to determine if he wanted to continue leasing the property. Mr. Deking did not respond. Instead he discussed the lease with George Carr. On February 18 Joel Carr went to his father’s home and found Mr. Deking there discussing a possible 5-year lease. Joel Carr again indicated he wanted cash rent. Later that day, unbeknownst to Joel Carr, Mr. Deking and George Carr executed a written 10-year crop-share lease at the office of Mr. Deking’s attorney. Under this lease, Mr. Deking agreed to pay all fertilizer costs. Joel Carr neither consented to nor ratified this lease and never authorized George Carr to act on his behalf.</p>
<p id="c5a5f283-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In April Joel Carr gave notice to Mr. Deking that his tenancy would terminate at the end of the 1987 crop year. Mr. Deking responded that he would retain possession pursuant to the written lease with George Carr. In July Joel Carr commenced this action to declare that no valid lease existed, Mr. Deking had no right to farm the land and he should be required to vacate the land at the end of the 1987 crop year.</p>
<p id="c5a5f284-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Joel Carr contends [that] the rights of Mr. Deking as lessee are subordinate to those of a nonjoining tenant in common. He argues public policy should prevent prospective lessees from going behind the back of one tenant in common to obtain a more favorable lease from the other.</p>
<p id="c5a5f285-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, it is Mr. Deking’s position that George Carr could lawfully enter into a lease with respect to his own undivided one-half interest in the property, and <span title="679" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-679">p. 679</span>Joel Carr was not entitled to bring an ejectment action to which George Carr did not agree. He asserts the proper remedy is partition, not ejectment.</p>
<p id="c5a61996-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is well settled that each tenant in common of real property may use, benefit and possess the entire property subject only to the equal rights of cotenants. Thus, a cotenant may lawfully lease his own interest in the common property to another without the consent of the other tenant and without his joining in the lease. The nonjoining cotenant is not bound by this lease of the common property to third persons. The lessee “steps into the shoes” of the leasing cotenant and becomes a tenant in common with the other owners for the duration of the lease. A nonjoining tenant may not demand exclusive possession as against the lessee, but may only demand to be let into co-possession.</p>
<p id="c5a61997-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying these principles, we find Joel Carr is not entitled to eject Mr. Deking from the property. The proper remedy is partition and until that occurs, Mr. Deking is entitled to farm the land under the lease. There is no indication that this property is not amenable to physical partition. Joel Carr clearly has the right to that remedy. Joel Carr cites no authority and none has been found which would render the lease ineffective as between the estate of George Carr and Mr. Deking.</p>
<p id="c5a61998-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of our holding that the trial court properly denied Joel Carr’s effort to eject Mr. Deking, Joel Carr is entitled to the benefit of the Deking-George Carr lease, at his election, until a partition of the property occurs. However, Joel Carr cannot claim the benefits contained in the Deking-George Carr lease without also accepting the other terms of that lease. Consequently, we remand to the trial court to determine Joel Carr’s election choice [between] the prior oral lease with Mr. Deking [and] the Deking-George Carr lease.</p>

<p id="c5a6199e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A joint tenant leases his interest in the joint tenancy property to a third person for a term of years, and dies during that term. We conclude that the lease does not sever the joint tenancy, but expires upon the death of the lessor joint tenant.</p>
<p id="c5a6199f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Raymond Johnson and plaintiff Hazel Tenhet owned a parcel of property as joint tenants. Assertedly without plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, Johnson leased the property to defendant Boswell for a period of 10 years at a rental of $150 per year with a provision granting the lessee an “option to purchase.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104B7_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104B7_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> Johnson died some three <span title="680" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-680">p. 680</span>months after execution of the lease, and plaintiff sought to establish her sole right to possession of the property as the surviving joint tenant. After an unsuccessful demand upon defendant to vacate the premises, plaintiff brought this action to have the lease declared invalid.</p>
<p id="c5a619a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5a619a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An understanding of the nature of a joint interest in this state is fundamental to a determination of the question whether the present lease severed the joint tenancy. Civil Code section 683 provides in part: “A joint interest is one owned by two or more persons in equal shares, by a title created by a single will or transfer, when expressly declared in the will or transfer to be a joint tenancy.” This statute, requiring an express declaration for the creation of joint interests, does not abrogate the common law rule that four unities are essential to an estate in joint tenancy: unity of interest, unity of time, unity of title, and unity of possession.</p>
<p id="c5a640b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement of four unities reflects the basic concept that there is but one estate which is taken jointly; if an essential unity is destroyed the joint tenancy is severed and a tenancy in common results. Accordingly, one of two joint tenants may unilaterally terminate the joint tenancy by conveying his interest to a third person. Severance of the joint tenancy, of course, extinguishes the principal feature of that estate — the <i>jus accrescendi</i> or right of survivorship. Thus, a joint tenant’s right of survivorship is an expectancy that is not irrevocably fixed upon the creation of the estate; it arises only upon success in the ultimate gamble — survival — and then only if the unity of the estate has not theretofore been destroyed by voluntary conveyance, by involuntary alienation under an execution, or by any other action which operates to sever the joint tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5a640b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our initial inquiry is whether the partial alienation of Johnson’s interest in the property effected a severance of the joint tenancy under these principles. It could be argued that a lease destroys the unities of interest and possession because the leasing joint tenant transfers to the lessee his present possessory interest and retains a mere reversion. Moreover, the possibility that the term of the lease may continue beyond the lifetime of the lessor is inconsistent with a complete right of survivorship.</p>
<p id="c5a640b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, if the lease entered into here by Johnson and defendant is valid only during Johnson’s life, then the conveyance is more a variety of life estate <i>pur</i> [sic] <i>autre vie</i> than a term of years. Such a result is inconsistent with Johnson’s freedom to alienate his interest during his lifetime.</p>
<p id="c5a640b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are mindful that the issue here presented is “an ancient controversy, going back to Coke and Littleton.” Yet the problem is like a comet in our law: Though its existence in theory has been frequently recognized, its observed passages are few. Some authorities support the view that a lease by a joint tenant to a third person effects a complete and final severance of the joint tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5a640b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others adopt a position that there is a temporary severance during the term of the lease. If the lessor dies while the lease is in force, under this view the existence of the lease at the moment when the right of survivorship would otherwise take effect operates as a severance, extinguishing the joint tenancy. If, however, the term of the <span title="681" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-681">p. 681</span>lease expires before the lessor, it is reasoned that the joint tenancy is undisturbed because the joint tenants resume their original relation. The single conclusion that can be drawn from centuries of academic speculation on the question is that its resolution is unclear.</p>
<p id="c5a640b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we shall explain, it is our opinion that a lease is not so inherently inconsistent with joint tenancy as to create a severance, either temporary or permanent.</p>
<p id="c5a640b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Civil Code sections 683 and 686 a joint tenancy must be expressly declared in the creating instrument, or a tenancy in common results. This is a statutory departure from the common law preference in favor of joint tenancy. Inasmuch as the estate arises only upon express intent, and in many cases such intent will be the intent of the joint tenants themselves, we decline to find a severance in circumstances which do not clearly and unambiguously establish that either of the joint tenants desired to terminate the estate.</p>
<p id="c5a640ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If plaintiff and Johnson did not choose to continue the joint tenancy, they might have converted it into a tenancy in common by written mutual agreement. They might also have jointly conveyed the property to a third person and divided the proceeds. Even if they could not agree to act in concert, either plaintiff or Johnson might have severed the joint tenancy, with or without the consent of the other, by an act which was clearly indicative of an intent to terminate, such as a conveyance of her or his entire interest. Either might also have brought an action to partition the property, which, upon judgment, would have effected a severance. Because a joint tenancy may be created only by express intent, and because there are alternative and unambiguous means of altering the nature of that estate, we hold that the lease here in issue did not operate to sever the joint tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5a640bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5a640bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that the joint tenancy was not severed by the lease and that sole ownership of the property therefore vested in plaintiff upon her joint tenant’s death by operation of her right of survivorship, we turn next to the issue whether she takes the property unencumbered by the lease.</p>
<p id="c5a640bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the very nature of joint tenancy, the interest of the nonsurviving joint tenant extinguishes upon his death. And as the lease is valid only “in so far as the interest of the lessor in the joint property is concerned,” it follows that the lease of the joint tenancy property also expires when the lessor dies.</p>
<p id="c5a640be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conclusion is borne out by decisions in this state involving liens on and mortgages of joint tenancy property. In <i>Zeigler v. Bonnell</i>, 126 P.2d 118 (Cal. Ct. App. 1942), the Court of Appeal ruled that a surviving joint tenant takes an estate free from a judgment lien on the interest of a deceased cotenant judgment debtor. The court reasoned that “The right of survivorship is the chief characteristic that distinguishes a joint tenancy from other interests in property. The judgment lien of (the creditor) could attach only to the interest of his debtor. That interest terminated upon [the debtor’s] death.” <i>Id.</i> at 119. After his death “the deceased joint tenant had no interest in the property, and his judgment creditor has no greater rights.” <i>Id.</i> at 120.</p>
<p id="c5a640bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="682" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-682">p. 682</span>A similar analysis was followed in <i>People v. Nogarr</i>, 330 P.2d 858 (Cal. Ct. App. 1958), which held that upon the death of a joint tenant who had executed a mortgage on the tenancy property, the surviving joint tenant took the property free of the mortgage. The court reasoned that “as the mortgage lien attached only to such interest as [the deceased joint tenant] had in the real property[,] when his interest ceased to exist the lien of the mortgage expired with it.”</p>
<p id="c5a640c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As these decisions demonstrate, a joint tenant may, during his lifetime, grant certain rights in the joint property without severing the tenancy. But when such a joint tenant dies his interest dies with him, and any encumbrances placed by him on the property become unenforceable against the surviving joint tenant. For the reasons stated a lease falls within this rule.</p>
<p id="c5a640c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Any other result would defeat the justifiable expectations of the surviving joint tenant. Thus, if <i>A</i> agrees to create a joint tenancy with <i>B, A</i> can reasonably anticipate that when <i>B</i> dies <i>A</i> will take an unencumbered interest in fee simple. During his lifetime, of course, <i>B</i> may sever the tenancy or lease his interest to a third party. But to allow <i>B</i> to lease for a term continuing after his death would indirectly defeat the very purposes of the joint tenancy. For example, for personal reasons <i>B</i> might execute a 99-year lease on valuable property for a consideration of one dollar a year. <i>A</i> would then take a fee simple on <i>B</i>’s death, but would find his right to use the property — and its market value — substantially impaired. This circumstance would effectively nullify the benefits of the right of survivorship, the basic attribute of the joint tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5a640c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, we are not insensitive to the potential injury that may be sustained by a person in good faith who leases from one joint tenant. In some circumstances a lessee might be unaware that his lessor is not a fee simple owner but merely a joint tenant, and could find himself unexpectedly evicted when the lessor dies prior to expiration of the lease. This result would be avoided by a prudent lessee who conducts a title search prior to leasing, but we appreciate that such a course would often be economically burdensome to the lessee of a residential dwelling or a modest parcel of property. Nevertheless, it must also be recognized that every lessee may one day face the unhappy revelation that his lessor’s estate in the leased property is less than a fee simple. For example, a lessee who innocently rents from the holder of a life estate is subject to risks comparable to those imposed upon a lessee of joint tenancy property.</p>
<p id="c5a640c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More significantly, we cannot allow extraneous factors to erode the functioning of joint tenancy. The estate of joint tenancy is firmly embedded in centuries of real property law and in the California statute books. Its crucial element is the right of survivorship, a right that would be more illusory than real if a joint tenant were permitted to lease for a term continuing after his death. Accordingly, we hold that under the facts alleged in the complaint the lease herein is no longer valid.</p>

<p id="c5a640c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Leases by one co-owner.</b> Should common owners have the right to lease the premises without the consent of the co-tenants? Is the rule promulgated in <i>Carr v. Deking</i> a good one?</p>
<p id="c5a667d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="683" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-683">p. 683</span><b>2. Remedies for leases by one co-tenant.</b> The court in <i>Carr v. Deking</i> held that George Carr had the power to lease his one-half interest without Joel’s consent. But in conclusion, it suggests that the son, Joel Carr, is “entitled to the benefit of the Deking-George Carr lease, at his election” until partition. Other courts have also held that a co-owner has a right to choose to participate in the lease and obtain his proportional share of the rent. <i>American Standard Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. v. Speros</i>, 494 N.W.2d 599 (N.D. 1993). Doesn’t this assume that the agreed-upon rent is close to the fair rental value of the premises? Suppose Joel could show that the agreed-upon rent in the Deking-George Carr lease was only two-thirds of the fair rental value and had been discounted (reduced) because Deking knew he had the consent of only one of two joint owners. Is either George or Joel entitled to an increase in the rent to make it reflect its fair rental value? Couldn’t Joel force Deking to agree to such an increase by threatening to partition the property? If so, should Deking be required to pay fair rental value rather than the agreed-upon rent if he wishes to avoid partition? <i>Cf. George v. George</i>, 591 S.W.2d 655 (Ark. Ct. App. 1979) (setting aside 99-year lease for nominal rent that court found was intended to defraud the co-tenant).</p>
<p id="c5a667d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Leases by one joint tenant and the right of survivorship.</b> Courts are divided on the question of whether leases sever joint tenancies. Justice Mosk argues in <i>Tenhet v. Boswell</i> that “a lease is not so inherently inconsistent with joint tenancy as to create a severance.” Isn’t this circular reasoning? How does it help to ask whether a lease is consistent or inconsistent with something that the court is being asked to define? <i>Cf. In re Estate of Quick</i>, 905 A.2d 471 (Pa. 2006) (finding leases did not sever joint tenancy where they did not reflect intent to do so). Compare the analysis in <i>Alexander v. Boyer</i>, 253 A.2d 359 (Md. 1969), in which the court held, contrary to <i>Tenhet v. Boswell</i>, that a lease by one joint tenant severs the joint tenancy. Judge Barnes explained that when the joint tenant “conveyed her possessory rights in the land” to a lessee for a term of years, she “thereby chang[ed] the nature of her ‘interest’ in the land from a present interest to a reversionary interest.” In so doing, she parted with “all of her possessory rights for the term of the lease,” thereby “destroy[ing] the unities of interest and possession in the joint tenancy” and terminating it. <i>Id</i>. at 365. <i>Accord, Estate of Gulledge</i>, 673 A.2d 1278 (D.C. 1996). Is this explanation any less circular than that of Justice Mosk? What policies are relevant in answering the question whether a leasehold by one joint tenant destroys the right of survivorship of the other?</p>
<p id="c5a667d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It might be argued that joint tenants have no justified expectations in their right of survivorship since it is so highly contingent on events that may not happen. After all, it can be lost if one dies first or if one’s co-owner sells her interest in the property. On one hand, allowing severance may increase the alienability of property, especially if the court holds that leases given by one joint tenant do not survive the death of the lessor; few people will rent property if they know their possessory rights will end as soon as their landlord dies. On the other hand, the right of survivorship may increase the alienability of the property by decreasing the number of owners from two to one. This makes it easier for the property to be bought and sold since a potential lessee or buyer does not have to worry about obtaining the consent of more than one person. Which <span title="684" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-684">p. 684</span>rule better promotes the reasonable use of property? How should the courts balance the right of each tenant to transfer her interest (a right of freedom of action) against the right of the co-owner to her right of survivorship (a right of security against loss of her property interest)?</p>
<p id="c5a667da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Mortgages and the right of survivorship.</b> Courts are also divided on the question of whether mortgages sever joint tenancies. Most states describe the borrower who grants the mortgage as the owner or title holder and the bank or lender who takes the mortgage as a “lienholder,” with a right to possess the property only if the borrower defaults. In such states, courts typically hold that a mortgage by one tenant does not sever the joint tenancy. Foreclosure during the life of the tenant would sever the tenancy and create a tenancy in common between the non-borrowing tenant and the bank. If the borrowing tenant dies before foreclosure, however, the surviving co-tenant receives the entire property unburdened by the mortgage. <i>See Biggers v. Crook</i>, 656 S.E.2d 835 (Ga. 2008); <i>Harms v. Sprague</i>, 473 N.E.2d 930 (Ill. 1984);<i> Smith v. Bank of America</i>, 103 A.D.3d 21 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012). <i>But see General Credit Co. v. Cleck</i>, 609 A.2d 553 (Pa. Super. 1992) (holding that mortgage severed joint tenancy relying on 1806 decision from before Pennsylvania became a lien theory state).</p>
<p id="c5a667db-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A minority of states retain the older “title” theory, in which the lender takes title to the property, subject to an “equity of redemption” in the borrower who grants the mortgage. Some courts in title theory states consider a mortgage to be a transfer of ownership that has the effect of severing the joint tenancy, see<i> Schaefer v. Peoples Heritage Savings Bank</i>, 669 A.2d 185 (Me. 1996), although others do not. <i>Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Reed</i>, 725 S.E.2d 667 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012). There is no substantive difference between “lien” theory states and “title” theory states; the difference today is merely verbal. Assuming that the question of severance should not depend on such a flimsy argument, how should the case have been decided, and why?</p>

<p id="c5a667e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a civil action brought by the plaintiffs-appellants, Masako Sawada and Helen Sawada, in aid of execution of money judgments in their favor, seeking to set aside a conveyance of real property from judgment debtor Kokichi Endo to Samuel H. Endo and Toru Endo, defendants-appellees herein, on the ground that the conveyance as to the Sawadas was fraudulent.</p>
<p id="c5a68df4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On November 30, 1968, the Sawadas were injured when struck by a motor vehicle operated by Kokichi Endo. On June 17, 1969, Helen Sawada filed her complaint for damages against Kokichi Endo. Masako Sawada filed her suit against him on August 13, 1969. The complaint and summons in each case was served on Kokichi Endo on October 29, 1969.</p>
<p id="c5a68df5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="685" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-685">p. 685</span>On the date of the accident, Kokichi Endo was the owner, as a tenant by the entirety with his wife, Ume Endo, of a parcel of real property situate at Wahiawa, Oahu, Hawai`i. By deed, dated July 26, 1969, Kokichi Endo and his wife conveyed the property to their sons, Samuel H. Endo and Toru Endo. This document was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on December 17, 1969. No consideration was paid by the grantees for the conveyance. Both were aware at the time of the conveyance that their father had been involved in an accident, and that he carried no liability insurance. Kokichi Endo and Ume Endo, while reserving no life interests therein, continued to reside on the premises.</p>
<p id="c5a68df6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 19, 1971, after a consolidated trial on the merits, judgment was entered in favor of Helen Sawada and against Kokichi Endo in the sum of $8,846.46. At the same time, Masako Sawada was awarded judgment on her complaint in the amount of $16,199.28. Ume Endo, wife of Kokichi Endo, died on January 29, 1971. She was survived by her husband, Kokichi. Subsequently, after being frustrated in their attempts to obtain satisfaction of judgment from the personal property of Kokichi Endo, the Sawadas brought suit to set aside the conveyance which is the subject matter of this controversy. The trial court refused to set aside the conveyance, and the Sawadas appeal.</p>
<p id="c5a68df7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determinative question in this case is, whether the interest of one spouse in real property, held in tenancy by the entireties, is subject to levy and execution by his or her individual creditors. This issue is one of first impression in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c5a68df8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A brief review of the present state of the tenancy by the entirety might be helpful. Dean Phipps, writing in 1951,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105E7_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N105E7_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> pointed out that only nineteen states and the District of Columbia continued to recognize it as a valid and subsisting institution in the field of property law. Phipps divided these jurisdictions into four groups. He made no mention of Alaska and Hawai`i, both of which were then territories of the United States.</p>
<p id="c5a68dfa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Group I states (Massachusetts, Michigan, and North Carolina) the estate is essentially the common law tenancy by the entireties, unaffected by the <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i>. As at common law, the possession and profits of the estate are subject to the husband’s exclusive dominion and control. In all three states, as at common law, the husband may convey the entire estate subject only to the possibility that the wife may become entitled to the whole estate upon surviving him. As at common law, the obverse as to the wife does not hold true. Only in Massachusetts, however, is the estate in its entirety subject to levy by the husband’s creditors. In both Michigan and North Carolina, the use and income from the estate is not subject to levy during the marriage for the separate debts of either spouse.</p>
<p id="c5a68dfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Group II states (Alaska, Arkansas, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon) the interest of the debtor spouse in the estate may be sold or levied upon for his or her separate debts, subject to the other spouse’s contingent right of survivorship. Alaska, which has been added to this group, has provided by statute that the interest of a <span title="686" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-686">p. 686</span>debtor spouse in any type of estate, except a homestead as defined and held in tenancy by the entirety, shall be subject to his or her separate debts.</p>
<p id="c5a68dfc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the Group III jurisdictions (Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming) an attempted conveyance by either spouse is wholly void, and the estate may not be subjected to the separate debts of one spouse only.</p>
<p id="c5a68dfd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Group IV, the two states of Kentucky and Tennessee hold that the contingent right of survivorship appertaining to either spouse is separately alienable by him and attachable by his creditors during the marriage. The use and profits, however, may neither be alienated nor attached during coverture.</p>
<p id="c5a68dfe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears, therefore, that Hawai`i is the only jurisdiction still to be heard from on the question. Today we join that group of states and the District of Columbia which hold that under the <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i> the interest of a husband or a wife in an estate by the entireties is not subject to the claims of his or her individual creditors during the joint lives of the spouses. In so doing, we are placing our stamp of approval upon what is apparently the prevailing view of the lower courts of this jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c5a68dff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hawai`i has long recognized and continues to recognize the tenancy in common, the joint tenancy, and the tenancy by the entirety, as separate and distinct estates. That the <i>Married Women’s Property Act</i> of 1888 was not intended to abolish the tenancy by the entirety was made clear by the language of Act 19 of the Session Laws of Hawai`i, 1903 (now Haw. Rev. Stat. §509-1). The tenancy by the entirety is predicated upon the legal unity of husband and wife, and the estate is held by them in single ownership. They do not take by moieties, but both and each are seized of the whole estate.</p>
<p id="c5a68e00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A joint tenant has a specific, albeit undivided, interest in the property, and if he survives his cotenant he becomes the owner of a larger interest than he had prior to the death of the other joint tenant. But tenants by the entirety are each deemed to be seized of the entirety from the time of the creation of the estate. At common law, this taking of the “whole estate” did not have the real significance that it does today, insofar as the rights of the wife in the property were concerned. For all practical purposes, the wife had no right during coverture to the use and enjoyment and exercise of ownership in the marital estate. All she possessed was her contingent right of survivorship.</p>
<p id="c5a68e01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect of the <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i> was to abrogate the husband’s common law dominance over the marital estate and to place the wife on a level of equality with him as regards the exercise of ownership over the whole estate. The tenancy was and still is predicated upon the legal unity of husband and wife, but the Acts converted it into a unity of equals and not of unequals as at common law. No longer could the husband convey, lease, mortgage or otherwise encumber the property without her consent. The Acts confirmed her right to the use and enjoyment of the whole estate, and all the privileges that ownership of property confers, including the right to convey the property in its entirety, jointly with her husband, during the marriage relation. They also had the effect of insulating the wife’s interest in the estate from the separate debts of her husband.</p>
<p id="c5a68e02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="687" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-687">p. 687</span>Neither husband nor wife has a separate divisible interest in the property held by the entirety that can be conveyed or reached by execution. A joint tenancy may be destroyed by voluntary alienation, or by levy and execution, or by compulsory partition, but a tenancy by the entirety may not. The indivisibility of the estate, except by joint action of the spouses, is an indispensable feature of the tenancy by the entirety.</p>
<p id="c5a6b513-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not persuaded by the argument that it would be unfair to the creditors of either spouse to hold that the estate by the entirety may not, without the consent of both spouses, be levied upon for the separate debts of either spouse. No unfairness to the creditor is involved here. We agree with the court in <i>Hurd v. Hughes</i>, 109 A. 418, 420 (Del. Ch. 1920): “But creditors are not entitled to special consideration. If the debt arose prior to the creation of the estate, the property was not a basis of credit, and if the debt arose subsequently the creditor presumably had notice of the characteristics of the estate which limited his right to reach the property.”</p>
<p id="c5a6b514-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We might also add that there is obviously nothing to prevent the creditor from insisting upon the subjection of property held in tenancy by the entirety as a condition precedent to the extension of credit. Further, the creation of a tenancy by the entirety may not be used as a device to defraud existing creditors.</p>
<p id="c5a6b515-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were we to view the matter strictly from the standpoint of public policy, we would still be constrained to hold as we have done here today.</p>
<p id="c5a6b516-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a matter of common knowledge that the demand for single-family residential lots has increased rapidly in recent years, and the magnitude of the problem is emphasized by the concentration of the bulk of fee simple land in the hands of a few. The shortage of single-family residential fee simple property is critical and government has seen fit to attempt to alleviate the problem through legislation. When a family can afford to own real property, it becomes their single most important asset. Encumbered as it usually is by a first mortgage, the fact remains that so long as it remains whole during the joint lives of the spouses, it is always available in its entirety for the benefit and use of the entire family. Loans for education and other emergency expenses, for example, may be obtained on the security of the marital estate. This would not be possible where a third party has become a tenant in common or a joint tenant with one of the spouses, or where the ownership of the contingent right of survivorship of one of the spouses in a third party has cast a cloud upon the title of the marital estate, making it virtually impossible to utilize the estate for these purposes.</p>
<p id="c5a6b517-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we were to select between a public policy favoring the creditors of one of the spouses and one favoring the interests of the family unit, we would not hesitate to choose the latter. But we need not make this choice for, as we pointed out earlier, by the very nature of the estate by the entirety as we view it, and as other courts of our sister jurisdictions have viewed it, “[a] unilaterally indestructible right of survivorship, an inability of one spouse to alienate his interest, and, importantly for this case, a broad immunity from claims of separate creditors remain among its vital incidents.” <i>In re Estate of Wall</i>, 440 F.2d 215, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>
<p id="c5a6b518-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having determined that an estate by the entirety is not subject to the claims of the creditors of one of the spouses during their joint lives, we now hold that the conveyance of the marital property by Kokichi Endo and Ume Endo, husband and wife, to <span title="688" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-688">p. 688</span>their sons, Samuel H.

<p id="c5a6b51a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority reaches its conclusion by holding that the effect of the <i>Married Women’s Act</i> was to equalize the positions of the spouses by taking from the husband his common law right to transfer his interest, rather than by elevating the wife’s right of alienation of her interest to place it on a position of equality with the husband’s. I disagree. I believe that a better interpretation of the <i>Married Women’s Acts</i> is that offered by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <i>King v. Greene</i>, 153 A.2d 49, 60 (N.J. 1959):</p>

And it follows, that if the wife takes equal rights with the husband in the estate, she must take equal disabilities. Such are the dictates of common equality. Thus, the judgment creditors of either spouse may levy and execute upon their separate rights of survivorship.</p>

Feenstra</i>, 450 U.S. 455, 456 (1981), the Supreme Court considered a Louisiana statute giving the “husband as ‘head and master’ of property jointly owned with his wife, the unilateral right to dispose of such property without his spouse’s consent.” <i>Id.</i> at 456. The Court held that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because the classification was not substantially related to achieving an important governmental interest. <i>Id.</i> at 458-459.</p>

Creditors’ rights to reach tenancy by the entirety property.</b> Massachusetts, Michigan, and North Carolina, the states that <i>Sawada v. Endo</i> stated still recognized the husband’s exclusive dominion over property by the entirety, have now abolished the husband’s prerogative. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, §1; Mich. Comp. Laws §557.71; N.C. Gen. Stat. §39-13.6. Therefore the four rules <i>Sawada</i> described have collapsed into three:</p>
<p id="c5a6dc31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) The substantial majority of states follow the <i>Sawada</i> rule that creditors cannot reach property held in the form of tenancy by the entirety to satisfy debts of one spouse; even if the property is sold or the debtor spouse survives the non-debtor, the creditor has no claim on the estate.</p>

Creditors may not, however, defeat the non-debtor spouse’s survivorship interest, and may not be able to demand partition of the property. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Capital Finance Co. Delaware Valley, Inc. v. Asterbadi</i>, 942 A.2d 21 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2008).</p>
<p id="c5a6dc33-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) A few states, including Tennessee and Kentucky, hold that the creditor may only attach the debtor spouse’s right of survivorship; the creditor only may possess the property if the debtor survives the non-debtor spouse. <i>See Robinson v. Trousdale County</i>, 516 S.W.2d 626, 630-631 (Tenn. 1974); <i>Raybro Elec. Supplies, Inc. v. Barclay</i>, 813 F. Supp. 1267 (W.D. Ky. 1992) (construing Kentucky law).</p>

<p id="c5a6dc35-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Tax liens.</b> In <i>United States v. Craft</i>, 535 U.S. 274 (2002), the wife of a delinquent taxpayer sued the United States to recover half the proceeds of the sale of tenancy by the entirety property. The United States had placed a lien on that portion of the proceeds to pay off her husband’s delinquent federal taxes. The wife noted that under Michigan law, one tenant by the entirety has no interest separable from that of the spouse; state law did not allow her husband’s creditors to reach his interest to satisfy his unpaid debts, and he therefore had no individual interest in the property that could be reached by the federal government to pay his unpaid taxes. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that his interest did constitute “property” or a “right to property” within the meaning of the federal tax lien legislation. Using the legal realist metaphor of property as a “bundle of sticks,” Justice O’Connor explained that the husband had a number of “the most essential property rights: the right to use the property, to receive income produced by it and to exclude others from it.” <i>Id.</i> at 283. He also possessed the right to alienate the property with his wife’s consent. “There is no reason to believe, however, that this one stick — the right of unilateral alienation — is essential to the category of ‘property.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at 284. The Court noted it had previously decided that the government had the discretion to foreclose on an individual’s interest in property, even though he lacked the unilateral power of alienation. This would mean that the United States could force a sale of the property over the wife’s objections to satisfy the husband’s unpaid taxes. However, the Internal Revenue Service has recognized that this creates “adverse consequences for the non-liable spouse of the taxpayer” and thus the use of foreclosure in such cases will be “determined on a case-by-case basis.” <i>See Collection Issues Related to Entireties Property</i>, IRS Notice 2003-60, 2003-39 I.R.B. 643, 2003 WL 22100950 (Sept. 29, 2003). Once property is sold with the consent of both owners, as it was in <i>Craft</i>, the United States can take the husband’s one-half share of the proceeds of the sale. This does not mean the delinquent taxpayer can <i>give</i> his property interest to his spouse and avoid paying the taxes. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5a6dc36-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Stevens dissented. Justice Scalia noted that the Court “nullifies (insofar as federal taxes are concerned, at least) a form of property ownership that was of particular benefit to the stay-at-home spouse or mother [who is] overwhelmingly unlikely to be the source of the individual indebtedness against which a tenancy by the entirety protects.” <i>Id.</i> at 289-290. Justice Thomas opined that state law <span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>defined the husband not to have any separate interest in the property; thus he had no individual “property” or “rights to property” to which the federal tax lien could attach. <i>Id.</i> at 292-299.</p>
<p id="c5a6dc37-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Presumptions.</b> Although ambiguous conveyances are normally interpreted as tenancies in common rather than joint tenancies, jurisdictions that have the tenancy by the entirety may presume that a conveyance to a married couple is held by the entirety. <i>Beal Bank v. Almand &amp; Associates</i>, 780 So. 2d 45 (Fla. 2001).</p>
<p id="c5a6dc38-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Homestead laws.</b> Homestead laws may protect the surviving spouse’s ownership and occupancy rights in the family home from demands of the decedent’s creditors. The effect of such laws may be to prevent the homeowner from transferring or encumbering her interests in the family home without the consent of both spousal owners. A few states provide unlimited protection for the value of the home, but most exempt only a certain dollar value, and these values are infrequently adjusted for inflation. Although the Endos’s property was a homestead under Hawaiian law, the amount of homestead exemption at the time was very low: only $2,750 of its value was protected from creditors.

<p id="c5a7034b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can a tenancy by the entirety be created by contract? Individuals who do not wish to marry, or married couples who live in states that have abolished the tenancy of entirety, may want to ensure that property is not sold or encumbered without the consent of either party. Imagine, for example, two friends who wish to live together and share expenses as they age. They buy a house together as joint tenants. The deed is recorded with a separate document containing a covenant between the two in which each covenants not to bring an action for partition of the property so long as both live in the house. It also provides that partition should not be allowed before the parties have reached a comprehensive property settlement in the event they move out; that settlement can either be one they voluntarily agree to or one that is imposed by a court in the context of litigation. The covenant also states that neither party may encumber, mortgage, sell, or lease their undivided interests without the consent of the other and that neither one owns a property interest that can be attached by creditors unless both owners agree to the transaction. The friends are attempting to create the incidents of a tenancy by the entirety through a contract, even though they are not married.</p>
<p id="c5a7034c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are the covenants enforceable, including (a) the covenant limiting the right to partition, (b) the restraint on alienation, and (c) the attempt to limit the ability of creditors to reach the parties’ individual interests? Or are they void, either because they constitute an attempt to create a new estate or because they constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation?</p>

<p id="c5a70354-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is a dispute involving approximately 75 acres of land situate in Lincoln County, West Virginia. The record indicates that “[t]he Caudill family has owned the land for nearly 100 years.” The property “consists of a farmhouse, constructed around 1920, several small barns, and a garden[.]” Prior to 2001, the property was owned exclusively by the Caudill family. However, in 2001 Ark Land acquired a 67.5% undivided interest in the land by purchasing the property interests of several Caudill family members. Ark Land attempted to purchase the remaining property interests held by the Caudill heirs, but they refused to sell. Ark Land sought to purchase all of the property for the express purpose of extracting coal by surface mining.</p>
<p id="c5a70355-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the Caudill heirs refused to sell their interest in the land, Ark Land filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County in October of 2001. Ark Land filed the complaint seeking to have the land partitioned and sold. On October 30, 2002, the circuit court entered an order directing the partition and sale of the property.</p>
<p id="c5a72a66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dispositive issue is whether the evidence supported the circuit court’s conclusion that the property could not be conveniently partitioned in kind, thus warranting a partition by sale. During the proceeding before the circuit court, the Caudill heirs presented expert testimony by Gary F. Acord, a mining engineer. Mr. Acord testified that the property could be partitioned in kind. Specifically, Mr. Acord testified that lands surrounding the family home did not have coal deposits and could therefore be partitioned from the remaining lands. On the other hand, Ark Land presented expert testimony which indicated that such a partition would entail several million dollars in additional costs in order to mine for coal.</p>
<p id="c5a72a67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note at the outset that “[p]artition means the division of the land held in cotenancy into the cotenants’ respective fractional shares. If the land cannot be fairly divided, then the entire estate may be sold and the proceeds appropriately divided.” 7 <i>Powell on Real Property</i>, §50.07[1] (2004). It has been observed that, “[i]n the United States, partition was established by statute in each of the individual states. Unlike the partition in kind which existed under early common law, the forced judicial sale was an American innovation.” Phyliss Craig-Taylor, <i>Through a Colored Looking Glass: A View of Judicial Partition, Family Land Loss, and Rule Setting</i>, 78 Wash. U. L.Q. 737, 752 (2000).</p>
<p id="c5a72a68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Partition by sale, when it is not voluntary by all parties, can be a harsh result for the cotenant(s) who opposes the sale. This is because “ ‘[a] particular piece of real estate cannot be replaced by any sum of money, however large; and one who wants a particular estate for a specific use, if deprived of his rights, cannot be said to receive an exact equivalent or complete indemnity by the payment of a sum of money.’” Consequently, “[p]artition in kind . . . is the preferred method of partition because it leaves cotenants <span title="692" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-692">p. 692</span>holding the same estates as before and does not force a sale on unwilling cotenants.” Powell, §50.07[4][a]. The laws in all jurisdictions “appear to reflect this longstanding principle by providing a presumption of severance of common ownership in real property by partition in-kind[.]” Craig-Taylor, <i>supra</i> at 752.</p>

<p id="c5a72a6a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By virtue of W. Va.

<p id="c5a72a6b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its lengthy order requiring partition and sale, the circuit court addressed each of the three factors in <i>Consolidated Gas Supply Corp</i>. as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a72a6c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(14) [T]he subject property’s nature, character, and amount are such that it cannot be conveniently, (that is “practically or justly”) partitioned, or divided by allotment among its owners. Moreover, it is just and necessary to conclude that such a proposal as has been made by the [Caudill heirs], that of allotting the manor house and the surrounding “bottom land” unto the [Caudill heirs], cannot be affected without undeniably prejudicing [Ark Land’s] interests, in violation of the mandatory provisions of Code §37-4-3; and,</p>
<p id="c5a72a6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(15) [W]hile its uniform topography superficially suggests a division-in-kind, as proposed by Mr. Acord, the access road, the bottom lands and the relatively flat home site is, in fact, integral to establishing the fair market value of the subject property in its entirety, as its highest and best use as mining property, as shown by the uncontroverted testimony of [Ark Land’s] experts Mr. Morgan and Mr. Terry; and,</p>
<p id="c5a72a6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(16) [I]t is undisputed that the remaining heirs, that are [the Caudill heirs] herein, do not wish to sell, or have the Court sell, their interests in the subject property, solely due to their sincere sentiment for it as the family’s “home place.” Other family members, however, did not feel the same way. Given the equally undisputed testimony of [Ark Land’s] experts, it is just and reasonable for the Court to conclude that the interests of all the subject property’s owners will not be financially prejudiced, but will be financially promoted, by sale of the subject property and distribution among them of the proceeds, according to their respective interests. The subject property’s value as coal mining property, its uncontroverted highest and best use, would be substantially impaired by severing the family’s “home place” and allotting it to them separately.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a72a6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are troubled by the circuit court’s conclusion that partition by sale was necessary because the economic value of the property would be less if partitioned in kind. We have long held that the economic value of property may be a factor to consider in determining whether to partition in kind or to force a sale. However, our cases do not support the conclusion that economic value of property is the exclusive test for determining whether to partition in kind or to partition by sale. In fact, we explicitly stated in <i>Hale v. Thacker</i>, 12 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1940), “that many considerations, other than monetary, attach to the ownership of land, and courts should be, and always have been, slow to take away from owners of real estate their common-law right to have the same set aside to them in kind.”</p>
<p id="c5a72a70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="693" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-693">p. 693</span>Other courts have also found that monetary consideration is not the only factor to contemplate when determining whether to partition property in kind or by sale. In the case of <i>Eli v. Eli</i>, 557 N.W.2d 405 (S.D. 1997), the South Dakota Supreme Court [reversed an order of partition in kind over the objection of one of three co-owners of farmland in the Eli family for almost 100 years]: “[M]onetary considerations, while admittedly significant, do not rise to the level of excluding all other appropriate considerations. . . . The sale of property ‘without [the owner’s] consent is an extreme exercise of power warranted only in clear cases.’ ”</p>
<p id="c5a72a71-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, in <i>Delfino v. Vealencis</i>, 436 A.2d 27 (Conn. 1980), two plaintiffs owned a 20.5 acre tract of land with the defendant. The defendant used part of the property for her home and a garbage removal business. The plaintiffs filed an action to force a sale of the property so that they could use it to develop residential properties. The trial court concluded that a partition in kind could not be had without great prejudice to the parties, and that the highest and best use of the property was through development as residential property. The trial court therefore ordered that the property be sold at auction. The defendant appealed. The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed for the following reasons:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a72a72-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>It is the interests of all of the tenants in common that the court must consider; and not merely the economic gain of one tenant, or a group of tenants.</i> The trial court failed to give due consideration to the fact . . . that the [defendant] has made her home on the property; and that she derives her livelihood from the operation of a business on this portion of the property, as her family before her has for many years. A partition by sale would force the defendant to surrender her home and, perhaps, would jeopardize her livelihood. It is under just such circumstances, which include the demonstrated practicability of a physical division of the property, that the wisdom of the law’s preference for partition in kind is evident.</p>

<p id="c5a75184-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In view of the prior decisions of this Court, as well as the decisions from other jurisdictions, we now make clear and hold that, in a partition proceeding in which a party opposes the sale of property, the economic value of the property is not the exclusive test for deciding whether to partition in kind or by sale. Evidence of longstanding ownership, coupled with sentimental or emotional interests in the property, may also be considered in deciding whether the interests of the party opposing the sale will be prejudiced by the property’s sale. This latter factor should ordinarily control when it is shown that the property can be partitioned in kind, though it may entail some economic inconvenience to the party seeking a sale.</p>
<p id="c5a75185-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, the Caudill heirs were not concerned with the monetary value of the property. Their exclusive interest was grounded in the longstanding family ownership of the property and their emotional desire to keep their ancestral family home within the family. It is quite clear that this emotional interest would be prejudiced through a sale of the property.</p>
<p id="c5a75186-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The expert for the Caudill heirs testified that the ancestral family home could be partitioned from the property in such a way as to not deprive Ark Land of any coal.

In 2001 Ark Land purchased ownership rights in the property from some Caudill family members. When the Caudill heirs refused to sell their ownership rights, Ark Land immediately sought to force a judicial sale of the property. In doing this, Ark Land established that its proposed use of the property, surface coal mining, gave greater value to the property. This showing is self-serving. In most instances, when a commercial entity purchases property because it believes it can make money from a specific use of the property, that property will increase in value based upon the expectations of the commercial entity. This self-created enhancement in the value of property cannot be the determinative factor in forcing a pre-existing co-owner to give up his/her rights in property. To have such a rule would permit commercial entities to always “evict” pre-existing co-owners, because a commercial entity’s interest in property will invariably increase its value.</p>
<p id="c5a7518b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are very sensitive to the fact that Ark Land will incur greater costs in conducting its business on the property as a result of partitioning in kind. However, Ark Land voluntarily took an economical gamble that it would be able to get all of the Caudill family members to sell their interests in the property. Ark Land’s gamble failed. The Caudill heirs refused to sell their interests. The fact that Ark Land miscalculated on its ability to acquire outright all interests in the property cannot form the basis for depriving the Caudill heirs of their emotional interests in maintaining their ancestral family home. The additional cost to Ark Land that will result from a partitioning in kind simply does not impose the type of injurious inconvenience that would justify stripping the Caudill heirs of the emotional interest they have in preserving their ancestral family home.</p>

We, therefore, reverse the circuit court’s order requiring sale of the property.

<p id="c5a778a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the dissent suggests, coal mining is an important industry in West Virginia. West Virginia Supreme Court justices, like those in many states, are elected. An infamous election occurred in the year <i>Ark Land</i> was decided. Coal company Massey Energy spent $3 million to get Brent Benjamin elected to the court as part of a successful effort to win reversal of a $50 million judgment against it. The authors of both the majority and dissent in <i>Ark Land</i> were implicated in the resulting scandal. <i>See</i> Lawrence Leaman, <i>The Price of Justice: A True Story of Greed and Corruption</i> (2013).</p>

In that regard, the record shows that none of the appellants have resided at the subject property for years. At most, the property has been used for weekend retreats. While this may have been the family “homeplace,” a majority of the family has already sold their interests in the property to the appellee. Only a minority of the family members, the appellants, have refused to do so. I believe that the sporadic use of the property by the appellants in this case does not outweigh the economic inconvenience that the appellee will suffer as a result of this property being partitioned in kind.</p>

<p id="c5a778a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am also troubled by the majority’s decision that this property should be partitioned in kind instead of being sold because I don’t believe that such would have been the case were this property going to be put to some use other than coal mining. For instance, I think the majority’s decision would have been different if this property was going to be used in the construction of a four-lane highway. Under those circumstances, I believe the majority would have concluded that such economic activity takes precedence over any long-term use or sentimental attachment to the property on the part of the appellants. In my opinion, coal mining is an equally important economic activity. This decision destroys the value of this land as coal mining property because the appellee would incur several million dollars in additional costs to continue its mining operations. As a result of the majority’s decision in this case, many innocent coal miners will be out of work.</p>

<p id="c5a778a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Why partition?</b> Co-tenancy has many advantages. It permits parties to jointly finance purchases they could not otherwise make and divide family property among all family members. But it also may create disputes over management, profits, and expenses. Tenants who wish to end a co-tenancy may agree to divide or sell the land, so-called <b>voluntary partition</b>. When they cannot agree, one tenant can seek<b> involuntary</b> or <b>judicial partition</b>. One court has characterized involuntary partition as “nothing short of the private condemnation of private land for private purposes, a result which is abhorrent to the rights of defendant as a freeholder.” <i>Butte Creek Island Ranch v. Crim</i>, 186 Cal. Rptr. 252, 256 (Dist. Ct. App. 1982). But the interests of the petitioning tenant are involved as well. In the words of another court, “No person can be compelled to remain the owner with another of real estate . . . every owner is entitled to the fullest enjoyment of his property, and that can come only through an ownership free from dictation by others as to the manner in which it may be exercised.” <i>Fernandes v. Rodriguez</i>, 761 A.2d 128, 1288 (Conn. 2000).</p>
<p id="c5a778a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="696" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-696">p. 696</span><b>2. In kind or by sale. Partition in kind</b> divides the property itself among the co-tenants. Where the property cannot be divided in parcels of exactly proportional value, the co-tenant receiving disproportionate value must pay the other co-tenant <b>owelty</b> (OH-el-tee) to compensate for the difference. <b>Partition by sale</b> orders the property sold, on the open market or at auction, and the proceeds divided. Some jurisdictions by statute also permit forced sale of one tenant’s interest to another. Although statutes in all jurisdictions express a strong preference for partition in kind, partition by sale is typical in many states. <i>Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act</i>, §8 (2010).</p>
<p id="c5a778a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts may order partition by sale if (1) division of the parcel is not practicable or (2) partition by kind will create “great prejudice,” “substantial injury” or be “inequitable” to the tenants. Although cases like <i>Ark Land</i> sometimes reject partition by sale if there are significant identity interests in the property, more often courts simply order partition by sale if the property is worth “materially less” divided than it would be if sold as a single parcel. <i>See</i> 4 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §38.04); N.C. Gen. Stat. §46-22 (defining “substantial injury” justifying sale as when “the fair market value of each cotenant’s share in an actual partition of the property would be materially less than the amount each cotenant would receive from the sale of the whole”); <i>Schnell v. Schnell</i>, 346 N.W.2d 713, 716 (N.D. 1984) (“Sentimental reasons, particularly in the preservation of a home, may also be considered, although they are subordinate to the pecuniary interests of the parties.”); <i>Fike v. Sharer</i>, 571 P.2d 1252, 1254 (Or. 1977) (“[T]he financial interests of the owners is the primary factor to be considered for purposes of a determination of prejudice in the event of partition or sale.”). Forced sales have been identified as one cause for the sharp decline in rural land ownership by African Americans. <i>See</i> Todd Lewan &amp; Dolores Barclay, <i>Developers and Lawyers Use a Legal Maneuver to Strip Black Families of Land</i>, Associated Press, Dec. 30, 2001. The Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, promulgated in 2010, seeks to limit forced sales of heirs property; thus far it has been adopted in eight states.</p>
<p id="c5a778a9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much scholarship considers the tension between market value and subjective value of the property, often concluding that the law adequately protects subjective value. <i>See</i> Abraham Bell &amp; Gideon Parchomovsky,<i> A Theory of Property</i>, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 531, 601 (2005); Thomas J. Miceli &amp; C.F. Stermans, <i>Partition of Real Estate, or, Breaking Up Is (Not) Hard to Do</i>, 29 J. Legal Stud. 783, 795 (2000). The price fetched at a partition sale, however, is likely to be far less than the market value. Partition sales are typically conducted at auctions with minimal advertising and few bidders; because individuals cannot usually obtain financing to bid at such auctions, the only bidders will often be realtors and others tipped off to such auctions or, as in <i>Ark Land</i>, developers who have purchased co-tenants’ shares solely for the purpose of forcing a sale. <i>See</i> Thomas W. Mitchell, Stephen Malpezzi &amp; Richard K. Green, <i>Forced Sale Risk: Class, Race, and the Double Discount</i>, 37 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 589, 611-613 (2010) (noting that courts often refuse to set aside partition sales prices of less than 50 percent of market value).</p>
<p id="c5a778aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Agreements not to partition.</b> Co-tenants sometimes agree among themselves not to partition jointly held property; grantors also sometimes attempt to prevent partition by including restrictions against partition in a deed or will. Although such agreements were traditionally held to be void as restraints on alienation, today <span title="697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-697">p. 697</span>courts are likely to uphold them if they are reasonably limited in time and have a reasonable purpose. William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §5.11, at 216 (3d ed. 2000); <i>compare Kopp v. Kopp</i>, 488 A.2d 636 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1985) (upholding a separation agreement restricting the husband’s right to partition so long as the wife lived and was residing in the house) <i>and Libeau v. Fox</i>, 892 A.2d 1068 (Del. 2006) (upholding agreement to give non-selling co-tenants a right of first refusal and that those purchasing the interest would be bound by rights of survivorship), <i>with Vinson v. Johnson</i>, 931 So. 2d 245 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) (invalidating testamentary prohibition on partition of house and farm willed to testator’s nine children). Statutes typically prohibit partition of common areas of condominiums.</p>

<p id="c5a79fc1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the common law of England, a single woman (a <i>feme sole</i>) enjoyed the same rights to hold and manage property and to enter enforceable contracts as did a man. Once married, however, the husband retained the sole power to possess and control the profits of all land owned by himself and his wife. The wife was called a <b>feme covert</b>, and her status was described by the institution of <b>coverture.</b> The husband and wife were treated as one person in the eyes of the law; that person was the husband. He had the power to convey his wife’s property without her consent and to control all the profits of the land. In addition, his consent was required in order to sell her land.</p>
<p id="c5a79fc2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the rigidity of the law courts, the equity courts created a variety of mechanisms by which some married women could exercise property rights during marriage. First, they could enforce antenuptial agreements by which some husbands voluntarily gave control over property to their wives. Second, a trust could be created for the benefit of the wife, and she could enforce the trust as the beneficiary without her husband’s consent. Fathers often took this route to keep property in their daughters’ control rather than allowing it to pass to their prospective sons-in-law. William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §2.13, at 65-66 (3d ed. 2000).</p>
<p id="c5a79fc3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law did give the wife certain important property interests to take effect at the death of her husband. The common law gave the surviving spouse a life estate in all or some of the land owned by the deceased spouse at the time of his death. The wife’s <b>dower</b> interest consisted of a life estate in one-third of the freehold lands of which the husband was seised at any time during the marriage and that could be inherited by the couple’s children. The wife’s dower interest could not be alienated by her husband without her consent; nor could it be used to satisfy the husband’s debts. The husband’s equivalent <b>curtesy</b> interest consisted of a life estate in <i>all</i> the lands in which his wife owned a present freehold estate during the marriage and that was inheritable by issue of the couple. However, the husband’s curtesy interest sprang into being <i>only</i> if the couple had a child capable of inheriting the property. Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra</i>, at 67-69.</p>

<p id="c5a79fc7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the second half of the nineteenth century (starting with Mississippi in 1839), all common law states passed <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i>. These statutes abolished coverture and removed the economic disabilities previously imposed on married women. After passage of the statutes, married women had the same rights as single women and married men to contract, to hold and manage property, and to sue and be sued. The wife’s earnings were her separate property and could not be controlled or taken by her husband without her consent; nor could her separate property be seized by her husband’s creditors. At the same time, these acts failed to achieve the aims of nineteenth-century women’s rights advocates who “sought to emancipate wives’ labor in the household as well as in the market, and to do so, advocated ‘joint property’ laws that would recognize wives’ claims to marital assets to which husbands otherwise had title.” Reva B. Siegel, <i>Home as Work: The First Woman’s Rights Claims Concerning Wives’ Household Labor, 1850-1880</i>, 103 Yale L.J. 1073, 1077 (1994). They argued that wives were “entitled to joint rights in marital property by reason of the labor they contributed to the family economy.” <i>Id.</i> Many women worked inside the home for no wages; the <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i> failed to grant such women any rights in marital property, while family law doctrines preserved their duties to render services inside the home. Other women engaged in labor inside the home for which wages were earned, such as taking in laundry or sewing, keeping boarders, gardening and dairying, and selling the crops or milk products for cash. Although some states gave married women property rights in such earnings, most <i>Married Women’s Property Acts</i> granted the husband control over such earnings or were interpreted by courts in this fashion on the ground that these acts were not intended to alter family law doctrines requiring women to provide services inside the home. <i>Id.</i> at 1181-1188. Since most men worked outside the home and most married women worked inside the home, gender equality in access to property was a long time in coming.</p>

<p id="c5a7c6da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most recent revolution in laws affecting marital property has been the extension of marriage to couples of the same sex.

Congress immediately responded with the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), declaring that for all federal programs and laws, “the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,” and no state was required to recognize a same-sex marriage performed under the laws of any other state. 1 U.S.C. §7 (held unconstitutional by <i>United States v.

Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer began their relationship in 1963, registered as domestic partners in New York in 1993, and married in Canada in 2007. Spyer died in 2009, leaving her entire estate to Windsor. Although New York recognized the Canadian marriage as valid, because DOMA prohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriage, Windsor was ineligible for the marital estate-tax deduction, and so owed $363,053 in estate taxes.

<p id="c5a7c6e1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Marriage remains a building block of our national community. For that reason, just as a couple vows to support each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition and material benefits to protect and nourish the union. Indeed, while the States are in general free to vary the benefits they confer on all married couples, they have throughout our history made marriage the basis for an expanding <span title="700" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-700">p. 700</span>list of governmental rights, benefits, and responsibilities. These aspects of marital status include: taxation; inheritance and property rights; rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege in the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decisionmaking authority; adoption rights; the rights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates; professional ethics rules; campaign finance restrictions; workers’ compensation benefits; health insurance; and child custody, support, and visitation rules. Valid marriage under state law is also a significant status for over a thousand provisions of federal law. The States have contributed to the fundamental character of the marriage right by placing that institution at the center of so many facets of the legal and social order.</p>
<p id="c5a7c6e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects.</p>

Two basic systems govern marital property rights in the United States: the <b>separate property</b> system in the majority of states, and the <b>community property system</b> in effect in nine states.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1094C_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1094C_ceea6a79-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span></p>

<p id="c5a7edfb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>During marriage.</b> In separate property states, spouses own their property separately, except to the extent they choose to share it or mingle it with their spouse’s property. This means that each spouse owns whatever property he or she possessed before the marriage — such as a house, a car, stock, or a bank account — and is individually liable for prior debts. Creditors cannot go after a spouse’s property to satisfy a debt individually undertaken by the other spouse. Property earned after the marriage, including wages and dividends, is also owned separately. A husband and wife may of course choose to share property with each other either informally, by sharing the costs of the household or giving part of individual earnings to the spouse, <span title="701" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-701">p. 701</span>or formally, by having a joint bank account to which either spouse has access as a joint tenant.</p>
<p id="c5a7edfc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to note that spouses in separate property states are not perfectly free to keep all their property to themselves. Spouses have a legal duty to support each other, and this duty may require a sharing of property earned during the marriage. A spouse who fails to comply with this obligation may be forced to do so by a court order for maintenance, although this kind of lawsuit rarely happens outside of divorce or separation.</p>
<p id="c5a7edfd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>On divorce.</b> Most legal disputes about marital property involve divorce or the death of a spouse. All states regulate the distribution of property rights between the parties on divorce. Separate property states have statutes that provide for <b>equitable distribution</b> of property owned by each of the parties on divorce, subject to a wide range of factors such as economic need (support for necessities, including child support), status (maintaining the lifestyle shared during the marriage), rehabilitation (support sufficient to allow one spouse to attain marketable skills such that support will no longer be needed), contributions of the parties (treating the marriage as a partnership and dividing the assets jointly earned from the enterprise), and, sometimes, fault. 3 <i>Family Law and Practice</i> §37.06. Some states allow marital fault to be considered and some explicitly exclude “marital misconduct” as a factor. <i>Id.</i> §37.06[1][h]. Specific factors that may be taken into account include age, health, occupation, income, vocational skills, contribution as a homemaker, dissipation of property during the marriage, income tax consequences, debts, obligations prior to marriage and contribution of one spouse to the education of the other. This system gives the trial judge great discretion in determining how the property should be shared or shifted between the parties. Often at issue are the standards to be used in dividing property, the weight to be given different factors, and the determination of the kinds of intangible resources that constitute “property” subject to equitable distribution on divorce.</p>
<p id="c5a7edfe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Separate property states also have provision for <b>alimony</b>, or periodic payments from one spouse to support the other. Until recently, alimony was routinely awarded to wives who were thought to be dependent on their husbands for income. However, with the huge recent increase in women in the workforce, as well as the advent of no-fault divorce, alimony has become exceptional and, when awarded, is often temporary. Current policy in most states aims at financial independence for the parties.</p>
<p id="c5a7edff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>On death.</b> A spouse may dispose of her property by will. Notwithstanding her right to do so, separate property states may limit her ability to determine who gets her property on death. Many states provide for a statutory <b>forced share</b> of the decedent’s estate, effectively allowing the widow or widower to override the will and receive a stated portion (usually one-third to one-half) of the estate. There is no obligation to leave separately owned property; spouses are generally free to give away their separate property during their lifetime. But the rules in force do protect the interests of a surviving spouse to the extent of defining an indefeasible right to receive a portion of the testator’s <b>estate</b> (the property owned by the testator at the time of death). When no <span title="702" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-702">p. 702</span>will is written, a spouse’s separate property is inherited according to the state intestacy statute. While some states grant the surviving spouse the decedent’s entire property, other states divide the property between the surviving spouse and the children.</p>

<p id="c5a81512-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>During marriage.</b> In community property states, as in separate property states, property owned prior to the marriage, as well as property acquired after marriage by gift, devise, bequest, or inheritance, is separate property. The American Law Institute’s <i>Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution</i>, adopted in 2002, favors the community property approach rather than the separate property approach. <i>See id.</i> §§4.01-4.12. All other property acquired during the marriage, including earnings, is community property and is owned equally by both spouses. In some community property states, earnings on separate property remain separate property. In several states, however, earnings from separate property, including interest, rents, and profits, become community property. Most states allow spouses to change, or “transmute,” their property from separate to community property, and vice versa, by written agreement.</p>
<p id="c5a81513-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While community property is somewhat similar to joint tenancy since it is a form of common ownership, a better analogy can be drawn between community property and partnership. Since the 1960s, most states have granted spouses equal rights to manage community property; each spouse individually may deal with the community property without the consent of the other spouse. At the same time, managers of community property are fiduciaries; they have the duty to manage the property for the good of the community and to act in good faith to benefit the community. In addition, most states have statutes requiring <i>both</i> parties to agree to convey or mortgage interests in real property and in assets in a business in which both spouses participate. Community property states have widely divergent rules on whether community property can be reached by creditors of individual spouses. Some states protect such property from being reached by creditors of individual spouses unless both spouses consented to the transaction; others allow the community property to be used to satisfy debts incurred by one spouse; still others limit the portion of the community property reachable by such creditors.</p>
<p id="c5a81514-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>On divorce.</b> A few community property states allocate property on divorce relatively mechanically by giving each spouse his or her separate property and half of the community property. Cal. Fam. Code §2550. Most community property states adopt the “equitable distribution” principle now existing in separate property states. Ariz. Rev. Stat. §25-318; Tex. Fam. Code §7.001; Wash. Rev. Code §26.09.080. The main issue arising in community property states is how to characterize specific items of property as separate or community property.</p>
<p id="c5a81515-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>On death.</b> In community property states, a spouse may dispose of her separate property and one-half of the community property by will. Statutory forced share statutes do not generally exist in community property states, given the spouse’s vested ownership of one-half of the community property.</p>

<p id="c5a81518-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Spouses may attempt to vary their respective property rights during marriage or at divorce by signing a <b>premarital</b> or <b>antenuptial agreement</b>. Traditionally, such agreements were unenforceable on public policy grounds because they were thought to undermine stable marriages. <i>See</i> J. Thomas Oldham, <i>Would Enactment of the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act in All Fifty States Change U.S. Law Regarding Premarital Agreements?</i>, 46 Fam. L.Q. 367, 368 (2012). Today, however, both premarital and marital agreements are generally enforceable if voluntary and not otherwise against public policy, reflecting both respect for freedom of contract and belief that such agreements may encourage marriage and discourage bitter divorce disputes. <i>See In re Marriage of Traster</i>, 291 P.3d 494, 501 (Kan. Ct. App. 2012), <i>aff’d in part, rev’d in part</i>, 339 P.3d 778 (Kan. 2014). The <i>Uniform Premarital Agreement Act</i> (UPAA) of 1983 made it extremely difficult to challenge premarital agreements, and although adopted in about half the states, about half of those made substantial changes to provide more protection for the parties. In 2012, the Uniform Laws Commission adopted the <i>Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act</i> (UPMAA), seeking to provide a level of protection more in line with state statutes and decisions.</p>
<p id="c5a81519-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts differ in the standards applied to determine whether agreements are voluntary. Factors may include whether the agreement was demanded shortly before the wedding, the relative sophistication of the parties, and whether the challenging party had reasonable time and means to access independent counsel. <i>See Mamot v. Mamot,</i> 813 N.W.2d 440, 447, 452 (Neb. 2012) (summarizing tests and finding agreement involuntary when demanded a few days before wedding and prospective wife could not reasonably have consulted an attorney); UMPAA §9(a)-(c) (2012) (agreement unenforceable if party did not have time or means to access an attorney and did not knowingly waive right to independent counsel); Cal. Fam. Code §1612(c) (restrictions on spousal support allowed only if the party waiving rights consulted with independent counsel).</p>
<p id="c5a83c2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most jurisdictions will not enforce agreements if they are “unconscionable” at the time of the agreement, but standards vary widely. Oldham, <i>supra</i>, at 379 (factors include the relative means of the parties, whether all distribution or economic support is waived, and degree of financial disclosure between the parties). Some jurisdictions will go further and consider whether agreements are equitable or fair. <i>See Ansin v. Craven-Ansin</i>, 929 N.E.2d 955, 964 (Mass. 2010) (reviewing to determine whether the terms of the agreement are “fair and reasonable”). Many states determine unconscionability or fairness as of the date of execution of the agreement. <i>See</i> Va. Code §20-151; N.J. Stat. §37:2-38(c); UPAA §6. A significant minority of states, however, may prohibit enforcement if unconscionable at the time enforcement is sought, particularly if there has been a substantial change in the circumstances of the parties. Oldham, <i>supra</i>, at 371, 380-381; <i>see also</i> UPMAA §9(f)(b) (optional provision permitting court to refuse to enforce agreement if it “would result in substantial hardship for a party because of a material change in circumstances arising after the agreement was signed”); Conn. Gen. Stat. §46b-36g(a)(2) (prohibiting enforcement if “unconscionable when it was <span title="704" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-704">p. 704</span>executed or when enforcement is sought”); <i>Ansin</i>, 929 N.E.2d at 964 (agreement must be “fair and reasonable at the time of execution and at the time of divorce”); American Law Institute, <i>Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution</i> §9.05 (2008) (recommending against enforcement if it “would work a substantial injustice” and the couple has either had a child or there has been another substantial change in circumstances).</p>

<p id="c5a83c2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost all states have homestead laws designed to protect the interests of a surviving spouse and children in the family home from the claims of creditors of the deceased spouse. They generally allow the spouse to live in the family home as long as she lives. Some states require the property to be registered as a homestead before the protections attach, while in others probate judges have the power to set aside homestead property as exempt from creditor’s claims. Many states limit the value that can be exempted from execution to pay debts; if the property is worth more than this limit, the property (or a divisible portion of the land) may be sold to pay amounts that exceed the limitation. <i>See</i> 3 <i>Thompson on Real Property, Thomas Editions</i> §21.04). Some states go further and allow owners to devise homestead property free from the reach of creditors even if there is no surviving spouse or minor child. <i>See McKean v. Warburton</i>, 919 So. 2d 341, 343-345 (Fla. 2005).</p>

<p id="c5a83c30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Distribution of property differs by gender and age, as well as race. Women, on average, earn less than men. In 2015, the median income of men who worked full time was $51,212, while the median income of women who worked full time was only $40,742, or 80 percent of male earnings. Bernadette D. Proctor, Jessica L. Semega &amp; Melissa A. Kollar, U.S. Census Bureau, <i>Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015</i> (Sept. 2016), <i>https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.pdf</i>. The reasons for the disparities between women and men are complicated. It is clear, however, that a major factor is that women continue to undertake the bulk of the responsibility for raising children. This work not only is unpaid but also interferes with women’s ability to work full time. <i>See</i> Martha Albertson Fineman, <i>The Illusion of Equality: The Rhetoric and Reality of Divorce Reform</i> (1991); Victor Fuchs, <i>Women’s Quest for Economic Equality</i> (1988); Joan Williams, <i>Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It</i> (2000); Vicki Schultz, <i>Life’s Work</i>, 100 Colum.

<p id="c5a83c31-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Women also suffer disproportionately from divorce. Recently divorced women, for example, had far lower incomes than divorced men or married women, and were twice as likely as either group to live in poverty. Diana B.

<p id="c5a83c32-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Children are more likely to be poor than adults, and some children are very likely to be poor.

Children who live in households without an adult male are extremely likely to be poor. While only 9.8 percent of related children in families of married couples were poor in 2015, 42.6 percent of related children living in female-headed households were poor. While the median income of married couples was $81,118, the median income of female-headed households was only $37,797, and the median income of male-headed households was $55,861.

Equitable distribution is governed by statute, but the statutes contain many factors and provide judges with significant discretion. Montana’s equitable distribution statute, below, a version of the <i>Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act</i> (1973) still in effect in five states, is typical. <i>O’Brien v.

<p id="c5a88a6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this divorce action, the parties’ only asset of any consequence is the husband’s newly acquired license to practice medicine. The principal issue presented is whether that license, acquired during their marriage, is marital property subject to equitable distribution under Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5).</p>
<p id="c5a88a6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I</i></p>
<p id="c5a88a6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff and defendant married on April 3, 1971. At the time both were employed as teachers at the same private school. Defendant had a bachelor’s degree and a <span title="707" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-707">p. 707</span>temporary teaching certificate but required 18 months of postgraduate classes at an approximate cost of $3,000, excluding living expenses, to obtain permanent certification in New York. She claimed, and the trial court found, that she had relinquished the opportunity to obtain permanent certification while plaintiff pursued his education. At the time of the marriage, plaintiff had completed only three and one-half years of college but shortly afterward he returned to school at night to earn his bachelor’s degree and to complete sufficient premedical courses to enter medical school. In September 1973 the parties moved to Guadalajara, Mexico, where plaintiff became a full-time medical student. While he pursued his studies defendant held several teaching and tutorial positions and contributed her earnings to their joint expenses. The parties returned to New York in December 1976 so that plaintiff could complete the last two semesters of medical school and internship training here. After they returned, defendant resumed her former teaching position and she remained in it at the time this action was commenced. Plaintiff was licensed to practice medicine in October 1980. He commenced this action for divorce two months later. At the time of trial, he was a resident in general surgery.</p>
<p id="c5a88a70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the marriage both parties contributed to paying the living and educational expenses and they received additional help from both of their families. They disagreed on the amounts of their respective contributions but it is undisputed that in addition to performing household work and managing the family finances defendant was gainfully employed throughout the marriage, that she contributed all of her earnings to their living and educational expenses and that her financial contributions exceeded those of plaintiff. The trial court found that she had contributed 76% of the parties’ income exclusive of a $10,000 student loan obtained by defendant. Finding that plaintiff’s medical degree and license are marital property, the court received evidence of its value and ordered a distributive award to defendant.</p>
<p id="c5a88a71-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant presented expert testimony that the present value of plaintiff’s medical license was $472,000. Her expert testified that he arrived at this figure by comparing the average income of a college graduate and that of a general surgeon between 1985, when plaintiff’s residency would end, and 2012, when [plaintiff] would reach age 65. After considering Federal income taxes, an inflation rate of 10% and a real interest rate of 3% he capitalized the difference in average earnings and reduced the amount to present value. He also gave his opinion that the present value of defendant’s contribution to plaintiff’s medical education was $103,390. Plaintiff offered no expert testimony on the subject.</p>

<p id="c5a88a75-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court, after considering the life-style that plaintiff would enjoy from the enhanced earning potential his medical license would bring and defendant’s contributions and efforts toward attainment of it, made a distributive award to her of $188,800, representing 40% of the value of the license, and ordered it paid in 11 annual installments of various <span title="708" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-708">p. 708</span>amounts beginning November 1, 1982 and ending November 1, 1992. The court also directed plaintiff to maintain a life insurance policy on his life for defendant’s benefit for the unpaid balance of the award and it ordered plaintiff to pay defendant’s counsel fees of $7,000 and her expert witness fee of $1,000. It did not award defendant maintenance.</p>
<p id="c5a88a76-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5a88a77-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Equitable Distribution Law contemplates only two classes of property: marital property and separate property (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(1)(c), (d)). The former, which is subject to equitable distribution, is defined broadly as “all property acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage and before the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action, <i>regardless of the form in which title is held</i>” (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(1)(c) (emphasis added)). Plaintiff does not contend that his license is excluded from distribution because it is separate property; rather, he claims that it is not property at all but represents a personal attainment in acquiring knowledge. He rests his argument on decisions in similar cases from other jurisdictions and on his view that a license does not satisfy common-law concepts of property. Neither contention is controlling because decisions in other States rely principally on their own statutes, and the legislative history underlying them, and because the New York Legislature deliberately went beyond traditional property concepts when it formulated the Equitable Distribution Law. Instead, our statute recognizes that spouses have an equitable claim to things of value arising out of the marital relationship and classifies them as subject to distribution by focusing on the marital status of the parties at the time of acquisition. Those things acquired during marriage and subject to distribution have been classified as “marital property” although, as one commentator has observed, they hardly fall within the traditional property concepts because there is no common-law property interest remotely resembling marital property. “It is a statutory creature, is of no meaning whatsoever during the normal course of a marriage and arises full-grown, like Athena, upon the signing of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action. It is hardly surprising, and not at all relevant, that traditional common law property concepts do not fit in parsing the meaning of ‘marital property’ ” (Florescue, <i>“Market Value,” Professional Licenses and Marital Property: A Dilemma in Search of a Horn</i>, 1982 N.Y. St. Bar Assn. Fam. L. Rev. 13 (Dec.)). Having classified the “property” subject to distribution, the Legislature did not attempt to go further and define it but left it to the courts to determine what interests come within the terms of section 236(B)(1)(c).</p>
<p id="c5a88a78-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We made such a determination in <i>Majauskas v. Majauskas</i>, 463 N.E.2d 15 (N.Y. 1984), holding there that vested but unmatured pension rights are marital property subject to equitable distribution. Because pension benefits are not specifically identified as marital property in the statute, we looked to the express reference to pension rights contained in section 236(B)(5)(d)(4), which deals with equitable distribution of marital property, to other provisions of the equitable distribution statute and to the legislative intent behind its enactment to determine whether pension rights are marital property or separate property. A similar analysis is appropriate here and leads <span title="709" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-709">p. 709</span>to the conclusion that marital property encompasses a license to practice medicine to the extent that the license is acquired during marriage.</p>
<p id="c5a8b189-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 236 provides that in making an equitable distribution of marital property, “the court shall consider: . . . (6) any equitable claim to, interest in, or direct or indirect contribution made to the acquisition of such marital property by the party not having title, including joint efforts or expenditures and contributions and services as a spouse, parent, wage earner and homemaker, and <i>to the career or career potential</i> of the other party [and] (9) the impossibility or difficulty of evaluating any component asset or any interest in a business, corporation or profession” (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(d)(6), (9) (emphasis added)). Where equitable distribution of marital property is appropriate but “the distribution of an interest in a business, corporation or <i>profession</i> would be contrary to law” the court shall make a distributive award in lieu of an actual distribution of the property (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(e) (emphasis added)). The words mean exactly what they say: that an interest in a profession or professional career potential is marital property which may be represented by direct or indirect contributions of the non-title-holding spouse, including financial contributions and nonfinancial contributions made by caring for the home and family.</p>
<p id="c5a8b18a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The history which preceded enactment of the statute confirms this interpretation. Reform of section 236 was advocated because experience had proven that application of the traditional common-law title theory of property had caused inequities upon dissolution of a marriage. The Legislature replaced the existing system with equitable distribution of marital property, an entirely new theory which considered all the circumstances of the case and of the respective parties to the marriage. Equitable distribution was based on the premise that a marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership to which both parties contribute as spouse, parent, wage earner or homemaker. Consistent with this purpose, and implicit in the statutory scheme as a whole, is the view that upon dissolution of the marriage there should be a winding up of the parties’ economic affairs and a severance of their economic ties by an equitable distribution of the marital assets. Thus, the concept of alimony, which often served as a means of lifetime support and dependence for one spouse upon the other long after the marriage was over, was replaced with the concept of maintenance which seeks to allow “the recipient spouse an opportunity to achieve [economic] independence.”</p>
<p id="c5a8b18b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The determination that a professional license is marital property is also consistent with the conceptual base upon which the statute rests. As this case demonstrates, few undertakings during a marriage better qualify as the type of joint effort that the statute’s economic partnership theory is intended to address than contributions toward one spouse’s acquisition of a professional license. Working spouses are often required to contribute substantial income as wage earners, sacrifice their own educational or career goals and opportunities for child rearing, perform the bulk of household duties and responsibilities and forego the acquisition of marital assets that could have been accumulated if the professional spouse had been employed rather than occupied with the study and training necessary to acquire a professional license. In this case, nearly all of the parties’ nine-year marriage was devoted to the acquisition of plaintiff’s <span title="710" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-710">p. 710</span>medical license and defendant played a major role in that project. She worked continuously during the marriage and contributed all of her earnings to their joint effort, she sacrificed her own educational and career opportunities, and she traveled with plaintiff to Mexico for three and one-half years while he attended medical school there. The Legislature has decided, by its explicit reference in the statute to the contributions of one spouse to the other’s profession or career (see Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(d)(6),(9);(e)), that these contributions represent investments in the economic partnership of the marriage and that the product of the parties’ joint efforts, the professional license, should be considered marital property.</p>
<p id="c5a8b18c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s principal argument is that a professional license is not marital property because it does not fit within the traditional view of property as something which has an exchange value on the open market and is capable of sale, assignment or transfer. The position does not withstand analysis for at least two reasons. First, as we have observed, it ignores the fact that whether a professional license constitutes marital property is to be judged by the language of the statute which created this new species of property previously unknown at common law or under prior statutes. Thus, whether the license fits within traditional property concepts is of no consequence. Second, it is an overstatement to assert that a professional license could not be considered property even outside the context of section 236(B). A professional license is a valuable property right, reflected in the money, effort and lost opportunity for employment expended in its acquisition, and also in the enhanced earning capacity it affords its holder, which may not be revoked without due process of law. That a professional license has no market value is irrelevant. Obviously, a license may not be alienated as may other property and for that reason the working spouse’s interest in it is limited. The Legislature has recognized that limitation, however, and has provided for an award in lieu of its actual distribution (see Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(e)).</p>
<p id="c5a8b18d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff also contends that alternative remedies should be employed, such as an award of rehabilitative maintenance or reimbursement for direct financial contributions. The statute does not expressly authorize retrospective maintenance or rehabilitative awards and we have no occasion to decide in this case whether the authority to do so may ever be implied from its provisions. It is sufficient to observe that normally a working spouse should not be restricted to that relief because to do so frustrates the purposes underlying the Equitable Distribution Law. Limiting a working spouse to a maintenance award, either general or rehabilitative, not only is contrary to the economic partnership concept underlying the statute but also retains the uncertain and inequitable economic ties of dependence that the Legislature sought to extinguish by equitable distribution. Maintenance is subject to termination upon the recipient’s remarriage and a working spouse may never receive adequate consideration for his or her contribution and may even be penalized for the decision to remarry if that is the only method of compensating the contribution. As one court said so well, “[t]he function of equitable distribution is to recognize that when a marriage ends, each of the spouses, based on the totality of the contributions made to it, has a stake in and right to a share of the marital assets accumulated while it endured, not because that share is needed, but because those assets represent the capital product of what was essentially <span title="711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-711">p. 711</span>a partnership entity” (<i>Wood v. Wood</i>, 465 N.Y.S.2d 475 (Sup. Ct. 1983)). The Legislature stated its intention to eliminate such inequities by providing that a supporting spouse’s “direct or indirect contribution” be recognized, considered and rewarded (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(d)(6)).</p>
<p id="c5a8b18e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the question of valuation, it has been suggested that even if a professional license is considered marital property, the working spouse is entitled only to reimbursement of his or her direct financial contributions.</p>
<p id="c5a8b18f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By parity of reasoning, a spouse’s down payment on real estate or contribution to the purchase of securities would be limited to the money contributed, without any remuneration for any incremental value in the asset because of price appreciation. Such a result is completely at odds with the statute’s requirement that the court give full consideration to both direct and indirect contributions “made to the acquisition of such marital property by the party not having title, including joint <i>efforts</i> or expenditures and <i>contributions and services as a spouse, parent</i>, wage earner and <i>homemaker</i>” (Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(5)(d)(6) (emphasis added)). If the license is marital property, then the working spouse is entitled to an equitable portion of it, not a return of funds advanced. Its value is the enhanced earning capacity it affords the holder and although fixing the present value of that enhanced earning capacity may present problems, the problems are not insurmountable. Certainly they are no more difficult than computing tort damages for wrongful death or diminished earning capacity resulting from injury and they differ only in degree from the problems presented when valuing a professional practice for purposes of a distributive award, something the courts have not hesitated to do. The trial court retains the flexibility and discretion to structure the distributive award equitably, taking into consideration factors such as the working spouse’s need for immediate payment, the licensed spouse’s current ability to pay and the income tax consequences of prolonging the period of payment and, once it has received evidence of the present value of the license and the working spouse’s contributions toward its acquisition and considered the remaining factors mandated by the statute, it may then make an appropriate distribution of the marital property including a distributive award for the professional license if such an award is warranted. When other marital assets are of sufficient value to provide for the supporting spouse’s equitable portion of the marital property, including his or her contributions to the acquisition of the professional license, however, the court retains the discretion to distribute these other marital assets or to make a distributive award in lieu of an actual distribution of the value of the professional spouse’s license.</p>
<p id="c5a8b190-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">B<span class="epub-small-caps">ERNARD</span> S. M<span class="epub-small-caps">EYER</span>, Judge (concurring).</p>
<p id="c5a8b191-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I concur in Judge Simons’ opinion but write separately to point up for consideration by the Legislature the potential for unfairness involved in distributive awards based upon a license of a professional still in training.</p>
<p id="c5a8b192-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An equity court normally has power to “‘change its decrees where there has been a change of circumstances.’” The implication of Domestic Relations Law §236(B)(9)(b), which deals with modification of an order or decree as to maintenance or child support, is, however, that a distributive award pursuant to section 236(B)(5)(e), once <span title="712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-712">p. 712</span>made, is not subject to change. Yet a professional in training who is not finally committed to a career choice when the distributive award is made may be locked into a particular kind of practice simply because the monetary obligations imposed by the distributive award made on the basis of the trial judge’s conclusion (prophecy may be a better word) as to what the career choice will be leaves him or her no alternative.</p>
<p id="c5a8b193-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case points up the problem. A medical license is but a step toward the practice ultimately engaged in by its holder, which follows after internship, residency and, for particular specialties, board certification. Here it is undisputed that plaintiff was in a residency for general surgery at the time of the trial, but had the previous year done a residency in internal medicine. Defendant’s expert based his opinion on the difference between the average income of a general surgeon and that of a college graduate of plaintiff’s age and life expectancy, which the trial judge utilized, impliedly finding that plaintiff would engage in a surgical practice despite plaintiff’s testimony that he was dissatisfied with the general surgery program he was in and was attempting to return to the internal medicine training he had been in the previous year. The trial judge had the right, of course, to discredit that testimony, but the point is that equitable distribution was not intended to permit a judge to make a career decision for a licensed spouse still in training. Yet the degree of speculation involved in the award made is emphasized by the testimony of the expert on which it was based. Asked whether his assumptions and calculations were in any way speculative, he replied: “Yes. They’re speculative to the extent of, will Dr. O’Brien practice medicine? Will Dr. O’Brien earn more or less than the average surgeon earns? Will Dr. O’Brien live to age sixty-five? Will Dr. O’Brien have a heart attack or will he be injured in an automobile accident? Will he be disabled? I mean, there is a degree of speculation. That speculative aspect is no more to be taken into account, cannot be taken into account, and it’s a question, again, Mr. Emanuelli, not for the expert but for the courts to decide. It’s not my function nor could it be.”</p>
<p id="c5a8b194-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The equitable distribution provisions of the Domestic Relations Law were intended to provide flexibility so that equity could be done. But if the assumption as to career choice on which a distributive award payable over a number of years is based turns out not to be the fact (as, for example, should a general surgery trainee accidentally lose the use of his hand), it should be possible for the court to revise the distributive award to conform to the fact. And there will be no unfairness in so doing if either spouse can seek reconsideration, for the licensed spouse is more likely to seek reconsideration based on real, rather than imagined, cause if he or she knows that the nonlicensed spouse can seek not only reinstatement of the original award, but counsel fees in addition, should the purported circumstance on which a change is made turn out to have been feigned or to be illusory.</p>

<p id="c5a8b197-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Division of the family home.</b> When a married couple gets divorced, the courts face the task of dividing property acquired during the marriage. The marital home is ordinarily the most valuable asset of the parties. Spouses often attempt to <span title="713" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-713">p. 713</span>work out a settlement, which may be reviewed by the court for fairness and legality. Many considerations influence the outcome. On one hand, requiring the house to be sold means that neither party can continue to live there. Having to move is especially disruptive to children. On the other hand, because both parties contribute to the joint enterprise of the marriage, they have a right to equitably share in the property acquired during the marriage. If the couple has invested in a home, it may be impossible to divide the monetary value of the home between the parties without selling it; the person to whom the home is given ordinarily does not have enough assets simply to pay off the other party. Moreover, the cost of maintaining the house may be greater than the cost of moving to more modest accommodations and may tax the limited resources of the couple, whose expenses may have risen since living separately. Finally, sale of the home may be the only way to obtain a significant source of funds to pay the added expenses of splitting up the household, allowing each of the parties to attain economic independence.</p>
<p id="c5a8b198-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have reached different conclusions in response to these conflicting pressures. In <i>In re Marriage of King</i>, 700 P.2d 591 (Mont. 1985), for example, the court awarded the family home solely to the wife over her husband’s objection after finding that it would be in the best interests of the minor children to remain there, and the husband’s income as a professional gambler did not permit a regular child support award. In <i>Ramsey v. Ramsey</i>, 546 N.E.2d 1280 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989), by contrast, the court ordered the house sold over the objections of <i>both</i> the husband and wife, a couple who had been married for 20 years and who wished the wife to continue living in the marital home with the five children where the father could continue to visit the children daily. The ruling was upheld on appeal as within the trial judge’s discretion but was accompanied by a vigorous dissent.</p>
<p id="c5a8b199-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Behrens v. Behrens</i>, 532 N.Y.S.2d 893 (App. Div. 1988), the court ordered the family house sold on the grounds that neither party had sufficient resources to afford the maintenance costs of the home. The wife had objected to the sale on the grounds that it would force her and the children to leave their present community, where the family had established strong ties. A dissenting opinion argued that the imagined savings of moving were illusory since the lower rents in alternative housing would increase over time, while the mortgage payments on the current home would remain constant. Similarly, in <i>In re Marriage of Stallworth</i>, 237 Cal. Rptr. 829 (Ct. App. 1987), the court held that the adverse economic, emotional, and social impact on the minor child from being forced to move out of the family home would be minimal, even though the child was under psychiatric care and in a special education program at school. The court concluded that the adverse effect on the child was outweighed by the husband’s economic interest in the sale of the home.</p>
<p id="c5a8b19a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a variation on this theme, the court in <i>Stolow v. Stolow</i>, 540 N.Y.S.2d 484 (App. Div. 1989), ordered the sale of the family “mini-mansion” on the grounds that it was extravagant and that the wife and children could use the proceeds of the sale to buy another “fine residence.” The court ordered the sale so that the husband could obtain his share of the value of the house, despite the fact that the husband was wealthy enough to be able to afford the house payments and in the face of the “well settled <span title="714" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-714">p. 714</span>principle of matrimonial law that exclusive possession of a marital residence is generally awarded to a custodial spouse with minor children.” <i>Id</i>. at 486.</p>

Mahoney</i>, 453 A.2d 527 (N.J. 1982), the court rejected the idea that graduate degrees constitute property, on the grounds that (a) professional degrees do not resemble traditional property interests because they cannot be transferred in any way; (b) they are the cumulative product of many years of hard work and cannot be acquired by mere expenditure of money; (c) their value cannot be readily determined because “valuing a professional degree in the hands of any particular individual at the start of his or her career would involve a gamut of calculations that reduces to little more than guesswork,” including what jobs the holder will have, what specialties she will practice, the location of practice, the length of interruptions in the career; and (d) unlike alimony, awards of property are final and unmodifiable, and courts therefore have no power to correct a mistake in the valuation of the license, no matter how gross the mistake.

Goodwill as marital property.</b> Although few states hold that professional degrees and licenses are property that can be divided, most permit division of the value of business “goodwill,” the value of a business’s reputation, patronage, or other intangible assets that enable it to produce income above the value of its individual parts. 4 <i>Thompson on Real Property</i>, <i>Thomas Editions</i> §37.11(c)(1) (2015); <i>May v. May</i>, 589 S.E.2d 536, 541-542 (W. Va. 2003) (surveying approaches). Many of these seek to distinguish between “enterprise goodwill,” which can be transferred on the market separate from the individual (such as by selling an ongoing practice), and “personal goodwill,” which is associated with an individual’s reputation and skill, and divide only the former. <i>See Gaskill v. Robbins</i>, 282 S.W.3d 306 (Ky. 2009) (holding that value of oral surgery practice was largely derived from reputation and skill of wife, and so could not be divided).

A striking case of the latter comes from the divorce of former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> star Joe Piscopo, in which the court divided the value of what it called “celebrity goodwill” over objections that his value as a star was personal to him and that his future earnings were too uncertain.

However, this award will be reduced or eliminated (1) if the couple has already substantially benefited from the education (with a presumption that this has occurred after ten years of marriage), (2) if the supporting spouse was similarly supported in receiving education, or (3) if the education enables the supported spouse to obtain employment that reduces support to which the supported spouse would otherwise be entitled. <i>See</i> Cal. Fam. Code §2641. At the same time, the statute provides that contribution to education that increases a spouse’s earning potential is a factor to be considered in determining whether alimony should be awarded. In determining whether one party will be required to provide support for the other, the courts are to consider a variety of additional factors, including the extent to which the earning capacity of each party is sufficient to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage, the length of the marriage, the needs of the parties, and the ability of each to support <span title="717" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-717">p. 717</span>themselves and the other party.

<p id="c5a926ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of his general argument, the defendant claims that the court should leave the parties to an illicit relationship such as the one in this case essentially as they are found, providing no relief at all to either party.</p>
<p id="c5a92700-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have discussed previously, allowing no relief at all to one party in a so-called “illicit” relationship effectively provides total relief to the other, by leaving that party owner of all the assets acquired through the efforts of both. Yet it cannot seriously be argued that the party retaining all the assets is less “guilty” than the other. Such a result is contrary to the principles of equity. Many courts have held, and we now so hold, that unmarried cohabitants may raise claims based upon unjust enrichment following the termination of their relationships where one of the parties attempts to retain an unreasonable amount of the property acquired through the efforts of both.</p>
<p id="c5a92701-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the plaintiff alleges that she contributed both property and services to the parties’ relationship. She claims that because of these contributions the parties’ assets increased, but that she was never compensated for her contributions. She further alleges that the defendant, knowing that the plaintiff expected to share in the property accumulated, “accepted the services rendered to him by the plaintiff” and that it would be unfair under the circumstances to allow him to retain everything while she receives nothing. We conclude that the facts alleged are sufficient to state a claim for recovery based upon unjust enrichment.</p>
<p id="c5a92702-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="721" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-721">p. 721</span>As part of the plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim, she has asked that a constructive trust be imposed on the assets that the defendant acquired during their relationship. A constructive trust is an equitable device created by law to prevent unjust enrichment. To state a claim on the theory of constructive trust the complaint must state facts sufficient to show (1) unjust enrichment and (2) abuse of a confidential relationship or some other form of unconscionable conduct. The latter element can be inferred from allegations in the complaint which show, for example, a family relationship, a close personal relationship, or the parties’ mutual trust. These facts are alleged in this complaint or may be inferred. Therefore, we hold that if the plaintiff can prove the elements of unjust enrichment to the satisfaction of the circuit court, she will be entitled to demonstrate further that a constructive trust should be imposed as a remedy.</p>

<p id="c5a92704-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiff’s last alternative legal theory on which her claim rests is the doctrine of partition. The plaintiff has asserted in her complaint a claim for partition of “all real and personal property accumulated by the couple during their relationship according to the plaintiff’s interest therein and pursuant to Chapters 820 and 842, Wis. Stats.”</p>
<p id="c5a92705-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Wisconsin partition is a remedy under both the statutes and common law. Partition applies generally to all disputes over property held by more than one party.</p>
<p id="c5a92706-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the plaintiff has alleged that she and the defendant were engaged in a joint venture or partnership, that they purchased real and personal property as husband and wife, and that they intended to share all the property acquired during their relationship. In our opinion, these allegations, together with other facts alleged in the plaintiff’s complaint (<i>e.g.</i>, the plaintiff’s contributions to the acquisition of their property) and reasonable inferences therefrom, are sufficient to state a claim for an accounting of the property acquired during the parties’ relationship and partition. We do not, of course, presume to judge the merits of the plaintiff’s claim. Proof of her allegations must be made to the circuit court. We merely hold that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts in her complaint to state a claim for relief [for] statutory or common law partition.</p>

<p id="c5a94d19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Meretricious relationship, contract, and partnership.</b> States have adopted three quite different approaches to the problem of property rights between unmarried cohabitants upon dissolution of the relationship. The early approach was to deny any remedy on the ground that a relationship between unmarried cohabitants violates public policy reflected in statutes encouraging marriage and prohibiting common law marriage. <i>Hewitt v. Hewitt</i>, 394 N.E.2d 1204, 1207-1208 (Ill. 1979), is illustrative:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a94d1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are major public policy questions involved in determining whether, under what circumstances, and to what extent it is desirable to accord some type of legal status to claims arising from such relationships. Of substantially greater importance than the rights of the immediate parties is the impact of such recognition upon our society and <span title="722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-722">p. 722</span>the institution of marriage. Will the fact that legal rights closely resembling those arising from conventional marriages can be acquired by those who deliberately choose to enter into what have heretofore been commonly referred to as “illicit” or “meretricious” relationships encourage formation of such relationships and weaken marriage as the foundation of our family-based society? Does not the recognition of legally enforceable property and custody rights emanating from nonmarital cohabitation in practical effect equate with the legalization of common law marriage?</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a94d1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a few states still follow this approach, today almost all states that have considered the issue allow enforcement of some agreements between the parties to provide support in exchange for non- sexual services. As noted in the leading case of <i>Marvin v. Marvin</i>, 557 P.2d 106 (Cal. 1976), “[t]he fact that a man and woman live together without marriage, and engage in a sexual relationship, does not in itself invalidate agreements between them relating to their earnings, property, or expenses. Agreements between nonmarital partners fail only to the extent that they rest upon a consideration of meretricious sexual services.” <i>Id.</i> at 113. In these cases, a central question is how explicit the agreement needs to be and whether an agreement can be inferred from the conduct of the parties.</p>
<p id="c5a94d1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some jurisdictions require that such agreements be in writing. <i>Posik v. Layton</i>, 695 So. 2d 759 (Fla. App. 1997), for example, adopted this approach in enforcing a written agreement by Dr. Nancy Layton to support Emma Posik in the amount of $2,500 per month for the rest of her life in exchange for her agreeing to give up her career as a nurse at the hospital where they met, move to Brevard County with her, and maintain and take care of their home. Four years later, Layton sought to move another woman into the house and served a notice of eviction on Posik. Although the trial court refused to enforce the agreement, the court of appeals reversed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a94d1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certainly, even though the agreement was couched in terms of a personal services contract, it was intended to be much more. It was a nuptial agreement entered into by two parties that the state prohibits from marrying. But even though the state has prohibited same-sex marriages and same-sex adoptions, it has not prohibited this type of agreement. By prohibiting same-sex marriages, the state has merely denied homosexuals the rights granted to married partners that flow naturally from the marital relationship. But the State has not denied these individuals their right to either will their property as they see fit nor to privately commit by contract to spend their money as they choose.</p>
<p id="c5a94d1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]n agreement for support between unmarried adults is valid unless the agreement is inseparably based upon illicit consideration of sexual services. . . . Because of the potential abuse in marital-type relationships, we find that such agreements must be in writing. The Statute of Frauds (section 725.01, Florida Statutes) requires that contracts made upon consideration of marriage must be in writing. This same requirement should apply to non-marital, nuptial-like agreements.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a94d1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 761-762. In 2010, the New Jersey Legislature amended its statute of frauds to require contracts to provide support to unmarried partners to be in writing and signed by the promisor, abrogating earlier decisions. N.J. Stat. §25:1-5; <i>Maeker v. Ross</i>, 62 A.3d 310 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2013) (holding that that statute barred <span title="723" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-723">p. 723</span>enforcement of agreements made before its enactment even if agreement was broken post-enactment).</p>
<p id="c5a94d20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other courts enforce oral agreements, but require the agreement to be express rather than implied from the conduct of the parties. The New York Court of Appeals adopted this approach in <i>Morone v. Morone</i>, 413 N.E.2d 1154, 1157 (N.Y. 1980). Justice Bernard Meyer explained,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a94d21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t is not reasonable to infer an agreement to pay for the services rendered when the relationship of the parties makes it natural that the services were rendered gratuitously. As a matter of human experience personal services will frequently be rendered by two people living together because they value each other’s company or because they find it a convenient or rewarding thing to do. For courts to attempt through hindsight to sort out the intentions of the parties and affix jural significance to conduct carried out within an essentially private and generally noncontractual relationship runs too great a risk of error.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a94d22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 1157.</p>
<p id="c5a94d23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third approach provides for property distribution even though the parties were not legally married and did not enter any agreement pertaining to support or property rights. As suggested by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <i>Watts</i>, this may be based on either finding an implied agreement to pool resources from the conduct of the parties or by imposing a constructive trust to avoid unjust enrichment. These cases consider factors such as whether the parties held joint accounts or property in common, sacrificed paid employment for work in the home, worked in the other partner’s business, and contributed financially to the purchase of property in the other partner’s name. <i>See Sullivan v. Rooney</i>, 533 N.E.2d 1372 (Mass. 1989); <i>Pickens v. Pickens</i>, 490 So. 2d 872 (Miss. 1986); <i>Wallender v. Wallender</i>, 870 P.2d 232 (Or. 1994); <i>Connell v. Francisco</i>, 898 P.2d 831 (Wash. 1995); <i>In re Marriage of Lindsey</i>, 678 P.2d 328 (Wash. 1984). In <i>Pickens</i>, for example, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that the parties had created a relationship akin to a <i>partnership</i>. “Where parties such as these live together in what must at least be acknowledged to be a partnership and where, through their joint efforts, real property or personal property, or both, are accumulated, an equitable division of such property will be ordered upon the permanent breakup and separation.” 490 So. 2d at 875-876. This approach rests on the assumption that the parties relied on each other and that both contributed to their ongoing relationship. Recovery is allowed based on the nature of the relationship rather than on a real or fictitious contract between the parties. Instead of finding a contract implied in fact from the conduct of the parties evidencing their actual intent to agree, the court imposed an agreement implied in law, which is binding on the parties regardless of their assent. This approach was proposed by the American Law Institute in the <i>Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution</i> §§6.01-6.06, adopted in 2002. Some scholars have defended this approach as protective of the justified expectations of the parties to the relationship, see Nancy D. Polikoff, <i>Making Marriage Matter Less: The ALI Domestic Partner Principles Are One Step in the Right Direction</i>, 2004 U. Chi. Legal F. 353, while others have criticized it for imposing obligations on individuals who did not voluntarily assume them and who may have deliberately chosen to eschew such obligations. <i>See</i> Marsha Garrison, <i><span title="724" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-724">p. 724</span>Is Consent Necessary?

<p id="c5a97435-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Constructive trust.</b> In <i>Sullivan v. Rooney</i>, 533 N.E.2d 1372 (Mass. 1989), the court imposed a constructive trust on a house in which an unmarried couple with a long-term relationship had lived for several years. The trial court found that the parties thought of the purchase as a joint transaction, although the defendant placed title in his name alone, explaining to the plaintiff that this was necessary to get 100 percent Veterans’ Administration financing. The court found that the defendant had repeatedly promised to place the house in both of their names, but never did. The defendant paid the mortgage obligations, taxes, utilities, and insurance on the house, while the plaintiff put all her savings and earnings as a waitress into the house, paying for the food, household supplies and furniture, and doing all the housework and entertaining the defendant’s colleagues. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the trial court’s order placing a constructive trust on the home:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a97436-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge’s unchallenged findings of fact demonstrate that there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties and that the defendant violated his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff. Equitable principles impose a constructive trust on property to avoid the unjust enrichment of a party who violates his fiduciary duty and acquires that property at the expense of the person to whom he owed that duty. Here the plaintiff was less educated (a high school graduate) and less experienced (she is a waitress) than the defendant (a career army officer attending law school at the time of the purchase of the house). She relied on him over a long period in important matters. That reliance was reasonable, and the defendant knew of and accepted the plaintiff’s trust in him.</p>
<p id="c5a97437-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be unjust not to impose a constructive trust in this case. The plaintiff gave up her career as a flight attendant and undertook to maintain a home for the defendant while he advanced his career. She contributed her earnings and services to the home. The defendant’s assurances to the plaintiff that they would own the property together (although title would be taken only in his name), his later promises to transfer title to joint ownership, and the plaintiff’s reasonable reliance on those promises made by one in whom she reasonably placed special confidence call for the imposition of a constructive trust in the plaintiff’s favor on one-half the Reading property.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5a97438-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i> at 1373-1375. Five years later, in <i>Collins v. Guggenheim</i>, 631 N.E.2d 1016 (Mass. 1994), the same court considered a case in which an unmarried couple had jointly taken out loans, invested in, and labored on a rundown farm titled in the woman’s name to turn it into a profitable pick-your-own business. The court refused to impose a constructive trust on the farm in favor of the man, finding that Massachusetts had refused to accord unsolemnized relationships the incidents of marriage, and that in the absence of “fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or other misconduct,” a constructive trust would not be imposed. <i>Id.</i> at 1017. The court did not cite its decision in <i>Sullivan</i>. How would you explain the different results?</p>
<p id="c5a97439-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Property rights on death.</b> In <i>Williams v. Mason</i>, 556 So. 2d 1045 (Miss. 1990), Roosevelt Adams promised Frances Mason in 1962 that if she would live in his home, <span title="725" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-725">p. 725</span>take care of him, and “do his bidding,” he would leave her all his property on his death. Mason lived with Adams for more than 20 years. When Adams died, he left a farm but, unfortunately, not a will or, indeed, any written memorandum of his promise to Mason. Adams never divorced his wife, who lived in Chicago, and he never promised to marry Mason. The court held that the promise to devise the property was unenforceable because it was not in writing, as required by the statute of frauds. Quoting Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the court explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a9743a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“We are aware that by our construction of Pub. Sts. C. 141, §1, the statute of frauds may be made an instrument of fraud. But this is always true, whenever the law prescribes a form for an obligation. The very meaning of such a requirement is that a man relies at his peril on what purports to be such an obligation without that form.” <i>Bourke v. Callahan</i>, 35 N.E. 460 (Mass. 1893).</p>
<p id="c5a9743b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding these well settled principles, experience has taught that gross unfairness may result where one acts in good faith and lives up to an oral agreement to provide services for another under circumstances such as today’s. Our law has seen in such situations a potential for unjust enrichment, if not fraud. In recognition of these practical realities, the positive law of this state directs that a person, who provides services to another in good faith and in consequence of an oral agreement to devise property in exchange for the services, is not without enforceable rights. These rights arise not out of the agreement but the conduct of the parties. The promisee activates the rights the law affords by performing the services in good faith reliance on the promise.</p>
<p id="c5a9743c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the parties have so acted with respect one to the other, that is, when one has provided services for the other in reasonable reliance upon a promise to give consideration there for, our cases are legion that, upon the death of the promisor, the promisee may recover of and from the estate on a <i>quantum meruit</i> basis. In such cases the amount of recovery is limited to the monetary equivalent of the reasonable value of the services rendered to the decedent for which payment has not been received. Said sum becomes a charge against the assets of the estate.</p>
<p id="c5a9743d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our law recognizes an additional basis upon which — assuming proper proof — a person such as Mason may recover. Where parties live together without benefit of marriage and where, through their joint efforts, [they] accumulate real property or personal property, or both, a party having no legal title nevertheless acquires rights to an equitable share enforceable at law. <i>Pickens v.

<p id="c5a99b58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One traditional view of property is that ownership carries with it the right to control the thing that is owned; if the owner manages the resource well, she will benefit, and if she doesn’t, she will suffer accordingly. Self-interest will therefore tend to result in the efficient management of property. <i>See</i> Harold Demsetz, <i>Toward a Theory of Property Rights</i>, 57 Am. Econ. Rev. 347 (1967). This view has its limits even when someone wholly owns property as an individual, see Chapter 2, §3.2, but it is particularly challenged in the increasingly common situation where people own property in the form of a stake in an entity whose size and nature can deprive them of meaningful governance rights. Corporations are the most important example of this, dividing the ownership of shares in the corporation from operational control by managers and boards of directors. Common interest developments similarly place control in the hands of owners associations in which an individual owner may have little voice. Trusts, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and a range of other entity types likewise divide the ownership of property from control. These forms of entity ownership raise questions of efficient and just management and the public role in regulating private relationships. To understand why, consider the following reading.</p>

</div><p id="c5a99b5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for <span title="727" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-727">p. 727</span>this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a “corporate system” — as there was once a feudal system — which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.</p><p id="c5a99b5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In its new aspect the corporation is a means whereby the wealth of innumerable individuals has been concentrated into huge aggregates and whereby control over this wealth has been surrendered to a unified direction. The power attendant upon such concentration has brought forth princes of industry, whose position in the community is yet to be defined. The surrender of control over their wealth by investors has effectively broken the old property relationships and has raised the problem of defining these relationships anew. The direction of industry by persons other than those who have ventured their wealth has raised the question of the motive force back of such direction and the effective distribution of the returns from business enterprise.</p><p id="c5a99b5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[This new] organization of economic activity rests upon two developments, each of which has made possible an extension of the area under unified control. The factory system, the basis of the industrial revolution, brought an increasingly large number of workers directly under a single management. Then, the modern corporation, equally revolutionary in its effect, placed the wealth of the innumerable individuals under the same central control. By each of these changes the power of those in control was immensely enlarged and the status of those involved, work or property owner, was radically changed. The independent worker who entered the factory became a wage laborer surrendering the direction of his labor to his industrial master. The property owner who invests in a modern corporation so far surrenders his wealth to those in control of the corporation that he has exchanged the position of independent owner for one in which he may become merely recipient of the wages of the capital.</p><p id="c5a99b5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Outwardly the change is simple enough. Men are less likely to own the physical instruments of production. They are more likely to own pieces of paper, loosely known as stocks, bonds, and other securities, which have become mobile through the machinery of the public markets. Beneath this, however, lies a more fundamental shift. Physical control over the instruments of production has been surrendered in ever growing degree to centralized groups who manage property in bulk, supposedly, but by no means necessarily, for the benefit of the security holders. Power over industrial property has been cut off from the beneficial ownership of this property — or, in less technical language, from the legal right to enjoy its fruits. Control of physical assets has passed from the individual owner to those who direct the quasi-public institutions, while the owner retains an interest in their product and increase. We see, in fact, the surrender and regrouping of the incidence of ownership, which formerly bracketed full power of manual disposition with complete right to enjoy the use, the fruits, and the proceeds of physical assets. There has resulted the dissolution of the old atom of ownership into its component parts, control and beneficial ownership.</p><p id="c5a99b60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This dissolution of the atom of property destroys the very foundation on which the economic order of the past three centuries has rested. Private enterprise, which <span title="728" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-728">p. 728</span>has molded economic life since the close of the middle ages, has been rooted in the institution of private property. Under the feudal system, its predecessor, economic organization grew out of mutual obligations and privileges derived by various individuals from their relation to property which no one of them owned. Private enterprise, on the other hand, has assumed an owner of the instruments of production with complete property rights over those instruments. Whereas the organization of feudal economic life rested upon an elaborate system of binding customs, the organization under the system of private enterprise has rested upon the self-interest of the property owner — a self-interest held in check only by competition and the conditions of supply and demand. Such self-interest has long been regarded as the best guarantee of economic efficiency. It has been assumed that, if the individual is protected in the right both to use his own property as he sees fit and to receive the full fruits of its use, his desire for personal gain, for profits, can be relied upon as an effective incentive to his efficient use of any industrial property he may possess.</p><p id="c5a99b61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the quasi-public corporation, such an assumption no longer holds. As we have seen, it is no longer the individual himself who uses his wealth. Those in control of that wealth, and therefore in a position to secure industrial efficiency and produce profits, are no longer, as owners, entitled to the bulk of such profits. Those who control the destinies of the typical modern corporation own so insignificant a fraction of the company’s stock that the returns from running the corporation profitably accrue to them in only a very minor degree. The stockholders, on the other hand, to whom the profits of the corporation go, cannot be motivated by these profits to a more efficient use of the property, since they have surrendered all disposition of it to those in control of the enterprise. The explosion of the atom of property destroys the basis of the old assumption that the quest for profits will spur the owner of the individual property to its effective use. It consequently challenges the fundamental economic principle of individual initiative in industrial enterprise. It raises for reexamination the question of the motive force back of industry, and the ends for which the modern corporation can be or will be run.</p><p id="c5a9c272-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the owner was also in control of his enterprise he could operate it in his own interest and the philosophy surrounding the institution of private property has assumed that he would do so. This assumption has been carried over to present conditions and it is still expected that enterprise will be operated in the interests of the owners. But have we any justification for assuming that those in control of a modern corporation will also choose to operate it in the interests of the owners? The answer to this question will depend on the degree to which the self-interest of those in control may run parallel to the interest of ownership and, insofar as they differ, on the checks on the use of power which may be established by political, economic, or social conditions.</p><p id="c5a9c273-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recognition that industry has come to be dominated by these economic autocrats must bring with it a realization of the hollowness of the familiar statement that economic enterprise in America is a matter of individual initiative. To the dozen or so men in control, there is room for such initiative. For the tens and even hundreds of thousands of workers and of owners in a single enterprise, individual initiative no <span title="729" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-729">p. 729</span>longer exists. Their activity is group activity on a scale so large that the individual, except he be in position of control, has dropped into relative insignificance. At the same time the problems of control have become problems in economic government.</p></div>

</div><p id="c5a9c277-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A major intellectual theme in the study of the modern corporation is the “separation of ownership and control” thesis, which was first popularized by Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner C. Means, in 1932 in their famous book. [T]he Berle and Means thesis has provided the basis for many calls for more stringent legal controls on managerial behavior. This area of corporate policy is called “corporate governance,” which refers to the manner in which the relations between the parties to the corporate contract are restrained by government regulation or private ordering.</p><p id="c5a9c278-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In contrast,] agency theory suggests that unity of ownership and control is not a necessary condition of efficient performance of a firm. This perspective stresses the voluntary, contractual nature of the corporation. [T]he contractual theory of the corporation [depends on] the Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis. The hypothesis states, in most basic terms, that securities prices are efficient in that they accurately reflect all publicly available information about the security.</p><p id="c5a9c279-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic mechanism of market efficiency is that information about a firm continually alters investor expectations about future returns and hence the prices at which they will sell and buy their securities. This information reaches investors in a wide variety of ways, including voluntary and mandatory disclosures by firms, stories in the media, reports by securities analysts, and disclosure of insider trades. The efficient markets hypothesis is important because it means that corporate contracts that harm investor interests will be recognized and punished by price reductions in the market. Incorporation in a state with corporation law that facilitates managerial abuse of shareholders, for example, will result in lower share prices than would be found if the same firm were incorporated in a state with a different corporation law.</p><p id="c5a9c27a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From a legal perspective, where the concern is often with fairness rather than efficiency, the efficient capital markets hypothesis means that securities markets are fair in the sense that a corporate shareholder gets what he is paying for in both the terms of the contract and the substantive nature of the product, including the quality of management. The contractual theory of the corporation suggests that share prices will not only be fair, but also that corporate managers will have incentives to maximize share value.</p><p id="c5a9c27b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he realities of the corporate agency relationship dictate that the corporation’s managers select the contractual terms that are then offered to potential investors. In order to raise capital at the lowest possible price, managers must offer contract terms — including evidence of the existence of intra-firm incentive structures — that convince investors that agency costs will be minimized. The managers of firms select the mix of legal and market governance mechanisms that is optimal given the particular circumstances of the firm. The “nexus of contracts” specifies the extent of <span title="730" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-730">p. 730</span>reliance upon differing mechanisms. Managers substitute among the various governance mechanisms until the marginal net productivity of each mechanism is equal. The corporate governance mechanisms, when combined in the manner most appropriate for the particular circumstances of each firm, resolve most of the conflicts between shareholders and managers. Freedom of contract allows the parties to structure their relations in a manner that ameliorates most of the problems inherent in the large corporation.</p><p id="c5a9c27c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he contractual theory of the corporation offers a new perspective on the corporation and the role of corporation law. The corporation is in no sense a ward of the state; it is rather, the product of contracts among the owners and others. Once this point is fully recognized by the state legislators and legal commentators, the corporate form may finally be free of unnecessary and intrusive legal chains.</p></div>

<p id="c5a9c27f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. The increasing importance of entity ownership.</b> Berle and Means were writing during the Great Depression at a time when widespread public ownership of companies was relatively novel. Today it represents a significant fraction of property that people in the U.S. own. In 2011, the total U.S. household net worth — assets minus liabilities — was about $40.2 trillion. About 25 percent of this represented equity in people’s homes. At the same time, however, Americans held 15 percent of their net assets in stocks and mutual funds and another 31 percent in various forms of retirement accounts. This represents a fundamental shift even over the last generation. In 1984, over 40 percent of aggregate U.S. assets were in home equity, while only 7 percent of American’s wealth was held in stocks and mutual funds, and a mere 2 percent was held in retirement accounts. Alfred Gottschalck et al., <i>Household Wealth in the U.S.: 2000 to 2011</i> (Census Bureau, March 2013), <i>available at www.census.gov/people/wealth/files/Wealth%20Highlights%202011.pdf</i>. Assets in stocks and similar investments are very unevenly held, but more than half of Americans own some stock. <i>See</i> Catherine Rampell, <i>Stock Markets Rise, but Half of Americans Don’t Benefit</i>, N.Y. Times, May 8, 2013.</p>
<p id="c5a9c280-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Splitting the atom of ownership and control.</b> What does it mean to “own” a portion of a corporation? Typically, shares may be sold, used as collateral for debt, devised, and passed by intestacy. But there may be thousands or even millions of other shareholders, particularly for large, public companies. Berle and Means identified a central problem with the basic structure of entity ownership that flows from this broad diffusion of ownership, which we now call <b>agency costs</b>. Berle and Means argued that the separation of ownership from control means that corporate managers and directors (the agents) are likely to have a different agenda than shareholders (the principals).</p>
<p id="c5a9c281-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Berle and Means noted, how serious this divergence between principal and agent is “will depend on the degree to which the self-interest of those in control may run parallel to the interest of ownership.” What might lead managers to have different interests than shareholders?</p>
<p id="c5a9c282-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="731" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-731">p. 731</span>There are a number of legal mechanisms designed to manage this principal-agent problem. For example, corporate law generally recognizes that officers and directors have <b>fiduciary duties</b> to act in the best interests of shareholders. <i>See</i> Hillary A. Sale, <i>Delaware’s Good Faith</i>, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 456 (2004) (discussing duties of due care, loyalty, and good faith). While it can be difficult for shareholders to enforce these duties, given the deference that courts give to managerial decisions, see note 4, below, the obligation nonetheless serves as a norm for officers and directors.</p>
<p id="c5a9c283-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, corporations — and business entities more generally — are subject to oversight federal and state regulation, some of which polices the relationship between management and ownership. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, regulates disclosure requirements for public companies and has used this authority to try to improve shareholder governance. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Securities and Exchange Commission, Final Rule, <i>Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations</i> (Nov. 15, 2010) (codified in various parts of 17 C.F.R. pts. 200, 232, 240 and 249) (requiring public companies to include nominees of significant, long-term shareholders in the materials they provide to shareholders for voting).</p>
<p id="c5a9e994-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, much of corporate law is permissive, giving business entities latitude to structure investor governance rights. This has given rise to <b>shareholder activism</b>, particularly on the part of large institutional investors such as pension funds, with a focus on leveraging what has traditionally been passive investment into more meaningful oversight and even direct election of corporate board members. John H. Biggs, <i>Shareholder Democracy: The Roots of Activism and the Selection of Directors</i>, 39 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 493 (2008).</p>
<p id="c5a9e995-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If these mechanisms fail, what other recourse do shareholders have?</p>
<p id="c5a9e996-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Property versus contract in corporate governance.</b> As Professor Butler notes, the <b>nexus of contracts</b> theory of corporate governance came to dominate corporate law theory in the 1970s. The nexus of contracts theory conceives of the corporation as an efficient conduit through which parties make and organize vast numbers of private agreements. The implication of this view is that capital markets will discipline corporate managers, leaving little justification for further legal ordering to mediate the relationship between shareholders and managers. What might undermine the ability of shareholders to price the structure of corporate management accurately? When might it be better to regulate governance rather than rely on price mechanisms, which depend on shareholders who are dissatisfied with management being able to sell their shares?</p>
<p id="c5a9e997-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, scholars are revisiting the contract-based theory of the corporation, arguing that property-based perspectives are crucial. <i>See</i> John Armour &amp; Michael J. Whincop,<i> The Proprietary Foundations of Corporate Law</i>, 27 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 429 (2007); Henry Hansmann &amp; Reinier Kraakman, <i>The Essential Role of Organizational Law</i>, 110 Yale L.J. 387 (2000). What is at stake in the distinction? First, property rights are generally good not simply against parties and intended beneficiaries to an agreement, but against many unknown parties. For example, personal creditors of the shareholders, the directors, and the managers, may not generally reach corporate assets, and owners <span title="732" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-732">p. 732</span>and creditors of the corporation have their rights prioritized against each other despite the absence of agreements between them. Second, while contract law begins from a presumption of infinite contractual forms, property law tends to limit the forms in which property may be held (the rule against creation of new estates or <i>numerus clausus</i> principle). <i>See</i> Chapter 10, §5.1. Because property rights are good against the public generally, property forms are limited to ensure that they serve public interests and provide notice to those who may be affected by them. A property-based theory therefore places more focus on the organizational form of the corporate entity and the balance of rights between owners and third parties affected by the activities of the corporation or its agents.</p>
<p id="c5a9e998-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. The limits of owner control.</b> Owners who wish to enforce the fiduciary obligations of corporate management can file a shareholder derivative suit on behalf of the corporation against the corporation’s directors or officers. Such suits, however, face a number of procedural hurdles, and liability is judged by the extremely deferential business judgment rule. In <i>Salsitz v. Nasser</i>, 208 F.R.D. 589 (E.D. Mich. 2002), for example, a shareholder in the Ford Motor Company alleged that board members had breached their fiduciary duty of care for three major management decisions. The court rejected these claims:</p>

<p id="c5a9e999-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A basic premise of corporate governance under Delaware law is that the directors, rather than the shareholders, manage the business and affairs of the corporation.” <i>McCall v.

Shareholders, thus, are permitted to challenge the propriety of decisions made by directors under their authority, only by overcoming “the powerful presumptions of the business judgment rule.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5a9e99a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The business judgment rule] provides that “whether a judge or jury considering [a business decision] after the fact, believes a decision substantively wrong, or degrees of wrong extending through ‘stupid’ to ‘egregious’ or ‘irrational,’ provides no ground for director liability, so long as the court determines that the process employed was either rational or employed in a good faith effort to advance corporate interests.” <i>In re Caremark Internat’l Inc. Derivative Litigation</i>, 698 A.2d 959, 967 (Del. Ch. 1996).

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5a9e99c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The TFI module is a computerized ignition system that was installed by Ford in a number of vehicle models directly onto the engine block. It is alleged that the TFI has a propensity to fail and thereby shut down the engine if overheated. Engineers began to raise warnings about TFI module overheating and malfunctioning as early as 1982. In May 1982, Ford engineers compiled a list of components that could cause a “quits on road” condition — a failure that causes the vehicle to shut down while being driven. While the document questioned whether a recall was necessary, the Company took no corrective action; it also continued to tell [the National Highway Traffic Safety <span title="733" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-733">p. 733</span>Administration (NHTSA)] there was no “common pattern or cause” behind the complaints about stalling. A warranty analysis conducted in January 1984 demonstrated that the TFI — which was supposed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle — would fail at a rate of 56% at five years or 50,000 miles.</p>
<p id="c5a9e99d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ford’s Policy and Strategy Committee, which included some of the Defendants, repeatedly discussed the risks and problems inherent in the TFI mechanism. On March 12, 1985 the committee discussed problems with the TFI module and concluded in an internal document that “ ‘stall’ rates on 1985 model Tempos-Topazes were unchanged from the year earlier.” The committee claimed that stalling problem was not a safety issue. The committee would have been required to report safety issues to NHTSA. NHTSA has recently obtained information regarding the TFI and has found that Ford improperly withheld this information, because it was, in fact, safety related.</p>
<p id="c5a9e99e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A report] delivered to Ford’s president on or about November 5, 1986, indicated that the total cost of correcting the TFI problems would have cost Ford approximately only $200 million more than the expected cost for one year of warranty related repairs. Ford was also aware that about 10% of TFI modules would have stalling problems in 1986. On November 13, 1986, Ford’s President gave the Board a status report on the ongoing TFI problem. The Board at this time concluded that a recall was “not feasible” because the Company did not have sufficient replacement parts. The TFI issue was discussed at Board meetings held in December 1987, January 1989, and October 1991. In 1995, Ford finally stopped attaching the TFI module to the distributor.</p>
<p id="c5a9e99f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ford settled four lawsuits involving serious injuries and deaths arising out of the TFI defect. On August 30, 2000, Judge Ballachey, a California state judge presiding over litigation arising out of the TFI defect accused Ford of engaging in an enormous cover-up by concealing the TFI design defect from regulators and consumers. That case was settled in 2001. Settlement was reported as having the potential of costing Ford as much as $2.7 billion. Judge Ballachey also blamed Ford for a corporate culture in which executives understood that their careers would be ruined if they reported design defects. The judge stated that the testimony of a top Ford engineer’s reluctance to convey bad news about the ignition module reminded him of “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Other actions regarding the TFI module are pending in five other states.</p>

<p id="c5aa10b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1990, the Ford Explorer was introduced to replace the Bronco II, which had attracted unfavorable publicity after the vehicle was widely linked to rollovers. The reported problems with Bronco II should have alerted Ford to take extra precautions with the Explorer. Ford intentionally designed the Explorer with a high center of gravity to take advantage of the Bronco II’s rugged SUV image. A 1990 internal Ford memorandum observed that “[t]he relative high engine position of the Explorer, unchanged from the Bronco II, prevents further significant improvement in stability.”</p>
<p id="c5aa10b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least two tire manufacturers, Michelin and Firestone, competed to supply tires for the new Explorer. Michelin has at all times held a world-wide reputation for high safety standards; Firestone, on the other hand, has had a long history of quality and manufacturing problems, including tread separation problems that in 1978 resulted in a forced recall of 13 million Firestone “500” tires. As a result of the 1978 tire problems, which were linked to 41 deaths, Firestone faced more than 250 personal injury lawsuits, <span title="734" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-734">p. 734</span>a host of class action suits, and a virtual rebellion by customers. Firestone was crippled financially by the 1978 recall and only managed to limp through the 1980’s until 1988, when it was acquired by Bridgestone, a Japanese corporation. Firestone was founded by the great-grandfather of Defendant William Clay Ford, Jr., and the Ford Company has maintained a close relationship with Firestone since 1906. In 1990 Ford chose Firestone to supply the tires for its new Explorer. Ford’s Board deferred all tire safety oversight and monitoring to Firestone. Ford kept no safety records on the Firestone tires installed on Explorers.</p>
<p id="c5aa10b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part to compensate for the SUV’s high center of gravity, Ford recommended that Explorer owners under-inflate their tires to ensure a smooth ride. Ford was aware that under-inflation would result in excessive pressure on the tire belts and also contribute to heat building up in tires, both factors that could increase the occurrence of tread separation. As early as 1992, motorists in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela complained that they were experiencing blowouts while driving Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tires. In a widely reported accident on September 5, 1996, TV reporter Stephen Gauvain was thrown from his Explorer and killed when the tread suddenly separated from one of his original-issue Firestone tires. In October 1998, Ford itself noted problems of tread separation on Firestone tires mounted on the Explorer and other light truck models in Venezuela and sent examples of the failed tires to Firestone for analysis.</p>
<p id="c5aa10b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was not until August 1999, that Ford quietly began replacing Firestone tires with tread separation problems on Explorers previously sold in Saudi Arabia. Ford, however, did not publicly disclose its safety concerns with the tires, and instead concealed the true purpose behind the offer to replace tires, terming it a “customer notification enhancement action.” Ford also failed to inform NHTSA of its actions in Saudi Arabia. This failure to report was in response to, inter alia, the specific request of Firestone, which was concerned that reporting the Saudi recall would prompt costly regulatory scrutiny in the United States. More than a year before initiating any public education and/or recall procedures in the United States, Ford had come under fire for beginning a Firestone tire recall in 16 foreign countries. On August 9, 2000, Firestone announced a region by region recall of more than 6.5 million tires, the majority of which had been installed by Ford on its Explorer and other light truck models. As a result of the tire/roll-over debacle, Ford has been named in a number of class action lawsuits.</p>

<p id="c5aa10b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 2002, Ford disclosed that it was required to take a $1 billion write-off on the value of its stockpile of precious metals, primarily palladium. Ford left the job of acquiring palladium to the same purchasing-department employees who normally buy its steel and copper. These purchasing department personnel failed to coordinate with Ford’s treasury department personnel and thus did not take the sort of basic precautions a reasonably sophisticated buyer routinely would use to hedge the inherent financial risk involved in high dollar purchases in clearly recognized potentially volatile markets. Likewise the purchasing department failed to stay in reasonable contact with Ford’s engineering department, and thus was unaware of Ford’s own engineering innovations which were continuing to shrink the Company’s need for the metal at the same time that the Company was increasing its purchases. Consequently, not only does Ford now find itself holding a huge over-supply of palladium, but, because the prices of the <span title="735" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-735">p. 735</span>metal have recently fallen drastically and Ford failed to ensure its positions in the metal were properly hedged, the Company must now take the $1 billion dollar write-off.</p>

Asking whether directors should owe fiduciary duties to workers or whether workers should have a say in electing directors is, in one sense, simply asking again whether shareholders should “own” the firm.

At heart, the property-based conception attempts to answer the question of why shareholders are dominant in corporate law simply by reference to the fact that they are dominant in corporate law.</p>

Property in other common entity forms.</b> The basic corporate form has a number of variations based on state law and federal tax treatment, but it is only one of an array of common types of entity ownership. Like the menagerie of common law estates, each form carries with it certain default characteristics and some latitude for the participants to vary those defaults.

<p id="c5aa10be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Partnerships.</b> The partnership is a long-standing form of collective ownership. Partnerships may be either general partnerships or limited partnerships. Although a general partnership is a separate legal entity, it does not divide ownership from control. Today, all states except Louisiana govern partnerships either through the revised <i>Uniform Partnership Act (1997)</i> (RUPA) (adopted by about 40 states), or through the original <i>Uniform Partnership Act (1914).</i> A partnership is <span title="736" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-736">p. 736</span>formed whenever there is “association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit,” regardless of whether the parties recognize or intend that their actions form a partnership. RUPA §202(a). Although agreement is necessary, it need not be in writing. Rather, a partnership is created whenever individuals “place their money, assets, labor, or skill in commerce with the understanding that profits will be shared between them.” <i>Id. Compare Swecker v. Swecker</i>, 360 S.W.3d 422, 426 (Tenn. App. 2011) (finding that son was entitled to a share of dairy business on his father’s death as a partner with him in the business) <i>with Love v. Mail on Sunday</i>, 489 F. Supp. 2d 1100 (C.D. Cal. 2007), <i>aff’d Love v. Associate Newspapers, Inc.</i>, 611 F.3d 601 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that Brian Wilson and Mike Love of the Beach Boys did not form a legal partnership by writing songs together without any evidence that they agreed to be co-owners of a business).</p>
<p id="c5aa10bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent other agreements, each partner has an equal right to possess the partnership property for partnership purposes and to share in the profits of the partnership. Because ownership is limited to the purposes of the partnership, partners do not have an individual interest in the partnership (as opposed to its profits or distributions of the property) that may be sold to or inherited by others or reached by personal creditors of the partners. Partners in a general partnership, however, are personally liable for all obligations of the partnership. RUPA §306.</p>
<p id="c5aa10c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Limited partnerships are similar to the corporate form in dividing ownership and control and affecting rights of third parties. Limited partners contribute capital in exchange for a share of profits but do not receive rights to manage or control partnership assets. In the increasingly popular limited liability partnership, partners are not personally liable for partnership debts; a creditor or tort victim may only reach partnership assets and the asset of the partner personally responsible for the debt. RUPA §306(c).</p>

<p id="c5aa10c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Trusts.</b> Trusts, which can also divide ownership from control through the separation of legal and beneficial ownership, are used not only for estate planning but also for business purposes as well. For example, “real estate investment trusts,” or REITs, can be publicly traded trusts that have tax advantages for holding real estate if they meet requirements set by the Internal Revenue Service. Similarly, mortgage securities are often held in a trust form for investors.</p>
<p id="c5aa10c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trusts are used as well to support a wide variety of nonprofit organizations and are a common way that ownership is structured for many colleges, hospitals, churches, arts organizations, and other nonprofits. Donors set up charitable trusts to generate income for charities, specifying the use to which the funds can be put in the trust documents, and can receive tax benefits in return. <i>See</i> Chapter 10, §4.3. Some of the largest philanthropies in the world are charitable trusts, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Charitable Trust, which in 2012 had assets of more than $36 billion.

Condominiums, cooperatives, and other common interest developments.</b> This increasingly common form of homeownership also significantly divides ownership from control. Such common interest developments typically have property owners associations governed by boards of directors charged with managing and enforcing the covenants governing the development. Property owners associations are often incorporated as not-for-profit corporations. Their boards of directors are usually comprised of volunteer unit owners elected by the owners, although some may be appointed by the developer during the active marketing stage of the development. Although unit owners may find it easier to influence decisions of the board of a property owners association than shareholders of corporations do, board decisions may have a much greater impact on owners’ lives, perhaps determining, for example, what color they can paint their houses or whether they can have pets. Some jurisdictions apply the business judgment rule to property owner actions seeking relief from board decisions. <i>See</i> Chapter 8, §4.2.</p>

Public versus private role in corporate governance.</b> Berle and Means thought of the corporation as a quasi-public institution to be regulated. Many corporate theorists of 1980s and today take as an implication of the nexus-of-contracts perspective that willing parties who invest in corporate ownership should be given substantial freedom of contract.
