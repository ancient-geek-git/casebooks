In this way, adverse possession doctrine transforms trespassers into owners. The following materials address the circumstances under which this occurs and the justifications for it.</p>

<p id="c564cab5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case involves the doctrines of adverse possession and tacking. David L. Gobble and Sue Ann Gobble, appellants/defendants below, appeal from a final order of the Circuit Court of Mercer County. At the conclusion of a bench trial the circuit court granted judgment for a strip of land to Gary S. Brown and Mitzi Brown, appellees/plaintiffs below.</p>
<p id="c564cab6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I. Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>
<p id="c564cab7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs instituted this action by filing a complaint on August 25, 1994. The complaint sought to have the defendants enjoined from interfering with the plaintiffs’ intended use of a two-feet-wide tract of land that formed a boundary running between <span title="288" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-288">p. 288</span>the adjoining properties of the parties. The defendants answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging ownership to the tract of land by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="c564cab8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record reveals that the defendants purchased their property by deed dated April 24, 1985. At the time of this land purchase a fence was in place which ran along the rear boundary of defendants’ property. The two-feet-wide tract of land in question here was enclosed by the fence and visually appeared to be part of the defendants’ property. When the defendants bought their land, they were informed by their real estate agent that their property ran up to and included the fence. The call references in their deed “read” as though the two-feet-wide tract of land was part of the conveyance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10072_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10072_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> The defendants believed the two-feet-wide tract of land was part of their property, and utilized it consistent with ownership rights up until the filing of this law suit.</p>
<p id="c564cabb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs purchased their property by deed dated April 28, 1989. Shortly before making this purchase, the plaintiffs had a survey of the property done. The survey revealed that the fenced-in two-feet-wide tract of land was part of plaintiffs’ property. Although the plaintiffs were aware at the time of the purchase of their property that the two-feet-wide tract of land was, in fact, theirs, they did nothing to show ownership to the tract until around August, 1994. It was in August of 1994, that the plaintiffs decided to build a road along the two-feet-wide tract of land. To do this meant cutting down several trees that were along the tract. The defendants apparently attempted to prevent the plaintiffs from building the road by asserting that they owned the tract of land. The plaintiffs thereafter instituted the present suit. The trial of this matter was held by the circuit court, sitting as fact finder, on December 13, 1994. The trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, wherein it held that “the defendants have failed to show by clear and convincing evidence their ownership by way of adverse possession[.]”</p>
<p id="c564f1cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Discussion</i></p>
<p id="c564f1cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note at the outset that the standard of review for judging a sufficiency of evidence claim is not appellant friendly. Following a bench trial, the circuit court’s findings, based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be overturned unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the circuit judge to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. We will disturb only those factual findings that strike us wrong with the “force of a five-week-old, unrefrigerated dead fish.”</p>
<p id="c564f1ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A. Standard of Proof for Adverse Possession Claims</i></p>
<p id="c564f1cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first argument raised by the defendants is that the circuit court committed error by requiring them to prove adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence. <span title="289" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-289">p. 289</span>There is a minority view that a preponderance of the evidence is sufficient to establish adverse possession. There is little reason given for adopting this standard other than it is the usual rule in civil cases.</p>
<p id="c564f1d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, the view adopted by a majority of jurisdictions is that adverse possession must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. It is appropriate, in our opinion, that adverse possession be proved by a more stringent standard than a mere preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p id="c564f1d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the preponderance standard applies across the board in civil cases, a higher standard is needed where fairness and equity require more persuasive proof. Although the standard clear and convincing is less commonly used, it nonetheless is no stranger to West Virginia civil cases. In <i>Wheeling Dollar Sav. &amp; Trust Co. v. Singer</i>, 250 S.E.2d 369, 374 (W. Va. 1978), this Court stated that “clear and convincing” is the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the fact finder a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It should be the highest possible standard of civil proof. The interest at stake in an adverse possession claim is not the mere loss of money as is the case in the normal civil proceedings. Rather, it often involves the loss of a homestead, a family farm or other property associated with traditional family and societal values. To this extent, most courts have used the clear and convincing standard to protect these important property interests. Adopting the clear and convincing standard of proof is more than a mere academic exercise. At a minimum, it reflects the value society places on the rights and interests being asserted.</p>
<p id="c564f1d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>
<p id="c564f1d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next argument raised by the defendants is that their evidence was sufficient to establish adverse possession under the clear and convincing evidence standard. Regarding the doctrine of adverse possession, we stated in <i>Naab v. Nolan,</i> 327 S.E.2d 151, 153-54 (W. Va. 1985), the following: The doctrine of adverse possession is firmly established in our property law and accompanies W. Va. Code §55-2-1 in settling land disputes equitably and efficiently.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100B4_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100B4_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> This doctrine enables one who has been in possession of a piece of real property for more than ten years to bring an action asserting that he is now the owner of that piece of property even when title rests in another. In Syllabus Point 3 of <i>Somon v. Murphy Fabrication and Erection Co.,</i> 232 S.E.2d 524 (W. Va. 1977) this Court stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c564f1d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One who seeks to assert title to a tract of land under the doctrine of adverse possession must prove each of the following elements for the requisite statutory period: (1) That he has held the tract adversely or hostilely; (2) That the possession has been actual; (3) That it has been open and notorious (sometimes stated in the cases as visible and notorious); (4) That possession has been exclusive; (5) That possession has been continuous; (6) That possession has been under claim of title or color of title.</p>
</div>
<p id="c564f1d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="290" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-290">p. 290</span>We also held in Syllabus Point 4 of <i>Somon</i>, that: “Where one by mistake occupies land up to a line beyond his actual boundary, believing it to be the true line, such belief will not defeat his right to claim that he holds such land adversely or hostilely under the doctrine of adverse possession.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100CF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100CF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> In addition to recognizing the common law doctrine of adverse possession, we have long recognized the principle of “tacking.” In Syllabus Point 3 of <i>Jarrett v. Stevens,</i> 15 S.E. 177 (W. Va. 1892), we stated that, “[t]o tack different adverse possessions to make up the period of bar the persons holding such possessions must be connected by privity of title or claim.”</p>
<p id="c564f1d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the above principles of law in view, we now turn to the evidence presented below.</p>
<p id="c564f1d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants do not contend that they are the lawful owners of the two-feet-wide tract of boundary land as a result of call references in their deed. That is, they do not claim possession under color of title. They have alleged ownership through claim of title or right. The defendants also do not contend that they have personally possessed the two-feet-wide tract for the requisite ten-year period. Instead, they contend that they have established adverse possession by tacking on the time periods that their predecessors in title claimed the two-feet-wide tract. We have held that “tacking” permits adding together the time period that successive adverse possessors claim property, and that should this period of time added together be more than ten years, adverse possession may be allowed.</p>
<p id="c564f1da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “tacking” the defendants presented evidence that Edward and Virgie Blevins (the “Blevins”) were the original owners of the property they purchased in 1985. The Blevins owned the property as far back as 1937, and during the entire time of their ownership they believed the two-feet-wide tract was part of their land, and they exercised dominion and control over the tract consistent with ownership rights. The Blevins sold their property on October 30, 1978, to Norman and Martha Fletcher (the “Fletchers”), believing that they were also conveying the two-feet-wide tract. Mr. Fletcher testified that when they bought the property they believed that they had purchased the two-feet-wide tract, and possessed it consistent with ownership rights. The defendants testified that they bought their property from the Fletchers in 1985, and believed their land purchase included the two-feet-wide tract of boundary land, and that they possessed it consistent with ownership rights, up until the filing of this law suit. Based upon this tacking evidence, the defendants contend that they are entitled as a matter of law to add the period 1937-1985, to their <span title="291" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-291">p. 291</span>nine-and-a-half year claim to the two-feet-wide tract, which would give them far in excess of ten years adverse possession of the tract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100E6_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100E6_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span></p>
<p id="c56518ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “hostile” or “adverse” possession by tacking, the defendants called several witnesses who testified that the two-feet-wide tract was fenced off as far back as 1937, that the Blevins placed the fence along the tract, and that the Blevins claimed the tract as theirs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100EF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100EF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span> Evidence was presented to show that the Fletchers maintained the fence along the two-feet-wide tract, and that the fence remained in place throughout their ownership of the property. The defendants testified that they purchased their property from the Fletchers in 1985, and that they claimed ownership of the two-feet-wide tract, and that it remained fenced off up until the start of the instant law suit.</p>
<p id="c56518ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “actual” possession by tacking, the defendants called several witnesses who testified that the Blevins periodically repaired the fence surrounding the two-feet-wide tract, that they routinely planted a garden along the tract, and that the Blevins constructed and maintained a shed along a portion of the tract. Mr. Fletcher testified that he regularly planted a garden along the tract, that he routinely removed weeds from along the tract and fence, and that he picked blackberries from the area and walnuts from trees that had grown along the tract.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F9_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N100F9_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> The defendants testified that they planted gardens along the tract, that they built a treehouse in one of the trees that had grown along the tract, and that they regularly mowed the grass and weeds in the area.</p>
<p id="c56518f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “open and notorious” possession by tacking, the defendants called several witnesses who testified that during the period that the Blevins owned the defendants’ property, the reputation of the two-feet-wide tract in the <span title="292" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-292">p. 292</span>community was that it belonged to the Blevins.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10105_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10105_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span> Mr. Fletcher testified that the reputation in the community was that the two-feet-wide tract was part of his property. The defendants testified that the reputation in the community was that the two-feet-wide tract was part of their property.</p>
<p id="c56518f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “exclusive” possession by tacking, the defendants presented testimony by two of the original owners of plaintiffs’ property.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1010F_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1010F_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> These two witnesses testified that neither the Blevins’ nor the Fletchers’ claim to the two-feet-wide tract was ever objected to by them or those who owned the property with them. The defendants also presented evidence to show that only the Blevins and Fletchers respectively had control and dominion over the two-feet-wide tract. The defendants also testified that they had exclusive control and dominion over the two-feet-wide tract up until the time of this law suit.</p>
<p id="c56518f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “continuous” possession the defendants presented testimony that the Blevins enclosed, maintained, cultivated and claimed ownership of the two-feet-wide tract up until they sold their property to the Fletchers. Mr. Fletcher testified that he maintained, cultivated and claimed ownership of the two-feet-wide tract up until he sold the property to the defendants. The defendants testified that they maintained, cultivated and claimed ownership of the two-feet-wide tract up until the instant law suit.</p>
<p id="c56518f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish the element of “claim of title” the defendants presented evidence to show that neither the Blevins, Fletchers nor the defendants had actual title to the two-feet-wide tract, yet each claimed ownership of it pursuant to all of the above conduct, during their entire respective occupancy.</p>

Adverse possession claims generate substantial litigation.</b> Each of the elements of adverse possession has caused problems of interpretation and application. Moreover, a significant number of states either add other elements to the standard list or identify multiple ways to acquire property by adverse possession. It is therefore crucial to examine carefully the version of the doctrine that has been adopted in your jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="c565400f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The elements of a claim for adverse possession typically include (1) actual possession that is (2) open and notorious, (3) exclusive, (4) continuous, and (5) adverse or hostile (6) for the statutory period. Most states agree on this list of elements. Some states have enacted shorter statutes of limitation depending on whether the possessor has acted under (7) “color of title” or has (8) paid property taxes on the land.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5654010-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adverse possession doctrine allows a non-owner to acquire full ownership rights in real property if the non-owner “actually possesses” property without permission by the “true” owner (meaning the formal title holder) in a visible manner for the period of time established by statute. Adverse possession claims may be brought by the adverse possessor herself in a lawsuit against the record owner to <b>quiet title</b>. This kind of claim asks the court to grant a declaratory judgment that the adverse possessor has become the owner of the disputed property through adverse possession. Adverse possession claims may also arise as <i>defenses</i> to trespass or ejectment claims by record owners. In ejectment lawsuits, the record owner claims that the adverse possessor is wrongfully occupying her property and seeks a court order ejecting the adverse possessor from the property; the adverse possessor defends by asserting that he has acquired title by adverse possession and that plaintiff therefore has no right to eject him. In trespass cases, the plaintiff alleges an intentional intrusion on her property, while the adverse possessor defends by alleging that he is not trespassing because he has acquired ownership of the property by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="c5654011-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Actual possession.</b> The adverse possessor must physically occupy the property in some manner. Some states have statutes that identify which types of actions are required to establish “actual” possession. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §323; Fla. Stat. §95.16; N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. §522. In the absence of a statute, “[a]ctual occupancy means the ordinary use to which the land is capable and such as an owner would make of it.” <i>Smith v. Hayden,</i> 772 P.2d 47, 55 (Colo. 1989). This may be shown by enclosing the property by a fence and treating it as one’s own. <i>Krosmico v. Pettit,</i> 968 P.2d 345 (Okla. 1998). <i>But see Hovendick v. Ruby,</i> 10 P.3d 1119 (Wyo. 2000) (“fence of convenience” designed to contain or keep out animals gives rise to a presumption of permissive use while a boundary fence gives rise to a presumption of adverse possession); N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. §543 (stating that enclosure of land by a fence or hedge is not sufficient for adverse possession). In the absence of a fence, one must demonstrate actual <span title="294" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-294">p. 294</span>possession by engaging in significant activities on the land, such as building on the land and/or living or conducting a business there. Other actions that are often sufficient to show actual possession are farming, clearing the land, and planting shrubs. <i>Harris v. Lynch,</i> 940 S.W.2d 42 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997). The touchstone is proof the possessor treated the land as an “average owner” would. <i>Jarvis v. Gillespie,</i> 587 A.2d 981, 985 (Vt. 1991).</p>
<p id="c5654012-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An adverse possessor who has a deed that purports to transfer the land in question but is ineffective to transfer title because of a defect in the deed (such as lack of a signature) or a defect in the process by which the deed was issued (lack of notice to the owner when the property is sold for failure to pay property taxes, for example) has <b>color of title</b> to the property. In that case, occupation of any portion of the land described in the defective title is generally deemed to be actual possession of the whole lot described in the void deed. <i>See</i> §1.2, <i>infra</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10179_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10179_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span></p>
<p id="c5654014-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Open and notorious.</b> Courts generally agree that the possessory acts must be sufficiently visible and obvious to put a reasonable owner on notice that her property is being occupied by a non-owner. <i>Lawrence v. Town of Concord,</i> 788 N.E.2d 546, 551-552 (Mass. 2003); <i>Grappo v. Blanks</i>, 400 S.E.2d 168 (Va. 1991). The adverse possessor need not demonstrate that the “true owner” (the formal title holder) observed or knew about the adverse possessor’s use of the property; rather, the true owner is “charged with seeing what reasonable inspection would disclose.” William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §11.7, at 856 (3d ed. 2000). <i>Accord, Lawrence v. Town of Concord,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 552 (adverse possession available even when record owner did not know it owned the property in question).</p>
<p id="c5654015-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A great deal of litigation has been generated over which acts are sufficient to put owners on notice. Enclosing land by a fence or a wall, as in <i>Brown v. Gobble</i>, is universally recognized as sufficiently open and notorious. <i>Smith v. Tippett,</i> 569 A.2d 1186 (D.C. 1990). Other acts deemed sufficient include building a structure, <i>Smith v. Hayden, supra</i> (garage located on neighboring property); clearing the land, laying down a driveway, mowing grass, and using the strip for parking, storage, garbage removal, and picnicking, <i>Chaplin v. Sanders,</i> 676 P.2d 431 (Wash. 1984); and planting and harvesting crops, <i>Cheek v. Wainwright</i>, 269 S.E.2d 443 (Ga. 1980). <i>Cf. Rhodes v. Cahill,</i> 802 S.W.2d 643 (Tex. 1990) (holding that isolated and selective clearing of trees for timber or grazing purposes and grazing cattle and goats without enclosing the land are insufficient to show adverse possession over a ten-year period).</p>
<p id="c5656726-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Exclusive.</b> The exclusivity requirement does not mean that no one but the owner used the property for the statutory period. Owners routinely allow others to enter their property for various purposes. <b>Exclusivity</b> generally means that the use “is of a type that would be expected of a true owner of the land in question” and that <span title="295" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-295">p. 295</span>“the adverse claimant’s possession cannot be shared with the true owner.” <i>Smith v. Tippett</i>, 569 A.2d at 1190. Proving that possession was not shared with the true owner may require a showing that “the record owner has been effectively excluded,” <i>Smith v. Hayden</i>, 772 P.2d at 52, although occasional entry by the true owner may not defeat the claim. <i>Id</i>. at 53. Two adverse possessors who possess property jointly may acquire joint ownership rights as co-owners.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101C3_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101C3_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span></p>
<p id="c5656728-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Continuous (tacking doctrine).</b> The requirement that the adverse possessor’s use be continuous does not mean that she must be on the property 24 hours a day. Nor does it mean that the owner may never leave the property for extended periods of time. Depending on the type of property in question, even extended absences may not defeat the claim. In <i>Howard v. Kunto,</i> 477 P.2d 210 (Wash. Ct. App. 1970), for example, adverse possession was established over a parcel of land used seasonally as a summer cabin. The court held the continuity requirement to mean that the adverse possessor must exercise control over the property in the ways customarily pursued by owners of that type of property. “[T]he requisite possession requires such possession and dominion ‘as ordinarily marks the conduct of owners in general in holding, managing, and caring for property of like nature and condition.’ ” <i>Id</i>. at 213-214.</p>
<p id="c5656729-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if someone adversely possesses property for less than the time period required by the relevant statute and sells the property — or, more precisely, <i>purports</i> to sell it — to another owner? The general rule is that the succeeding periods of possession by different persons may be added together; this is called <b>tacking</b>. Successors can add the original adverse possessor’s holding period only if they are in <b>privity</b> with one another, meaning that the original adverse possessor purported to transfer title to the property to the successor. <i>Shelton v. Strickland,</i> 21 P.3d 1179, 1184 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001). If, however, the successor dispossessed the prior adverse possessor forcibly, the tacking doctrine does not apply.</p>
<p id="c565672a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Adverse or hostile.</b> Of all the elements of adverse possession, the adverseness requirement has given rise to the most confused and varied treatment. The courts agree that the adverseness requirement means that the use is nonpermissive. A showing that the true owner has permitted the use will defeat the claim. Beyond this basic premise, however, much disagreement ensues. It is important to distinguish the requirements for the state of mind of the true owner from the requirements for the state of mind of the adverse possessor.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c565672b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. True owner’s state of mind.</b> If someone is occupying another’s land with the owner’s permission, the occupier cannot acquire the land by adverse possession. The court’s question, therefore, is whether the true owner <i>permitted</i> the use; if so, this defeats an adverse possession claim. Although it is counterintuitive, the adverse possessor must show that her use was <i>nonpermissive</i> to obtain ownership by adverse possession. What evidence is sufficient to prove that possession is nonpermissive? This is generally not a problem if the owner has expressly granted permission (through granting a license or lease, for example) or has expressly denied <span title="296" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-296">p. 296</span>permission (by posting “No Trespassing” signs, for example). In many cases, however, the owner has said nothing either way. In such cases, the courts almost always hold that there is a <i>presumption</i> that possession of another’s property is <i>nonpermissive. Robarge v. Willett</i>, 636 N.Y.S.2d 938 (App. Div. 1996). This means that adverse possession can be established by longstanding, visible, continuous possession of another’s land. No proof need be given on the question of adverseness; lack of permission is presumed. If all the elements are met, adverse possession can be claimed unless the true owner produces evidence to show that the use was permissive.</p>
<p id="c565672c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Co-owners of property, such as two sisters who own a house jointly or two roommates who share an apartment, are each legally entitled to possess the whole property. They work out actual usage informally between or among themselves. Use of the whole property by one of two co-owners is as of right because each is acting within her legal rights if she occupies the whole property. No permission is needed to possess the whole property so no trespass has occurred if an owner possesses the whole. To acquire adverse possession against a co-owner, one must make an explicit statement of intent to take possession of the entire property by adverse possession; this is called an <b>ouster</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1020A_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1020A_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span></p>
<p id="c565672e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, possession that begins as permissive will stay that way unless the owner explicitly revokes permission or the adverse possessor announces that she is ousting the true owner and claiming the property as her own. However, if the owner allows another to possess his property for a very long time and the possessor reasonably relies on that permission to invest in the land, she may be granted possessory rights on the ground that the owner is estopped from denying continued permission.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10213_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10213_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span></p>
<p id="c5658e40-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Adverse possessor’s state of mind.</b> Four approaches exist. They include (i) an <b>objective test</b> based on possession (the rule in most states); and <b>subjective tests</b> based on (ii) a <b>claim of right</b>; (iii) <b>intentional dispossession</b>; and (iv) <b>good faith</b><i>.</i> An objective test makes the adverse possessor’s state of mind irrelevant, while a subjective test requires the adverse possessor to prove a particular attitude on her part <i>in addition</i> to showing that the true owner did not permit the possession.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5658e41-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>i. Lack of permission.</i></b> The first approach is an objective test, meaning that the adverse possessor’s state of mind is irrelevant. All that matters is that the possessor <i>lacked permission</i> from the true owner. This is the law in the overwhelming majority of states. <i>See Yourik v. Mallonee,</i> 921 A.2d 869, 878 (Md. 2007) (adverse possessor wins, even though she knew she was occupying property owned by another).</p>
<p id="c5658e42-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>ii. Claim of right.</i> </b>Some courts state that the adverse possessor must allege a “claim of right.” This looks like a subjective test because it means “a possessor’s intention to appropriate and use the land as his own to the exclusion <span title="297" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-297">p. 297</span>of all others.” <i>Grappo v. Blanks</i>, 400 S.E.2d at 171. However, in most states, this second test is actually a variant on the first. States that require a “claim of right” generally do not require proof of what the adverse possessor was thinking; all they require is that the adverse possessor act toward the land as an average owner would act. “That intention need not be expressed but may be implied by a claimant’s conduct. Actual occupation, use, and improvement of the property by the claimant, as if he were in fact the owner, is conduct that can prove a claim of right.” <i>Id</i>. This collapses the claim of right test into the “actual possession” test, automatically satisfying the claim of right if actual possession has been shown.</p>
<p id="c5658e43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states that require a showing of a claim of right demand evidence of “subjective intent to ‘possess[] the property intending to be its owner and not in subordination to the true owner.’” <i>Hoffman v. Freeman Land and Timber, LLC.</i>, 994 P.2d 106, 112 (Or. 1999). These states usually permit adverse possession where the possessor occupied the property under a mistaken belief as to the boundary line, but not if the evidence shows that the adverse possessor did not occupy the land with the intent to own it. <i>Petsch v. Widger,</i> 335 N.W.2d 254, 260 (Neb. 1983); <i>Mid-Valley Resources, Inc. v. Engelson,</i> 13 P.3d 118, 122 (Or. Ct. App. 2000). </p>
<p id="c5658e44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>iii. Intentional dispossession.</i></b> A minority of states go further and require intentional dispossession in certain cases. Under this test, the adverse possessor must know that she is occupying property owned by someone else and must intend to dispossess the true owner. A claim of adverse possession will “fail[] where an encroaching neighbor is under a mistaken belief as to boundary location and therefore lacks intention to dispossess the true owner.” <i>Brown v. Clemens</i>, 338 S.E.2d 338, 339 (S.C. 1988). The courts that adopt this test ordinarily limit it to boundary disputes. <i>Perry v. Heirs at Law &amp; Distributees of Gadsden,</i> 449 S.E.2d 250 (S.C. 1994).</p>
<p id="c5658e45-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most scholars and courts reject this test on the grounds that it rewards wrongdoers (intentional trespassers) and fails to protect innocent persons who have mistakenly occupied land belonging to another. It can seem perverse to deny protection to good faith possessors while granting repose to those who intended to invade and steal neighboring land. “To limit the doctrine of adverse possession to the latter type places a premium on intentional wrongdoing, contrary to fundamental justice and policy.” <i>Smith v. Tippett</i>, 569 A.2d at 1191. One answer may lie in the type of disputes a jurisdiction wants to rule out. Border disputes between neighbors may be more likely to be based on mistakes. And yet they generate discord. Squatting, however, often enjoys support among neighbors when squatters improve property that owners have left to decay. <i>See</i> Eduardo M. Peñalver &amp; Sonia K. Katyal, <i>Property Outlaws</i> 133-134 (2010)<i>.</i> If a community plagued by underused property wants to encourage squatting (perhaps to punish absentee owners) but avoid discord among neighbors, it might conclude that intentional adverse possession should be allowed while adverse possession by mistake should not.<i> See id</i>. at 148-152 <span title="298" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-298">p. 298</span>(defending intentional adverse possession under contexts of extreme economic inequality); <i>see also</i> Lee Anne Fennell, <i>Efficient Trespass: The Case for “Bad Faith” Adverse Possession</i>, 100 Nw.

<p id="c5658e46-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b><i>iv. Good faith.</i> </b>Some states require the exact opposite of an intent to oust the true owner: instead, they require good faith occupation to prevail. In these jurisdictions, <i>only innocent</i> possessors — those who <i>mistakenly</i> occupy property owned by someone else — can acquire ownership by adverse possession. Colo. Rev. Stat. §38-41-101(3)(b)(II); Ga. Code §§44-5-161 to -162; N.M. Stat. §37-1-22); <i>Carpenter v. Ruperto</i>, 315 N.W.2d 782, 786 (Iowa 1982) (“A claim of right by a squatter is a false claim.

<p id="c5658e47-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states provide a shorter statute of limitations if the possession was in good faith. <i>Compare</i> La. Civ. Code arts. 3473 and 3475 <i>with</i> art. 3486 (10-year period for prescription if possession was in good faith and 30-year period if possession was in bad faith). Professor Richard Helmholz has argued that even though most states reject a good faith test, they <i>in fact</i> grant adverse possession only to good faith possessors. They do this, he claims, by manipulating the other elements of the test, such as the open and notorious, exclusivity, or continuity requirements. Richard Helmholz, <i>Adverse Possession and Subjective Intent</i>, 61 Wash. U. L.Q. 331 (1983); Richard Helmholz, <i>More on Subjective Intent: A Response to Professor Cunningham</i>, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 65 (1986). Professor Roger Cunningham has rejected Helmholz’s claim, arguing instead that the courts do not in fact require good faith to prevail. Roger Cunningham, <i>Adverse Possession and Subjective Intent: A Reply to Professor Helmholz,</i> 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 1 (1986). Whoever is correct in this debate, it is clear that most courts have so far rejected the idea of adopting a good faith test as a formal element in adverse possession doctrine. <i>Chaplin v. Sanders,</i> 676 P.2d 431 (Wash. 1984).</p>

Town of Trumbull,</i> 574 A.2d 796, 800 (Conn. 1990); <i>Devins v. Borough of Bogota, 5</i>92 A.2d 199 (N.J. 1991). A federal statute allows adverse possession of federal lands in certain instances if a claimant has occupied the property for 20 years in good faith reliance on a claim or color of title and has either cultivated the land or constructed improvements. 43 U.S.C. §1068.</p>

The defective title may be void because the person who conveys it does not actually own the land it purports to convey; because the document lacks a signature, <i>Romero v.

In <i>Romero</i>, the deed purporting to convey the parcel was void because it included only the signature of Octaviano’s father, but not that of his mother. For more on community property, see Chapter 9, §3.2.</p>
</div>
<p id="c566028a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts are the following: In 1947 plaintiff Ida Garcia Romero and her deceased husband Octaviano Garcia, son of the defendants, purchased the 13 acres in dispute for $290 from Octaviano’s father, Antonio Garcia. Mrs. Antonio Garcia failed to join in the conveyance. The 13 acres were carved out of 165 acres Antonio Garcia had purchased in 1923. The plaintiff and her deceased husband entered into possession in 1947 and built a home on the land with the help of both defendants. The deed was recorded in May, 1950. Ida and Octaviano lived in their home until 1962, when he died, whereupon she moved to Colorado and subsequently remarried.</p>
<p id="c566028b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main thrust of the appellants’ argument concerns the deed. Appellants argue that (1) the void deed was inadequate for color of title and (2) the deed’s description was inadequate for adverse possession because it failed to describe a specific piece of property. The first argument is clearly erroneous. A deed is sufficient for the purpose of color of title even though it is void because it lacks the signature of a member of the community.</p>
<p id="c566028c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We move to the question of whether the deed was insufficient for adverse possession because it failed to describe adequately a parcel of land which can be ascertained on the ground. Since the deed in question was in Spanish, the court and the parties relied on the following English translation of the description:</p>

Range 7E N.M.P.M., said 13 acres are bounded as follows: East and South bounded by property of Antonio Garcia; on the North by the National Forest and on the West by property of Alfonso Marquez. The said 13 acres are in the NW corner of the ranch above described.</p>

<p id="c566299f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The description in the deed specified that the land is bounded on the north by the National Forest and on the west by Alfonso Marquez and on the south and east by the grantor.

Duggar,</i> 525 P.2d 854, 857 (N.M. 1974) we held that the deed is not void for want of proper description if, with the deed and with extrinsic evidence on the ground, a surveyor can ascertain the boundaries.</p>
<p id="c56629a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bar we had testimony from the grantor that the fence line along the entire northern boundary had been there for over fifty years, and the fence line on the western boundary of the property which he conveyed to his son had also been there for more than fifty years. We therefore see that the northwest corner was adequately established as being the intersection of these two fence lines. The surveyor testified that the plaintiff showed him generally where the land was and pointed to the house that was built by the plaintiff and the defendants. The surveyor walked down the western boundary line and found a pipe in position; he established that pipe as the southwest corner. He shot an angle parallel to the northern boundary line and found a pile of rocks which he established as the southeastern corner. He then closed the parallelogram by shooting a line to the northern boundary parallel to the western fence. This parallelogram measured 12.95 acres; the deed granted “13 acres more or less.” Thus, the land is in the shape of a parallelogram and is bounded by the National Forest on the north, by Alfonso Marquez (now lands of Mr. L.C. White) on the west, and on the south and east by the grantor. This parallelogram is also in close proximity to the river from which water could be used in accordance with the assignment of the water rights.</p>

The Northwest corner of the land conveyed is established by the intersection of a fence line extending along the entire northern boundary of said property from east to west, and the point where an existing fence line along the westerly boundary of said property intersected; the Southwest corner of said lands of the Plaintiff was marked by an iron pipe found in place by a surveyor, and the Southeast corner of said property conveyed was marked by a pile of rocks, and the Northeast corner of said tract was marked by an existing fence extending from East to West along the entire northerly boundary of said tract of land.</p>

<p id="c56650bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Legal consequences of color of title.</b> Some states lower the number of years required to obtain adverse possession when the owner has color of title. <i>Compare</i> Tex. Code §16.026 (10 years if no color of title) <i>with</i> Tex. Code §16.025 (5 years if cultivated, paid taxes, with registered deed) <i>and</i> Tex. Code §16.024 (3 years if under color of title). In a few states, adverse possession statutes treat color of title as a prerequisite for any successful adverse possession claim. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.M. Stat. §37-1-22.</p>
<p id="c56650be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all states, as noted above in §1.1, when color of title exists, courts use the land area described in the title as conclusive evidence of the property that is being adversely possessed. Actual possession of any portion of that land constitutes adverse possession of all the land described in the document providing color of title (except to the extent that some portion of the land described is actually occupied by the original title owner). In such a case of so-called constructive possession, color of title functions as fences often do to help the court determine the boundaries of the land being claimed by adverse possession.</p>
<p id="c56650bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Color of title and permission.</b> As we discussed above, color of title sometimes exists because a technical defect in the deed conveying the property renders the conveyance invalid. In those situations, the true owner intends to convey the property but fails to do so. Does this mean that the occupant takes possession with the owner’s permission and therefore fails to satisfy the requirement of adversity? After all, in a sense, she enters the property with the true owner’s (<i>i.e</i>., the failed conveyor’s) consent. </p>
<p id="c56677d0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, she takes possession of the property as someone claiming ownership on her own behalf, not as someone entering by virtue of ongoing permission granted by the owner and (therefore) as someone subordinate to the owner’s superior title. Where an adverse possessor enters the property as part of an intended (but somehow invalid) conveyance, courts typically deem the possession to be adverse to <span title="303" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-303">p. 303</span>the owner. <i>See Polanski v. Town of Eagle Point</i>, 141 N.W.2d 281 (Wis. 1966) (“Where it is admitted that the present possession is the result of a conveyance by a former owner, it is obvious that there will be no forcible entry. However, the occupation of property pursuant to a deed is presumptively and in fact an act adverse to and in derogation of the former owner’s title.”); <i>cf. Hubbard v. Curtiss</i>, 684 P.2d 842 (Alaska 1984) (“The possession of a grantee is presumptively adverse to his grantor . . . because once the grantor has purported to convey property neither he nor his grantee believe that the grantee’s possession is subordinate to the grantor’s title.”); 3 Am. Jur. 2d <i>Adverse Possession</i> §192. </p>
<p id="c56677d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another approach would be to treat situations in which the parties intended to transfer a property interest but failed for some reason as a special case of adverse possession in which adversity (understood as nonpermissiveness) is not required. The <i>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §2.16 favors this approach for prescriptive easements, discussed in §3, below. Which approach is better?</p>

Record title to a tract of land known as mineral survey 1161, which includes the disputed parcel, is held by Nome 2000.</p>
<p id="c5669eed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 24, 1987, Nome 2000 filed suit to eject Charles and Peggy Fagerstrom from the disputed parcel. The Fagerstroms counterclaimed that through their use of the parcel they had acquired title by adverse possession. </p>
<p id="c5669eee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A jury trial ensued and, at the close of the Fagerstroms’ case, Nome 2000 moved for a directed verdict on two grounds. First, it maintained that the Fagerstroms’ evidence of use of the disputed parcel did not meet the requirements of the doctrine of adverse possession. Alternatively, Nome 2000 maintained that the requirements for adverse possession were met only as to the northerly section of the parcel and, therefore, the Fagerstroms could not have acquired title to the remainder. The trial court denied the motion. After Nome 2000 presented its case, the jury found that the Fagerstroms had adversely possessed the entire parcel.</p>
<p id="c5669eef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The disputed parcel is located in a rural area known as Osborn.

At that time, he and his family used an abandoned boy scout cabin present on the parcel as a subsistence base camp during summer months. Around 1947 or 1948, they moved their summer campsite to an area south of the disputed parcel. However, Charles and his family continued to make seasonal use of the disputed parcel for subsistence and recreation.</p>
<p id="c5669ef1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1963, Charles and Peggy Fagerstrom were married and, in 1966, they brought a small quantity of building materials to the north end of the disputed parcel. They intended to build a cabin. In 1970 or 1971, the Fagerstroms used four cornerposts to stake off a twelve acre, rectangular parcel for purposes of a Native Allotment application.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10441_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10441_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span> The northeast and southeast stakes were located on or very near mineral survey 1161. The northwest and southwest stakes were located well to the west of mineral survey 1161. The overlap constitutes the disputed parcel. The southeast stake disappeared at an unknown time. Also around 1970, the Fagerstroms built a picnic area on the north end of the disputed parcel. The area included a gravel pit, beachwood blocks as chairs, firewood and a 50-gallon barrel for use as a stove.</p>
<p id="c5669ef3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About mid-July 1974, the Fagerstroms placed a camper trailer on the north end of the disputed parcel. The trailer was leveled on blocks and remained in place through late September. Thereafter, until 1978, the Fagerstroms parked their camper trailer on the north end of the disputed parcel from early June through September. The camper was equipped with food, bedding, a stove and other household items.</p>
<p id="c5669ef4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About the same time that the Fagerstroms began parking the trailer on the disputed parcel, they built an outhouse and a fish rack on the north end of the parcel. Both fixtures remained through the time of trial in their original locations. The Fagerstroms also planted some spruce trees, not indigenous to the Osborn area, in 1975-76.</p>
<p id="c566c605-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the summer of 1977, the Fagerstroms built a reindeer shelter on the north end of the disputed parcel. The shelter was about 8 x 8 feet wide, and tall enough for Charles Fagerstrom to stand in. Around the shelter, the Fagerstroms constructed a pen which was 75 feet in diameter and 5 feet high. The shelter and pen housed a reindeer for about six weeks and the pen remained in place until the summer of 1978.</p>
<p id="c566c606-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During their testimony, the Fagerstroms estimated that they were personally present on the disputed parcel from 1974 through 1978, “every other weekend or so” and “[a] couple times during the week . . . if the weather was good.” When present they used the north end of the parcel as a base camp while using the entire parcel for subsistence and recreational purposes. Their activities included gathering berries, catching and drying fish and picnicking. Their children played on the parcel. The Fagerstroms also kept the property clean, picking up litter left by others.</p>
<p id="c566c607-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While so using the disputed parcel, the Fagerstroms walked along various paths which traverse the entire parcel. The paths were present prior to the Fagerstroms’ use of the parcel and, according to Peggy Fagerstrom, were free for use by others <span title="305" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-305">p. 305</span>in connection with picking berries and fishing. On one occasion, however, Charles Fagerstrom excluded campers from the land. They were burning the Fagerstroms’ firewood.</p>

<p id="c566c60b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nome 2000 placed into evidence the deposition testimony of Dr. Steven McNabb, an expert in anthropology, who stated that the Fagerstroms’ use of the disputed parcel <span title="306" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-306">p. 306</span>was consistent with the traditional Native Alaskan system of land use. According to McNabb, unlike the non-Native system, the traditional Native system does not recognize exclusive ownership of land. Instead, customary use of land, such as the Fagerstroms’ use of the disputed parcel, establishes only a first priority claim to the land’s resources. The claim is not exclusive and is not a matter of ownership, but is more in the nature of a stewardship. That is, other members of the claimant’s social group may share in the resources of the land without obtaining permission, so long as the resources are not abused or destroyed. McNabb explained that Charles’ exclusion of the campers from the land was a response to the campers’ use of the Fagerstroms’ personal property (their firewood), not a response to an invasion of a perceived real property interest.</p>
<p id="c566c60c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, several persons from the community testified that the Fagerstroms’ use of the property from 1974 through 1977 was consistent with that of an owner of the property. For example, one Nome resident testified that since 1974 “[the Fagerstroms] cared for [the disputed parcel] as if they owned it. They made improvements on it as if they owned it. It was my belief that they did own it.”</p>
<p id="c566c60d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the summer of 1978, the Fagerstroms put a cabin on the north end of the disputed parcel. Nome 2000 admits that from the time that the cabin was so placed until the time that Nome 2000 filed this suit, the Fagerstroms adversely possessed the north end of the disputed parcel. Nome 2000 filed its complaint on July 24, 1987.</p>
<p id="c566c60e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fagerstroms’ claim of title by adverse possession is governed by Alaska Stat. §09.10.030, which provides for a ten-year limitations period for actions to recover real property.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10480_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10480_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">15</a></span> Thus, if the Fagerstroms adversely possessed the disputed parcel, or any portion thereof, for ten consecutive years, then they have acquired title to that property. Because the Fagerstroms’ use of the parcel increased over the years, and because Nome 2000 filed its complaint on July 24, 1987, the relevant period is July 24, 1977 through July 24, 1987.</p>
<p id="c566c610-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recently described the elements of adverse possession as follows: “In order to acquire title by adverse possession, the claimant must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, . . . that for the statutory period ‘his use of the land was continuous, open and notorious, exclusive and hostile to the true owner.’” <i>Smith v. Krebs,</i> 768 P.2d 124, 125 (Alaska 1989). The first three conditions — continuity, notoriety and exclusivity — describe the physical requirements of the doctrine. The fourth condition, hostility, is often imprecisely described as the “intent” requirement.</p>
<p id="c566c611-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nome 2000 argues that as a matter of law the physical requirements are not met absent “significant physical improvements” or “substantial activity” on the land. Thus, according to Nome 2000, only when the Fagerstroms placed a cabin on the disputed parcel in the summer of 1978 did their possession become adverse. For the prior year, so the argument goes, the Fagerstroms’ physical use of the property was insufficient because they did not construct “significant structure[s]” and their use was only seasonal. Nome 2000 also argues that the Fagerstroms’ use of the disputed parcel was not <span title="307" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-307">p. 307</span>exclusive because “[o]thers were free to pick the berries, use the paths and fish in the area.” We reject these arguments.</p>
<p id="c566c612-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a claimant’s physical acts upon the land are sufficiently continuous, notorious and exclusive does not necessarily depend on the existence of significant improvements, substantial activity or absolute exclusivity. Indeed, this area of law is not susceptible to fixed standards because the quality and quantity of acts required for adverse possession depend on the character of the land in question. Thus, the conditions of continuity and exclusivity require only that the land be used for the statutory period as an average owner of similar property would use it. Where, as in the present case, the land is rural, a lesser exercise of dominion and control may be reasonable.</p>
<p id="c566ed23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The character of the land in question is also relevant to the notoriety requirement. Use consistent with ownership which gives visible evidence of the claimant’s possession, such that the reasonably diligent owner “could see that a hostile flag was being flown over his property,” is sufficient. <i>Shilts v. Young</i>, 567 P.2d 769, 776 (Alaska 1977). Where physical visibility is established, community repute is also relevant evidence that the true owner was put on notice.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1049E_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1049E_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span></p>
<p id="c566ed25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we hold that the jury could reasonably conclude that the Fagerstroms established, by clear and convincing evidence, continuous, notorious and exclusive possession for ten years prior to the date Nome 2000 filed suit. We point out that we are concerned only with the first year, the summer of 1977 through the summer of 1978, as Nome 2000 admits that the requirements of adverse possession were met from the summer of 1978 through the summer of 1987.</p>
<p id="c566ed26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The disputed parcel is located in a rural area suitable as a seasonal homesite for subsistence and recreational activities. This is exactly how the Fagerstroms used it during the year in question. On the premises throughout the entire year were an outhouse, a fish rack, a large reindeer pen (which, for six weeks, housed a reindeer), a picnic area, a small quantity of building materials and some trees not indigenous to the area. During the warmer season, for about 13 weeks, the Fagerstroms also placed a camper trailer on blocks on the disputed parcel. The Fagerstroms and their children visited the property several times during the warmer season to fish, gather berries, clean the premises, and play. In total, their conduct and improvements went well beyond “mere casual and occasional trespasses” and instead “evince[d] a purpose to exercise exclusive dominion over the property.” <i>See Peters v. Juneau-Douglas Girl Scout Council,</i> 519 P.2d 826, 830 (Alaska 1974). That others were free to pick berries and fish is consistent with the conduct of a hospitable landowner, and undermines neither the continuity nor exclusivity of their possession. <i>See id</i>. at 831 (claimant “merely acting as any other hospitable landowner might” in allowing strangers to come on land to dig clams).</p>
<p id="c566ed27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to the notoriety requirement, a quick investigation of the premises, especially during the season which it was best suited for use, would have been <span title="308" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-308">p. 308</span>sufficient to place a reasonably diligent landowner on notice that someone may have been exercising dominion and control over at least the northern portion of the property. Upon such notice, further inquiry would indicate that members of the community regarded the Fagerstroms as the owners. Continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession were thus established.</p>
<p id="c566ed28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nome 2000 also argues that the Fagerstroms did not establish hostility. It claims that “the Fagerstroms were required to prove that they intended to claim the property as their own.” According to Nome 2000, this intent was lacking as the Fagerstroms thought of themselves not as owners but as stewards pursuant to the traditional system of Native Alaskan land usage. We reject this argument and hold that all of the elements of adverse possession were met.</p>
<p id="c566ed29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the Fagerstroms believed or intended has nothing to do with the question whether their possession was hostile. Hostility is instead determined by application of an objective test which simply asks whether the possessor “acted toward the land as if he owned it,” without the permission of one with legal authority to give possession. <i>Hubbard v. Curtiss,</i> 684 P.2d 842, 848 (Alaska 1984). As indicated, the Fagerstroms’ actions toward the property were consistent with ownership of it, and Nome 2000 offers no proof that the Fagerstroms so acted with anyone’s permission. That the Fagerstroms’ objective manifestations of ownership may have been accompanied by what was described as a traditional Native Alaskan mind-set is irrelevant. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with precedent and patently unfair.</p>
<p id="c566ed2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that the Fagerstroms established the elements of adverse possession, we turn to the question whether they were entitled to the entire disputed parcel. Specifically, the question presented is whether the jury could reasonably conclude that the Fagerstroms adversely possessed the southerly portion of the disputed parcel.</p>
<p id="c566ed2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Absent color of title,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104CA_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104CA_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span> only property actually possessed may be acquired by adverse possession. Here, from the summer of 1977 through the summer of 1978, the Fagerstroms’ only activity on the southerly portion of the land included use of the pre-existing trails in connection with subsistence and recreational activities, and picking up litter. They claim that these activities, together with their placement of the cornerposts, constituted actual possession of the southerly portion of the parcel. Nome 2000 argues that this activity did not constitute actual possession and, at most, entitled the Fagerstroms to an easement by prescription across the southerly portion of the disputed parcel.</p>
<p id="c567143d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nome 2000 is correct. The Fagerstroms’ use of the trails and picking up of litter, although perhaps indicative of adverse use, would not provide the reasonably diligent owner with visible evidence of another’s exercise of dominion and control. To this, the cornerposts add virtually nothing. Two of the four posts are located well to the west of the disputed parcel. Of the two that were allegedly placed on the parcel in 1970, the one located on the southerly portion of the parcel disappeared at an unknown time. The Fagerstroms maintain that because the disappearing stake was securely in place in 1970, we should infer that it remained for a “significant period.” Even if we draw this <span title="309" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-309">p. 309</span>inference, we fail to see how two posts on a rectangular parcel of property can, as the Fagerstroms put it, constitute “[t]he objective act of taking physical possession” of the parcel. The two posts simply do not serve to mark off the boundaries of the disputed parcel and, therefore, do not evince an exercise of dominion and control over the entire parcel. Thus, we conclude that the superior court erred in its denial of Nome 2000’s motion for a directed verdict as to the southerly portion. This case is remanded to the trial court, with instructions to determine the extent of the Fagerstroms’ acquisition in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="c5671444-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2007, Richard McLean, a former judge and mayor of Boulder, Colorado, and his wife, attorney Edith Stevens, won a lawsuit against their neighbors Don and Susie Kirlin in which McLean and Stevens claimed a third of the Kirlins’ land by adverse possession. The trial judge believed their evidence that they had taken over the property and occupied it for 25 years, more than the 18 years required by the statute of limitations. The case elicited a firestorm of protest because McLean and Stevens admitted that they knew they were trespassing on their neighbors’ property the whole time. <i>See</i> Heath Urie, <i>Couple Will Appeal “Adverse Possession” Ruling,</i> Daily Camera Online, Nov. 15, 2007<i>.</i> This intentional “land grab” created an enormous backlash that led to Colorado amending its statutes in 2008 to allow adverse possession only if the adverse possessor “had a good faith belief [that he or she] was the actual owner of the property and the belief was reasonable under the particular circumstances.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §38-41-101(3)(b)(II). Alaska similarly amended its law in 2003 to adopt a good faith requirement for border cases. Alaska Stat. §09.45.052 (adverse possessors can prevail in border disputes only if they have “a good faith but mistaken belief” that the property lay within the borders of their own land). And in 2008, New York amended its adverse possession statute to require the claimant to show “a reasonable basis for the belief that the property belongs to the adverse possessor.” N.Y. Real Prop.

This is because the law requires the adverse possessor to use the land as an average owner would use it, and if land in the area is not used intensively, then actual possession may be shown with fewer acts on the land. However, other courts focus on the fact that the use must be “open and notorious” and that greater acts should be required in rural areas to ensure that a reasonable owner would be on notice of the occupation of her land.

<p id="c5673b5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Robert Cooter and Thomas Ulen propose two economic justifications for adverse possession. First they argue that by quieting title and closing off stale claims, adverse possession “lowers the cost of establishing rightful ownership claims by removing the risk that ownership will be disputed on the basis of the distant past.” Robert Cooter &amp; Thomas Ulen, <i>Law and Economics</i> 155 (5th ed. 2007). Uncertainty inhibits transactions, or it raises their costs, thereby lowering their profitability. This is because people can sell only what they own; if it is unclear what people own, they will be inhibited from entering transactions because of the risk that they will not in fact be buying or selling what they are purporting to buy or sell. By defining who is the lawful owner in the case of boundary disputes, adverse possession doctrine both settles the dispute and allows further transactions to take place. <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p id="c5673b5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be true that adverse possession settled boundary disputes before a recording system was in place; with both a recording system and the ability to use scientific surveying methods to fix the boundaries of property, however, it is almost always <span title="311" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-311">p. 311</span>more efficient and economical to rely on the boundaries fixed in the record title to identify the record owner than it is to conduct a lawsuit to determine whether the complicated and confusing elements of adverse possession have been met. Even in cases of conflicting deeds — where two deeds purport to grant ownership to the same parcel or strip to different persons — it would be less expensive simply to rely on a rule that ownership vests in the person whose deed was recorded first.</p>
<p id="c5673b5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Richard Epstein provides another explanation of how adverse possession lowers the costs of determining the title holder. He argues that it “shorten[s] the period during which prospective purchasers and lenders (both noted for their squeamishness) need examine the state of the title.” Richard Epstein, <i>Past and Future: The Temporal Dimension in the Law of Property</i>, 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 667, 678 (1986). Of course, in the case of a record owner whose deed properly describes the land in question and an adverse possessor whose deed does <i>not</i> cover that land, this explanation is wanting. Rather than fixing the owner in a certain fashion, the rule tends to generate litigation. In this type of dispute, it would almost certainly be more predictable simply to fix title in the record owner. And in the case of conflicting deeds (two deeds whose land descriptions both cover the strip of property in question), it would almost certainly be less expensive simply to limit the time period (to 50 years or so) within which one must search the title records and then fix ownership in the person whose deed was recorded first.</p>
<p id="c5673b60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second explanation Cooter and Ulen advance for adverse possession is that it “prevents valuable resources from being left idle for long periods of time by specifying procedures for a productive user to take title from an unproductive user.” Cooter &amp; Ulen, <i>supra</i>, at 155. Those who do not use their property run the risk of losing that property to an adverse possessor. Cooter and Ulen do note, however, that using property is not always beneficial to society. Moreover, if the adverse possessor really values the property more than the true owner, why not require the adverse possessor to find out who the true owner is and offer to buy the property from him?</p>
<p id="c5673b61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes offered a different explanation for adverse possession in a letter to William James. Holmes explained adverse possession as based on the desire to protect the expectations of the adverse possessor who has come to “shape his roots to his surroundings, and when the roots have grown to a certain size, cannot be displaced without cutting at his life.” <i>Tioga Coal Co. v. Supermarkets General Corp</i>., 546 A.2d 1, 5 (Pa. 1988) (quoting Holmes). This explanation rests on the desire to protect the settled expectations of the adverse possessor as against the true owner, who would regard recovery of the land as an unexpected windfall — like winning the lottery.</p>
<p id="c5676272-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit adopts Holmes’s explanation but translates it into the language of wealth and utility. Posner argues:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5676273-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Over time, a person becomes attached to property that he regards as his own (is this a purely psychological phenomenon or can it be explained in economic terms?), and the deprivation of the property would be wrenching. Over the same period of time, as <span title="312" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-312">p. 312</span>Holmes pointed out, a person loses attachment to property that he regards as no longer his own, and the restoration of the property would give him therefore only moderate pleasure. This is a point about diminishing marginal utility of income. The adverse possessor would experience the deprivation of the property as a diminution in his wealth; the original owner would experience the restoration of the property as an increase in <i>his</i> wealth. If they have the same wealth, their combined utility will be greater if the adverse possessor is allowed to keep the property.</p>

<p id="c5676274-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Richard Posner, <i>Economic Analysis of Law</i> §3.12, at 97-98 (8th ed. 2011).</p>
<p id="c5676275-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stewart Sterk has similarly presented an economic defense of adverse possession. Like Posner and Cooter and Ulen, Sterk asserts that the adverse possessor is likely to value the property more than the true owner. Stewart Sterk, <i>Neighbors in American Land Law</i>, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 55 (1987). He explains that the true owner has “demonstrated virtually no concern with the possessor’s occupation.” <i>Id</i>. at 80. Because the encroaching adverse possessor has shown by her actions that she values the strip more, it is therefore wealth-maximizing to transfer ownership to her. If this is so, why not rely on private bargaining to do this? If the adverse possessor really values the strip more than the true owner, why shouldn’t she <i>have</i> to offer the true owner enough money to induce the true owner to sell? After all, requiring a transaction will <i>test</i> the proposition that the adverse possessor is the most valued user.</p>
<p id="c5676276-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sterk answers that the costs of strategic bargaining may discourage such a wealth-maximizing transaction. In a two-person bargaining situation, each party must guess what the other party’s bottom line is — how much time she has to bargain and what price she is willing to pay or accept — and what bargaining strategy the other side will adopt. “If the costs of transmitting offers and counteroffers are high, the bargainer may find that his best strategy is to eschew bargaining altogether.” <i>Id</i>. at 72. If the adverse possessor usually values the strip more, and the costs of bargaining prohibit a transfer from the true owner to the adverse possessor, then adverse possession doctrine promotes efficiency by vesting ownership in the adverse possessor. Does this mean, however, that the transfer should not require compensation from the adverse possessor to the record owner?</p>
<p id="c5676277-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Sterk and others have noted, moreover, it is not a foregone conclusion that the adverse possessor places a higher value on the property than the true owner, at least if value is measured in terms of willingness to pay in a market transaction. “[T]he adverse possessor’s offer price is likely to be lower, and may be much lower, than her asking price. The adverse possessor may not be able to come up with $10,000 in cash, or be willing to borrow $10,000 to buy the strip, but may be very willing to keep the strip rather than sell it to the true owner for the same price.” Jack Beermann &amp; Joseph William Singer, <i>Baseline Questions in Legal Reasoning: The Example of Property in Jobs</i>, 23 Ga. L. Rev. 911, 964-965 (1989).</p>
<p id="c5676278-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the inability of the cash- or credit-poor to come up with money to make a market offer may make “willingness to pay” a poor metric for measuring the degree to which an adverse possessor values the property. As Eduardo Peñalver and Sonia Katyal have argued, “[p]eople who have nothing (or very little) will have limited means to express in market offers the value they place on an item of property. . . . <span title="313" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-313">p. 313</span>The adverse possessor’s long-term use (and improvement) of the property, combined with the risk of civil and criminal sanctions, will in many cases constitute strong prima facie evidence that the lawbreaker places high value on the property.” <i>See</i> Eduardo M. Peñalver &amp; Sonia K. Katyal, <i>Property Outlaws</i> 128-129 (2010). Lee Fennell concurs that “[t]he law’s harsh treatment of knowing trespassers before the statutory period has run amounts to a built-in test of the relative subjective values that the trespasser and the record owner place on the land.” Lee Anne Fennell, <i>Efficient Trespass: The Case for “Bad Faith” Adverse Possession</i>, 100 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1037, 1043 (2006).</p>
<p id="c5676279-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a consequence of the operation of distortions on some adverse possessors’ ability to express their valuation of the land in terms of offers to pay, determining who values the land more may differ according to which side is required to buy the land from the other. “Because of the difference between offer and asking prices, the result may differ depending on which party is declared the owner of the disputed strip.” Beerman &amp; Singer, <i>supra</i>, at 964-965. Under these circumstances, efficiency analysis based on “willingness to pay” becomes far less determinate.</p>
<p id="c567627a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Margaret Jane Radin adopts Holmes’s explanation for adverse possession but uses the language of justice and fairness rather than economics. Her approach centers on the significant distinction between personal and fungible property: an object is “fungible” if “it is perfectly replaceable with money”; it is “personal” if it “has become bound up with the personhood of the holder and is no longer commensurate with money.” Radin argues that the adverse possessor’s interest is “initially fungible” but “becomes more and more personal as time passes.” Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Time, Possession, and Alienation,</i> 64 Wash. U. L.Q. 739, 748 n.26 (1986). “At the same time, the titleholder’s interest fades from personal to fungible and finally to nothingness. At what point is the titleholder detached enough and the adverse possessor attached enough to make the switch? This [requires] a moral judgment.” <i>Id</i>. at 748-749. One problem with this explanation, as Radin concedes, is that the personality theory does not always apply to corporations. <i>Id</i>. at 749.</p>
<p id="c567898b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another moral basis for adverse possession lies in “the reliance interests that the possessor may have developed through longstanding possession of the property.” Thomas Merrill, <i>Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Adverse Possession,</i> 79 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1122, 1131 (1984-1985). Thus, adverse possession may be justified by the moral principle of protecting reliance on relationships. The adverse possessor and the true owner develop a kind of relationship based on the true owner’s acquiescence in having her property occupied by the adverse possessor. “The possessor comes to expect and may have come to rely on the fact that the true owner will not interfere with the possessor’s use of the property . . . and the true owner has fed those expectations by her actions (or her failure to act).” Joseph William Singer, <i>The Reliance Interest in Property</i>, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 611, 666-667 (1988). The true owner has failed to interfere with the adverse possessor’s use, thereby generating expectations of continued access on the part of the adverse possessor. For that reason, “[i]t is morally wrong for the true owner to allow a relationship of dependence to be established and then to cut off the dependent party.” <i>Id</i>. at 667. Does this argument adequately account for the law’s distinction <span title="314" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-314">p. 314</span>between permissive use (which cannot generate a claim for adverse possession) and nonpermissive use (which can)?</p>
<p id="c567898c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there any way to justify the extension of adverse possession doctrine to the knowing trespasser — the land pirate who intentionally trespasses and occupies neighboring land, knowing that the neighbor is ignorant of the actual border? It seems perverse to reward such a person. Under this view, the law of adverse possession should always include a good faith standard, either as an element of the claim that must be proved by the adverse possessor or as a defense allowing the true owner to defeat a claim of adverse possession if the true owner can show the presence of bad faith.</p>
<p id="c567898d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several arguments might justify granting protection to the land pirate. First, one purpose of the adverse possession doctrine is to create security by encouraging owners to rely on existing practical arrangements that have persisted for a long time. Resting title on something as difficult to prove as good faith (how can we easily determine someone’s state of mind?) will make property rights too unpredictable and generate even more litigation, making ownership less stable, less certain, and less predictable than it now is.</p>
<p id="c567898e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, we might interpret the failure of the true owner to object to the presence of a squatter as tantamount to abandonment of the owner’s rights. Finders generally become owners of abandoned goods. Adverse possession requires occupation to be open and notorious. An owner’s failure to object to such an occupation may indicate a lack of concern about the encroachment. Strictly speaking, American law does not allow landowners to abandon ownership of their property, but for an owner who places no value on her rights  —   as evidenced by her failure to assert them within the lengthy adverse possession period  —   it might not be accurate to call the intentional trespasser a pirate or thief. After all, we do not think of finders of abandoned property in these terms.</p>
<p id="c567898f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, even if we view the land pirate as an immoral thief, one policy behind the statute of limitations is to give victims incentives to bring lawsuits within a reasonable time; when this is done, everyone has repose, knowing that she is not subject to lawsuits for actions undertaken long ago. The interest in repose is a strong one. Moreover, it is wrong for the victim to wait too long to vindicate her rights. One can argue about the amount of time that is appropriate, but at some point the failure to assert one’s rights may become more blameworthy than the original wrong.</p>
<p id="c5678990-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, in situations of intentional adverse possession, the title owner may not be a hapless neighbor but a land speculator who is merely warehousing the property in the hope of being able to sell it and reap a profit should land prices rise. In the meantime, the property sits unused and decaying. During the recent foreclosure crisis, banks became the owners of large numbers of properties in hard-hit communities. Instead of quickly renting or selling these properties, some banks held them vacant for protracted periods of time. These vacant properties became unsightly magnets for crime. Under these circumstances, neighbors may judge a squatter who moves in and improves the property to be a sympathetic character who helps to remove the blight of empty housing from the community. <i>See</i> Peñalver &amp; Katyal, <i>supra</i>, at 133-134; Ben Austen, <i>The Death and Life of Chicago</i>, N.Y. Times Magazine, May 29, 2013 (describing <span title="315" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-315">p. 315</span>a movement of squatters in Chicago who, typically with the support of neighbors, occupy housing that has been foreclosed and held vacant by banks).</p>
<p id="c5678991-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because adverse possession doctrine employs relatively flexible standards, it allows substantial room for manipulation by decision makers and, in certain cases, significant uncertainty for property owners. To avoid such uncertainty, more rigid rules could be adopted to settle boundary and other possessory disputes. Yet adverse possession is one of the oldest rules of property law, and some version of it already exists in every jurisdiction. Most scholars continue to think that it both promotes justice and fulfills important social and individual needs.</p>

They can be either <b>affirmative</b> (the right to engage in a particular use on another’s land) or <b>negative</b> (the right to limit or block a particular use of another’s land).

<p id="c567b0ad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff brought an action claiming a prescriptive easement over a portion of defendant’s land. The trial court rejected the claim and, instead, entered judgment for defendant on its counterclaim for ejectment, from which plaintiff appeals. We reverse.</p>
<p id="c567b0ae-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff operates a small wholesale and retail animal feed business in Westminster Station, Vermont. Defendant is a neighboring business which owns the land adjacent to that upon which plaintiff’s buildings stand. At issue is a parcel of land to the north of plaintiff’s principal building (the “mill”), which testimony showed to be a rectangular area measuring approximately 60 x 90 feet, covered with gravel but not otherwise improved. Plaintiff owns that part of the gravel area extending approximately twenty-eight feet to the north of the mill; the remainder belongs to defendant.</p>
<p id="c567b0af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mill has loading areas on both the north and south sides: the north loading dock is used mostly by trucks delivering bag feed and by customers coming to pick <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>up feed, while the southern area is where plaintiff receives shipments of feed in bulk. Testimony showed that vehicles using either loading area would use the gravel lot for turning and backing. Evidence tended to show that the suppliers’ trucks as well as the customers’ smaller vehicles used the gravel lot for this purpose.</p>
<p id="c567b0b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although defendant bought its land in 1956, it was not until a new survey was made in 1984 that it was conclusively established that the bulk of the gravel area used by plaintiff’s vehicles actually belonged to defendant. Defendant then erected a barrier at approximately the location of the survey line to prevent cars and trucks from using its portion of the gravel area, precipitating plaintiff’s lawsuit for declaration of a prescriptive easement.</p>
<p id="c567b0b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court, after making findings of fact, concluded that plaintiff’s claim of a prescriptive easement failed for two reasons: first, plaintiff failed to prove with sufficient particularity the width and length of the easement; and second, any use of the area in question by plaintiff or its customers was made with the permission of the fee owner. Plaintiff claims that the court erred in these conclusions and in the findings of fact supporting them, and that the record as a whole supports the conclusion that a prescriptive easement exists.</p>
<p id="c567b0b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Findings of fact will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and the findings will be upheld if supported by reasonable or credible evidence, even if contrary evidence exists. Despite this strict standard, a thorough review of the record leads us to the conclusion that plaintiff is correct in its claims that the court erred in making two findings of fact.</p>
<p id="c567b0b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Finding 18, the court held that although “all types of vehicles have turned and backed up to plaintiff’s building for loading and unloading since the early 1920s,” plaintiff had “failed to prove by the requisite measure of proof as to what portion, if any, of defendant’s land” was used by plaintiff’s vehicles. This finding, which entails both an issue of law (the measure of proof necessary to establish an easement) and an issue of fact, served as the basis for the court’s first conclusion of law denying the claim for a prescriptive easement.</p>
<p id="c567b0b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement and adverse possession are essentially the same under Vermont law: an adverse use or possession which is open, notorious, hostile and continuous for a period of fifteen years, and acquiescence in the use or possession by the person against whom the claim is asserted. The difference lies in the interest claimed. The term “prescription” applies to the acquisition of nonfee interests, while “adverse possession” indicates that the interest claimed is in fee.</p>
<p id="c567b0b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adverse possession may be asserted either under claim of title (where claimant took possession under a deed which is for some reason defective), or under a claim of right which arises from the open, notorious and hostile possession of the land at issue.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10675_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10675_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">18</a></span> Where there is color of title, it is relatively simple to ascertain the extent of the <span title="317" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-317">p. 317</span>possession claimed, since “actual and exclusive occupation of any part of the deeded premises carr[ies] with it constructive possession of the whole. . . .” In the absence of color of title, however, and where a lot has no definite boundary marks, adverse possession can only extend as far as claimant has actually occupied and possessed the land in dispute.</p>

<p id="c567d7cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In California, case law requires claimants to show prescriptive easements by “a definite and certain line of travel” for the statutory period. <i>Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc</i>., 676 P.2d 584, 587 (Cal. 1984). Despite the apparently restrictive nature of that standard, however, the <i>Warsaw</i> court, on facts almost identical to ours, found that an easement existed for the purpose of trucks turning around and positioning themselves at loading docks attached to plaintiff’s building, stating that “[s]light deviations from the accustomed route will not defeat an easement, [only] substantial changes which break the continuity of the course of travel. . . .” <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p id="c567d7cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the case law cited above, it is clear that when a prescriptive easement is claimed, the extent of the user must be proved not with absolute precision, but only as to the general outlines consistent with the pattern of use throughout the prescriptive period. We hold that where a claimant adduces enough evidence to prove those general outlines with reasonable certainty, it has met its burden on that issue.</p>
<p id="c567d7ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, the trial court had before it extensive evidence as to the nature and scope of the user claimed.

<p id="c567d7d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The elements for establishing a prescriptive easement are the same as those for adverse possession except that the claimant must show adverse “use” rather than adverse “possession.” Most courts drop the exclusivity requirement, although some retain it. <i>See Hoffman v. United Iron &amp; Metal Co</i>., 671 A.2d 55, 64 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1996); <i>Rogers v. Marlin,</i> 754 So. 2d 1267, 1272 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999). A few states add the requirement that the true owner “acquiesce” in the adverse use.</p>
</div>
<p id="c567d7d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he elements necessary to prove a prescriptive easement [are] open, notorious, hostile and continuous use over a fifteen-year period in which the fee owner has acquiesced. In its findings, the trial court found as fact that the area in dispute had been used by vehicles of all descriptions in a manner consistent with the claimed use since the 1920s. The record showed that this use continued uninterrupted, and in a manner substantially unchanged since then but for the modernization of the vehicles using the area, until the barrier was erected in 1984. On the facts as found by the court, this comprises “open, notorious and continuous” use of defendant’s property.</p>
<p id="c567fee5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The general rule is that open and notorious use will be presumed to be adverse. The trial court noted in its order (without further comment), and the defendant argues, that not this presumption but the presumption that public use of private property is by permission should apply. This case does not, however, involve . . . generalized public use.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106E8_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N106E8_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span></p>
<p id="c567fee7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to prove the final element of its claim, the passing of the fifteen-year period set forth at Vt. Stat. tit. 12, §501, plaintiff proved the chain of title of its property from plaintiff’s predecessors in interest from 1929 through the present, and showed through uncontradicted testimony that those predecessors had also made use of the gravel area now claimed by plaintiff as an easement by prescription. Under the doctrine of “tacking,” plaintiff may add those previous periods of use to its own upon a <span title="319" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-319">p. 319</span>showing that it has “assume[d] the use of the easement directly from his predecessor as a part of his receipt of the dominant estate.” The record supports the conclusion that adverse use began no later than 1929, with the result that the prescriptive period expired in 1944. The record supports a conclusion that the claimed use was made in an open, notorious, continuous and adverse manner from 1929 until at least 1956.</p></div></div>

<p id="c567feec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in adverse possession, occasional or sporadic use is likely to violate the continuity requirement for a prescriptive easement. <i>Barchowsky v. Silver Farms, Inc</i>., 659 A.2d 347, 354 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1995). However, in <i>United States ex rel. Zuni Tribe of N.M. v. Platt,</i> 730 F. Supp. 318 (D. Ariz. 1990), the court recognized a prescriptive easement of passage in the Zuni Tribe, which had traversed a 110-mile path located on private lands every four years on a pilgrimage to a sacred site and probably had been doing so since 1540.</p>

<p id="c567feed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Burden of proof.</b> As with adverse possession, many courts require proof of adverse use for prescriptive easements by clear and convincing evidence, <i>McDonald v. Harris,</i> 978 P.2d 81 (Alaska 1999), while some require only that the claimant prove the elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Stiefel v. Lindemann,</i> 638 A.2d 642, 649 n.8 (Conn. Ct. App. 1994).</p>
<p id="c567feee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Adverse possession claims result in a transfer of title to the adverse possessor while prescriptive easement claims result in the right to continue the kind and amount of use that persisted during the statutory period.</p>
<p id="c567feef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Acquiescence.</b> As <i>Community Feed Store</i> demonstrates, a significant number of states require the prescriptive easement claimant to prove <b>acquiescence</b> by the true owner as one of the elements of the claim. This is a confusing term. How can the true owner both “acquiesce” in the use and “not permit” it?</p>
<p id="c567fef0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The acquiescence requirement may have its origin in the theory that prescriptive easements are based not on adverse or nonpermissive use, but on a <b>lost grant</b>. Because statutes of limitation usually applied only to possessory claims in England, English law protected longstanding use on the premise that the use had a lawful origin. The device of choice was the fiction of a lost grant. This theory presumes initial permissive use and therefore contradicts the requirement of proving that use was adverse or nonpermissive.</p>
<p id="c5682601-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For some courts today, acquiescence merely means that the owner did not assert her right to exclude by bringing a trespass action; this interpretation renders the requirement duplicative and unnecessary. For some courts, however, it does have independent significance; it means that the landowner must have <i>known</i> about the use and passively allowed it to continue without formally granting permission. <i>Sparling v. Fon du Lac Township</i>, 745 N.E.2d 660 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001). Alternatively, it could mean that a reasonable owner would or <i>should</i> have known of the use; this meaning duplicates the requirement that the use be open and notorious because use is open and notorious only if it is sufficiently visible to put a reasonable owner on notice of it. <i>Hodgins v. Sales,</i> 76 P.3d 969, 973 (Idaho 2003); <i>Jones v. Cullen,</i> 1998 WL 811558, at *5 (Minn. Ct. App. 1998); <i>Lingvall v. Bartmess,</i> 982 P.2d 690, 694 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999).</p>

Presumptions as to permission.</b> Most states presume that a use that satisfies the other elements of prescription is nonpermissive, just as they do with adverse possession. <i>See, e.g., Harambasic v. Owens,</i> 920 P.2d 39, 40-41 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996). However, a significant minority of courts presume that use, unlike possession, is presumptively permissive rather than adverse. <i>Johnson v. Coshatt,</i> 591 So. 2d 483, 485 (Ala. 1991); <i>McGill v. Wahl</i>, 839 P.2d 393, 397-398 (Alaska 1992). They do so because owners often do allow their neighbors to cross over their land as a “neighborly gesture,” <i>Jones v. Cullen,</i> 1998 WL 811558, at *5 (Minn. Ct. App. 1998), and there may therefore be more warrant for assuming that limited uses are permissive than there is for presuming that occupation is permissive. <i>Johnson v. Stanley,</i> 384 S.E.2d 577, 579 (N.C. Ct. App. 1989). Some courts adopt a presumption that use is permissive only if it can be shown that there was a community custom to allow such uses on the land of others. <i>Warnack v. Coneen Family Trust,</i> 879 P.2d 715 (Mont. 1994). Finally, some states protect owners from prescriptive easements over large bodies of unenclosed land under a “neighborhood accommodation exception” where the owners could not reasonably know of passings over the land. <i>See Algermissen v. Sutin,</i> 61 P.3d 176, 182 (N.M. 2002) (describing but not applying this exception).</p>

<p id="c5682605-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Trees.</b> A great deal of litigation has ensued between neighbors over encroaching trees. Owners are entitled to cut branches of their neighbors’ trees that encroach over their land. <i>Lane v. W.J. Curry &amp; Sons,</i> 92 S.W.3d 355, 360 (Tenn. 2002). Can a tree owner obtain a prescriptive easement allowing the tree’s branches to remain over neighboring land? Almost all courts hold no, creating an important exception to the prescriptive easement doctrine. <i>Pierce v. Casady, 7</i>11 P.2d 766 (Kan. Ct. App. 1985); <i>Koresko v. Farley,</i> 844 A.2d 607 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2004). However, some courts may allow such rights to ripen into easements. <i>Garcia v. Sanchez,</i> 772 P.2d 1311 (N.M. Ct. App. 1989); <i>Jones v. Wagner</i>, 624 A.2d 166, 171 n.3 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993).</p>

<p id="c5682606-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Adversity and color of title, revisited.</b> As we discussed in connection with color of title and adverse possession, situations in which parties intend to transfer a property interest but fail to do so through some technical defect can create a puzzle for doctrines (like adverse possession and prescription) that insist on “adversity.”  Some courts have responded to this puzzle by theorizing that use of property under a defective conveyance is not actually permissive. In contrast, the <i>Restatement (Third) of Property</i> §2.16 responds by distinguishing between two categories of “prescriptive” uses: (1) uses that are “adverse to the owner of the land” or (2) uses that are “made pursuant to the terms of an intended but imperfectly created servitude.” Uses that arise under an “imperfectly created servitude” do not need to be adverse.</p>
<p id="c5682607-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. The good faith problem.</b> In <i>Community Feed Store</i>, one person mistakenly used his neighbor’s property. In contrast, in <i>Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc.,</i> 676 P.2d 584 (Cal. 1984), cited in <i>Community Feed Store</i>, the adverse user clearly knew that it was trespassing on neighboring property. In <i>Warsaw</i>, plaintiffs arranged for the construction of a large commercial building on their property but unfortunately left insufficient space between the edge of the building and their property line. The 40-foot driveway was “inadequate since the large trucks which carried material to and from plaintiffs’ loading dock could not turn and position themselves at these docks without traveling onto the defendant’s property,” <i>id</i>. at 586, which they proceeded to do for the next seven years. When defendant developed plans to build on the portion <span title="321" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-321">p. 321</span>of its property that had been used by plaintiffs to back up its delivery trucks, plaintiffs sued to establish a prescriptive easement over the 25-foot strip on the edge of defendant’s property. Defendant unwisely continued construction over the disputed strip while litigation proceeded. Plaintiffs ultimately prevailed, obtaining a prescriptive easement since the relevant statute of limitations allowed a relatively short six-year period to establish such an easement.</p>
<p id="c5682608-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Acquisition by the public.</b> Many older cases and some modern cases hold that the public could not acquire an easement by prescription. <i>Mihalczo v. Borough of Woodmont,</i> 400 A.2d 270, 272 (Conn. 1978); <i>Forest Hills Gardens Corp. v. Baroth,</i> 555 N.Y.S.2d 1000, 1002 (Sup. Ct. 1990). This rule is based partly on the difficulty of proving continuity of use (how does one define the public?), partly on the difficulty of excluding the general public from certain areas, and partly on the presumption that public use of private property is permissive rather than adverse.</p>
<p id="c5682609-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the strong trend of modern cases is to recognize that the public may acquire prescriptive easements, while often presuming that public access to private land is permissive in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, thereby defeating the claim for prescription. <i>Houghton v. Johnson,</i> 887 N.E.2d 1073 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008) (evidence insufficient to prove public prescriptive easement over private beach); <i>Weidner v. State</i>, 860 P.2d 1205, 1209 (Alaska 1993) (holding that the state could acquire an easement by prescription); <i>Limestone Dev. Corp. v. Village of Lemont,</i> 672 N.E.2d 763, 768 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996); <i>Fears v. YJ Land Corp.,</i> 539 N.W.2d 306, 308 (N.D. 1995). This is the approach adopted by the <i>Restatement</i> (<i>Third) of Property (Servitudes)</i> §2.18 (2000). Some states have statutes providing that use by the public of a road for a certain amount of time creates a public highway. Idaho Code §40-202. A few states have used this doctrine to recognize prescriptive rights in the public to use beaches for recreational purposes. <i>City of Daytona Beach v. Tona-Rama, Inc.,</i> 294 So. 2d 73, 75 (Fla. 1974); <i>Villa Nova Resort, Inc. v. State,</i> 711 S.W.2d 120, 127 (Tex. Ct. Civ. App. 1986).</p></div>

<p id="c5687436-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens when someone mistakenly invests a lot of money in building a structure that encroaches on a neighbor’s property? If the structure <i>decreases</i> the value of the neighboring property, the owner ordinarily wishes it to be removed. Owners normally have the right to end a continuing trespass.

<p id="c568743a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many courts, especially in older cases, hold that a property owner has an absolute right to an injunction ordering an encroaching structure removed, no matter what the cost involved or the relative value of the properties or the extent of the encroachment. This is most often done in the case of a fence or wall, driveway, or overhanging porch or fire escape, but some courts go so far as to order the removal of an encroaching building. For example, in <i>Bishop v. Reinhold,</i> 311 S.E.2d 298 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984), defendants partially erected their house on the adjoining, unimproved lot of the plaintiffs. The court held that the plaintiffs had an absolute right to have the part of the house that encroached on plaintiffs’ property removed. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Geragosian v. Union Realty Co</i>., 193 N.E. 726, 728 (Mass. 1935) (“The general rule is that the owner of land is entitled to an injunction for the removal of trespassing structures.”).</p>
<p id="c568743b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority of states, however, now reject this rigid approach and instead adopt the <b>relative hardship</b> doctrine. <i>Urban Site Venture II Limited Partnership v. Levering Associates Limited Partnership</i>, 665 A.2d 1062 (Md. 1995); <i>Restatement of Property</i> §563 (1944). If the encroachment is innocent (the result of a mistake), the harm minimal, the interference in the true owner’s property interests small, and the costs of removal substantial, the courts often refuse to grant an injunction ordering removal of the structure. Instead, they will either order the encroaching party to pay damages to the landowner to compensate for the decrease in market value of the owner’s land or order a forced sale of the property from the landowner to the owner of the encroaching structure with damages equal to the value of the land taken and possibly a premium to compensate for the involuntary nature of the transfer in ownership. If, however, the cost of removal is not substantial or the interference with the neighbor’s ability to use its property is substantial, removal will still be ordered. The North Carolina Court of Appeals explained the doctrine in <i>Williams v. South &amp; South Rentals, Inc.,</i> 346 S.E.2d 665, 669 (N.C. Ct. App. 1986):</p>

<p id="c568743c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the encroachment is minimal and the cost of removing the encroachment is most likely substantial, two competing factors must be considered in fashioning a remedy. On the one hand, without court intervention, a defendant may well be forced to buy plaintiff’s land at a price many times its worth rather than destroy the building that encroaches. On the other hand, without the threat of a mandatory injunction, builders may view the legal remedy as a license to engage in private eminent domain. The process of balancing the hardships and the equities is designed to eliminate either extreme. Factors to be considered are whether the owner acted in good faith or intentionally built on the adjacent land and whether the hardship incurred in removing the structure is disproportionate to the harm caused by the encroachment. Mere inconvenience and expense are not sufficient to withhold injunctive relief. The relative hardship must be disproportionate.</p>

Patterson,</i> 437 So. 2d 491, 495 (Ala. 1983) (ordering the defendant to remove the portion of her concrete driveway that encroached 12 feet onto a small neighboring lot because the encroachment “permanently impaired the [plaintiffs’] use and enjoyment of their property”).</p>
<p id="c568743e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But courts will refuse to order the removal of a mistaken encroachment when the equities tilt strongly in favor of the encroacher. In <i>Yeakel v. Driscoll,</i> 467 A.2d 1342 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1983), the court declined to order the removal of a recently constructed fire wall that encroached two inches onto plaintiff’s porch. The court invoked the maxim <i>de minimus non curat lex</i>, meaning “that the law will not concern itself with trifles. More specifically it means that a court will not grant equitable relief to a plaintiff who seeks a decree which will do him no good but which will work a hardship on another.” <i>Id</i>. at 1344. <i>See Gilpin v. Jacob Ellis Realties,</i> 135 A.2d 204 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1957) (denying an injunction removing an encroachment when the cost of removal was $11,500 and the damage to neighboring property was only $1,000); <i>Generalow v. Steinberger,</i> 517 N.Y.S.2d 22 (App. Div. 1987) (refusing to order removal of a driveway and wall that encroached 8.4 inches onto neighboring property and relegating plaintiff to damages); <i>Knuth v. Vogels,</i> 61 N.W.2d 301 (Wis. 1953) (refusing to order removal of a garage that encroached one to two feet onto plaintiff’s property and giving the defendant trespasser the option of removing the structure or paying damages).</p>
<p id="c568743f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where encroachment occurs in bad faith, however, courts refuse to consider arguments about relative hardship. For example, in <i>Warsaw v. Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc</i>., 676 P.2d 584 (Cal. 1984), the defendant proceeded to build a structure that infringed on its neighbor’s property, even though the defendant knew that plaintiff claimed that the structure would infringe on the plaintiff’s property. The court ordered the structure removed. The court did not weigh relative hardship because “the defendant acted with a full knowledge” of the owner’s asserted rights. <i>Id</i>. at 588. Because construction began while a lawsuit was pending regarding the parties’ property rights, the court held that defendant “gambled on the outcome of the action and lost.” <i>Id. Accord, Goulding v. Cook,</i> 661 N.E.2d 1322 (Mass. 1996) (ordering removal of septic tank built when builder knew land ownership was in dispute).</p>

<p id="c5689b52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens when, rather than partially encroaching, an <i>entire structure</i> is built on land belonging to another? Are the situations meaningfully different? Traditionally, courts have held that the structure belongs to the owner of the land on which it sits. <i>Banner v. United States,</i> 238 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Does this result in unjust enrichment to the landowner? Or is it an appropriate result in light of the builder’s <span title="325" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-325">p. 325</span>negligence in building on someone else’s land? If both parties were negligent in allowing the construction to happen, what should the court do? Should it order the landowner to pay for the building so that the landowner is not unjustly enriched? Or should the landowner be forced to sell the land to the builder? The following case deals with these questions.</p>

<p id="c5689b5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs, W.J. Somerville and Hazel M. Somerville, the owners of Lots 44, 45 and 46 in the Homeland Addition to the city of Parkersburg, in Wood County, believing that they were erecting a warehouse building on Lot 46 which they owned, [and in reliance on a surveyor’s report and plat,] mistakenly constructed the building on Lot 47 owned by the defendants, William L. Jacobs and Marjorie S. Jacobs. Construction of the building was completed in January 1967 and by deed dated January 14, 1967 the Somervilles conveyed Lots 44, 45 and 46 to the plaintiffs Fred C. Engle and Jimmy C. Pappas who subsequently leased the building to the Parkersburg Coca-Cola Bottling Company, a corporation. Soon after the building was completed but not until then, the defendants learned that the building was on their property and claimed ownership of the building and its fixtures on the theory of annexation. The plaintiffs then instituted this proceeding for equitable relief in the Circuit Court of Wood County and in their complaint prayed, among other things, for judgment in favor of the Somervilles for $20,500.00 as the value of the improvements made on Lot 47, or, in the alternative, that the defendants be ordered to convey their interest in Lot 47 to the Somervilles for a fair consideration. The Farmers Building and Loan Association, a corporation, the holder of a deed of trust lien upon the land of the defendants, was on motion permitted to intervene and be made a defendant in this proceeding.</p>
<p id="c568c26c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The controlling question for decision is whether a court of equity can award compensation to an improver for improvements which he has placed upon land not owned by him, which, because of mistake, he had reason to believe he owned, which improvements were not known to the owner until after their completion and were not induced or permitted by such owner, who is not guilty of any fraud or inequitable conduct, and require the owner to pay the fair value of such improvements or, in the alternative, to convey the land so improved to the improver upon his payment to the owner of the fair value of the land less the value of the improvements.</p>
<p id="c568c26d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though there are numerous decisions by this Court relating to improvements to land, the precise question here involved is one of first impression in this jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="c568c26f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Section 625, Chapter 11, Volume 2, <i>Tiffany Real Property,</i> Third Edition, the text contains this language:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c568c270-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the rule that erections or additions made by one who has no rights to land are fixtures, and therefore not removable by him, even though he made them in the belief that he was the owner of the land, is calculated to cause hardship to an innocent occupant of another’s land, by giving the benefit of his labor and expenditures to the landowner, the courts of this country, without either imputing fraud or requiring proof of it, hold it inequitable to allow one to be enriched under such circumstances by the labor and expenditures of another who acted in good faith and in ignorance of any adverse claim or title. Applying this doctrine of “unjust enrichment,” a court of equity will, on the principle that he who seeks equity must do equity, refuse its assistance to the rightful owner of land as against an occupant thereof unless he makes compensation for permanent and beneficial improvements, made by the latter without notice of the defect in his title.</p>
</div>
<p id="c568c271-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the foregoing authorities it is manifest that equity has jurisdiction to, and will, grant relief to one who, through a reasonable mistake of fact and in good faith, places permanent improvements upon land of another, with reason to believe that the land so improved is that of the one who makes the improvements, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief which they seek in this proceeding.</p>
<p id="c568c272-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The undisputed facts, set forth in the agreed statement of counsel representing all parties, is that the plaintiff W.J. Somerville in placing the warehouse building upon Lot 47 entertained a reasonable belief based on the report of the surveyor that it was Lot 46, which he owned, and that the building was constructed by him because of a reasonable mistake of fact and in the good faith belief that he was constructing a building on his own property and he did not discover his mistake until after the building was completed. It is equally clear that the defendants who spent little if any time in the neighborhood were unaware of the construction of the building until after it was completed and were not at any time or in any way guilty of any fraud or inequitable conduct or of any act that would constitute an estoppel. In short, the narrow issue here is between two innocent parties and the solution of the question requires the application of principles of equity and fair dealing between them.</p>
<p id="c568c273-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear that the defendants claim the ownership of the building. Under the common law doctrine of annexation, the improvements passed to them as part of the land. This is conceded by the plaintiffs but they assert that the defendants can not keep and retain it without compensating them for the value of the improvements, and it is clear from the testimony of the defendant William L. Jacobs in his deposition that the defendants intend to keep and retain the improvements and refuse to compensate the plaintiffs for their value. The record does not disclose any express <span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-327">p. 327</span>request by the plaintiffs for permission to remove the building from the premises if that could be done without its destruction, which is extremely doubtful as the building was constructed of solid concrete blocks on a concrete slab, and it is reasonably clear, from the claim of the defendants of their ownership of the building and their insistence that certain fixtures which have been removed from the building be replaced, that the defendants will not consent to the removal of the building even if that could be done.</p>
<p id="c568c274-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that situation if the defendants retain the building and refuse to pay any sum as compensation to the plaintiff W.J. Somerville they will be unjustly enriched in the amount of $17,500.00, the agreed value of the building, which is more than eight and one-half times the agreed $2,000.00 value of the lot of the defendants on which it is located, and by the retention of the building by the defendants the plaintiff W.J. Somerville will suffer a total loss of the amount of the value of the building. If, however, the defendants are unable or unwilling to pay for the building which they intend to keep but, in the alternative, would convey the lot upon which the building is constructed to the plaintiff W.J. Somerville upon payment of the sum of $2,000.00, the agreed value of the lot without the improvements, the plaintiffs would not lose the building and the defendants would suffer no financial loss because they would obtain payment for the agreed full value of the lot and the only hardship imposed upon the defendants, if this were required, would be to order them to do something which they are unwilling to do voluntarily. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, if the defendants refuse and are not required to exercise their option either to pay W.J. Somerville the value of the improvements or to convey to him the lot on which they are located upon his payment of the agreed value, the defendants will be unduly and unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff W.J. Somerville who will suffer the complete loss of the warehouse building which by bona fide mistake of fact he constructed upon the land of the defendants. Here, in that situation, to use the language of the Supreme Court of Michigan in <i>Hardy v. Burroughs,</i> 232 N.W. 200, “It is not equitable . . . that defendants profit by plaintiffs’ innocent mistake, that defendants take all and plaintiffs nothing.”</p>
<p id="c568c275-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To prevent such unjust enrichment of the defendants, and to do equity between the parties, this Court holds that an improver of land owned by another, who through a reasonable mistake of fact and in good faith erects a building entirely upon the land of the owner, with reasonable belief that such land was owned by the improver, is entitled to recover the value of the improvements from the landowner and to a lien upon such property which may be sold to enforce the payment of such lien, or, in the alternative, to purchase the land so improved upon payment to the landowner of the value of the land less the improvements and such landowner, even though free from any inequitable conduct in connection with the construction of the building upon his land, who, however, retains but refuses to pay for the improvements, must, within a reasonable time, either pay the improver the amount by which the value of his land has been improved or convey such land to the improver upon the payment by the improver to the landowner of the value of the land without the improvements.</p>

<p id="c568c277-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respectfully, but firmly, I dissent from the decision of the majority in this case. Although the majority expresses a view which it says would result in equitable treatment for both parties, I am of the opinion that such view is clearly contrary to law and to the principles of equity and that such holding, if carried into effect, will establish a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p id="c568e988-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am aware of the apparent alarmist posture of my statements asserting that the adoption of the majority view will establish a dangerous precedent. Nonetheless, I believe just that and feel that my apprehension is justified. On the basis of unjust enrichment and equity, the majority has decided that the errant party who, without improper design, has encroached upon an innocent owner’s property is entitled to equitable treatment. That is, that he should be made whole. How is this accomplished? It is accomplished by requiring the owner of the property to buy the building erroneously constructed on his property or by forcing (by court edict) such owner to sell his property for an amount to be determined by the court.</p>
<p id="c568e989-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What of the property owner’s right? The solution offered by the majority is designed to favor the plaintiff, the only party who had a duty to determine which lot was the proper one and who made a mistake. The defendants in this case, the owners of the property, had no duty to perform and were not parties to the mistake. Does equity protect only the errant and ignore the faultless? Certainly not.</p>
<p id="c568e98a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not unusual for a property owner to have long range plans for his property. He should be permitted to feel secure in the ownership of such property by virtue of placing his deed therefor on record. He should be permitted to feel secure in his future plans for such property. However, if the decision expressed in the majority opinion is effectuated then security of ownership in property becomes a fleeting thing. It is very likely that a property owner in the circumstances of the instant case either cannot readily afford the building mistakenly built on his land or that such building does not suit his purpose. Having been entirely without fault, he should not be forced to purchase the building.</p>
<p id="c568e98b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion for the court to permit the plaintiff to force the defendants to sell their property contrary to their wishes is unthinkable and unpardonable. This is nothing less than condemnation of private property by private parties for private use. Condemnation of property (eminent domain) is reserved for government or such entities as may be designated by the legislature. Under no theory of law or equity should an individual be permitted to acquire property by condemnation. The majority would allow just that.</p>
<p id="c568e98c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am aware of the doctrine that equity frowns on unjust enrichment. However, contrary to the view expressed by the majority, I am of the opinion that the circumstances of this case do not warrant the application of such doctrine. It clearly is the accepted law that as between two parties in the circumstances of this case he who made the mistake must suffer the hardship rather than he who was without fault.</p>

<p id="c568e991-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Mistake.</b> When a builder mistakenly constructs an entire structure on land belonging to another, the courts generally rule that the landowner becomes the owner of the structure built on her land by another. Does this rule make sense, given the fact that the landowner stood by and allowed the construction to occur without intervening? Does the owner have any obligation to look out for her own rights? Does the landowner have to compensate the builder? The builder claims that failure to compensate will leave the landowner unjustly enriched by the builder’s investment; moreover, both parties made a mistake — the builder by encroaching on neighboring property and the landowner by not noticing that someone was building on her own land and not taking action to prevent it. Which property claim should prevail?</p>
<p id="c568e992-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the court in <i>Somerville v. Jacobs,</i> some courts hold that an innocent trespasser who improves property in the good faith belief that it was her own property has a right to compensation for the value of the improvements made when those improvements increase the value of the property. Some courts, however, hold that “trespassers cannot have the advantage of any benefits they have made to the property. Such improvements belong to the landowner, without compensation to trespassers for labor or materials.” 9-64A <i>Powell on Real Property</i> §64A.05[5]. Do you agree with the majority or the dissenting opinion in <i>Somerville</i>?</p>
<p id="c568e993-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Betterment statutes.</b> Some states have <b>betterment statutes</b> that allow owners to choose between paying the builder the value of improvements built on their land or selling the land on which the improvement sits to the builder. They generally allow compensation only when the builder had color of title and believed in good faith that the land was hers. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ark. Code §18-60-213; N.C. Gen. Stat. §§1-340 to 1-351. In effect, these statutes force owners to pay for unwanted improvements or give up to the builder land they otherwise would have owned. Should the burden be on the builder to make sure she is building on her own land, or should the landowner have an obligation to determine if someone else is building on her own land and act to stop the trespass?</p>

<p id="c56910a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Banner v. United States,</i> 238 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <i>aff’g</i> 44 Fed. Cl. 568 (Fed. Cl. 1999), title to most of the town of Salamanca, New York, was held by the Seneca Nation of Indians. In the 1870s, non-Indians began to settle on Seneca land pursuant <span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>to leases granted them by the Seneca Nation. However, under federal Indian law,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10983_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10983_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">21</a></span> those leases were not valid under federal law without the consent of the United States. An 1875 federal statute validated the leases and extended them for a number of years. Several statutes followed until Congress unilaterally extended those leases in an 1890 federal statute for 99 years. With no choice but to extend the leases, the Seneca Nation itself renewed the leases at nominal rents of $1 to $10 a year. Those rents were not raised over the entire period of the leases until they expired on February 1, 1991.</p>
<p id="c56910a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At that point the City of Salamanca created a public authority to negotiate a new arrangement with the Seneca Nation. That agreement provided that “(1) the United States and the state of New York would pay a combined $60 million to the Seneca Nation to remedy the severe value inequities of the 99-year leases, (2) the Seneca Nation would offer new leases to the then-existing lessees with a term of forty years, renewable for another forty years at fair market value. . . .” <i>Id</i>. The agreement left for the future the question of who would own the improvements on the land at the end of the leases if they ever expired and were not renewed. That agreement was ratified by Congress in legislation passed in 1990.</p>
<p id="c56910a9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because some individuals refused to accept the lease renewals, the United States brought suit against them on behalf of the Seneca Nation to eject them from Seneca lands. The court ruled that the tribe was not obligated to renew the leases and that ejectment was a proper remedy. The court also ruled that the Seneca Nation owned the improvements placed on the land. The ejected owners then brought a claim against the United States arguing that, by failing to provide compensation for the lost value of their dwellings, the United States had taken their property without just compensation. The Federal Circuit Court affirmed the ruling of the Court of Federal Claims that no such taking had occurred because the common law granted ownership of buildings built on land belonging to another to the owner of the land.</p>
<p id="c56910aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Were the courts correct to hold that the Seneca Nation owned the improvements built on their land? Does it matter that, in the past, the United States had consistently sided with the settlers and protected their interests when they conflicted with the interests of the Seneca Nation?

A valid dedication requires an <b>offer</b> by the owner of the property and an <b>acceptance</b> by the public. The offer consists of words or conduct on the part of the owner that demonstrate an intent to turn the property over to the public. The offer may be made by a written or oral statement from the owner. The courts may also find an implied offer by one who invites or merely permits the public to use her land for a long period of time. The acceptance may be made formally by passing a city council resolution or informally by taking over maintenance of the area or ceasing to collect property taxes on the parcel. Finally, just as an offer may be implied from the owner’s longstanding acquiescence in public use, an acceptance may be implied from long and substantial public use, even absent governmental action. Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra,</i> §11.6, at 846-850.</p>
<p id="c5695edd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts take seriously the idea that the owner must express an intent to make a gift of the property to the public, whether this is expressed through an oral statement or by conduct evidencing an intent to make a gift. <i>See, e.g., General Auto Service Station v. Maniatis,</i> 765 N.E.2d 1176 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (evidence insufficient to show either dedication or acceptance despite long public usage). Some courts, however, have found dedication when the owner has objected to public use but has made no serious effort to stop that use. In <i>Gion v. City of Santa Cruz</i>, 465 P.2d 50 (Cal. 1970), for example, the California Supreme Court found that the owners of a private beach had “dedicated” their property to the public by acquiescing in longstanding public use; the owners’ efforts to stop the use were “half-hearted and ineffectual.” Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra,</i> §11.6, at 848.

<p id="c5695ee3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The analog for trespass in the context of chattels is conversion. The statute of limitations for conversion begins to run when the property is wrongfully taken (converted) and the owner dispossessed of the property. <i>Songbyrd, Inc. v. Estate of Albert B. Grossman,</i> 23 F. Supp. 2d 219 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) (adverse possession of music recordings); <i>Vigilant Insurance Co. of America v. Housing Authority of the City of El Paso,</i> 660 N.E.2d 1121 (N.Y. 1995) (bonds). Without supplemental doctrines, the wrongful possessor would become immune from suit by the original owner upon the expiration of the statute of limitations. But the transfer of title to the possessor upon the expiration of the limitations period  —   as occurs with the adverse possession of land  —   would be harsher for chattel owners than it would be for landowners. Do you see why? As a result, courts have developed different rules that (under certain circumstances) work to extend the statute of limitations for conversion. Most jurisdictions follow one of two principal approaches: the discovery rule or the demand rule.</p>
<p id="c5695ee4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The leading case establishing the <b>discovery rule</b> is <i>O’Keeffe v. Snyder,</i> 416 A.2d 862 (N.J. 1980). In <i>O’Keeffe</i>, the painter Georgia O’Keeffe sued a New York gallery owned by Barry Snyder to recover three paintings stolen from her and purchased for $35,000 by Snyder from a third party, Ulrich A. Frank, who had inherited them from his father. Snyder claimed that he had acquired title to the paintings by adverse possession under New Jersey’s six-year statute of limitations. Snyder claimed that the six-year period started to run when the paintings were stolen. In contrast, O’Keeffe argued that she had not known where the paintings were after they were stolen and thus could not reasonably have made a demand to have the paintings returned. Since she had sued the possessor within six years of discovering where the paintings were, her claim should not be barred. The court agreed, noting that a thief can never acquire good title and that no one can acquire good title from a thief; even a bona fide purchaser who is unaware that property was stolen will not ordinarily be able to retain ownership in a contest with the true owner. An exception to this principle is contained in the <i>Uniform Commercial Code</i>, which provides that entrusting possession of goods to a merchant who deals in that kind of goods gives the merchant the power to transfer all the rights of the entruster to a buyer in the ordinary course of business, thereby vesting good title in the buyer as against the original owner. <i>See</i> U.C.C. §2-403(2). The court held that if that section of the UCC did not apply, the statute of limitations for adverse possession (in someone other than the true owner) would start to run only when the true owner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, where the stolen personal property was located. The question, therefore, was whether O’Keeffe had used due diligence to recover the paintings and whether the paintings had been concealed from her. <i>Accord, Charash v. Oberlin College</i>, 14 F.3d 291, 299 (6th Cir. 1994).</p>

In <i>Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation v. Lubell,</i> 569 N.E.2d 426 (N.Y. 1991), a Chagall gouache was stolen from the storeroom of the Guggenheim Museum in the late 1960s. However, the museum neither notified the police nor publicly announced the theft. The current possessor argued that the failure to attempt to recover the artwork meant that the museum’s rights were barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The museum responded that this was a tactical decision “based upon its belief that to publicize the theft would succeed only in driving the gouache further underground and greatly diminishing the possibility that it would ever be recovered.” The court rejected the discovery rule on the grounds that it was wrong to place a general obligation of due diligence on the true owner. Rather, the court held that “a cause of action for replevin against the good faith purchaser of a stolen chattel accrues when the true owner makes demand for return of the chattel and the person in possession of the chattel refuses to return it. Until demand is made and refused, possession of the stolen property by the good faith purchaser for value is not considered wrongful.” The court explained, <i>id</i>. at 431:</p>

<p id="c56984f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[O]ur decision today is in part influenced by our recognition that New York enjoys a worldwide reputation as a preeminent cultural center. To place the burden of locating stolen artwork on the true owner and to foreclose the rights of that owner to recover its property if the burden is not met would, we believe, encourage illicit trafficking in stolen art. Three years after the theft, any purchaser, good faith or not, would be able to hold onto stolen art work unless the true owner was able to establish that it had undertaken a reasonable search for the missing art. This shifting of the burden onto the wronged owner is inappropriate. In our opinion, the better rule gives the owner relatively greater protection and places the burden of investigating the provenance of a work of art on the potential purchaser.</p>

The evidence seems to suggest that the Blevins may very well have established adverse possession to the two-feet-wide tract, because they maintained the tract for over ten years. The Blevins conveyed their adversely possessed property to the Fletchers, and the Fletchers in turn conveyed the same to the defendants. Therefore the tacking involved here does not require analysis of the defendants’ period of ownership, unless it is established that the Blevins did not in fact acquire adverse possession. If it is determined that the Blevins acquired adverse possession of the two-feet-wide tract, the issue then merely becomes whether the Blevins intended to convey the two-feet-wide tract to the Fletchers, and whether the Fletchers intended to convey the two-feet-wide tract to the defendants. The period of ownership by the defendants becomes irrelevant under this scenario. It is only if a determination is made that the Blevins did not establish adverse possession that the defendants’ period of ownership becomes relevant for tacking on the time period of the Fletchers.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c56518ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN100EF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N100EF_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span>&nbsp;We have held that to establish “hostile” or “adverse” possession, evidence must be presented which shows that possession of disputed property was against the right of the true owner and is inconsistent with the title of the true owner for the entire requisite ten-year period.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c56518ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN100F9_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N100F9_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span>&nbsp;We have held that to establish “actual” possession, evidence must be presented which shows that possession of disputed property was used for enjoyment, cultivation, residence or improvements for the entire requisite ten-year period.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c56518f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10105_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10105_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span>&nbsp;We have held that to establish “open and notorious” possession, evidence must be presented which shows that possession of disputed property was in such a manner as to give notice to the true owner that the property is being claimed by another for the entire requisite ten-year period.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c56518f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1010F_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N1010F_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span>&nbsp;We have held that to establish “exclusive” possession, evidence must be presented which shows that possession of disputed property was used only by the occupant and others were not permitted to use it or claim ownership during the entire requisite ten-year period.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5654013-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN10179_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N10179_cee9f544-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span>&nbsp;Cases involving mistaken boundaries may generate claims of either adverse possession or what are called prescriptive easements, which involve rights of access but not ownership.

That case, which also enunciated the “public use” exception to the general presumption of adversity, involved one shopholder’s claim of prescriptive easement as to passage, both for himself and his customers, over a neighboring shopholder’s land. There, the Court found that because the second shopholder had already opened his land to general passage by his own customers, there was a presumption of permission to all public users, including the first shopholder and his customers.
