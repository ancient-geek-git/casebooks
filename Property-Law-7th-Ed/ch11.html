<p id="c5c16993-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property interests known as <b>leaseholds</b> are familiar to most law students. In a lease, the landlord agrees to transfer possession of the property for a specified period to the tenant in return for the tenant’s promise to make a periodic rental payment. When the tenancy is over, possession ordinarily reverts to the landlord unless she has sold the property, conveying her interest to someone else. Landlord-tenant law therefore involves a division of property interests between the landlord and the tenant as well as a long-term relationship between them.</p>
<p id="c5c16994-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A lease is both a <b>conveyance</b> of an important property interest, akin in many ways to other estates such as the life estate, as well as a <b>contract</b> between the landlord and the tenant. Many of the topics in this chapter highlight this dual character. In some instances, doctrines traditionally based in property law have given way to contractual norms, and this has been an important part of the modernization of landlord-tenant law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10036_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10036_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span></p>

<p id="c5c190a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are four major types of tenancies or leaseholds: <b>term of years</b>, <b>periodic tenancy</b>, <b>tenancy at will</b>, and <b>tenancy at sufferance</b>.</p>

<p id="c5c190ab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first version of URLTA was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1972 and has been adopted in some form by nearly half the states. In 2015, the Uniform Law Commission promulgated a <i>Revised Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</i> with a range of updates and new sections on disposing tenant property, security deposits, and terminating leases in the context of domestic violence or sexual assault.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c190ac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Term of years.</b> A term of years lasts for a specified period of time determined by the parties. The period can be of any length. For example, a one-year lease is a term of years; so is a 10-year lease or a 60-day lease. For that matter, so is a 99-year lease. A <span title="814" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-814">p. 814</span>term of years ends automatically at the agreed-upon time, but it may be terminated before the end of the fixed period on the happening of some event or condition stated in the lease agreement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10072_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10072_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> The future interest that follows the term of years, if retained by the landlord, is a <b>reversion</b>. If, at the time the lease is signed, the owner provides that the property will shift to a third party at the end of the leasehold, the third party holds a <b>remainder</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1007E_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1007E_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> The death of either party does not terminate the tenancy. The landlord is not entitled to evict the tenant before the end of the term; the only exception occurs when the tenant is breaching a material term of the lease, such as the covenant to pay rent.</p>
<p id="c5c190af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Periodic tenancy.</b> Periodic tenancies renew automatically at specified periods unless either the landlord or the tenant chooses to end the relationship. For example, a tenant may have a lease that renews annually for a year period. By statute or common law, notice is required before either party can terminate the relationship and end the periodic tenancy. Usually, the required notice for termination is the length of one period (up to some maximum, such as six months).</p>
<p id="c5c190b0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many tenants have no written leases or specified end to their tenancy but pay monthly rent to the landlord. These arrangements create <b>month-to-month tenancies</b>, a form of periodic tenancy; they renew automatically each month if neither party notifies the other that he intends to end the relationship. Many states require a month’s notice to end a month-to-month tenancy, while the <i>Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</i> (URLTA) §4.301(b) requires 60-day notice for such termination. <i>See also Revised Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</i> (RURLTA) §801(b)(2) (requiring 30-day notice). The death of either the landlord or the tenant does not terminate the tenancy. Of course, the heirs or devisees of the deceased landlord or tenant may choose to end the tenancy, unless some statute or common law rule prevents this. Under this arrangement, the landlord can evict the tenant only by providing the requisite notice that the tenancy will not be renewed.</p>
<p id="c5c190b1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Tenancy at will.</b> The tenancy at will is similar to a periodic tenancy except that it can be ended with no notice by either party. Many states have effectively abolished tenancies at will by requiring notice before a tenancy can be terminated; if the required notice is the same as that for a month-to-month tenancy, the two become virtually identical. But some differences remain. For example, traditionally, the death of either the landlord or the tenant terminates the tenancy at will. This result differs from periodic tenancies or the term of years and may have important <span title="815" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-815">p. 815</span>consequences. Although the landlord still needs to give the statutorily required notice to evict, the landlord may have an absolute right to do so since the tenancy is at an end. In contrast, the landlord under a periodic tenancy may not be able to terminate the tenancy if the tenant has a defense to eviction, such as violation of the implied warranty of habitability.</p>
<p id="c5c190b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Tenancy at sufferance (holdover tenant).</b> A tenant rightfully in possession who wrongfully stays after the leasehold has terminated is called a <b>tenant at sufferance</b>, or a <b>holdover tenant</b>. The term is intended to distinguish between a tenant who wrongfully retains possession after the end of the lease term from a trespasser, who never had a right to possess the property. The legal procedures for ejecting trespassers often differ in significant ways from those for evicting holdover tenants. It may be lawful for an owner to physically eject a trespasser herself or to call on the police to do so. In contrast, an eviction proceeding and a court judgment are generally required to evict a tenant, including a tenant at sufferance. A landlord who accepts rent checks from a holdover tenant may be held to have agreed to a new tenancy calculated by the rental payment schedule (monthly checks creating a month-to-month tenancy).</p>

<div id="c5c1b7c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5c1b7c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">§1.2 Commercial and Residential Tenancies</p></h3></div>

<p id="c5c1b7c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts often distinguish between <b>residential</b> and <b>commercial</b> tenancies. Residential tenancies involve renting property for the purpose of establishing a home; commercial tenancies involve any nonresidential use, including operation of a business for profit or operation of a nonprofit institution such as a church, hospital, or university. Residential leases tend to be relatively shorter than commercial leases; one-year residential leases are common, while commercial leases can last a decade or more, depending on the nature of the use.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most rules are the same for both types of tenancy, but there are some differences. Even when the rules are the same, courts often analyze the two situations separately, on the assumption that the underlying policy considerations and the justified expectations of the parties may differ. In general, courts are more inclined to adopt common law rules regulating the terms of residential leases, on the assumption that commercial tenants are more likely to have sufficient bargaining power and expertise to shape the contractual arrangement in their best interests, while residential tenants are less likely to bargain for appropriate terms in the contract that reflect their justified expectations. <i>See Wesson v. Leone Enterprises</i>, 774 N.E.2d 611, 620 (Mass. 2002). By its own terms, ULRTA applies only to residential tenancies. The doctrines canvassed in this chapter apply to residential and commercial tenancies, although their application may differ in each context; when they do, we will make the distinctions explicit.</p>

<div id="c5c1b7c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="epub-section epub-bhead cc-section" level="B"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-large left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5c1b7c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">§1.3 Regulation of Landlord-Tenant Relationships</p></h3></div>

<p id="c5c1b7c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In most states, landlord-tenant relationships are heavily regulated by both common law and local, state, and federal statutes. <b>Procedural regulations</b>, for example, <span title="816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-816">p. 816</span>impose formal requirements for <i>creating</i> the landlord-tenant relationship. Under the <b>Statute of Frauds</b>, most states require that leases of more than one year be in writing, while leases of one year or less are enforceable whether they are written or oral. Oral periodic tenancies are generally enforceable under the Statute of Frauds so long as the period is one year or less; month-to-month tenancies satisfy this condition because, although they could last more than one year in total, the relevant period — one month — is less than a year. Oral tenancies at will are valid as well. Regulations also define the procedures required to <b>terminate</b> the relationship; these procedures ordinarily require <b>notice</b> and an <b>eviction proceeding</b> and court judgment to evict the tenant from the property. They may also provide for expedited court proceedings, often called <b>summary process</b>, to allow relatively quick evictions.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Substantive regulations</b> define the parties’ obligations to each other. For example, administrative agencies established by legislation may pass housing codes specifying the minimum requirements for conditions in an apartment, including heat, toilet and kitchen facilities, and pest control. Common law rules also govern the mutual obligations of the parties and impose implied terms in the contract. For example, all leaseholds include an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by which the landlord promises not to disturb the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the property.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Common law doctrines, and some statutes, define the circumstances under which a breach of the agreement by each of the parties entitles the other party to end her performance of her contractual obligations. For example, the landlord’s failure to comply with the housing code may relieve the tenant partially or totally of the obligation to pay rent.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some terms implied into leases are waivable by the parties, who may contract around them by agreeing to different arrangements. Other implied terms are compulsory or nonwaivable; any contractual term purporting to waive or alter the implied term is void and unenforceable.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to legislation specifically regulating landlord-tenant relations, many states have passed general <b>consumer protection statutes</b>. In recent years, a number of courts have held that tenants may bring claims against landlords as <b>consumers of housing services</b>.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do tenants bring claims under consumer protection acts when they have remedies under a statute or the common law for issues covered, for example, by the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment? They do so because some unfair trade practices or consumer protection statutes provide for multiple damages or reimbursement for attorneys’ fees or both. Multiple damages are awarded both to punish the wrongdoer and to deter wrongful conduct. Legislatures fear that compensatory damages may not be enough to deter fraudulent conduct since defendants may simply factor possible liability into their cost-benefit calculations, thus treating it as a cost of doing business. If the benefits of such conduct outweigh the costs, businesses may simply continue the unlawful conduct, thereby defeating the purpose of the legislation, which aims to protect consumers from such activity in the first place.</p>
<p id="c5c1b7cf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Various issues arise in these cases. First, courts must determine whether tenants are protected by general consumer protection statutes that prohibit “unfair” or <span title="817" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-817">p. 817</span>“deceptive” trade practices in the sale of “goods” and “services” to consumers. Courts commonly hold that rental housing constitutes a “service” that is bought by tenants as consumers, thus enabling tenants to sue under these statutes, or otherwise find landlords to be covered by such statutes. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Sawyer v. Robson</i>, 915 A.2d 1298, 1304 (Vt. 2006); <i>People ex rel. City of Santa Monica v. Gabriel</i>, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 574, 579 (Ct. App. 2010). Some courts, however, have held that the presence of specific landlord-tenant legislation, such as the URLTA<i>,</i> demonstrates a legislative intent to exclude tenants from coverage under other statutes and that tenants therefore cannot obtain additional remedies under general consumer protection legislation. <i>State v. Schwab</i>, 693 P.2d 108 (Wash. 1985).</p>
<p id="c5c1dee0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, courts must define what kinds of conduct constitute “unfair” or “deceptive” practices. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that including illegal and unenforceable clauses in residential leases constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice that “injures” tenants, even if the landlord never attempts to enforce the clause and the tenant admits never having read the clause. In the absence of reliance, however, damages are nominal. <i>Leardi v. Brown</i>, 474 N.E.2d 1094 (Mass. 1985). Other kinds of conduct held to constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices include retaliatory evictions, <i>Hernandez v. Stabach,</i> 193 Cal. Rptr. 350 (Ct. App. 1983), and the failure to maintain rental housing in a habitable condition, <i>Dean v. Hill</i>, 615 S.E.2d 699, 701-702 (N.C. Ct. App. 2005); <i>State v. Weller</i>, 327 N.W.2d 172 (Wis. 1982). Another central issue is addressed in the following problem.</p>

<p id="c5c1dee6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following case deals with the question whether migrant farmworkers who reside in facilities provided by their employer are entitled to a court hearing before being evicted. Tenants are generally entitled to such legal process; others generally are not so entitled. In addition, tenants may have a right under certain circumstances to continued occupancy over the landlord’s objections. The farmworkers’ relationship with their employer has many of the elements of a landlord-tenant relationship: the employer transfers possession of a portion of the employer’s property by allowing the farmworkers to live there in exchange for the farmworkers’ promises to convey value back to the employer. Their relationship also appears different, in ways that may be significant, from that of most tenants. Many migrant farmworkers pay no rent; instead, they work for the employer in the fields. They are compensated for these services in <span title="818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-818">p. 818</span>the form of wages. This compensation <i>may</i> be reduced to account for the rental value of the employer’s property they occupy. The exchange of land for services may make the relationship seem more like a feudal one than a modern contractual one.</p>
<p id="c5c1dee7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether the employees are classified as tenants or otherwise, the common law may require employers to follow certain procedures to exclude an ex-employee from the employer’s property. The important question therefore centers on the real procedures required to evict fired employees who, during their employment, were legally entitled to live on the employer’s property. Can the employer-landlord eject them physically? Can he call the police and have them arrested? Or must the employer provide notice and obtain a court judgment?</p>

<p id="c5c1deed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Glassboro [Service Association] is a non-profit corporation comprised of farmers who contracted with Glassboro for migrant farm labor. The farmers called Glassboro as they needed workers to pick crops, and Glassboro transported workers from its labor camp to the farms. The length of time that a worker stayed at a farm varied, depending primarily on the time needed to pick a crop. Glassboro paid the worker his wages, and the farmer paid Glassboro for those wages plus a commission for Glassboro’s services.</p>
<p id="c5c1deee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Only men were hired; the workers’ families remained in Puerto Rico. Glassboro paid a farmworker $2.40 per hour and charged him $23 per week for meals. The worker agreed to work eight hours a day for six days a week, plus overtime as mutually agreed.</p>
<p id="c5c1deef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In 1976, Glassboro negotiated a contract with the Puerto Rican Department of Labor.] The contract stated that a worker was to pay for his transportation from Puerto Rico. If he completed his contract, he would be reimbursed for the cost of transportation from and provided return transportation to Puerto Rico. If the worker did not fulfill his contract, Glassboro was not obliged to reimburse him for the cost of transportation. Although the contract provided that Glassboro would furnish a non-negotiable airplane ticket to Puerto Rico for a worker who became physically unfit, there was no comparable provision for a worker who was fired. The contract period was for 28 weeks, or until December 1, whichever came first.</p>
<p id="c5c20600-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract provided that, if an employee was to be discharged, a hearing was to occur no later than five days after the employee was given notice of termination. The contract did not require a minimum amount of time to elapse between notice and termination of employment. The contract provided further for administrative review within the Puerto Rican Department of Labor whenever a worker had a complaint “regarding the breach, application, interpretation or compliance” with the contract. If the Secretary of Labor determined that Glassboro had “not adequately remedied the complaint,” the Secretary could represent the worker and sue Glassboro.</p>
<p id="c5c20601-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to the contract, Glassboro supplied living quarters for workers at its labor camp in New Jersey. Those quarters consisted of barracks housing up to 30 men. <span title="819" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-819">p. 819</span>Each worker received a mattress, bedding, and a locker. The barracks were equipped with common toilets, showers, and lavatories. Although some farmers charged the workers for housing while the workers were at the farms, Glassboro did not impose any extra charge for housing at its labor camp. The contract did not require a migrant farmworker to live at Glassboro’s labor camp. Nonetheless, the parties contemplated that the farmworker would reside at the labor camp.</p>
<p id="c5c20602-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1976, [Natividad] Vásquez was recruited in Puerto Rico and came to New Jersey to work for Glassboro. According to Glassboro’s foreman, Vásquez’s work was not satisfactory. On July 19, 1976, the foreman told Vásquez that he was to be discharged. A few hours later Vásquez had his “hearing” with the foreman and a field representative of the Puerto Rican Department of Labor. Thereafter the foreman decided to complete the discharge, a decision Vásquez does not challenge in this action. Although there were vacant spaces at the Glassboro barracks, Vásquez was not permitted to remain overnight. The foreman told him to gather his belongings and leave.</p>
<p id="c5c20603-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unable to speak English and without funds to return to Puerto Rico, Vásquez sought the assistance of the Farmworkers Corporation, a federally funded non-profit corporation dedicated to the needs of farmworkers. A Rutgers law student returned with Vásquez to the camp and requested that Vásquez be allowed to remain overnight. The request was refused. Vásquez stayed with a friend who was participating in a job training program conducted by the Farmworkers Corporation.</p>
<p id="c5c20604-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Farmworkers Rights Project filed a complaint on July 22, 1976, seeking an order permitting Vásquez to reenter his living quarters and enjoining defendants from depriving him of the use of the quarters except through judicial process. Although Vásquez has since found housing, other workers have been evicted, one at 3:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M</span>.</p>

<p id="c5c20606-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, one who occupied premises as an employee of the owner and received the use of the premises as part compensation for his services or under a contract of employment was not considered a tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c20607-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The <i>New Jersey Anti-Eviction Act,</i> N.J. Stat. §§2A:18-61.1 to 2A:18-61.12, prohibits eviction of tenants unless the landlord can show good cause, as defined in the statute. Section 2A:18-61.1(m) allows eviction if the “landlord or owner conditioned the tenancy upon and in consideration for the tenant’s employment by the landlord or owner as superintendent, janitor or in some other capacity and such employment is being terminated.”]</p>
<p id="c5c20608-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The initial question is whether the Legislature intended to include migrant farmworkers in the phrase “in some other capacity” in N.J. Stat. §2A:18-61.1(m). Where general words follow a specific enumeration, the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i> requires that the general words are applicable only to the same class of things already mentioned. In N.J. Stat. §2A:18-61.1(m), the general words “in some other capacity” follow the specific enumeration of “superintendent” and “janitor.” We determine that, within the meaning of the statute, a farmworker does not belong to the same class of employees as a janitor or superintendent. A farmworker who possesses a mattress and locker in an unpartitioned barracks while waiting to be sent to work on a farm is <span title="820" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-820">p. 820</span>different from a superintendent or janitor residing with his or her family in an apartment house. The farmworkers are all men who come from Puerto Rico without their families. They live in large barracks with no privacy, sleeping in bunks in an unpartitioned room and sharing toilets and showers. Their occupancy of the barracks is intermittent, since it is a base camp for use while they are awaiting assignment to farms.</p>
<p id="c5c20609-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis of the words of the statute, the absence of any illuminating legislative history, and the application of principles of statutory construction lead to the conclusion that a migrant farmworker is not a tenant within the meaning of N.J. Stat. §2A:18-61.1(m). The special characteristics of migrant workers’ housing, the absence of a contractual provision for the payment of rent, the lack of privacy, the intermittent occupancy, and the interdependence of employment and housing support this conclusion.</p>
<p id="c5c2060a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5c2060b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In ascertaining whether a farmworker is entitled to notice before dispossession, we turn next to the Glassboro contract. [T]he contract resulted from negotiations between the Puerto Rican Department of Labor and Glassboro. No migrant farmworker participated directly or through a labor union in the negotiations. The record does not demonstrate whether or not the Puerto Rican Department of Labor has the same interests as the migrant farmworkers. The Puerto Rican Department of Labor may have been concerned also about reducing unemployment in Puerto Rico by finding jobs for its residents on farms in New Jersey. Whatever the interests of the parties to the negotiations, a migrant farmworker was required to accept the contract as presented by Glassboro.</p>
<p id="c5c2060c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The contract in evidence is written in English. Although Vásquez spoke Spanish only, the record does not show that he received a Spanish translation of the contract. Nonetheless, he signed a copy of the contract.</p>
<p id="c5c2060d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a migrant farmworker came to Glassboro’s labor camp in New Jersey, he depended on Glassboro for employment, transportation, food, and housing. He was separated by over 1300 miles from his home and family. Although an American citizen, he was isolated from most citizens in New Jersey by his inability to speak English. An invisible barrier separated a migrant farmworker from the rest of the State as he was shuttled from the labor camp to the farms. The lack of alternative housing emphasized the inequality between Glassboro and the migrant farmworkers. Once his employment ended, a farmworker lost not only his job but his shelter. The fear of discharge, and with it the loss of income, housing, and return passage to Puerto Rico permeated the contractual relationship. This is the setting in which we measure the contract against the public policy of the State.</p>
<p id="c5c2060e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Public policy eludes precise definition and may have diverse meanings in different contexts. The sources of public policy include federal and state legislation and judicial decisions.</p>
<p id="c5c2060f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the past, courts in New Jersey have refused to enforce contracts that violate the public policy of the State. No contract can be sustained if it is inconsistent with the public interest or detrimental to the common good. Contracts have been declared <span title="821" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-821">p. 821</span>invalid because they violate statutes, promote crime, interfere with the administration of justice, encourage divorce, violate public morality, or restrain trade. With respect to employment contracts that have an otherwise lawful purpose, courts have afforded judicial sanction to post-employment restrictive covenants only to the extent that the covenants are reasonable and comport with public policy.</p>
<p id="c5c20610-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts and Legislature of New Jersey have demonstrated a progressive attitude in providing legal protection for migrant farmworkers. [The state legislature has passed legislation regulating housing conditions and sanitation for migrant farmworkers. In 1979, the federal government, pursuant to the <i>Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970</i>, 29 U.S.C. §651 <i>et seq.</i>, assumed responsibility for inspection of many migrant labor camps.] The constant attention accorded by Congress and the State Legislature demonstrates a legislative concern for the well-being of migrant farmworkers.</p>
<p id="c5c22d21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>State v. Shack</i>, 277 A.2d 369 (N.J. 1971), this Court reversed convictions for trespass of a fieldworker and an attorney for organizations providing services for migrant farmworkers. Declining to characterize the migrant farmworker as either tenant or employee, Chief Justice Weintraub wrote:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c22d22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no profit in trying to decide upon a conventional category and then forcing the present subject into it. That approach would be artificial and distorting. The quest is for a fair adjustment of the competing needs of the parties, in the light of the realities of the relationship between the migrant worker and the operator of the housing facility. 277 A.2d at 374.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c22d23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court weighed the property rights of the farmer against the rights of the farmworkers to information and services and found that the balance tipped in favor of the farmworker. Underlying that conclusion was recognition of the fundamental right of the farmworker to live with dignity. As in <i>Shack</i>, the appropriate result in this case arises from the status and the relationship of the parties.</p>
<p id="c5c22d24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The enlightened approach of the courts and the Legislature provides the context in which we assess the Glassboro contract and consider how a migrant farmworker should be dispossessed from his living quarters at a labor camp.</p>
<p id="c5c22d25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A basic tenet of the law of contracts is that courts should enforce contracts as made by the parties. However, application of that principle assumes that the parties are in positions of relative equality and that their consent is freely given. In recent years, courts have become increasingly sensitive to overreaching in contracts where there is an inequality in the status of the parties.</p>
<p id="c5c22d26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a variety of situations, courts have revised contracts where there was an inequality in the bargaining power of the parties. The principle has been applied also to leases. In <i>Kuzmiak v. Brookchester</i>, 111 A.2d 425 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1955), the court invalidated a clause in an apartment lease exculpating a landlord from liability for negligence. More recently the inequality of bargaining power between landlord and tenant led this Court to comment that “lease agreements are frequently form contracts of adhesion.” <i>Trentacost v. Brussel</i>, 412 A.2d 436, 442 (N.J. 1980).</p>
<p id="c5c22d27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A migrant farmworker has even less bargaining power than a residential tenant. Although the contract did not require a migrant farmworker to live at the labor camp, <span title="822" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-822">p. 822</span>the realities of his employment forced him to stay at the camp. Residence at the labor camp benefited not only the farmworker, but also Glassboro and its member farmers. It was more convenient for them if the workers resided at the camp: the pool of labor was at hand, and the workers could be transported conveniently to the farms. The contract assured Glassboro that there would be a labor source available on its property.</p>
<p id="c5c22d28-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the contract, once a worker’s employment was ended, he had no right to stay at the camp. Glassboro’s possible need for the bed of a discharged farmworker, particularly during the growing season, is relevant, but not persuasive. In this case, Glassboro had ample space for Vásquez, yet he was turned out of the barracks on the same day he was fired. The interest of neither the migrant farmworker nor the public is served by casting the worker adrift to fend for himself without reasonable time to find shelter.</p>
<p id="c5c22d29-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The status of a worker seeking employment with Glassboro is analogous to that of a consumer who must accept a standardized form contract to purchase needed goods and services. Neither farmworkers nor consumers negotiate the terms of their contracts; both must accept the contracts as presented to them. In both instances, the contracts affect many people as well as the public interest.</p>
<p id="c5c22d2a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to a standardized form contract, the intention of the consumer has been described as “but a subjection more or less voluntary to terms dictated by the stronger party, terms whose consequences are often understood only in a vague way, if at all.” Kessler, <i>Contracts of Adhesion — Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract</i>, 43 Colum. L. Rev. 629, 632 (1943). A contract where one party, as here, must accept or reject the contract does not result from the consent of that party. It is a contract of adhesion:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c22d2b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There being no private consent to support a contract of adhesion, its legitimacy rests entirely on its compliance with standards in the public interest. The individual who is subject to the obligations imposed by a standard form thus gains the assurance that the rules to which he is subject have received his consent either directly or through their conforming to higher public laws and standards made and enforced by the public institutions that legitimately govern him. Slawson, <i>Standard Form Contracts and Democratic Control of Lawmaking Power</i>, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 529, 566 (1971).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c22d2c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The absence of a provision in the contract for reasonable time to find housing after termination of his employment bespeaks Glassboro’s superior bargaining position. Further, by failing to provide for a reasonable time to find alternative housing, the contract is inconsistent with the enlightened attitude of the Legislature and the courts towards migrant farmworkers.</p>
<p id="c5c22d2d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crux of this case thus becomes the unconscionability of the contract as it is sought to be enforced against the migrant workers. The unconscionability of the contract inheres not only in its failure to provide a worker with a reasonable opportunity to find alternative housing, but in its disregard for his welfare after termination of his employment. The inherent inequity of the contract arouses a sense of injustice and invokes the equitable powers of the courts. In the absence of any concern demonstrated for the worker in the contract, public policy requires the implication of a provision for a reasonable time to find alternative housing.</p>
<p id="c5c22d2e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="823" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-823">p. 823</span><i>IV</i></p>
<p id="c5c22d2f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, on termination of employment, an employer could dispossess an employee who occupied premises incidental to his employment. Similarly, a landlord could dispossess peaceably a holdover tenant. To that extent, both an employer and landlord could use self-help to regain possession peaceably. The advantage to them was that they were assured of prompt restoration of the use of their property. However, an inherent vice in self-help is that it can lead to confrontations and breaches of the peace. In the absence of self-help, a landlord or employer at common law was remitted to an action in ejectment. The problem with ejectment is that it was slow and expensive.</p>
<p id="c5c22d30-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With regard to real property occupied solely as a residence, the Legislature has resolved the dilemma by prohibiting entry without consent and by providing a summary dispossess proceeding. N.J. Stat. §2A:39-1 and N.J. Stat. §2A:18-53 <i>et seq.</i> Similarly, the Legislature has provided a summary dispossess proceeding for the removal of residential tenants. N.J. Stat. §2A:18-61.2. As explained above, migrant farmworkers are not tenants, and there is no comparable statute providing for their summary dispossession on termination of their employment. In fashioning a suitable remedy, we acknowledge that the realities of the relationship between the migrant worker and a farm labor service are unique and summon a judicial response unrestricted by conventional categories, such as employer-employee and landlord-tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c25441-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of a contractual provision or legislation addressing the plight of a migrant farmworker on termination of his employment, the courts, exercising equitable jurisdiction, should devise a remedy to fit the circumstances of each case. Depending on the circumstances, an equitable adjustment of the rights of the parties may vary from one case to another. An appropriate remedy might include time in addition to that implied in the contract, assistance in obtaining alternative housing, return passage to Puerto Rico, or some other form of relief. By abolishing self-help and requiring dispossession through a judicial proceeding, we provide a forum for an equitable resolution of a controversy between a farm labor service and a migrant farmworker on termination of the latter’s employment.</p>
<p id="c5c25442-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are mindful of the special considerations pertaining to migrant farmworkers and of the need for a prompt resolution of disputes between farmworkers and a farm labor service. In general, a summary action under [N.J. Rule 4:67] should be a more appropriate proceeding than a plenary action. In fact, the present case was instituted on complaint and order to show cause returnable three days later, at which time the court heard testimony, reserved decision, and rendered a written opinion seven days later. We conclude that a dispute concerning the dispossession of a migrant farmworker on termination of his employment, whether instituted by a farm labor service or, as here, by a farmworker, should proceed in a summary manner under [Rule] 4:67.</p>

Wright</i>, 620 N.Y.S.2d 363 (App. Div. 1994) (city entitled to use self-help to evict illegal occupants of city-owned property). If they refuse to leave, the owner may even use reasonable force. Owners used to be entitled to use self-help to remove tenants as well, and the law in some states still allows this, particularly for commercial tenants. <i>See Brown v. State Central Bank</i>, 459 F. Supp. 2d 837 (S.D. Iowa 2006) (commercial landlord permitted to retake possession by changing locks). However, today almost all states outlaw self-help in removing tenants, instead obligating landlords to use court proceedings (eviction) to recover possession.</p>
<p id="c5c25446-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Leases versus licenses and easements.</b> The question frequently arises whether an arrangement constitutes a lease or whether it is instead a license or an easement. This matters for purposes of determining whether a landlord may use self-help, but can be an issue in a much broader range of tenant statutory and common law rights. The characterization issue comes up in the context of department store and shopping mall concessions, students living in college dormitories, apartment complex managers and migrant farmworkers, and other contexts. Students living in dormitories and apartment managers living on the premises are explicitly exempted from the protections of the URLTA.<i> See</i> URLTA §1.202 (tenancy protections do not apply to residents at educational institutions or to “occupancy by an employee of a landlord whose right to occupancy is conditional upon employment in and about the premises”); <i>see also</i> RURLTA §103(c). Such residents will thus not be treated as tenants in those states that have adopted URLTA without modification on this point, <i>compare, e.g.</i>, Conn. Gen. Stat. §47a-2 (excluding the general exemption for employees in Connecticut’s version of URLTA), although, as <i>Vásquez</i> shows, they may have other legal protections. If no statute answers the question, these cases are generally decided by asking whether the owner has transferred exclusive “possession” of a defined space; if so, a lease will be found. If control of a particular space is not granted, or such possession is not exclusive, a license is likely to be found. <i>Millennium Park Joint Venture, LLC v. Houlihan</i>, 948 N.E.2d 1, 18-21 (Ill. 2010). However, the cases are split, with some courts finding leases and other courts finding mere licenses.</p>
<p id="c5c25447-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have reached differing results in the case of <i>students</i> in dormitories, in part depending on the nature of the claim at issue. <i>Compare Burch v. University of Kansas</i>, 756 P.2d 431 (Kan. 1988), <i>and Rhaney v. University of Maryland, Eastern Shores</i>, 880 A.2d 357, 367 (Md. 2005) (both holding that students in dormitories are tenants for purposes of analyzing universities’ tort liability as landlords), <i>with Houle v. Adams State College</i>, 547 P.2d 926 (Colo. 1976), <i>and Cook v. University Plaza</i>, 427 N.E.2d 405 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981) (both holding that universities are not landlords in the context of security deposit requirements). In the case of <i>employees</i>, such as migrant farmworkers and apartment building managers, the cases focus on determining whether access to the apartment seems to be part of the employment relationship and intended to last only as long as the employee remains on the job. It also matters whether the employer/landlord has a particular space reserved for employees and if occupancy by a nonemployee would interfere with the owner’s ability to provide the services that the <span title="825" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-825">p. 825</span>employee renders. <i>Compare GENC Realty LLC v. Nezaj</i>, 860 N.Y.S.2d 106 (App. Div. 2008), <i>with Bigelow v. Bullard</i>, 901 P.2d 630 (Nev. 1995) (superintendent is a tenant). <i>Compare De Bruyn Produce Co. v. Romero</i>, 508 N.W.2d 150 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993) (migrant farmworkers are licensees, not tenants), <i>with State v. DeCoster</i>, 653 A.2d 891 (Me. 1995) (migrant farmworkers are tenants).</p>
<p id="c5c25448-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should the courts distinguish between licenses and leases? In <i>Keller v. Southwood North Medical Pavilion, Inc.</i>, 959 P.2d 102 (Utah 1998), a chiropractor leased space in a shopping center pursuant to a written agreement that included the right to place a sign on a large monument located near the street. Most of the signs on the monument were small brass plaques advertising various tenants’ services, but the landlord allowed the chiropractor to put up a larger sign in exchange for additional consideration. When the landlord sold the shopping center, the new owner objected to the appearance of the chiropractor’s sign and removed it. The chiropractor claimed that the new owner violated the state forcible entry statute, which required landlords to use court eviction proceedings rather than self-help to recover possession of property from tenants. The court, however, found that the chiropractor only had a license, not a lease subject to the statute, because the agreement did not transfer exclusive possession of any part of the monument and did not identify any particular space on the monument that the chiropractor had a right to occupy. Does the court’s focus on possession make sense? Or should it instead focus on the policies underlying the prohibition on landlord self-help? We discuss those policies in §3.1, below.</p>
<p id="c5c25449-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Vásquez</i> court avoided the abstract question whether the farm owner had granted “possession” to the farmworkers or whether they had the status of “tenants.” In effect, the court ruled that the farmworkers were entitled to protection even if they were not tenants and even if the statutory procedures did not apply to them. Was this a good idea? Was it justified? Could the legislature have intended to allow owners to engage in self-help in cases not covered by the summary process law? <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> City of New York v. Utsey</i>, 714 N.Y.S.2d 410 (App. Div. 2000) (governmental owner may be obligated to use eviction proceedings against long-term squatters whose initial occupancy was nonpermissive if the owner acquiesced in their occupancy in a manner that demonstrates an intent to treat them as tenants at will).</p>
<p id="c5c2544a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Contract language.</b> Could the issue of the character of the property interest be avoided if the parties had a written agreement? The answer depends in part on whether the policy outlawing self-help is disclaimable. If it is, then there should be no problem with the parties agreeing to call their arrangement a license, under which the licensee can be removed at will without court eviction proceedings. If it is not, then the language cannot be determinative. The cases are not uniform. Courts have interpreted “lease” arrangements as licenses and “license” arrangements as leases. <i>Compare Halley v. Harden Oil Co.</i>, 357 S.E.2d 138 (Ga. Ct. App. 1987) (although contract stated that it was a “lease,” owner retained possession, use, and responsibility for maintenance of property and thus was merely a license), <i>and Loren v. Marry</i>, 600 N.Y.S.2d 369 (App. Div. 1993) (same), <i>with Dargis v. Paradise Park, Inc.</i>, 819 N.E.2d 1220 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004), <i>and M &amp; I First National Bank v. Episcopal Homes Management, Inc.</i>, <span title="826" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-826">p. 826</span>536 N.W.2d 175 (Wis.

<p id="c5c2544b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Freedom of contract, unequal bargaining power, and minimum standards.</b> Landlord/tenant relationships arise from voluntary agreements between landowners and those who seek access to their land. When the agreement is ambiguous, courts must interpret the agreement to determine its terms. However, contracts involve a second, distinct issue; some contracts are illegal and some contract terms are mandatory. Statutes, regulations, and common law may, for example, require eviction procedures to remove an occupant of land, whether or not the agreement between the parties provides for this. When should contracts contain mandatory terms?</p>
<p id="c5c2544c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One view is that contracts should be regulated when the parties have <b>unequal bargaining power</b>. Robert Hale argued that individuals may be forced to agree to onerous contract terms if they have no reasonable alternative. They may have little market power because of their poverty, lack of marketable skills, or substantial competition from others seeking similar entitlements. “[B]y judicious legal limitation on the bargaining power of the economically and legally stronger, it is conceivable that the economically weak would acquire greater freedom of contract than they now have — freedom to resist more effectively the bargaining power of the strong, and to obtain better terms.” Robert Hale, <i>Bargaining, Duress, and Economic Liberty</i>, 43 Colum. L. Rev. 603, 628 (1943). If the law prohibits certain onerous contract terms, then potential tenants will be protected from them. For example, tenants will know that, if they obtain rental housing, they cannot be evicted without court proceedings to determine whether the landlord has a right to recover possession and to ensure that the tenants have time to move. Tenants and landlords may have unequal bargaining power because housing is a necessity and because of structural disparities between landlords and tenants associated with the fact that landlords own real property and tenants do not; in addition, landlords often collude by using form leases drafted by real estate associations that include terms favorable to landlords.</p>
<p id="c5c2544d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, this view has been criticized because it fails to recognize that landlords can respond to regulations either by raising the rent, changing other terms of the contract, or withdrawing from the market altogether — all of which arguably hurt the very people we hoped to help by the regulation in the first place. Thus, a second view is that contracts should hardly ever be regulated by the state; the ideal of <b>freedom of contract</b> is based on the notion that the parties should be free to make whatever arrangements suit their purposes. Limitation on freedom of contract arguably both interferes with individual autonomy and is inefficient because it makes both parties worse off in their own terms. Professor Alan Schwartz argues that “just outcomes arise when people are permitted to do the best they can, given their circumstances. This is because, the theory goes, people are the best judges of what maximizes their own utility; hence, allowing them to make unrestrained choices is most likely to maximize utility for the individual and for society as a whole.” Alan Schwartz, <i>Justice and the Law of Contracts: A Case for the Traditional Approach</i>, 9 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Poly. 107, 107 (1986). This means that people should be free to contract on any terms they like. <span title="827" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-827">p. 827</span>Nor should we worry about unfair contract terms because “competition in markets prevents even very large firms from exploiting even very small consumers.” <i>Id.</i> at 109. Moreover, regulating contract terms arguably hurts the very people we are trying to protect. Schwartz explains that “not enforcing contract clauses . . . tends to make people poorer rather than richer.” <i>Id.</i> at 115. He continues:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c27b5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To make a person poorer is meant here to shrink the number of options a person has available to improve his or her lot in life. Suppose a judge bans a contract clause. He has imposed a restriction on the choices available to persons who agreed to it or would have agreed to it in preference to other contract clauses that firms could offer. Poor people tend to have fewer choices than rich people because they have less money. Poor people do have free will, however. If a judge bans a contract clause on the ostensible ground of protecting the poor, the judge actually is reducing the choices of poor people and is therefore preventing poor people from doing as well as they can, given their circumstances, in the realm of contractual choice.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c27b5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A third view is that contracts should be regulated to ensure that they comply with <b>minimum standards</b> compatible with the legal framework of a free and democratic society. Joseph William Singer, <i>Things That We Would Like to Take for Granted: Minimum Standards for the Legal Framework of a Free and Democratic Society</i>, 2 Harv. L. &amp; Poly. Rev. 139 (2008). All contracts are regulated by state or federal law in some respect. Some of these regulations ensure that contracts do not violate public policy and that they are consistent with basic standards of decency in social relationships in a just society. Other regulations take the form of <b>consumer protection laws</b> that ensure that products (including housing) are safe and meet the legitimate expectations of purchasers. On this view, freedom of contract is an important norm, but it takes place within boundaries established by minimum standards regulations. If such regulations make housing too expensive for the very poorest persons, then the appropriate remedy is not to deregulate but to adopt other means either to increase their bargaining power or to provide affordable and safe housing.</p>

<p id="c5c27b69-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Across a number of areas, the phenomenon often referred to as the “sharing economy” has become increasingly common in recent years, with notable examples that include ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft and companies such as Airbnb and HomeAway that allow people to find short-term stays in people’s homes. The general model across sectors involves an on-line “platform” that pairs people with some surplus to offer (space in a car, a room in an apartment, time for short-term work) with people in need of that resource. The sharing economy has many proponents who tout its potential to reduce the ecological footprint of consumer spending as well as the social promise of “collaborative consumption,” <i>see</i> Janelle Orsi, <i>Practicing Law in the Sharing Economy</i> (ABA 2012), but has also sparked controversy for undermining consumer welfare regulation and weakening labor and employment rights. <i>See generally</i> Orly Lobel, <i>The Law of the Platform</i>, 101 Minn.

<p id="c5c27b6e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to understand the context in which landlord-tenant litigation tends to occur. Many disputes arise because either the landlord has interfered with the tenant’s possession or what is known as “quiet enjoyment” of the property or the tenant has breached his obligation to pay rent — or both. This chapter addresses these issues in this and the next two sections.</p>
<p id="c5c27b6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a landlord asserts a claim against a tenant based on the tenant’s failure to pay rent or on some claimed breach of the lease agreement, the landlord may seek either (or both) (a) payment of <b>back rent</b> the tenant owes, or (b) <b>possession</b> of the premises (otherwise known as <b>eviction</b>). The landlord may also make a claim for <b>damages</b> resulting from the tenant’s breach — for example, the cost of repairing facilities damaged by the tenant. The tenant may answer each of these claims by denying that he has breached the lease (he has in fact paid the rent or he did not cause the damage). Or he may raise <b>defenses</b> to these claims, admitting that he stopped paying rent but asserting that he was entitled to do so because the landlord breached the agreement first.</p>
<p id="c5c2a180-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to a lawsuit by the landlord, the tenant may also be able to make <b>counterclaims</b> against the landlord. These may include claims for <b>damages</b> resulting from the landlord’s breach of the lease, and courts may order a rent <b>abatement</b> (a reduction in rent) owed for the period during the breach. Some courts will also allow the tenant to recover damages if the landlord acted negligently and physical harm resulted to the tenant or an invitee on the premises; such damages also may exceed the rental value of the premises. The tenant may petition for <b>injunctive</b> relief, such as an order to the landlord to fix the apartment to comply with the local housing code.</p>
<p id="c5c2a181-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenants may also sue the landlord initially with the tenant’s claims. Such lawsuits ordinarily ask for either (a) damages resulting from the landlord’s breach, such as a failure to maintain the premises, or compensation, for example, for injuries resulting from the landlord’s failure to comply with the housing code, or (b) an injunction ordering the landlord to fix the apartment to comply with the terms of the lease or the housing code.</p>

<p id="c5c2a185-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the current majority rule, the landlord has the duty to deliver possession of the rented premises to the tenant at the beginning of the leasehold. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §6.2 (1977); URLTA §§2.103, 4.102; <i>see also</i> RURLTA §§301, 405. If a prior tenant wrongfully holds over after his lease term expires, the landlord has an obligation in most jurisdictions to remove the prior tenant within a reasonable period of time by either instituting eviction proceedings or convincing the holdover tenant to leave. Failure to deliver actual possession of the premises to the new tenant constitutes a breach of the lease by the landlord. The tenant who has been shut out may either terminate the lease and recover damages as compensation for having to find another place to live or affirm the lease, withhold rent for the period during which she could not occupy the premises, and recover damages for the cost of temporarily renting alternative housing while the landlord undertakes eviction proceedings to remove the prior tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c2a186-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A minority of jurisdictions follow the traditional rule, under which the landlord has only the duty to deliver the <i>right</i> to possession but no duty to deliver <i>actual</i> possession. In those states, it is the new tenant’s responsibility to evict the holdover tenant by bringing ejectment or other appropriate proceedings. Since the landlord is not in default under the minority rule, the new tenant is legally obligated to pay the rent even though she is not in possession. The new tenant’s remedy is to go after the holdover tenant for damages.</p>

<p id="c5c2c8b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Use restrictions.</b> Many residential leases, in addition to addressing waste and nuisance, limit the use of the premises to “residential purposes” or similar terms, and questions can arise about whether home businesses violate these restrictions. As with similar covenants in the context of common interest communities, courts often read residential use restrictions in leases narrowly, although some courts have found a breach for substantial businesses. <i>See Park West Village v. Lewis</i>, 465 N.E.2d 844 (N.Y. 1984) (tenant in breach where she conducted a professional counseling practice out of an apartment rented for residential purposes).</p>
<p id="c5c2c8b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In commercial and retail leases, particularly those involving multiple tenants in office buildings and shopping centers, restrictions on the use to which tenants can put the property are quite common and can regulate the nature of a tenant’s use in detail. Can you see why?</p>
<p id="c5c2c8b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Covenants to operate.</b> Tenants may also be <b>affirmatively obligated</b> in some circumstances to continue a use contemplated in a lease. In <i>The College Block v. Atlantic Richfield Co.</i>, 254 Cal. Rptr. 179 (Ct. App. 1988), a company signed a 20-year lease for land on which it agreed to build and operate a gas station. Rent was set as a percentage of gasoline delivered, with a $1,000 monthly base amount. After operating for 17 years, the company closed the service station, but continued to pay the monthly minimum of $1,000 per month due under the lease. The landlord sued for damages, <span title="833" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-833">p. 833</span>seeking the amount it asserted it would have received had the station remained in business. Despite the absence of an express provision in the lease on point, the court found that a covenant of continued operation could be implied because the bulk of the contemplated rent was to have come from operations, and remanded for a finding as to whether the base rent was substantial and provided a fair return on the landlord’s investment.</p>
<p id="c5c2c8ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts refuse to interpret percentage leases to find an implied covenant to operate a business continuously if the base rent is substantial. If the base rent is nominal or is much less than the fair rental value of the premises, most courts will take the approach suggested in <i>The College Block</i> and find such an implied covenant. Is an implied duty to operate likely to be more consistent or less consistent with the actual intent of the parties at the time they contracted? Should commercial tenants be exempt from implied obligations on the grounds that commercial landlords are sufficiently sophisticated and can adequately protect themselves by including an explicit covenant to operate in their leases? Should the result depend on whether the tenant had a right to sublet or assign the lease? Why? Does a negatively phrased obligation not to use the premises for anything other than a specific purpose, such as a restaurant, imply an affirmative duty to operate? What result best promotes the efficient use of property? Most likely reflects the intent of the parties?</p>
<p id="c5c2c8bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts generally will enforce express covenants to operate. However, they will not force an unprofitable business to operate and are very likely to deny injunctive relief ordering the tenant to continue operating, relegating the landlord to damages on the ground that damages are an adequate remedy for the tenant’s breach and because judges are not competent to manage the tenant’s business operations to ensure compliance with the operating covenant. <i>Summit Town Center, Inc. v. Shoe Show of Rocky Mount, Inc</i>., 828 A.2d 995 (Pa. 2003) (enforcing an express covenant to operate by a damages remedy and denying injunctive relief).</p>

Anchor stores.</b> Many shopping centers include large “anchor stores” that are intended to attract large numbers of patrons and to serve as a draw to the shopping center that would enable smaller stores there to attract customers.

<p id="c5c2c8bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Columbia East Associates v. Bi-Lo, Inc.</i>, 386 S.E.2d 259 (S.C. Ct. App. 1989), the court held that it did have such an obligation despite the absence of any affirmative obligation to that effect in the lease. Defendant Bi-Lo, a popular supermarket chain, leased space in the center of plaintiff’s shopping center for a term of 20 years. The lease provided that the leased premises “shall be used only for the operation of a supermarket (for the sale of groceries, meats and/or other items generally sold by supermarkets).” When another supermarket in an adjacent shopping center closed, Bi-Lo took the opportunity to take over the space because it could thereby “eliminat[e] the competitor and [prevent another] competitor from taking over the [space].” <i>Id</i>. at 261. Although it had a right to sublet the original site, Bi-Lo failed to obtain a subtenant and made only minimal efforts to do so. Instead, it continued to pay the agreed-upon fixed rent, which did not include a percentage rent. Bi-Lo argued that, under the terms <span title="834" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-834">p. 834</span>of the lease, it could vacate the premises and leave the store empty so long as it continued to pay rent. The landlord, Columbia East, argued that Bi-Lo was required either to operate a supermarket or to sublet to another for operation of a retail store. The court noted that Bi-Lo was an anchor tenant whose presence in the shopping center was intended by the landlord to bring customers to the smaller shops. Allowing Bi-Lo to leave without an adequate replacement would defeat the landlord’s purpose in agreeing to the lease. The court held that the lease contained an implied obligation of good faith and that this encompassed a requirement of continuous operation on an anchor store even in the absence of a percentage rent agreement. Bi-Lo breached its lease by ceasing operations and by failing to make reasonable efforts to find a subtenant. Chief Judge Sanders concurred on the ground that Bi-Lo had breached the lease by using the premises not for operation of a supermarket but “for a purpose not allowed by the lease; namely, as part of a scheme to stifle competition.” <i>Id</i>. at 263.</p>
<p id="c5c2c8be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, some other courts have disagreed with this result. For example, in <i>Oakwood Village LLC v. Albertsons, Inc.</i>, 104 P.3d 1226 (Utah 2004), the Utah Supreme Court refused to find an implied covenant of continuous operation in circumstances somewhat similar to those in <i>Bi-Lo.</i> Despite the fact that the landlord had leased the ground to the anchor tenant (which built its own store) for up to 65 years at a very low rent, which did not rise over time, the lease did not impose any obligations on the tenant who closed the store after 21 years of operation and moved to another location nearby, leaving the other 25 stores in the center without the benefit of the anchor’s business. The court refused to imply a covenant of operation either from the nominal rent or the potential 65-year duration. It focused on the fact that the lease did not have a percentage rent term and that the tenant had built its own store. It was not clear why the landlord gave a ground lease for such a low rent, but the court concluded that, if this was a bad deal, the landlord had to live with it. Moreover, the tenant had the right to sublet or assign the premises without the landlord’s consent. Nor did the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing suggest imposing obligations that could not be inferred from the language of the lease. The court concluded:</p>

The tenant, whose lease stated that it “shall use the premises for the operation of a restaurant facility and for no other purpose without first obtaining the written consent of Lessor,” subsequently changed its operation from offering a full-service dinner menu to a limited offering of soup, salad, and sandwiches to walk-in customers only. Gross sales fell dramatically. The base rent was $825 per month, and the court assumed that this amount was substantial. However, the percentage rent (5 percent of gross sales) was also substantial, rising from $2,500 in 1978 to $18,752 in 1981 and a total of $36,230 for 1986. Eventually, the tenant closed the restaurant entirely but continued to pay the base rent of $825 per month for the remainder of the lease term.

<p id="c5c2efd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord has the right to transfer her property interest. What happens if the landlord sells the property or it is inherited by the landlord’s heirs? The new owner receives what the landlord was able to sell or give, that is, the landlord’s reversion subject to the tenant’s leasehold.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104EA_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104EA_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> The new owner also receives the attendant contractual rights to collect rent and to enforce the other terms of the lease. The new owner, however, does not obtain an immediate right to possess the property; the tenant’s leasehold interest survives. The new owner, of course, may end a month-to-month tenancy, just as the prior landlord could have done, but if the tenant has six months left on a one-year lease, the new owner is obligated to honor the tenant’s remaining six-month possessory right. The landlord’s interest may also end through equitable division of property on divorce. Because property is reallocated between the parties on divorce, a building owned partly or wholly by a husband may be granted to the wife upon divorce. Such cases are treated like sales of the property and the leases survive.</p>
<p id="c5c2efd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if the property was mortgaged and the landlord fails to make the mortgage payments and loses the property through foreclosure? The answer depends on whether the lease or mortgage was established first. If the landlord leased the property to the tenant and then borrowed money subject to a mortgage on the building, the lease generally takes priority since it was first in time. However, if the property is subject to a mortgage and the lease follows, the mortgage takes priority. The mortgage <span title="836" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-836">p. 836</span>gives the lender the power to force a sale of the property to recoup the unpaid loan; tenants who rent such properties take their apartments subject to the prior mortgage. Thus, in the absence of statute to the contrary, when the landlord’s title ends through foreclosure, so does the tenant’s lease. A similar situation obtains with a life estate. If the landlord owns the property for life and leases it to the tenant, then the landlord’s interest ends when the landlord dies; since you can only convey what you own, and the landlord did not own the right to lease the property after her death, the tenant’s lease ends automatically when the landlord dies.</p>
<p id="c5c2efda-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis that began around 2008 led to many tenants facing eviction after foreclosure, even though the tenants were faithfully paying the rent, because their leases were entered into after the mortgage that gave rise to the foreclosure. Many banks following foreclosure immediately evict the tenants because they believe it is easier to sell property that is vacant than property that is inhabited. These tenants complain that although the landlord may have defaulted on the mortgage payments to the bank, the tenants had been paying their lease payments faithfully and should not suffer because of the landlord’s default. <i>See generally</i> Creola Johnson, <i>Renters Evicted en Masse: Collateral Damage Arising from the Subprime Foreclosure Crisis</i>, 62 Fla.

No. 111-22, 123 Stat. 1660, codified as 12 U.S.C. §5220, note, gave tenants some protection, although the statute expired at the end of 2014. A number of state and local governments have responded to the impact of the foreclosure crisis on tenants with their own legislation. These statutes vary significantly, but some examples of their scope include requirements that tenants receive notice of foreclosure, see, e.g., N.J. Ct. R. 4:65-1-4:65-2, as amended by N.J. Orders 2009-37; mandates that tenants receive notice of the identity of the new owner, which responds to the problem of tenants following foreclosure not knowing where to send their rent and then facing nonpayment evictions, see, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code §1962, amended by AB 1953; and provisions that tenants in units acquired through foreclosure can only be evicted for good cause, with foreclosure itself not constituting good cause, see Los Angeles Municipal Code ch.

When the grocery store opens, the drug store tenant complains to the new owner of the shopping center, who responds that the grocery store does not violate the non-competition provision and, even if it does, the violation occurred before the sale, so it was the original owner’s responsibility.

Would the situation be different if the lease obligated the landlord to provide financial statements at the end of every year detailing each tenant’s charges for common areas in the shopping center, and the year before the transfer, the original owner failed to meet this obligation?</p>

<p id="c5c316f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A <b>sublease</b> generally refers to a transfer by a tenant of a portion of its possessory rights under the lease; by contrast, an <b>assignment</b> generally refers to the transfer of the tenant’s entire possessory rights.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c316f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The tenant’s right to transfer.</b> A tenant can generally transfer all or a portion of her possessory interest in the premises unless the lease specifically limits this right. The tenant can do so through an <b>assignment</b> or through a <b>sublease</b>, or sublet. An assignment generally conveys <i>all</i> the tenant’s remaining property interests without retaining any future rights to enter the property; under a sublease, the tenant retains some future interest or the right to control the property in the future. A sublease exists, for example, if a tenant has six months remaining on the lease and transfers possession of the apartment to someone else for four months. Since the tenant retains the right to regain possession for the last two months of the term of years, the transfer is a sublease rather than an assignment. A sublease may also exist if the tenant retains a right of entry that can be exercised if the subtenant violates one or more of the terms of the sublease agreement.</p>
<p id="c5c316f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although restraints on alienation of fee interests are generally void, a “no subletting” or “no assignment” clause in a lease agreement is generally enforceable, and violation of the prohibition on assignment will entitle the landlord to evict the tenant for breaching a material term of the lease contract. Cal. Civ. Code §1995.230 (“A restriction on transfer of a tenant’s interest in a lease may absolutely prohibit transfer.”); <i>Carma Development (California), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc.</i>, 826 P.2d 710, 717-718 (Cal. 1992). Such a clause protects the landlord from being forced to accept a substitute tenant who may be less creditworthy. For the tenant, a clause prohibiting subletting may limit her ability to get out of the lease and move elsewhere.</p>
<p id="c5c316f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In limiting sublets or assignments, leases sometimes use the general term “sublet” when what is really meant is “sublet or assign.” Traditional doctrine held that, in order to promote the alienability of leaseholds, a lease that limits subletting but not assigning will be strictly construed to limit only subletting. However, the modern trend is to focus on the intent of the parties; since modern usage sometimes employs the term “subletting” to mean any transfers of the leasehold interest, a clause that provides for “no subletting” may very well be interpreted to prohibit subletting <i>or</i> assigning.</p>
<p id="c5c316f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Why it matters whether the transfer is an assignment or a sublease.</b> Why is it important to know whether the arrangement is a sublease or an assignment? Traditionally, under an assignment, the new tenant — called the assignee — is responsible directly to the landlord for all the undertakings under the original lease. In other words, the tenant’s covenants — including the covenant to pay rent and other covenants in the lease agreement — run with the land. The landlord and the assignee are not in <b>privity of contract</b> since they did not reach an agreement with each other. Since the original tenant has given up all interest in the property, however, the landlord and the assignee are thought to share interests in the property; they are therefore in <b>privity of estate</b>, which makes the assignee directly liable to the landlord for the covenants made by the original tenant to the landlord. It also makes the landlord liable to the assignee for breach of the landlord’s covenants, such as the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which we will discuss below.</p>
<p id="c5c316f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="838" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-838">p. 838</span>In contrast, under a sublease, the lease covenants do <i>not</i> run with the land as <b>real covenants</b>. The landlord has no right to sue the subtenant to enforce any of the covenants in the original lease, including the covenant to pay rent, if the requested relief is damages. The only exception is when the subtenant expressly promises the tenant to pay the rent to the landlord. In that case, the landlord may be able to sue the subtenant as a <b>third-party beneficiary</b> of the contract made between the tenant and subtenant; in other words, the landlord is the intended beneficiary of the subtenant’s promise to the tenant. However, lease covenants probably <i>can</i> be enforced by injunction as equitable servitudes, so long as the subtenant has notice of them. Is the subtenant bound if she has not seen the original lease and that lease is not recorded? The courts are likely to find the subtenant on inquiry notice of the covenants in the original lease; the reasonable subtenant would inquire whether the tenant had made promises to the landlord restricting use of the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c316f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficult question is whether the landlord can sue the subtenant for an injunction ordering the subtenant to comply with the covenant to pay rent. Some courts will not grant an injunction since the payment of rent is a money payment and resembles the payment of damages. Others grant an injunction because it constitutes enforcement of an affirmative covenant, even though that covenant requires the payment of money.</p>
<p id="c5c316fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If an assignee fails to pay the rent, the landlord may sue the original tenant for the unpaid rent because the original tenant remains in a contractual relationship with the landlord, which the assignment does not relieve. But the landlord may instead choose to sue the assignee directly for the unpaid rent. Since the covenant to pay rent runs with the land, the assignee is directly liable to the landlord for the unpaid rent. In a sublet, however, the landlord can only sue the original tenant (who remains contractually bound to pay the rent). Note, however, that, in a sublet, if neither the tenant nor the subtenant pays the rent, the landlord can evict the tenant (sue for possession from the tenant) and end the leasehold, thereby terminating the subtenant’s right of possession. In either case, if the landlord chooses to sue the original tenant for the rent, the original tenant has a right to be reimbursed by the new tenant for the amount owed to the landlord.</p>
<p id="c5c316fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tenant may choose to sublet for a rental amount different from the amount owed to the landlord. Whether the new rent is less or more than the original rent, the tenant remains liable only for the original amount to the landlord. Thus, if the subtenant is paying less than the rent owed to the landlord, the tenant must make up the difference. If the subtenant is paying more than the rent owed to the landlord, the tenant subtenant is allowed to keep the difference.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1057D_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1057D_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span></p>
<p id="c5c316fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Landlord consent.</b> Many leases provide for subletting or assignment only with the landlord’s consent.

The question we address is whether, in the absence of a provision that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld, a lessor may unreasonably and arbitrarily withhold his or her consent to an assignment. This is a question of first impression in this court.</p>
<p id="c5c33e18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I</i></p>
<p id="c5c33e19-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease at issue is for 14,400 square feet of hangar space at the San Jose Municipal Airport. The City of San Jose, as owner of the property, leased it to Irving and Janice Perlitch, who in turn assigned their interest to respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Prior to assigning their interest to respondent, the Perlitches entered into a 25-year sublease with one Robert Bixler commencing on January 1, 1970. The sublease covered an original five-year term plus four 5-year options to renew. The rental rate was to be increased every 10 years in the same proportion as rents increased on the master lease from the City of San Jose. The premises were to be used by Bixler for the purpose of conducting an airplane maintenance business.</p>
<p id="c5c33e1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bixler conducted such a business under the name “Flight Services” until, in 1981, he agreed to sell the business to appellants Jack Kendall, Grady O’Hara and Vicki O’Hara. The proposed sale included the business and the equipment, inventory and improvements on the property, together with the existing lease. The proposed assignees had a stronger financial statement and greater net worth than the current lessee, Bixler, and they were willing to be bound by the terms of the lease.</p>
<p id="c5c33e1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The lease provided that written consent of the lessor was required before the lessee could assign his interest, and that failure to obtain such consent rendered the lease voidable at the option of the lessor. Accordingly, Bixler requested consent from <span title="840" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-840">p. 840</span>the Perlitches’ successor-in-interest, respondent Ernest Pestana, Inc. Respondent refused to consent to the assignment and maintained that it had an absolute right arbitrarily to refuse any such request. The complaint recites that respondent demanded “increased rent and other more onerous terms” as a condition of consenting to Bixler’s transfer of interest.</p>
<p id="c5c33e1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proposed assignees brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration “that the refusal of Ernest Pestana, Inc. to consent to the assignment of the lease is unreasonable and is an unlawful restraint on the freedom of alienation.”</p>
<p id="c5c33e1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5c33e1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law generally favors free alienability of property, and California follows the common law rule that a leasehold interest is freely alienable. Contractual restrictions on the alienability of leasehold interests are, however, permitted. “Such restrictions are justified as reasonable protection of the interests of the lessor as to who shall possess and manage property in which he has a reversionary interest and from which he is deriving income.” Schoshinski, <i>American Law of Landlord and Tenant</i> §815, at 578-79 (1980).</p>
<p id="c5c33e1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law’s hostility toward restraints on alienation has caused such restraints on leasehold interests to be strictly construed against the lessor.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105FA_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N105FA_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> This is particularly true where the restraint in question is a “forfeiture restraint,” under which the lessor has the option to terminate the lease if an assignment is made without his or her consent.</p>
<p id="c5c36531-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, a majority of jurisdictions have long adhered to the rule that where a lease contains an approval clause (a clause stating that the lease cannot be assigned without the prior consent of the lessor), the lessor may arbitrarily refuse to approve a proposed assignee no matter how suitable the assignee appears to be and no matter how unreasonable the lessor’s objection. The harsh consequences of this rule have often been avoided through application of the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, under which the lessor may be found to have waived (or be estopped from asserting) the right to refuse consent to assignment.</p>
<p id="c5c36532-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional majority rule has come under steady attack in recent years. A growing minority of jurisdictions now hold that where a lease provides for assignment only with the prior consent of the lessor, such consent may be withheld only where the lessor has a commercially reasonable objection to the assignment, even in the absence <span title="841" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-841">p. 841</span>of a provision in the lease stating that consent to assignment will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p id="c5c36533-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the minority rule is the preferable position.</p>
<p id="c5c36534-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5c36535-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impetus for change in the majority rule has come from two directions, reflecting the dual nature of a lease as a conveyance of a leasehold interest and a contract. The policy against restraints on alienation pertains to leases in their nature as conveyances. Numerous courts and commentators have recognized that “[i]n recent times the necessity of permitting reasonable alienation of commercial space has become paramount in our increasingly urban society.” <i>Schweiso v. Williams</i>, 198 Cal. Rptr. 238, 240 (Ct. App. 1984).</p>
<p id="c5c36536-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Civil Code section 711 provides: “Conditions restraining alienation, when repugnant to the interest created, are void.” It is well settled that this rule is not absolute in its application, but forbids only unreasonable restraints on alienation. Reasonableness is determined by comparing the justification for a particular restraint on alienation with the quantum of restraint actually imposed by it. “[T]he greater the quantum of restraint that results from enforcement of a given clause, the greater must be the justification for that enforcement.” <i>Wellenkamp v. Bank of Am.</i>, 148 Cal. Rptr. 379, 382 (Ct. App. 1978).</p>
<p id="c5c36537-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement Second of Property</i> adopts the minority rule on the validity of approval clauses in leases: “A restraint on alienation without the consent of the landlord of a tenant’s interest in leased property is valid, <i>but the landlord’s consent to an alienation by the tenant cannot be withheld unreasonably</i>, unless a freely negotiated provision in the lease gives the landlord an absolute right to withhold consent.” (<i>Rest. 2d Property</i>, §15.2(2) (1977)) (italics added). A comment to the section explains: “The landlord may have an understandable concern about certain personal qualities of a tenant, particularly his reputation for meeting his financial obligations. The preservation of the values that go into the personal selection of the tenant justifies upholding a provision in the lease that curtails the right of the tenant to put anyone else in his place by transferring his interest, but this justification does not go to the point of allowing the landlord arbitrarily and without reason to refuse to allow the tenant to transfer an interest in leased property.” (<i>Id</i>., comment a.) Under the <i>Restatement</i> rule, the lessor’s interest in the character of his or her tenant is protected by the lessor’s right to object to a proposed assignee on reasonable commercial grounds. The lessor’s interests are also protected by the fact that the original lessee remains liable to the lessor as a surety even if the lessor consents to the assignment and the assignee expressly assumes the obligations of the lease.</p>
<p id="c5c36538-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second impetus for change in the majority rule comes from the nature of a lease as a contract. As the Court of Appeal observed in <i>Cohen v. Ratinoff</i>, 195 Cal. Rptr. 84, 88 (Ct. App. 1983), “[since the majority rule was adopted], there has been an increased recognition of and emphasis on the duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in every contract.” Thus, “[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant that <span title="842" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-842">p. 842</span>neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.” <i>Universal Sales Corp. v. Cal. etc. Mfg. Co</i>., 128 P.2d 665, 677 (Cal. 1942). “[W]here a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other, a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.” <i>Cal. Lettuce Growers v. Union Sugar Co.</i>, 289 P.2d 785, 791 (Cal. 1955). Here the lessor retains the discretionary power to approve or disapprove an assignee proposed by the other party to the contract; this discretionary power should therefore be exercised in accordance with commercially reasonable standards.</p>
<p id="c5c36539-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the minority rule, the determination whether a lessor’s refusal to consent was reasonable is a question of fact. Some of the factors that the trier of fact may properly consider in applying the standards of good faith and commercial reasonableness are: financial responsibility of the proposed assignee; suitability of the use for the particular property; legality of the proposed use; need for alteration of the premises; and nature of the occupancy, <i>i.e</i>., office, factory, clinic, etc.</p>
<p id="c5c3653a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Denying consent solely on the basis of personal taste, convenience or sensibility is not commercially reasonable. Nor is it reasonable to deny consent “in order that the landlord may charge a higher rent than originally contracted for.” This is because the lessor’s desire for a better bargain than contracted for has nothing to do with the permissible purposes of the restraint on alienation — to protect the lessor’s interest in the preservation of the property and the performance of the lease covenants.</p>
<p id="c5c3653b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the policy reasons advanced in favor of the minority rule, the majority rule has traditionally been justified on three grounds. Respondent raises a fourth argument in its favor as well. None of these do we find compelling.</p>
<p id="c5c3653c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it is said that a lease is a conveyance of an interest in real property, and that the lessor, having exercised a personal choice in the selection of a tenant and provided that no substitute shall be acceptable without prior consent, is under no obligation to look to anyone but the lessee for the rent. This argument is based on traditional rules of conveyancing and on concepts of freedom of ownership and control over one’s property.</p>
<p id="c5c3653d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A lessor’s freedom at common law to look to no one but the lessee for the rent has, however, been undermined by the adoption in California of a rule that lessors — like all other contracting parties — have a duty to mitigate damages upon the lessee’s abandonment of the property by seeking a substitute lessee. Furthermore, the values that go into the personal selection of a lessee are preserved under the minority rule in the lessor’s right to refuse consent to assignment on any commercially reasonable grounds. Such grounds include not only the obvious objections to an assignee’s financial stability or proposed use of the premises, but a variety of other commercially reasonable objections as well. The lessor’s interests are further protected by the fact that the original lessee remains a guarantor of the performance of the assignee.</p>
<p id="c5c3653e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second justification advanced in support of the majority rule is that an approval clause is an unambiguous reservation of absolute discretion in the lessor over assignments of the lease. The lessee could have bargained for the addition of a reasonableness clause to the lease (<i>i.e</i>., “consent to assignment will not be unreasonably <span title="843" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-843">p. 843</span>withheld”). The lessee having failed to do so, the law should not rewrite the parties’ contract for them.</p>
<p id="c5c38c4f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Numerous authorities have taken a different view of the meaning and effect of an approval clause in a lease, indicating that the clause is not “clear and unambiguous,” as respondent suggests. As early as 1940, the court in <i>Granite Trust Bldg. Corp. v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co</i>., 36 F. Supp. 77 (D. Mass. 1940), examined a standard approval clause and stated: “It would seem to be the better law that when a lease restricts a lessee’s rights by requiring consent before these rights can be exercised, <i>it must have been in the contemplation of the parties that the lessor be required to give some reason for withholding consent</i>.” (<i>Id</i>. at 78, italics added.)</p>
<p id="c5c38c50-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he assertion that an approval clause “clearly and unambiguously” grants the lessor absolute discretion over assignments is untenable. It is not a rewriting of a contract, as respondent suggests, to recognize the obligations imposed by the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which duty is implied by law in every contract.</p>
<p id="c5c38c51-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third justification advanced in support of the majority rule is essentially based on the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>. It is argued that the courts should not depart from the common law majority rule because “many leases now in effect covering a substantial amount of real property and creating valuable property rights were carefully prepared by competent counsel in reliance upon the majority viewpoint.” As pointed out above, however, the majority viewpoint has been far from universally held and has never been adopted by this court. Moreover, the trend in favor of the minority rule should come as no surprise to observers of the changing state of real property law in the 20th century. The minority rule is part of an increasing recognition of the contractual nature of leases and the implications in terms of contractual duties that flow therefrom. We would be remiss in our duty if we declined to question a view held by the majority of jurisdictions simply because it is held by a majority. As we stated in <i>Rodriguez v. Bethlehem Steel Corp</i>., 525 P.2d 669, 676 (Cal. 1974), the “vitality [of the common law] can flourish only so long as the courts remain alert to their obligation and opportunity to change the common law when reason and equity demand it.”</p>
<p id="c5c3b362-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final argument in favor of the majority rule is advanced by respondent and stated as follows: “Both tradition and sound public policy dictate that the lessor has a right, under circumstances such as these, to realize the increased value of his property.” Respondent essentially argues that any increase in the market value of real property during the term of a lease properly belongs to the lessor, not the lessee. We reject this assertion. One California commentator has written:</p>

Why should he be deprived of the contractual benefits of the lease because of the fortuitous inflation in the marketplace[?] By reaping the benefits he does not deprive the landlord of anything to which the landlord was otherwise entitled.

A lessor is free to build periodic rent increases into a lease, as the lessor did here.

<p id="c5c40195-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a hearing, the board found that the tenant had allowed an unauthorized person to occupy his apartment without first obtaining the landlord’s written consent. Nonetheless, the board refused to issue the eviction certificate. The board based its refusal on its determination of law that, implicit in the lease provision requiring the landlord’s consent prior to an assignment or a sublease or the permitting of other occupants, there is an “agreement on the part of the landlord to at least consider prospective tenants [and other permitted occupants] and not withhold consent unreasonably or unequivocally.” The board found that the landlord had acted unreasonably because she had categorically refused to allow the tenant to bring in someone new after the original cotenant had moved out. Because of the landlord’s unreasonable behavior, the board concluded that the tenant could not be said to have violated the lease.</p>
<p id="c5c40196-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue whether a tenant’s obligation, as specified in a residential lease, to obtain the written consent of a landlord before assigning the lease or subletting or permitting other occupants implies as a matter of law an obligation on the landlord’s part to act reasonably in withholding consent has not been decided by this court.</p>
<p id="c5c40197-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A majority of jurisdictions subscribe to the rule that a lease provision requiring the landlord’s consent to an assignment or sublease permits the landlord to refuse arbitrarily or unreasonably. However, the board argues that the current trend is the other way, and cites numerous cases in support of that proposition. We note that every case cited by the board except two, which we discuss below, involved a commercial, not a residential, lease. Although the significance of the distinction between commercial and residential leases may be fairly debatable, we observe that in several of the cases cited by the board the court specifically states that its holding is limited to the commercial lease context. <i>See Kendall v. Ernest Pestana, Inc</i>., 709 P.2d 837 (Cal. 1985).</p>
<p id="c5c40198-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Kruger v. Page Management Co</i>., 432 N.Y.S.2d 295 (Sup. Ct. 1980), is the only purely residential lease case cited by the board. We get little help from that case because the reasonableness requirement in New York has been statutorily imposed.</p>
<p id="c5c40199-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The board argues that we should be guided by the commercial lease cases because the reasons for implying a reasonableness requirement in a residential lease are at least as compelling as in a commercial lease. Our review of the commercial lease cases, however, and particularly of the rationale that appears to have motivated the courts in those cases to adopt a reasonableness requirement, does not persuade us that we should adopt such a rule in this case, which involves a residential lease in a municipality governed by a rent control law.</p>
<p id="c5c4019a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="846" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-846">p. 846</span>Two major concerns emerge from the commercial lease cases. First, courts have exhibited concern that commercial landlords may exercise their power to withhold consent for unfair financial gain. In several of the cases cited by the board, a commercial landlord refused to consent to a proposed subtenant and then attempted to enter into a new or revised lease for the same premises at a more favorable rental rate. However, in a rent control jurisdiction like Brookline there is little economic incentive to withhold consent in the residential lease context because the landlord has such limited control over the rent that can be charged.</p>
<p id="c5c4019b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second concern that appears to have motivated the commercial lease decisions is a desire to limit restraints on alienation in light of the fact that “the necessity of reasonable alienation of commercial building space has become paramount in our ever-increasing urban society.” <i>Homa-Goff Interiors, Inc. v. Cowden</i>, 350 So. 2d 1035, 1037 (Ala. 1977). However, this court has previously, albeit not recently, ruled that a commercial lease provision requiring a landlord’s consent prior to an assignment, with no limitation on the landlord’s ability to refuse, is not an unreasonable restraint on alienation. <i>68 Beacon St., Inc. v. Sohier</i>, 194 N.E. 303 (Mass. 1935).</p>
<p id="c5c4019c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of our decision in <i>68 Beacon St., Inc</i>., and in the absence of a demonstrable trend involving residential leases in other jurisdictions, we are not persuaded that there is such a “necessity of reasonable alienation of [residential] building space” that we ought to impose on residential landlords a reasonableness requirement to which they have not agreed. We are mindful that valid arguments in support of such a rule can be made, but there are also valid counter-arguments, not the least of which is that such a rule would be likely to engender a plethora of litigation about whether the landlord’s withholding of consent was reasonable. The question is one of public policy which, of course, the Legislature is free to address. We note that the Legislature has spoken in at least four States: Alaska Stat. §34.03.060; Del. Code tit. 25, §5512(b); Haw. Rev. Stat. §516-63; N.Y. Real Prop. Law §226-b.</p>

Duty of good faith and fair dealing.</b> In commercial leases, the trend is toward adopting an implied reasonableness term in lease clauses that give the landlord the right to consent to sublet or assignment. <i>See Dick Broadcasting Co. v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc.</i>, 395 S.W.3d 653, 665-666 (Tenn. 2013) (the “traditional common law view that parties asked to consent to assignment may refuse arbitrarily or unreasonably refuse . . . has steadily eroded over time and is now a minority position among the courts that have considered the issue”); <i>Uno Restaurants, Inc. v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp.</i>, 805 N.E.2d 957 (Mass. 2004) (covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all leasehold agreements)<i>.</i> This is the view taken in URLTA, RURLTA, and the <i>Restatement (Second) of Property</i>, see URLTA §1.302 (“every duty [under the URLTA] imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement”); RURLTA §105 (same); <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §15.2(2) (1977) (“A restraint on alienation without the consent of the landlord of the tenant’s interest in the leased property is valid, but the landlord’s consent to an alienation by the tenant cannot be withheld unreasonably, unless a freely negotiated provision in the lease <span title="847" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-847">p. 847</span>gives the landlord an absolute right to withhold consent”). It also echoes the <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i>, which likewise provides in §205 that “[e]very contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.” <i>See Warner v. Konover</i>, 553 A.2d 1138, 1141-1142 (Conn. 1989) (applying this to a commercial landlord’s assignment clause)<i>.</i></p>
<p id="c5c401a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, in <i>First Federal Savings Bank of Indiana v.

It is not the province of courts to require a party acting pursuant to such a contract to be “reasonable,” “fair,” or show “good faith” cooperation. Such an assessment would go beyond the bounds of judicial duty and responsibility. It would be impossible for parties to rely on the written expressions of their duties and responsibilities. Further, it would place the court at the negotiation table with the parties. In the instant case, the court would decide what is “fair” or “reasonable” concerning the advantage or disadvantage of control of the leased property. The proper posture for the court is to find and enforce the contract as it is written and leave the parties where it finds them. It is only where the intentions of the parties cannot be readily ascertained because of ambiguity or inconsistency in the terms of a contract or in relation to extrinsic evidence that a court may have to presume the parties were acting reasonably and in good faith in entering into the contract.</p>

<p id="c5c428b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that the California legislature responded to the <i>Kendall</i> decision by adopting the implied reasonableness test for commercial leases, Cal. Civ. Code §§1995.020(b), 1995.260, but providing that it should apply prospectively only to new leases, Cal. Civ. Code §1995.270, and that the parties were substantially free to contract to the contrary, Cal. Civ. Code §1995.240 (“[a] restriction on transfer of a tenant’s interest in a lease may provide that the transfer is subject to any express standard or condition, including, but not limited to, a provision that the landlord is entitled to some or all of any consideration the tenant receives from a transferee in excess of the rent under the lease”).</p>
<p id="c5c428b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. What is reasonable?</b> In <i>Tenet Healthsystem Surgical, L.L.C. v. Jefferson Parish Hospital Service District No. 1</i>, 426 F.3d 738, 743 (5th Cir. 2005), a tenant leased space for an outpatient surgical center. The lease gave the tenant the right to assign its lease with the consent of the landlord, and indicated that such consent “shall not be unreasonably withheld.” Two years into the lease term, the owner of an adjacent hospital bought the property. Shortly thereafter, the tenant stopped operating and sought consent to assign the lease to a new tenant who intended to open an occupational medical clinic. The new landlord refused, and, when asked why, explained that one reason was that the proposed assignee would compete with its adjacent hospital. <i>Id.</i> at 740. In the ensuing suit, the landlord argued that “a reasonable business person in its position would deny consent to assign a lease that would bring new competition <span title="848" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-848">p. 848</span>into the immediate area where it does business.” The court disagreed, stating that “[i]n determining whether a landlord’s refusal to consent [is] reasonable in a commercial context, only factors that relate to the landlord’s interest in preserving the leased property or in having the terms of [the] prime lease performed should be considered. Among factors a landlord can consider are the financial responsibility of the proposed subtenant, the legality and suitability of proposed use and nature of the occupancy. A landlord’s personal taste or convenience are factors not properly considered. Rather the landlord’s objection ‘must relate to ownership and operation of leased property, not lessor’s general economic interest.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at 743. Why is it unreasonable for a landlord to take potential competition from an assignee into account? Would it have been unreasonable for the landlord to have refused to lease to that party in the first place? </p>
<p id="c5c428b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Commercial versus residential leases.</b> Do the distinctions between commercial and residential leases relied on by the court in <i>Slavin</i> make sense to you? Note that Massachusetts subsequently extended <i>Slavin</i> to commercial leases, refusing to adopt the <i>Kendall</i> approach. <i>21 Merchants Row Corp. v. Merchants Row, Inc.</i>, 587 N.E.2d 788 (Mass. 1992). Do the reasons for implying a reasonableness requirement differ in the residential context? If the arguments applicable to commercial leases are inapplicable to residential leases, what other arguments could you make on behalf of the tenant? How would you argue that residential leases, but not commercial leases, should be subject to an implied duty of reasonableness?</p>
<p id="c5c428b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Common law development.</b> The court in <i>Slavin</i> finds the laws in other states cited by the tenant to be inapposite since they are incorporated into the statutes rather than the common law of those states. <i>See, e.g.</i>, N.Y. Real Prop. Law §226-b(2)(a) (tenants can sublet with landlord’s consent; such consent cannot be unreasonably withheld). What difference does this make? On one hand, it can be argued that this question should be, and has been in other states, left to the legislature to address. On the other hand, since the theory underlying contract law is that the court should enforce the presumed intent of the parties, it might be argued that because these laws reflect changing values and expectations, the presumption underlying the common law rule no longer reflects the justified expectations of the parties. Would it have made a difference to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court if the tenant could have identified another state that had modernized its law by common law ruling rather than statute? Should that make a difference? Doesn’t some state have to be first?</p>

<p id="c5c428be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In what circumstances should tenants be able to terminate their leases before the end of the term without the consent of the landlord? Several states allow tenants who have suffered domestic violence to do so, and also provide other tenant protections for such victims. In Colorado, for example, residential tenants have the right to terminate their leases if they give their landlords notice, such as a recent police report or a protection order, if the tenant “seeks to vacate the premises due to fear of imminent danger for self or children”; residential leases also cannot include provisions that would allow landlords to penalize tenants if they seek police or emergency assistance in response to domestic violence or abuse. <i>See</i> Colo. Rev. Stat. §38-12-402. And Massachusetts provides tenants who are victims of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking with the right to terminate their tenancy upon notice to their landlord, protects tenants who have invoked the statute from being barred from future tenancies, and allows victims to have their landlords change their locks; it also makes any waivers of these and the other rights provided under the statute void and unenforceable. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §§23-29.

<p id="c5c44fd2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord is entitled to evict the tenant if the tenant breaches material terms of the lease. The main reason for eviction is failure to pay rent or failure to pay rent on time. Is the landlord entitled to evict the tenant who has <i>not</i> breached any terms of the leasehold? A tenant with a term of years — a one-year lease, for example — cannot be evicted before the end of the term unless the tenant has breached the lease. The landlord has no obligation, however, to <i>renew</i> a leasehold. Thus a landlord is entitled to refuse to renew a one-year lease for any reason. Landlords are also entitled to end periodic tenancies, such as month-to-month tenancies, by giving requisite notice.</p>
<p id="c5c44fd3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are some exceptions to the general principle that landlords may choose not to renew. First, federal and state antidiscrimination statutes prohibit landlords from not renewing leaseholds if the landlord’s motivation is discriminatory. Similarly, most courts hold that tenants are protected from eviction if the landlord’s motivation is to retaliate against them for asserting their right to habitable premises by calling the housing inspector, for example, to report housing code violations.</p>
<p id="c5c44fd4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tenants in units that are subject to statutory or local rent control ordinarily are protected from eviction and, in some cases, non-renewal unless the landlord can show just cause. The District of Columbia, New Jersey, and New Hampshire are the only jurisdictions that have adopted statutes granting some or all tenants in private housing a right to continue in possession unless the landlord has just cause to end the tenancy or refuse to renew the leasehold. <i>See</i> D.C. Code §42-3505.1; N.H. Rev. Stat. §540:2; N.J. Stat. §§2A:18-61.1 to 2A:18-61.12. <i>See also Aimco Properties LLC v. Dziewisz</i>, 883 A.2d 310 (N.H. 2005) (expiration of one-year lease is not “good cause” for eviction under N.H. Rev. Stat. §540:2). Those statutes allow eviction if the tenant is not paying rent on time, damaging the premises or violating reasonable rules in the lease. They also allow eviction if the landlord or a member of the landlord’s family wants to move in or the landlord wants to convert the property to a nonrental use.</p>
<p id="c5c44fd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal government subsidizes low-income families through a program known as Section 8 housing, with the federal government paying a significant portion of the tenants’ rent owed to private landlords. Under one part of the program, the tenant is given a voucher, finds the apartment, and then obtains the agreement of the landlord to participate. In 1981, the federal statute was amended to prohibit eviction of tenants in Section 8 housing without “good cause.” 42 U.S.C. §1437f(d)(1)(B). Public housing owned and operated by public authorities or governmental agencies is similarly prohibited from evicting tenants in the absence of “serious or repeated violation of the terms or conditions of the lease or for other good cause.” 42 U.S.C. §1437d(<i>l</i>)(5).</p>

Some ordinances prohibit eviction of existing tenants when apartments are converted. <i>See Fore L Realty Trust v. McManus</i>, 884 N.E.2d 994, 998 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008). Some laws protect particular classes of tenants, such as the elderly or disabled. <i>See Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act</i>, N.J. Stat. §2A:18-61.22 <i>et seq</i>. (granting elderly and disabled tenants protection from eviction for up to 40 years after conversion). Other statutes give tenants preference in purchasing either the building or their particular units within the building when it is converted by granting tenants preemptive rights or rights of first refusal; these rights entitle them to match any offers made by third parties and thus acquire the building or particular units within it. <i>See, e.g</i>., D.C. Code §45-1631 <i>et seq</i>.; <i>Allman v. Snyder</i>, 888 A.2d 1161 (D.C. 2005) (tenants may assign their statutory right of first refusal to prospective third-party purchasers).</p>

A smaller number of cases involve attempts to evict tenants for breaching other express or implied terms of the lease. These other terms may include a covenant not to damage the apartment, a covenant requiring the tenants not to interfere with the quiet enjoyment of neighboring tenants in the building, covenants not to keep pets in the apartment, and covenants not to sublet.</p>

<p id="c5c476f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The holdover tenant and the renewal of the tenancy.</b> What happens if the tenant wrongfully holds over after the end of the lease term and <i>continues</i> to pay rent? The landlord may choose to accept a new tenancy relationship with the holdover tenant. Most states hold that the new tenancy is a periodic tenancy based on the rent payment; if the landlord accepts a rent check for one’s month rent, a new month-to-month tenancy is established. A minority of states hold that a new term is created if the landlord accepts rent from a holdover tenant who was originally occupying under a term of years. In these states, the tenant is bound to another term of the same length as the original term. The tenant who holds over wrongfully is obligated to pay rent to the landlord for the time during which she occupies the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c476f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord is also free to take the opposite course of action, that is, to treat the tenant as a tenant at sufferance or a holdover tenant and sue for possession. If the landlord chooses the latter course, does the landlord have the right to collect rent from the holdover tenant before the eviction proceedings are completed? Some states hold that acceptance of the rent check proffered by the holdover tenant <i>necessarily</i> creates a new tenancy — regardless of whether the landlord intends to create a new tenancy. To evict the tenant, the landlord may have to go through the procedures to evict a month-to-month tenant, including providing the requisite notice. The landlord may attempt to avoid this result by suing immediately for possession and either (a) refusing to accept the tenant’s proffered checks (or returning them to the tenant) or (b) cashing the checks while writing on the back of each check that the landlord is not agreeing to renew the tenancy but is merely using the check to cover the rental value of the property from the tenant at sufferance.</p>
<p id="c5c476f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Self-help.</b> A major issue when the tenant breaches the lease and refuses to leave is whether the landlord is entitled to engage in self-help to remove the tenant. Almost all states now hold that the landlord may <i>not</i> use self-help, at least in the residential <span title="853" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-853">p. 853</span>context and often in the commercial context as well. The law today is generally that the landlord must evict the tenant through court proceedings. In <i>Berg v. Wiley</i>, 264 N.W.2d 145 (Minn. 1978), the tenant operated a restaurant pursuant to a written lease. The lease contained a covenant by the tenant not to make any changes in the building structure without the landlord’s consent. After observing continued violations of this provision and having made several attempts to persuade the tenant to stop remodeling the building to no avail, the landlord changed the locks on the door of the tenant’s restaurant, barring the tenant from the premises. The tenant sued the landlord for wrongful eviction. The court found for the tenant, holding that the only lawful means to dispossess a tenant who continues to occupy the premises and has not voluntarily surrendered her rights under the tenancy is to resort to judicial process. In so doing, the court rejected the traditional rule allowing landlords to use self-help to regain possession of leased premises if the landlord is legally entitled to possession and the landlord’s means of reentry are “peaceable” rather than “forcible.” The court argued that the legislature had provided a summary procedure to allow landlords a relatively quick judicial process for a court order allowing the landlord to recover possession. This procedure protected the landlord’s rights adequately and prevented the landlord from taking the law into his own hands. Self-help, the court argued, is likely to become violent; moreover, the landlord may be mistaken about his right to possession, and he should not be “the judge of his own rights.” The court noted that the landlord could also go to court for an immediate temporary restraining order to prevent the tenant from destroying the property.</p>
<p id="c5c476f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Summary process.</b> Most states have statutes providing for a relatively fast judicial determination of the landlord’s claim of a right to regain possession of her property. The statutes are called by a variety of names, including <b>forcible entry and detainer</b>, <b>unlawful detainer</b><i>,</i> <b>summary proceedings</b>, and <b>summary ejectment</b>. Summary process statutes often limit the issues that can be addressed in the lawsuit; for many years they were interpreted in ways that prevented tenants from raising defenses to the landlord’s claim that she was entitled to possession of the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c476f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These proceedings have become considerably less “summary” in recent years, as they have been interpreted by courts or amended by legislatures to allow tenants to raise an increasingly diverse number of defenses — chief among them the implied warranty of habitability. Some states, however, still prevent the tenant from raising defenses, such as the landlord’s violation of the implied warranty of habitability, in summary proceedings. The United States Supreme Court has upheld this practice, holding that treating the “undertakings of the tenant and those of the landlord as independent rather than dependent covenants” is not a fundamentally unfair procedure that would violate the tenant’s rights to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment. <i>See Lindsey v. Normet</i>, 405 U.S. 56, 68 (1972).</p>
<p id="c5c476f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the book <i>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</i>, Matthew Desmond closely follows eight families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they struggle with cycles of eviction. According to Desmond, with the majority of renters in poverty spending more than half of their income on housing, Milwaukee experiences roughly 16,000 <span title="854" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-854">p. 854</span>evictions annually. Desmond tracks the causes of eviction — not just economic insecurity, but also domestic violence, nuisance complaints, and even being the victim of a crime — and the devastating consequences of eviction, including a record of having been evicted, making renting again that much more difficult.</p>
<p id="c5c476fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Representation and the access to justice gap.</b> Another challenge common in landlord-tenant cases, both for problems that arise during the term of the lease and at termination, is lack of tenant representation. Many landlord-tenant disputes are handled in specialized housing courts. However, the majority of landlords in these courts are represented by counsel and the overwhelming majority of tenants are not. There is evidence that outcomes differ significantly when tenants have lawyers. <i>See generally</i> Boston Bar Association Task Force on the Civil Right to Counsel, <i>The Importance of Representation in Eviction Cases and Homelessness Prevention</i> (2012) (reporting that in two pilot programs providing free representation to tenants, representation significantly reduced the risk of eviction and improved financial outcomes compared to unrepresented tenants); <i>see also</i> D. James Greiner, Cassandra Wolos Pattanayak &amp; Jonathan Hennessy,<i> The Limits of Unbundled Legal Assistance: A Randomized Study in a Massachusetts District Court and Prospects for the Future</i>, 126 Harv.

<p id="c5c476fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has recognized a right to counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases, see<i> Gideon v. Wainwright</i>, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), but has declined to extend that right to civil cases, at least as a general matter, see<i> Turner v. Rogers</i>, 564 U.S. 431, 445 (2011). Should tenants facing eviction — which can have significant adverse consequences, including homelessness — be granted the same right if they cannot afford counsel? If not, how else might the legal system, including courts and counsel for landlords, respond to the shortage of lawyers for indigent tenants?</p>

<p id="c5c476fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different set of problems ensues if the tenant breaches the lease for a term of years by ceasing rent payments and moves out before the end of the lease term. The right to sue for possession is of no use since the tenant has already given up possession. In this situation, the landlord can choose among three remedies.</p>
<p id="c5c476ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Accept the tenant’s surrender.</b> By moving out before the end of the lease term and ceasing rent payments, the tenant makes an implied offer to the landlord to end the term of years. The landlord may, if she chooses, “accept the tenant’s surrender of the lease.” This means that the landlord agrees that the tenant will not be legally obligated to pay the future rent because the landlord has accepted possession of the property.</p>
<p id="c5c49e10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to note, however, that the landlord’s acceptance of the tenant’s surrender does <i>not</i> mean that the tenant is relieved of <i>all</i> financial liability. The landlord may still choose to sue the tenant for <b>back rent</b> owed but not paid for the time before the tenant abandoned the premises by moving out. In addition, the landlord may sue immediately (without waiting until the end of the lease term) for <b>damages</b> for breach <span title="855" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-855">p. 855</span>of the lease — which is different from the amount of the <b>future rent</b>. As in other contractual settings you may have learned about, damages are likely to be measured by an estimate of the amount the landlord lost because of the tenant’s failure to perform his obligations under the contract. This amount is <i>not</i> the remaining rent, but the <b>agreed-upon rental price minus the fair market price</b>. The theory is that, because the landlord can re-rent the apartment, all the landlord loses by the tenant’s breach is the difference between the amount the tenant agreed to pay and the amount the landlord can get from a replacement tenant, plus the advertising and search costs of finding a replacement tenant and lost rent in the meantime. If the rental price is the same as or below the market price, damages are zero (plus the cost of locating the new tenant). The court is likely to add to the computation of damages the reasonable cost of finding a replacement — a cost the landlord would not have had to bear if the tenant had not breached.</p>
<p id="c5c49e11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Re-let on the tenant’s account.</b> The landlord may <b>refuse to accept the surrender</b>; instead, the landlord may, after notice to the tenant, actively look for a new tenant and <b>re-let the apartment on the tenant’s account</b>. When a new tenant is found, the landlord may sue the <i>former</i> tenant for the difference between the old rental price and the new rent received from the new lessee, if the new rent is lower than the original rent. The new rent must be reasonable; the landlord cannot rent the apartment to her sister for $5 a month and expect to recover the difference between the agreed-upon rent and the artificially low figure charged to her sister.</p>
<p id="c5c49e12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An issue that often arises in this context is how the landlord can make clear that she is refusing to accept the tenant’s proffered surrender of the lease. In some states, the very act of re-letting the apartment may be taken as evidence that the landlord has accepted the surrender of the leasehold. In those states, the landlord must notify the tenant that she is re-letting on the tenant’s account and that she refuses to accept the surrender in order to hold the tenant to the rent later. <i>See OMV Associates, L.P. v. Clearway Acquisition, Inc.</i>, 976 N.E.2d 185, 194 (Mass. App. Ct. 2012).</p>
<p id="c5c49e13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why does it matter whether the landlord is held to have accepted the surrender? Consider a situation in which the tenant under a one-year lease moves out after six months. The landlord finds a new tenant, who agrees to a month-to-month tenancy at the old rent. But this second tenant moves out after four months, with two months left on the year lease. The landlord looks for, but is unable to find, a new tenant. If the landlord has accepted the first tenant’s surrender, then the landlord cannot sue the original tenant for the last two months’ rent. If the landlord has <i>not</i> accepted the tenant’s surrender, then the tenant will be obligated to reimburse the landlord for the last two months’ rent.</p>
<p id="c5c49e14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Wait and sue for the rent at the end of the lease term versus mitigate damages.</b> The traditional rule is that the landlord may do nothing, wait for the end of the lease term, and then sue the tenant for the remaining unpaid back rent. Rent comes due periodically; under a one-year lease with monthly rental payments, each rental payment is not due until that month arrives. Thus, the landlord could not immediately sue for the remaining rent in the middle of the lease term. To sue the <span title="856" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-856">p. 856</span>tenant immediately for monetary compensation in the middle of the lease term, the landlord must ask for damages (rental price minus fair market price); to sue for the entire rent itself, the landlord must wait until the lease term ends.</p>
<p id="c5c49e15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost all states, however, now reject this option. Instead, they apply the contract doctrine that requires the aggrieved party to <b>mitigate damages</b>. The following case explores what this duty entails.</p>

<p id="c5c49e1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 10, 1972 the defendant, James Kridel, entered into a lease with the plaintiff, Abraham Sommer, owner of the “Pierre Apartments” in Hackensack, to rent apartment 6-L in that building. The term of the lease was from May 1, 1972 until April 30, 1974, with a rent concession for the first six weeks, so that the first month’s rent was not due until June 15, 1972.</p>
<p id="c5c49e1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One week after signing the agreement, Kridel paid Sommer $690. Half of that sum was used to satisfy the first month’s rent. The remainder was paid under the lease provision requiring a security deposit of $345. Although defendant had expected to begin occupancy around May 1, his plans were changed. He wrote to Sommer on May 19, 1972, explaining</p>

<p id="c5c4c534-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, a third party went to the apartment house and inquired about renting apartment 6-L. Although the parties agreed that she was ready, willing and able to rent the apartment, the person in charge told her that the apartment was not being shown since it was already rented to Kridel. In fact, the landlord did not re-enter the apartment or exhibit it to anyone until August 1, 1973. At that time it was rented to a new tenant for a term beginning on September 1, 1973. The new rental was for $345 per month with a six week concession similar to that granted Kridel.</p>
<p id="c5c4c535-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to re-letting the new premises, plaintiff sued Kridel in August 1972, demanding $7,000, the total amount due for the full two-year term of the lease. <span title="857" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-857">p. 857</span>Following a mistrial, plaintiff filed an amended complaint asking for $5,000, the amount due between May 1, 1972 and September 1, 1973. The amended complaint included no reduction in the claim to reflect the six week concession provided for in the lease or the $690 payment made to plaintiff after signing the agreement. Defendant filed an amended answer to the complaint, alleging that plaintiff breached the contract, failed to mitigate damages and accepted defendant’s surrender of the premises. He also counterclaimed to demand repayment of the $345 paid as a security deposit.</p>
<p id="c5c4c536-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge ruled in favor of defendant. Despite his conclusion that the lease had been drawn to reflect “the ‘settled law’ of this state,” he found that “justice and fair dealing” imposed upon the landlord the duty to attempt to re-let the premises and thereby mitigate damages. He also held that plaintiff’s failure to make any response to defendant’s unequivocal offer of surrender was tantamount to an acceptance, thereby terminating the tenancy and any obligation to pay rent. As a result, he dismissed both the complaint and the counterclaim. The Appellate Division reversed in a per curiam opinion, and we granted certification.</p>

<p id="c5c4c538-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This controversy arose in a similar manner. On December 27, 1972, Carlos Perosio entered into a written lease with plaintiff Riverview Realty Co. The agreement covered the rental of apartment 5-G in a building owned by the realty company at 2175 Hudson Terrace in Fort Lee. As in the companion case, the lease prohibited the tenant from subletting or assigning the apartment without the consent of the landlord. It was to run for a two-year term, from February 1, 1973 until January 31, 1975, and provided for a monthly rental of $450. The defendant took possession of the apartment and occupied it until February 1974. At that time he vacated the premises, after having paid the rent through January 31, 1974.</p>
<p id="c5c4c539-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord filed a complaint on October 31, 1974, demanding $4,000 in payment for the monthly rental from February 1, 1974 through October 31, 1974. Defendant answered the complaint by alleging that there had been a valid surrender of the premises and that plaintiff failed to mitigate damages. The trial court granted the landlord’s motion for summary judgment against the defendant, fixing the damages at $4,000 plus $182.25 interest.</p>
<p id="c5c4c53a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court, holding that it was bound by prior precedents, including <i>Joyce v.

<p id="c5c4c53f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule has been followed in a majority of states. Nevertheless, while there is still a split of authority over this question, the trend among recent cases appears to be in favor of a mitigation requirement.</p>
<p id="c5c4c540-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority rule is based on principles of property law which equate a lease with a transfer of a property interest in the owner’s estate. Under this rationale the lease conveys to a tenant an interest in the property which forecloses any control by the landlord; thus, it would be anomalous to require the landlord to concern himself with the tenant’s abandonment of his own property.</p>

<p id="c5c4ec5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Various courts have adopted this position.</p>
<p id="c5c4ec5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The pre-existing rule cannot be predicated upon the possibility that a landlord may lose the opportunity to rent another empty apartment because he must first rent the apartment vacated by the defaulting tenant. Even where the breach occurs in a multi-dwelling building, each apartment may have unique qualities which make it attractive to certain individuals. Significantly, in <i>Sommer v. Kridel</i>, there was a specific request to rent the apartment vacated by the defendant; there is no reason to believe that absent this vacancy the landlord could have succeeded in renting a different apartment to this individual.</p>
<p id="c5c4ec5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that antiquated real property concepts which served as the basis for the pre-existing rule, shall no longer be controlling where there is a claim for damages under a residential lease. Such claims must be governed by more modern notions of fairness and equity. A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages where he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c4ec5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the landlord has other vacant apartments besides the one which the tenant has abandoned, the landlord’s duty to mitigate consists of making reasonable efforts to re-let the apartment. In such cases he must treat the apartment in question as if it was one of his vacant stock.</p>
<p id="c5c4ec5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of his cause of action, the landlord shall be required to carry the burden of proving that he used reasonable diligence in attempting to re-let the premises. We note that there has been a divergence of opinion concerning the allocation of the burden of proof on this issue. While generally in contract actions the breaching party has the burden of proving that damages are capable of mitigation, here the landlord will be in a better position to demonstrate whether he exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to re-let the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c51270-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5c51271-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Sommer v. Kridel</i> case presents a classic example of the unfairness which occurs when a landlord has no responsibility to minimize damages. Sommer waited 15 <span title="860" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-860">p. 860</span>months and allowed $4658.50 in damages to accrue before attempting to re-let the apartment. Despite the availability of a tenant who was ready, willing and able to rent the apartment, the landlord needlessly increased the damages by turning her away. While a tenant will not necessarily be excused from his obligations under a lease simply by finding another person who is willing to rent the vacated premises, here there has been no showing that the new tenant would not have been suitable. We therefore find that plaintiff could have avoided the damages which eventually accrued, and that the defendant was relieved of his duty to continue paying rent. Ordinarily we would require the tenant to bear the cost of any reasonable expenses incurred by a landlord in attempting to re-let the premises, but no such expenses were incurred in this case.</p>
<p id="c5c51272-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Riverview Realty Co. v. Perosio</i>, no factual determination was made regarding the landlord’s efforts to mitigate damages, and defendant contends that plaintiff never answered his interrogatories. Consequently, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. Upon remand and after discovery has been completed, the trial court shall determine whether plaintiff attempted to mitigate damages with reasonable diligence, and if so, the extent of damages remaining and assessable to the tenant. As we have held above, the burden of proving that reasonable diligence was used to re-let the premises shall be upon the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c5c51273-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing whether the landlord has satisfactorily carried his burden, the trial court shall consider, among other factors, whether the landlord, either personally or through an agency, offered or showed the apartment to any prospective tenants, or advertised it in local newspapers. Additionally, the tenant may attempt to rebut such evidence by showing that he proffered suitable tenants who were rejected. However, there is no standard formula for measuring whether the landlord has utilized satisfactory efforts in attempting to mitigate damages, and each case must be judged upon its own facts.</p>

<p id="c5c51276-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. The duty to mitigate damages.</b> As <i>Sommer</i> notes, the traditional rule that landlords have no duty to mitigate damages reflected the idea that a lease was considered a conveyance of a property interest for the term. Having transferred exclusive control of the property to the tenant, subject only to a reversion or remainder, the landlord was entitled to the continuing payment of rent in much the same way that an installment contract can require payments over time.</p>
<p id="c5c51277-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost all states have now changed their laws through statute or judicial decision to impose on both parties to residential leases a duty to mitigate damages that emphasize the contractual nature of the lease. <i>E.g.,</i> Alaska Stat. §34.03.230; Cal. Civ. Code §1951.2; Ky. Rev. Stat. §383.670. URLTA §§1.105, 4.203(c) imposes such a duty, although the newly promulgated RURLTA provides a safe harbor for landlords who make reasonable efforts following tenant abandonment, see RURLTA §§104, 604. Most states also now extend the duty to commercial leases. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Frenchtown Square Partnership v. Lemstone, Inc.</i>, 791 N.E.2d 417 (Ohio 2003) (commercial landlord has duty to mitigate damages); <i>Austin Hill Country Realty v. Palisades Plaza</i>, 948 S.W.2d 293 (Tex. 1997) (same).</p>
<p id="c5c51278-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="861" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-861">p. 861</span>By sitting around and waiting for the unpaid rent to accumulate, the landlord arguably increases damages that could have been avoided by re-letting the apartment to another tenant. States that require the landlord to mitigate damages place an obligation on the landlord to act reasonably in seeking another tenant and respect the tenant’s interest in not being bound unfairly to the lease. If the landlord does mitigate damages, he can still recover from the tenant the reasonable costs of finding a new tenant, the rent for the premises while the premises were vacant and the landlord was looking for a new tenant, and the difference between the rental price and the new rent paid by the replacement tenant if it is lower than the original rent.</p>
<p id="c5c51279-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few states retain the rule that the landlord has no duty to mitigate damages. <i>Bowdoin Square, L.L.C. v. Winn-Dixie Montgomery, Inc.,</i> 873 So. 2d 1091, 1100 (Ala. 2003); <i>Ferrick v. Bianchini</i>, 2013 Pa. Super. 116 (Super. Ct. 2013) (commercial); <i>Holy Properties, Ltd. v. Kenneth Cole Products, Inc.</i>, 661 N.E.2d 694, 696 (N.Y. 1995)<i>; Rios v. Carillo</i>, 861 N.Y.S.2d 129 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008). The <i>Restatement (Second) of Property</i> also adheres to the traditional rule. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §12.1(3) &amp; cmt. i (1977).</p>
<p id="c5c5127a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Effect of the failure to mitigate.</b> The common law duty to mitigate damages is not an enforceable obligation in the sense that the landlord <i>must</i> attempt to re-let the premises. The landlord is perfectly free to leave the premises vacant. The rule simply means that, in a lawsuit against the tenant for back rent, the landlord can recover only the difference between the market rent and the contract rent provided for in the rental agreement with the original tenant, plus the costs of finding a replacement tenant. However, URLTA goes further, providing that if a landlord fails to mitigate, “the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated” and the landlord can recover no damages past that point. <i>See</i> URLTA §4.203(c); <i>see also</i> RURLTA §604(d)(4). </p>
<p id="c5c5127b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Landlords who want to protect themselves are well advised to attempt to re-let the premises, even in jurisdictions that retain the traditional rule, given the possibility that the law may be changed at any time and be applied retroactively. If a landlord attempts to re-let and finds a new tenant who then fails to pay part or all of the rent, the landlord may want to go after the original tenant for the unpaid rent. If, however, the landlord has accepted the original tenant’s surrender of the lease, he can go after only the new tenant. How can the landlord increase the likelihood that the courts will find that the landlord did not accept the tenant’s surrender of the lease?</p>
<p id="c5c5127c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Arguments for and against the duty to mitigate.</b> Some scholars argue that the duty to mitigate damages is efficient because it encourages landlords to rent the premises rather than leaving them vacant. Because the landlord can be compensated by the tenant for all the extra costs of re-letting the premises and still obtain the economic value of the leasehold, re-renting gives the landlord the benefit of the bargain; he is in the economic position he would have been in had the tenant performed. Moreover, the old tenant has been able to get out of an arrangement that was no longer in her interest; the new tenant has obtained an apartment, thus being made better off. Placing no duty on the landlord would allow him to leave the apartment vacant, thereby wasting a scarce resource. Alternatively, it would force the tenant to give up <span title="862" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-862">p. 862</span>a job opportunity elsewhere, for example, and remain locked in to the apartment. Either result creates a loss of social wealth relative to re-letting the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c5127d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Others argue, however, that there is no such efficiency loss. The landlord bargained for the right not to have to look for another tenant before the end of the lease term. This right is a property right that the landlord owns; the tenant has no right to take this right from the landlord without offering adequate compensation. The only compensation that is adequate is the remainder of the bargained-for rent. If the tenant wanted a nine-month lease, she could have bargained for it. If the tenant wants to breach the 12-month lease by moving out early, she should have to compensate the landlord sufficiently to induce the landlord to agree to give up his right not to have to look for a new tenant. If the tenant is unwilling to compensate the landlord for the right to terminate the lease early, the cost to the landlord outweighs the benefit to the plaintiff. And tenants in many situations are as capable of subleasing or assigning their units as landlords are at renting in the first place.</p>
<p id="c5c5127e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is either of these arguments convincing? Should it make a difference whether the landlord has limited a tenant’s right to sublease or assign? Why?</p>
<p id="c5c5127f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Advice for tenants.</b> In a jurisdiction that imposes a duty on landlords to mitigate damages, what advice would you give a tenant who wanted to leave before the end of the lease term? Should she give the landlord notice before she leaves? Does the duty to mitigate damages protect her sufficiently so that she can leave in confidence that she will be relieved of rent obligations for the rest of the lease term?

<p id="c5c51280-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Rent acceleration clauses.</b> Some landlords attempt to contract around the duty to mitigate damages through an “acceleration clause,” making the rest of the rent due immediately if the tenant abandons the premises or otherwise breaches the lease in a material way. This is a form of “liquidated damages,” whereby the parties agree to the amount of damages due if one of them breaches. This remedy goes beyond waiting until the rent is due to sue to collect it; it allows the landlord to obtain the rest of the rent immediately upon breach and, if enforceable, would allow the landlord <i>also</i> to rent out the premises to another tenant. Some courts enforce such provisions on the ground that the parties voluntarily agreed to them; however, they generally also police the term and will not enforce the clause if it constitutes a “penalty” or if the amount owed is “unconscionable.” <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Summers v. Crestview Apartments</i>, 236 P.3d 586, 590 (Mont. 2010). As with other liquidated damages, they will be deemed to be an unenforceable penalty if they do not constitute a reasonable estimate of the actual damages the landlord is likely to suffer because of the breach. <i>Cummings Properties, L.L.C. v. National Communications Corp.</i>, 869 N.E.2d 617 (Mass. 2007). Most (but not all) courts will not allow such a clause to waive the duty to mitigate damages; while the remaining rent payments are what the landlord “could have expected to receive . . . over the term of the lease,” the landlord is also expected to attempt to re-let the premises and the accelerated rent payments will be reduced by the damages that would have been avoided by re-letting. <i>HealthSouth Rehabilitation Corp. v. <span title="863" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-863">p. 863</span>Falcon Management Co.</i>, 799 So. 2d 177, 185-186 (Ala. 2001); <i>Aurora Business Park Association v.

Burden of proof.</b> <i>Sommer</i> holds that the landlord has the burden to persuade the decision maker that he tried to mitigate damages and to justify the amount lost because of the inability to mitigate. This appears to be the majority rule at least in the case of residential tenancies. However, some states impose the burden on the tenant, and this appears to be the majority rule in cases involving commercial leases, for those states that have addressed the issue. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Commercial Real Estate Investment, L.C. v. Comcast of Utah II, Inc.,</i> 285 P.3d 1193, 1204 (Utah 2012). By statute, Maine and Wisconsin have a shifting burden of proof on this issue, requiring the landlord initially to prove reasonable efforts to comply and then giving the tenant the opportunity to prove that the landlord was not reasonable. <i>See</i> Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, §6010-A(3); Wis. Stat. §704.29(3). Which approach is better?</p>

Each floor in the building contains the same mix of studio, one-bedroom, and two bedroom apartments. Each apartment of a given type has the same layout and standard finishes, and the views from each are similar, although slightly better from higher floors. A tenant breaches her one-year lease on a one-bedroom apartment and moves out after only three months. At the time the landlord sets out to re-let the apartment, the building has three other one-bedroom apartments available to rent, and a handful of studio and two-bedroom apartments vacant as well. If a prospective tenant comes to the building’s leasing office seeking an apartment and does not specify any particular unit, must the landlord rent the newly vacated unit before offering any other vacant units? What if the prospective tenants are a couple with a small child?</p>
<p id="c5c53995-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> A landlord who lives in a three-unit building rents two of the apartments. The building is located in an urban area with many universities and a shortage of rental housing; many prospective tenants look for housing much of the time. Most of the tenants are students, many of whom go elsewhere for the summer. Because the landlord lives in the building, she is concerned about finding tenants who will not be disruptive. Because the state imposes a duty to mitigate damages, however, tenants have started leaving at the end of the school year and stopping rent payments. This constitutes a breach of the year-long lease; however, they know that the landlord will be able to find replacement tenants and that she has a “duty to mitigate damages.” Because she can easily find new tenants, she is unlikely to come after them for the money.</p>

<p id="c5c5399e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few municipalities (most notably, New York City) have laws limiting the amount by which landlords can raise the rent. Such laws are intended to allow landlords to obtain a reasonable return on their investment, while protecting the rights of tenants to continue living in their homes. Rent control has been repeatedly upheld against claims that it constitutes an unconstitutional taking of the landlord’s property rights. <i>Yee v. City of Escondido</i>, California, 503 U.S. 519 (1992).</p>
<p id="c5c5399f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rent control laws generally allow rents to rise to market levels when the current tenant vacates the premises. This fact leads to a great deal of game-playing on both sides. Landlords may try to harass tenants to get them to move out so the landlord can raise the rent, and tenants may sublet the apartment against the wishes of the landlord. In addition, tenants are generally entitled to leave their apartments to spouses or other family members living with the tenant before the tenant’s death. In the famous case of <i>Braschi v. Stahl Associates</i>, 543 N.E.2d 49 (N.Y. 1989), the court ruled that a partner in a same-sex couple was a “family member” entitled to continue living in the apartment when his partner died. The rent control ordinance was subsequently amended to reflect this result. <i>N.Y. City Rent &amp; Eviction Regulations</i> §2204.6(d)(3). But in <i>Hudson View Properties v. Weiss</i>, 450 N.E.2d 234 (N.Y. 1983), the landlord sought to evict a tenant from a rent-controlled apartment on the ground that she had breached a term in her lease under which she covenanted not to allow anyone to occupy the premises with her who was not a member of her “immediate family.” She lived with a man “with whom she [had] a loving relationship,” but the court decided that because the couple was not married, the man was not a part of the tenant’s immediate family.</p>

The tenants’ answer set forth as affirmative defenses that because they were unable to use two-thirds of the loft space due to the landlord’s renovations and other conditions, they were entitled to an abatement of two-thirds of the rent, and that as to the remaining one-third space, they were entitled to a further rent abatement due to the landlord’s failure to supply essential services. The tenants also counterclaimed for breach of warranty of habitability, seeking both actual and punitive damages and attorney’s fees.</p>

<p id="c5c560c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In September of 1981 the landlord commenced construction work in the building to convert the building into a Class A multiple building. To convert the freight elevator into a passenger elevator, petitioner had the elevator shaft on respondent’s side of the building removed. The workers threw debris down the elevator shaft, raising “huge clouds of dust” which came pouring into the loft and settled everywhere, on respondents’ clothes, bed, food, toothbrushes and musical equipment. The musical equipment had to be covered at all times to protect it from the dust. Respondents began to suffer from eye and sinus problems, nausea, and soreness in their throats from the inhalation of the dust. Respondents attempted to shield themselves somewhat from the dust by putting up plastic sheets, only to have the workmen rip them down.</p>
<p id="c5c560c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To demonstrate the hazardous nature of some of the construction work, respondents introduced evidence that as the landlord’s workers were demolishing the stairs from the seventh floor down, no warning signs were posted, causing one visitor to come perilously close to falling through a hole in the stairs. The workers jackhammered a new entrance to the loft, permitting the debris to fall directly onto the floor of respondents’ loft. The workmen would mix cement right on respondents’ floor. A new entrance door to the loft was sloppily installed without a door sill, and loose bricks were left around the frame. A day later, brick fragments and concrete fell on tenant Randolph’s head as she closed the door.</p>
<p id="c5c560c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The record contains many more examples of dangerous construction and other conduct interfering with respondents’ ability to use and enjoy possession of their loft. From 1981 until the time of trial, Kikuchi was completely unable to use the music studio portion of the loft. His musical instruments had been kept covered and protected against the sand and later the dust since 1978.</p>
<p id="c5c560c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury rendered a verdict awarding respondents a rent abatement of 80% for July 1981 through November 1983, as compensatory damages on the theory of constructive eviction from the music studio portion of the loft; a 40% rent abatement for January 1981 through November 1983, on the remainder of the rent due for the residential portion of the premises, on a theory of breach of warranty of habitability; a 10% rent abatement on the rent attributable to the residential portion of the premises for all of 1979, on a breach of warranty of habitability theory; and punitive damages in the amount of $20,000. After trial the court granted respondents’ motion made pursuant to Real Property Law Sec. 234 for reasonable attorney’s fees, awarding respondents $5000.

Holding that the doctrine of constructive eviction could not provide a defense to this non-payment proceeding, because tenants had not abandoned possession of the demised premises, the court reversed the jury’s award as to the 80% rent abatement predicated on the constructive eviction theory.</p>
<p id="c5c560c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with the holding and reasoning of <i>East Haven Associates v. Gurian</i>, 313 N.Y.S.2d 927 (Civ. Ct. 1970), that a tenant may assert as a defense to the nonpayment of rent the doctrine of constructive eviction, even if he or she has abandoned only a portion of the demised premises due to the landlord’s acts in making that portion of the premises unusable by the tenant. Indeed “compelling considerations of social policy and fairness” dictate such a result.</p>
<p id="c5c560ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence at trial fully supported a finding that respondents were compelled to abandon the music studio portion of the loft due to “the landlord’s wrongful acts [which] substantially and materially deprive[d] the tenant[s] of the beneficial use and enjoyment” of that portion of the loft.</p>
<p id="c5c560cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner does, however, correctly point out that as the constructive eviction claim was asserted as a defense to the nonpayment of rent and respondents did not request an abatement for any months other than those in which they did not pay rent, the jury’s award of an 80% rent abatement as to the months July, August, September and half of October of 1981 must be stricken.</p>
<p id="c5c560cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The award for punitive damages, as reduced by the Civil Court to $5000, should be reinstated as well. Although generally in breach of contract claims the damages to be awarded are compensatory, in certain instances punitive damages may be awarded when to do so would “deter morally culpable conduct.” The determining factor is “the moral culpability of the defendant,” and whether the conduct implies a “criminal indifference to civil obligations.”</p>

One particularly egregious example of the landlord’s wanton disregard for the safety of others was the way in which the stair demolition was performed: steps were removed and no warning sign even posted. The landlord’s indifference and lack of response to the tenants’ repeated complaints of dust, sand and water leak problems demonstrated a complete indifference to their health and safety and a lack of concern for the damage these conditions could cause to the tenants’ valuable personal property. Such indifference must be viewed as rising to the level of high moral culpability. Accordingly, the award of punitive damages is sustained.</p>

Miller</i>, 94 A. 1055, 1056 (Pa. 1915). A breach of the covenant can be demonstrated through constructive eviction, if the tenant can establish that the utility of the premises has been substantially and fundamentally impaired. The manner in which defendant leased to the Hair Cuttery violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>
<p id="c5c587e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of a breach of a constructive eviction, [a] lessee may recover “for all losses which he can prove he has actually sustained, or which he will necessarily sustain, under the circumstances, as a result of the unlawful eviction. The measure of damages has been liberally extended to include . . . profits of the business.” <i>Pollock v. Morelli</i>, 369 A.2d 458, 462 (Pa. Super. 1976). As in any other contract action, the purpose of damages is to restore the injured party to the financial position it would have achieved had the contract been fulfilled. This means that the injured party is “entitled to be reimbursed for the money actually paid out and for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred on the faith of the contract.” <i>Emerman v. Baldwin</i>, 142 A.2d 440, 447 (Pa. Super. 1958).</p>
<p id="c5c587e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the court in this non-jury trial must determine what the financial position of 3000 B.C. would have been if constructive eviction had not occurred. This analysis begins with determining the length of time for which damages must be awarded. The lease from which the plaintiff was evicted expired on August 1, 2006. Although plaintiff argues that the 12-year rental history would allow the court to presume that the lease would have been repeatedly renewed and therefore calculate damages beyond the August 1, 2006 termination date, the court rejects that proposition. In Pennsylvania, a landlord can refuse to renew a lease for any good reason, for no reason, or any bad reason, as long as no constitutionally protected right is violated. Only speculation could determine the length of a new lease of the adjusted rent if the <span title="869" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-869">p. 869</span>court were to calculate damages upon the leap of faith that the lease would be renewed. To determine damages upon these assumptions is to rely on speculation upon speculation. This speculation is impermissible.</p>
<p id="c5c587e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court reviewed the proof presented as to damages. The court began with 3000 B.C.’s losses from the start of the noise, in February 2005, through 3000 B.C.’s forced evacuation in December 2005, including attorneys’ fees, moving expenses, and additional rent that 3000 B.C. was required to pay. The court also awarded 3000 B.C. damages for spa credits given to customers whose treatments had been destroyed as well as loss of business good will, or the value of a business’ reputation, noting that the disruption “necessarily causes consternation, hard feelings, ill will, and dismay among clients in a business which had been providing healthful therapeutic serenity to customers for over 12 years at the same location.” The court, however, declined to award damages for the expense of retraining new staff for the new location, which the court found would have occurred at the natural termination of the lease. All told, the court awarded $236,233.45 in damages.]</p>

<p id="c5c587eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Express and implied terms in the landlord-tenant relationship.</b> The landlord-tenant relationship is governed partly by the <b>express terms</b> of any written lease. The landlord-tenant relationship is also governed by <b>implied terms</b>. These terms need not be written down or even explicitly discussed to be legally binding. They may or may not be waivable by the parties. One important term implied in every landlord-tenant relationship by common law or statute is the <b>covenant of quiet enjoyment</b> by which the landlord impliedly promises not to disturb the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the property. Other implied terms that are frequently recognized include reasonable rights of access across land or through non-leased portions of a building, see, e.g., <i>Kysar v. Amoco Product Co.</i>, 93 P.3d 1272 (N.M. 2004), or for parking next to a retail store, see <i>Sierad v. Lilly</i>, 22 Cal. Rptr. 580 (Dist. Ct. App. 1962).</p>
<p id="c5c587ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Actual eviction.</b> If the landlord breaches the lease by physically barring the tenant from the property, the tenant’s obligation to pay rent ceases entirely. The placement of new locks on the door constitutes actual eviction. <i>Olin v. Goehler</i>, 694 P.2d 1129 (Wash. Ct. App. 1985); <i>see also Sengul v. CMS Franklin, Inc.</i>, 265 P.3d 320, 326 (Alaska 2011). The tenant also may sue the landlord for damages for trespass and may seek an injunction ordering the landlord to reconvey possession of the premises to the tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c587ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if the landlord bars the tenant from only <i>part</i> of the leased property? A <b>partial actual eviction</b> constitutes a breach of the lease and provides the tenant with ample justification to move out before the end of the lease term; the tenant will not be liable for the rent after moving out. <i>But see Eastside Exhibition Corp. v. 210 East 86th Street Corp.</i>, 965 N.E.2d 246 (N.Y. 2012) (relaxing the traditional rule by holding that a commercial landlord’s interference with possession of 12 square feet of space out of a total of 15,000 square feet does not constitute a partial actual eviction entitling the tenant to a full rent abatement). What happens if the tenant chooses to stay? The <span title="870" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-870">p. 870</span>traditional rule relieves the tenant of the obligation to pay rent <i>completely</i> even though the tenant continues to occupy the rest of the premises. But the more recent trend seems to be to <i>abate</i> the rent (reduce it) to the fair market value of the property that remains. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §6.1 (1977).</p>
<p id="c5c587ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Constructive eviction.</b> A “constructive” eviction occurs when the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. The defense of constructive eviction allows the tenant to stop rent payments and move out before the end of the lease term. The theory is that when the landlord allows the conditions in the apartment to deteriorate such that living in the apartment is either impossible or uncomfortable, her actions are functionally equivalent to physically barring the tenant from the premises.</p>
<p id="c5c587ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if the tenant stops paying rent and fails to move out? The traditional rule is that the tenant can raise a defense of constructive eviction only if he moves out within a reasonable period of time. To establish constructive eviction, the tenant must claim that the landlord’s interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises is so substantial that nobody in his right mind would stay there; the place is uninhabitable and, therefore, the landlord’s actions are equivalent to barring the door. If, however, the tenant <i>stays</i>, then this can be used as evidence that the interference is not sufficiently serious to justify allowing the tenant to stop paying rent or ending the leasehold. <i>Barash v. Pennsylvania Terminal Real Estate Corp.</i>, 256 N.E.2d 707 (N.Y. 1970).</p>
<p id="c5c5af00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>East Haven Associates, Inc. v. Gurian,</i> 313 N.Y.S.2d 927 (Civ. Ct. 1970), on which the court in <i>Minjak</i> relies, held that tenants could establish a defense of <b>partial constructive eviction</b>. Under this doctrine, tenants can show that the landlord’s actions have substantially deprived the tenant of the use and enjoyment of a portion of the property. The defense of partial constructive eviction may allow the tenant to continue living in the remaining part of the premises from which the tenant does not claim to have been constructively evicted. <i>Minjak</i> illustrates that the remedy for partial constructive eviction for the tenant who wants to stay is likely to be a partial, rather than complete, abatement of rent. The court in <i>East Haven</i> explained the basis for the doctrine, <i>id</i>. at 930-931:</p>

<p id="c5c5af01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It cannot be seriously disputed that a major shortage in residential housing has prevailed in our metropolitan area for several decades. The clear effect has been to undermine so drastically the bargaining power of tenants in relation to landlords that grave questions as to the fairness and relevance of some traditional concepts of landlord-tenant law are presented.</p>
<p id="c5c5af02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The very idea of requiring families to abandon their homes before they can defend against actions for rent is a baffling one in an era in which decent housing is so hard to get, particularly for those who are poor and without resources. It makes no sense at all to say that if part of an apartment has been rendered uninhabitable, a family must move from the entire dwelling before it can seek justice and fair dealing. <i>See Arbern Realty Co. v. Clay Craft Planters Co.</i>, 727 N.Y.S.2d 236 (App. Div. 2001) (applying the partial constructive eviction doctrine in the context of a commercial lease).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c5af03-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="871" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-871">p. 871</span>The <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §6.1 (1977) provides that “there is a breach of the landlord’s obligations if, during the period the tenant is entitled to possession of the leased property, the landlord, or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, interferes with a permissible use of the leased property by the tenant.” The <i>Second Restatement</i> departs from traditional law in several respects. First, it defines constructive eviction as interference that is “more than insignificant” rather than requiring the interference to be “substantial.” Reporter’s note 1. Second, it adopts view that the landlord is liable not only for actions the landlord takes, but also for the acts of third parties “performed on property in which the landlord has an interest, which conduct could be legally controlled by him.” Cmt. d. Third, it rejects the traditional requirement that the tenant abandon the premises before taking advantage of the constructive eviction doctrine, on the ground that “it makes the law completely unavailable to tenants who for one reason or another cannot move, <i>e.g.</i>, indigent urban apartment dwellers in many cities, and available only at great risk to others, who must first deprive themselves of such benefit as they are deriving from the premises before getting a ruling on whether they were justified in doing so.” Reporter’s note 6.</p>
<p id="c5c5af04-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Relation to the implied warranty of habitability.</b> The warranty of habitability, considered in §4.2, below, obligates landlords to provide premises that are safe and suitable for habitation. Breach of the warranty entitles tenants to move out before the end of the lease term or to stay and either stop paying rent or pay a reduced rent until the improper conditions of the premises are fixed. Because of the development of the implied warranty, litigation about constructive eviction now tends to focus less on the physical condition of the premises and more on acts by the landlord that interfere with quiet enjoyment, such as noise or harassment attributable to the landlord. Constructive eviction applies, as well, when the landlord undertakes some activity that interferes with the tenant’s beneficial use of the premises, such as legal action. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Kohl v. PNC Bank National Association</i>, 912 A.2d 237 (Pa. 2006) (landlord lawsuit against tenant that substantially impairs tenant’s possessory interest in bad faith, and primarily other than to seek legal redress constitutes breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment). Constructive eviction also remains a factor for physical conditions attributable to a landlord’s actions for commercial tenants where the warranty of habitability may not apply. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Manhattan Mansions v. Moe’s Pizza</i>, 561 N.Y.S.2d 331 (Civ. Ct. 1990).</p>
<p id="c5c5af05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Tenant’s duties to other tenants.</b> Many written leases contain express clauses obligating tenants not to disturb the quiet enjoyment of other tenants, and many states have statutes, like the URLTA, that require the tenant to “conduct himself and require other persons on the premises with his consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not disturb his neighbors’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises.” URLTA §3.101(7). Breach of this obligation would entitle the landlord to evict the tenant. If the tenant’s conduct rises to the level of a common law nuisance, such as excessive noise, others tenants may have remedies for damages or injunctive relief.</p>
<p id="c5c5af06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="872" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-872">p. 872</span><b>6. Landlord’s liability for acts of other tenants.</b> The traditional rule provides that constructive eviction may be shown only if the landlord or someone acting under the landlord has acted in a way that interfered with the tenant’s interest in quiet enjoyment. Under this traditional rule, the landlord is not responsible for the acts of other tenants unless the lease specifically includes an obligation to control the conduct of other tenants. The trend, however, appears to be in the direction of the approach adopted by the <i>Second Restatement</i>. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant)</i> §6.1 (1977); <i>see, e.g.</i>,<i> Arbern Realty Co. v. Clay Craft Planters Co., Inc</i>., 727 N.Y.S.2d 236, 237 (Sup. Ct. 2001) (landlord’s failure to protect tenant’s access for loading and unloading of trucks and parking from another tenant’s interference was a partial constructive eviction); <i>Blackett v. Olanoff,</i> 358 N.E.2d 817 (Mass. 1976); <i>see also Bocchini v. Gorn Management Co.</i>, 515 A.2d 1179, 1184 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1986) (noting that the traditional rule “has been increasingly abandoned”).</p>
<p id="c5c5af07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Blackett</i>, <i>supra</i>, landlords who were renting apartments also leased nearby premises to a cocktail lounge that was intending to play live music. The lounge, however, played music almost daily until 1:30 or 2 in the morning that was loud enough for neighboring residents to hear through the granite walls of their building. In finding the landlord liable for violation of the residential tenants’ covenant of quiet enjoyment, the court paid particular attention to the fact that the landlord had the right under its lease to the lounge to control lounge’s noise.</p>
<p id="c5c5af08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the absence of such a clause, should a tenant have an implied duty not to disturb his neighbors such that violation of the duty would constitute a breach of the lease and entitle the landlord to evict the tenant? Should the landlord have not only the <i>right</i> but the <i>obligation</i> to evict a noisy tenant to protect the interests of neighboring tenants? Should it be enough to find a violation of a tenant’s covenant of quiet enjoyment that a landlord rents to a new tenant whose use of the premises is likely to conflict with the existing tenant’s use?</p>

<p id="c5c5d623-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before the 1970s, most courts held that landlords had no implied duty to repair the rented premises and that leaseholds included no implied representations that the apartment was in habitable condition. The only exception to this principle was that landlords had a duty to fix latent defects known to them and not easily discoverable by the tenant. If the tenant wanted a warranty or a contractual obligation on the landlord to maintain the apartment, she had to bargain for it.</p>
<p id="c5c5d624-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts also held that the contractual obligations of the landlord and tenant were <b>independent</b> rather than <b>dependent</b>. This meant that, contrary to other kinds of contracts, the parties’ obligations to perform were not contingent on the other party’s performance. Thus, the tenant’s obligation to pay rent was enforceable by the landlord even if the landlord herself was violating a covenant to repair the premises. The tenant’s only remedy was to sue the landlord for damages. To terminate the lease, the tenant needed to show constructive eviction; thus, any defects or failures to repair that did not rise to the level of constructive eviction prevented the tenant from lawfully getting out of the lease early, even if there was a covenant to repair and the landlord was breaching the agreement.</p>
<p id="c5c5d625-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years, most states have repudiated both the lack of a duty to repair or maintain and the independent covenants rule, at least in the context of residential housing. Starting around 1970, there was a virtual revolution in residential landlord-tenant law. Before 1970, courts viewed a leasehold solely as a transfer of a property interest; the landlord granted the tenant the right to possess the premises for a specified period of time, conditional on an agreed-upon rent. The landlord’s obligations were limited to transferring possession; constructive eviction was seen as a failure to comply with this duty. The tenant had a duty to pay the rent and not to commit waste by damaging the property. No other obligations attended the relationship, which was governed by <i>caveat emptor</i> or <i>caveat lessee</i> — let the buyer beware.</p>

However, they alleged numerous [1,500] violations of the Housing Regulations as “an equitable defense or (a) claim by way of recoupment or set-off in an amount equal to the rent claim,” as provided in the rules of the Court of General Sessions. Appellants conceded at trial, however, that this offer of proof reached only violations which had arisen since the term of the lease had commenced.</p>

<p id="c5c5fd44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since, in traditional analysis, a lease was the conveyance of an interest in land, courts have usually utilized the special rules governing real property transactions to resolve controversies involving leases. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in another context, “the body of private property law . . . more than almost any other branch of law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical.” Courts have a duty to reappraise old doctrines in the light of the facts and values of contemporary life — particularly old common law doctrines which the courts themselves created and developed. As we have said before, “The continued vitality of the common law . . . depends upon its ability to reflect contemporary community values and ethics.”<span title="875" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-875">p. 875</span></p>

<p id="c5c6245a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The assumption of landlord-tenant law, derived from feudal property law, that a lease primarily conveyed to the tenant an interest in land may have been reasonable in a rural, agrarian society; it may continue to be reasonable in some leases involving farming or commercial land. In these cases, the value of the lease to the tenant is the land itself. But in the case of the modern apartment dweller, the value of the lease is that it gives him a place to live. The city dweller who seeks to lease an apartment on the third floor of a tenement has little interest in the land 30 or 40 feet below, or even in the bare right to possession within the four walls of his apartment. When American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek “shelter” today, they seek a well known package of goods and services — a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.</p>
<p id="c5c6245b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have realized that certain of the old rules of property law governing leases are inappropriate for today’s transactions. In order to reach results more in accord with the legitimate expectations of the parties and the standards of the community, courts have been gradually introducing more modern precepts of contract law in interpreting leases.</p>
<p id="c5c6245c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our judgment the trend toward treating leases as contracts is wise and well considered. Our holding in this case reflects a belief that leases of urban dwelling units should be interpreted and construed like any other contract.</p>
<p id="c5c6245d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c5c6245e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern contract law has recognized that the buyer of goods and services in an industrialized society must rely upon the skill and honesty of the supplier to assure that goods and services purchased are of adequate quality. In interpreting most contracts, courts have sought to protect the legitimate expectations of the buyer and have steadily widened the seller’s responsibility for the quality of goods and services through implied warranties of fitness and merchantability.</p>
<p id="c5c6245f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rigid doctrines of real property law have tended to inhibit the application of implied warranties to transactions involving real estate. Now, however, courts have begun to hold sellers and developers of real property responsible for the quality of their product. For example, builders of new homes have recently been held liable to purchasers for improper construction on the ground that the builders had breached an implied warranty of fitness. In other cases courts have held builders of new homes <span title="876" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-876">p. 876</span>liable for breach of an implied warranty that all local building regulations had been complied with.</p>
<p id="c5c62460-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite this trend in the sale of real estate, many courts have been unwilling to imply warranties of quality, specifically a warranty of habitability, into leases of apartments. Recent decisions have offered no convincing explanation for their refusal; rather they have relied without discussion upon the old common law rule that the lessor is not obligated to repair unless he covenants to do so in the written lease contract. However, the Supreme Courts of at least two states, in recent and well reasoned opinions, have held landlords to implied warranties of quality in housing leases. <i>Lemle v. Breeden</i>, 462 P.2d 470 (Haw. 1969); <i>Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper</i>, 251 A.2d 268 (N.J. 1969). In our judgment, the old no-repair rule cannot coexist with the obligations imposed on the landlord by a typical modern housing code, and must be abandoned in favor of an implied warranty of habitability. In the District of Columbia, the standards of this warranty are set out in the Housing Regulations.</p>
<p id="c5c62461-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>IV</i></p>
<p id="c5c62462-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A</i></p>
<p id="c5c62463-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our judgment the common law itself must recognize the landlord’s obligation to keep his premises in a habitable condition. This conclusion is compelled by three separate considerations. First, we believe that the old rule was based on certain factual assumptions which are no longer true; on its own terms, it can no longer be justified. Second, we believe that the consumer protection cases discussed above require that the old rule be abandoned in order to bring residential landlord-tenant law into harmony with the principles on which those cases rest. Third, we think that the nature of today’s urban housing market also dictates abandonment of the old rule.</p>
<p id="c5c62464-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law rule absolving the lessor of all obligation to repair originated in the early Middle Ages. Such a rule was perhaps well suited to an agrarian economy; the land was more important than whatever small living structure was included in the leasehold, and the tenant farmer was fully capable of making repairs himself. These historical facts were the basis on which the common law constructed its rule; they also provided the necessary prerequisites for its application.</p>
<p id="c5c62465-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Court decisions in the late 1800’s began to recognize that the factual assumptions of the common law were no longer accurate in some cases. For example, the common law, since it assumed that the land was the most important part of the leasehold, required a tenant to pay rent even if any building on the land was destroyed. Faced with such a rule and the ludicrous results it produced, in 1863 the New York Court of Appeals declined to hold that an upper story tenant was obliged to continue paying rent after his apartment building burned down. The court simply pointed out that the urban tenant had no interest in the land, only in the attached building.</p>
<p id="c5c62466-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law’s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing <span title="877" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-877">p. 877</span>patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.</p>
<p id="c5c64b77-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today’s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in “a house suitable for occupation.” Furthermore, today’s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the “jack-of-all-trades” farmer who was the common law’s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant’s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today’s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.</p>
<p id="c5c64b78-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our approach to the common law of landlord and tenant ought to be aided by principles derived from the consumer protection cases referred to above. In a lease contract, a tenant seeks to purchase from his landlord shelter for a specified period of time. The landlord sells housing as a commercial businessman and has much greater opportunity, incentive and capacity to inspect and maintain the condition of his building. Moreover, the tenant must rely upon the skill and bona fides of his landlord at least as much as a car buyer must rely upon the car manufacturer. In dealing with major problems, such as heating, plumbing, electrical or structural defects, the tenant’s position corresponds precisely with “the ordinary consumer who cannot be expected to have the knowledge or capacity or even the opportunity to make adequate inspection of mechanical instrumentalities, like automobiles, and to decide for himself whether they are reasonably fit for the designed purpose.” <i>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc.</i>, 161 A.2d 69, 78 (N.J. 1960).</p>
<p id="c5c64b79-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since a lease contract specifies a particular period of time during which the tenant has a right to use his apartment for shelter, he may legitimately expect that the apartment will be fit for habitation for the time period for which it is rented. We point out that in the present cases there is no allegation that appellants’ apartments were in poor condition or in violation of the housing code at the commencement of the leases. Since the lessees continue to pay the same rent, they were entitled to expect that the landlord would continue to keep the premises in their beginning condition during the lease term. It is precisely such expectations that the law now recognizes as deserving of formal, legal protection.</p>
<p id="c5c64b7a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even beyond the rationale of traditional products liability law, the relationship of landlord and tenant suggests further compelling reasons for the law’s protection of the tenants’ legitimate expectations of quality. The inequality in bargaining power between landlord and tenant has been well documented. Tenants have very little leverage to enforce demands for better housing. Various impediments to competition in the rental housing market, such as racial and class discrimination and standardized <span title="878" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-878">p. 878</span>form leases, mean that landlords place tenants in a take it or leave it situation. The increasingly severe shortage of adequate housing further increases the landlord’s bargaining power and escalates the need for maintaining and improving the existing stock. Finally, the findings by various studies of the social impact of bad housing has led to the realization that poor housing is detrimental to the whole society, not merely to the unlucky ones who must suffer the daily indignity of living in a slum.</p>
<p id="c5c64b7b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus we are led by our inspection of the relevant legal principles and precedents to the conclusion that the old common law rule imposing an obligation upon the lessee to repair during the lease term was really never intended to apply to residential urban leaseholds. Contract principles established in other areas of the law provide a more rational framework for the apportionment of landlord-tenant responsibilities; they strongly suggest that a warranty of habitability be implied into all contracts for urban dwellings.</p>
<p id="c5c64b7c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B</i></p>
<p id="c5c64b7d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe, in any event, that the District’s housing code requires that a warranty of habitability be implied in the leases of all housing that it covers. The housing code — formally designated the Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia — was established and authorized by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia on August 11, 1955. Since that time, the code has been updated by numerous orders of the Commissioners. The 75 pages of the Regulations provide a comprehensive regulatory scheme setting forth in some detail: (a) the standards which housing in the District of Columbia must meet; (b) which party, the lessor or the lessee, must meet each standard; and (c) a system of inspections, notifications and criminal penalties. The Regulations themselves are silent on the question of private remedies.</p>
<p id="c5c64b7e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two previous decisions of this court, however, have held that the Housing Regulations create legal rights and duties enforceable in tort by private parties. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals gave further effect to the Housing Regulations in <i>Brown v. Southall Realty Co.</i>, 237 A.2d 834 (D.C. 1968). There the landlord knew at the time the lease was signed that housing code violations existed which rendered the apartment “unsafe and unsanitary.” Viewing the lease as a contract, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the premises were let in violation of Sections 2304 and 2501 of the Regulations and that the lease, therefore, was void as an illegal contract. In the light of <i>Brown</i>, it is clear not only that the housing code creates privately enforceable duties, but that the basic validity of every housing contract depends upon substantial compliance with the housing code at the beginning of the lease term. The <i>Brown</i> court relied particularly upon Section 2501 of the Regulations which provides:</p>

This part of this Code contemplates more than mere basic repairs and maintenance to keep out the elements; its purpose is to include repairs and maintenance designed to make a premises or neighborhood healthy and safe.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c64b80-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By its terms, this section applies to maintenance and repair during the lease term. Under the <i>Brown</i> holding, serious failure to comply with this section before the lease <span title="879" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-879">p. 879</span>term begins renders the contract void. We think it untenable to find that this section has no effect on the contract after it has been signed. To the contrary, by signing the lease the landlord has undertaken a continuing obligation to the tenant to maintain the premises in accordance with all applicable law.</p>
<p id="c5c64b81-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This principle of implied warranty is well established. Courts often imply relevant law into contracts to provide a remedy for any damage caused by one party’s illegal conduct.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E32_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E32_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span></p>

The duties imposed by the Housing Regulations may not be waived or shifted by agreement if the Regulations specifically place the duty upon the lessor. Criminal penalties are provided if these duties are ignored. This regulatory structure was established by the Commissioners because, in their judgment, the grave conditions in the housing market required serious action. Yet official enforcement of the housing code has been far from uniformly effective. Innumerable studies have documented the desperate condition of rental housing in the District of Columbia and in the nation.</p>
<p id="c5c64b84-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that the Housing Regulations imply a warranty of habitability, measured by the standards which they set out, into leases of all housing that they cover.</p>

Under contract principles, however, the tenant’s obligation to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord’s performance of his obligations, including his warranty to maintain the premises in habitable condition. In order to determine whether any rent is owed to the landlord, the tenants must be given an opportunity to prove the housing code violations alleged as breach of the landlord’s warranty.</p>
<p id="c5c64b87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, the finder of fact must make two findings: (1) whether the alleged violations<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E53_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10E53_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span> existed during the period for which past due rent is claimed, and (2) what portion, if any or all, of the tenant’s obligation to pay rent was suspended by the landlord’s breach.

<p id="c5c6729d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Common law evolution and the judicial role.</b> The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the federal court to which Judge J. Skelly Wright had been appointed by President Kennedy, regularly heard landlord-tenant matters in the 1960s. In a letter to Professor Edward Rabin, Judge Wright reflected on why there were such significant changes in landlord-tenant law in that period. “I was indeed influenced,” Judge Wright noted, “by the fact that, during the nationwide racial turmoil of the sixties and the unrest caused by the injustice of racially selective service in Vietnam, most of the tenants in Washington, D.C. slums were poor and black and most of the landlords were rich and white. There is no doubt in my mind that these conditions played a subconscious role in influencing my landlord and tenant decisions.” Edward H. Rabin, <i>The Revolution in Landlord-Tenant Law: Causes and Consequences</i>, 69 Cornell L. Rev. 517, 549 (1984) (quoting an October 14, 1982 letter from Judge J. Skelly Wright). Were these legitimate considerations to influence Judge Wright? Would it have been possible for a judge sitting in the District of Columbia to rule on landlord-tenant matters at the time without considering them?</p>
<p id="c5c6729e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Allowing the tenant to raise the landlord’s violation of the housing code or analogous failures to provide habitable premises makes eviction proceedings considerably more complicated, drawn out, and expensive. Because of this, the defense seems to contradict the policy underlying summary process statutes, whose purpose was to provide the landlord with relatively expeditious proceedings for eviction of tenants who were violating the terms of the lease. Is the implied warranty of habitability compatible with the policies underlying summary process statutes? If so, how?</p>
<p id="c5c6729f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may (or may not) be helpful to note that many states responded to the judicial creation of the implied warranty of habitability by incorporating it into their landlord-tenant legislation. To the extent the implied warranty violated the purpose or intent of the summary process statutes, these legislative enactments explicitly or implicitly amended the summary process procedure by allowing tenants to raise the warranty as a defense to a claim for possession.</p>

Relation to building and housing codes.</b> Building codes set minimum requirements for a building’s structural safety, water and waste systems, mechanical equipment, electrical wiring, and other standards. Housing codes more directly regulate the safety and sanitary conditions of residential buildings, typically addressing requirements for minimum dwelling space, ventilation, and adequate services. These codes are generally administered and enforced by local government agencies. Many housing codes also provide statutory rights to tenants, such as the right to escrow rent while violations are outstanding or even to terminate the lease. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Mich. Comp. Laws §125.53; Ohio Rev. Code §5321.07B. If a condition in a rental unit fails to meet the standards of the housing code, a tenant may have distinct rights under her lease and the housing code.</p>

Majority rule.</b> The implied warranty of habitability has been adopted in almost all states for residential tenancies. However, there are still a few holdouts. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Harper v. Coleman</i>, 705 So. 2d 388 (Ala. Civ. App. 1996), <i>rev’d on other grounds by Ex parte Coleman</i>, 705 So. 2d 392 (Ala. 1997).</p>
<p id="c5c672a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the warranty waivable or disclaimable? If so, then it is merely a <b>presumption</b> or <b>default</b> position that the courts will assume to be the agreement of the parties in the absence of language to the contrary. If the implied warranty is <b>nondisclaimable</b> or <b>nonwaivable</b>, it constitutes a <b>compulsory term</b> in the contract that the parties have no power to alter by agreement. <i>Javins</i> provided that “[a]ny private agreement to shift the duties would be illegal and unenforceable.” 428 F.2d at 1082 n.58. This position is supported in most jurisdictions by statute or common law. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Hilder v. St. Peter</i>, 478 A.2d 202, 210 (Vt. 1984); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, §14.</p>
<p id="c5c672a4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states measure the landlord’s obligations by reference to state or local housing codes, holding that the warranty is breached when the landlord fails to comply with applicable building code provisions so as to materially impair health and safety. Other courts, however, have measured the landlord’s obligations independently of the applicable housing code, holding that landlords have an obligation to conform with “general community standards of suitability for occupancy.” Robert S. Schoshinski, <i>American Law of Landlord and Tenant</i> §3:17, at 128 (1980). <i>See Detling v. Edelbrock</i>, 671 S.W.2d 265, 270 (Mo. 1984) (habitability to be judged by community standards, including but not limited to local housing codes). Examples of problems that are likely to violate the implied warranty include lack of heat or hot water, broken windows, pest infestation, and leaky roofs.</p>
<p id="c5c672a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a landlord fails to provide a necessary service, such as heat or hot water, does the tenant have an immediate right to a rent reduction when the problem occurs to compensate for the lowered rental value of the premises, or does the landlord have a grace period within which to fix the problem? Many courts hold that the implied warranty is not violated until the landlord has been notified of the problem and has a reasonable opportunity to fix it. <i>Chiodini v. Fox</i>, 207 S.W.3d 174, 177 (Mo. Ct. App. <span title="882" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-882">p. 882</span>2006). However, some courts find a violation the moment the condition occurs, <i>Knight v. Hallsthammar</i>, 623 P.2d 268, 273 (Cal. 1981) (breach of warranty existed whether or not landlord had reasonable time to repair defects existing when he purchased the building), and others hold that the violation starts when the landlord is notified, <i>Berman &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson</i>, 396 N.E.2d 981, 985-986 (Mass. 1979) (breach occurred when landlord received notice of lack of heat and hot water, even though he promptly fixed the problem). Which approach is better?</p>
<p id="c5c672a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For commercial leases, most courts have adopted the modern view that the covenants in commercial leases are dependent rather than independent; some, however, have retained the older view that they are independent. <i>Compare Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc.</i>, 774 N.E.2d 611 (Mass. 2002) (covenants in commercial lease are dependent), <i>with Universal Communications Network, Inc. v. 229 West 28th Owner, LLC</i>, 926 N.Y.S.2d 479, 480 (N.Y. App. Div. 2011) (covenants in commercial lease independent unless lease terms state otherwise). On the other hand, while a few states find an implied warranty of suitability for intended purposes to commercial leases, <i>e.g., Davidow v. Inwood N. Professional Group</i>, 747 S.W.2d 373 (Tex. 1988), most still do not do so, holding that commercial leases have no implied warranties unless they state so explicitly. <i>Pinzon v. A &amp; G Props.</i>, 874 A.2d 347, 351 (D.C. 2005); <i>Propst v. McNeill</i>, 932 S.W.2d 766 (Ark. 1996); <i>B.W.S. Investments v. Mid-Am Restaurant, Inc</i>., 459 N.W.2d 759 (N.D. 1990). And those few states that do recognize warranties for commercial leases make them disclaimable. <i>See Gym-N-I Playgrounds, Inc. v. Snider</i>, 220 S.W.2d 905 (Tex. 2007). Does it make sense to distinguish commercial from residential leases in terms of the expectations of the parties and the other grounds Judge Wright discussed in <i>Javins</i>?</p>
<p id="c5c672a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Remedies.</b> Various remedies are available to vindicate the tenant’s rights under the implied warranty of habitability. In most states, the remedies available to tenants come from a combination of common law doctrines and specific statutory provisions, some of which may explicitly modify or limit common law remedies. <i>See</i> URLTA §§4.104-4.105; <i>see also</i> RURLTA §§401-409. The most important remedies are discussed below.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c672a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Rescission, or the right to move out before the end of the lease term.</b> The landlord’s violation of his contractual obligation to provide a habitable apartment entitles the tenant to stop performance of her contractual obligations. Thus, the tenant may repudiate the contract and move out before the end of the lease term without being liable for rent for the months remaining on the lease. This is the case when breach of the warranty of habitability results in a material change in housing conditions even when that change would not amount to constructive eviction. <i>Wesson v. Leone Enterprises, Inc., supra</i> (finding this result in the case of a commercial lease). Suppose the tenant moves out five months before the end of the lease term, and the landlord sues the tenant for the remaining five months’ rent. If the tenant can show that the landlord violated the implied warranty of habitability, then the tenant has a defense to the landlord’s claim for the remaining rent.</p>
<p id="c5c672a9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Rent withholding.</b> If the landlord breaches the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant ordinarily has the right to stop paying rent and continue living <span title="883" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-883">p. 883</span>in the premises. If the landlord sues the tenant for back rent owed, the tenant may raise the violation of the warranty as a defense to the claim for back rent. If the landlord has breached the implied warranty, then the tenant’s failure to pay rent does not constitute a breach of the tenant’s contractual obligations; rather, the tenant had a legal right to stop paying rent under the circumstances. This distinguishes the implied warranty of habitability from constructive eviction, which ordinarily requires the tenant to move out to become entitled to stop paying rent before the end of the lease term.</p>
<p id="c5c672aa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the landlord sues the tenant for possession on the grounds of nonpayment of rent, the tenant can raise the violation of the warranty as a defense to the eviction proceedings. If the defense is established, the landlord will not be allowed to evict the tenant, who will be able to continue living in the apartment.</p>
<p id="c5c699bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is advisable for tenants who are contemplating rent withholding to determine whether any statutes regulate their ability to withhold rent. These statutes may, for example, require that the tenant give notice to the landlord of the defect in the premises before the tenant is entitled to withhold rent. They may also limit rent withholding to situations in which the tenant has verified the complaint by calling a local housing inspector to document the existence and seriousness of the housing code violation.</p>
<p id="c5c699bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is also advisable for tenants who stop paying rent to the landlord to deposit the usual rental amount in a separate account, called an <b>escrow</b> account. If it turns out that the tenant was not entitled to withhold rent, the court will order the tenant to pay back rent to the landlord. If the tenant is unable to pay this back rent within a reasonable period of time, the tenant can be evicted. It is therefore advisable for the tenant to save, rather than spend, the money that would otherwise be going to the landlord as the monthly rent. Some states may have statutes requiring tenants to make rental payments to an escrow account. In the alternative, these statutes may allow the landlord to go to court for an order requiring the tenant to pay the rent into an escrow account held by the court clerk pending adjudication.</p>
<p id="c5c699bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Rent abatement.</b> When the landlord violates the implied warranty of habitability, the tenant ordinarily is entitled to a reduction in the rent, also known as <b>rent abatement</b>. The tenant can sue the landlord for a declaratory judgment that the landlord has violated the implied warranty of habitability and ask the court to order the landlord to reimburse the tenant for all or a portion of the rent previously paid to the landlord during the period of the violation.</p>
<p id="c5c699be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Usually, however, the tenant withholds rent, waits to be sued by the landlord for back rent or possession, then argues that the rent should be abated for the period of the violation. When the case is adjudicated, the court ordinarily will determine what, if any, portion of the rent withheld should be paid back to the landlord. If the violation of the implied warranty is quite serious, the landlord may get nothing for the period of the violation. If the violation is less serious, the court may rule that the tenant is obligated to pay a portion of the rent, such as 25 or 50 percent.</p>
<p id="c5c699bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The amount of the rent deduction depends on the test used in the jurisdiction. Some states apply a <b>fair market value</b> test. The amount of rent owed to the <span title="884" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-884">p. 884</span>landlord during the period of the violation is based on the fair market value of the premises “as is” or with the defect. Most states simply reduce the rent by a percentage amount that reflects the seriousness of the violation and the amount of discomfort experienced by the tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c699c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>d. Repair and deduct.</b> The tenant may be able to pay for needed repairs herself and then deduct the cost of the repairs from the rent paid to the landlord. Local statutes may regulate this practice by limiting the amount deducted or the kinds of repairs allowed.</p>
<p id="c5c699c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>e. Injunctive relief, or specific performance.</b> Some states, by statute or common law, allow tenants to bring a lawsuit against the landlord for an injunction ordering the landlord to comply with the housing code by making needed repairs.</p>
<p id="c5c699c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>f. Administrative remedies.</b> Finally, many states provide for administrative remedies. The local housing code may include procedures for enforcement by local housing inspectors. For example, the aggrieved tenant may be able to call the local housing inspector to ask for a rapid inspection of the apartment. If the inspector finds material violations of the housing code, the inspector may then contact the landlord herself and order repairs to be made. If the landlord fails to make repairs, the inspector may be empowered to bring a court action for injunctive relief, ordering the landlord to comply with the housing code. The inspector may also seek civil damages against the landlord as provided by statute; these damages are paid to the state rather than to the tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c699c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>g. Criminal penalties.</b> Building codes may provide for criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for landlords who fail to fix dangerous and unlawful conditions in their apartment buildings. Judges have even ordered recalcitrant landlords to live for a period of time in one of their substandard buildings as punishment for continued and unconscionable violations of the law. Luz Delgado, <i>Landlord Forced to Live in His Decrepit Property</i>, Boston Globe, June 10, 1992, at 50.</p>
<p id="c5c699c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>h. Compensatory damages.</b> In most cases, tenants raise the implied warranty of habitability as a defense to claims by landlords for back rent or possession. Sometimes, however, tenants bring claims for compensatory damages against landlords for violation of the implied warranty either as independent lawsuits or as counterclaims to landlord suits. A claim for damages may seek an amount of money that exceeds the rent rather than merely a reduction in the rent or reimbursement for some of the rent already paid. <i>See Hilder v. St. Peter</i>,<i> supra</i> (tenant claim for damages). Damages might exceed the amount of the rent if the violation harms valuable personal property of the tenant, such as the expensive musical equipment owned by the tenant in <i>Minjak</i> (<i>see</i> §4.1, above), or if the tenant seeks reimbursement for the costs of staying in a hotel while the premises were uninhabitable. Ordinarily, however, courts are likely to assume that a judgment for breach of the duty of habitability cannot exceed the agreed-upon rent on the ground that the rental amount constitutes the value of what was lost by the tenant.</p>
<p id="c5c699c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Damages for personal injury may require a showing of negligence on the part of the landlord, which may or may not be present in the context of a violation of <span title="885" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-885">p. 885</span>the implied warranty.

Mitchell</i>, 391 N.E.2d 1288 (1979), a 17-day strike by an apartment complex owner’s staff interrupted maintenance and left piles of rotting garbage, which created conditions so serious that the New York City Department of Health declared a health emergency. Some tenants withheld rent for the period of the strike and when the landlord sued for nonpayment, one tenant asserted the implied warranty of habitability as a defense. The New York Court of Appeals agreed with the tenant that the landlord was responsible for conditions in the complex notwithstanding the strike, holding that “conditions occasioned by . . . acts of third parties or natural disaster are within the scope of the warranty.” <i>Id.</i> at 1294.</p>
<p id="c5c699c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a general consensus among scientists that climate change is likely increasing the frequency and intensity of certain weather-related events such as extreme coastal high water, although there remain significant questions of measurement. <i>See</i> Sonia Seneviratne et al., <i>Changes in Climate Extremes and Their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment</i>, in <i>Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation</i> 178-180 (A Special Report of Working Groups I and II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge University Press 2012). If this trend continues, questions of liability for natural disaster, and how best to adapt to a changing climate, are likely to loom larger in many areas of property law, including landlord-tenant. <i>Cf.</i> John A. Lovett,<i> Property and Radically Changed Circumstances: Hurricane Katrina and Beyond</i>, 74 Tenn. L. Rev. 463, 495-510 (2007).</p>
<p id="c5c699c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New York City experienced severe flooding, with many tenants losing electricity, heat, and other essential services. <i>See</i> Damon Howard, <i>Landlord-Tenant Obligations in the Aftermath of Hurricane Sandy</i>, 248 N.Y. L.J. 4 (2012). Should the warranty of habitability apply to these kinds of wide-scale disasters? If not, why not? Who is likely to be in a better position to respond, landlords or tenants? Or is another institutional response necessary?</p>
<p id="c5c6c0d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Impact of the implied warranty?</b> How important is the implied warranty of habitability in practice? The promise of the warranty — and the broader revolution in landlord-tenant law of which it was a part — requires tenants to have the resources and knowledge to assert their rights in litigation. It also requires capable advocates and courts that are institutionally equipped to resolve the often complex questions raised by issues such as failure to repair and landlord retaliation. Indeed, one reason why <i>Javins</i> was brought was that a Neighborhood Legal Services Program office was located at Clifton Terrace. <i>See</i> Richard H. Chused, <i>Saunders</i> (a.k.a.<i> Javins</i>)<i> v. First National Realty Corporation</i>, in <i>Property Stories</i> 136 (Gerald Korngold &amp; Andrew P. Morriss eds. 2d ed. 2009).</p>
<p id="c5c6c0da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor David Super argues that formal limitations in the doctrine, notably that tenants who withhold rent in many states must show that they did so solely to contest repair issues and the practice of landlords obtaining protective orders requiring tenants to deposit rent as condition of raising a warranty defense, have undermined the <span title="886" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-886">p. 886</span>warranty. Super also points to a court system with few resources and a propensity to favor landlords as repeat players as factors in limiting the warranty’s impact. <i>See</i> David A. Super, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Implied Warranty of Habitability</i>, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 389 (2011). How might these shortcomings be remedied? Would our legal system be better off without an affirmative obligation on the part of landlords to maintain habitable premises, even if relatively few tenants are able to succeed in pressing claims in court based on this duty?</p>

The landlord fails to maintain the premises in a safe condition, allowing hazardous conditions — such as flooding in the tenants’ apartment caused by the operation of a health club with jacuzzis upstairs, the presence of huge clouds of dust caused by the landlord’s renovation work in common areas, and the formation of holes in the stairway — to develop unchecked. Two questions arise.</p>

The legislature is considering a proposed amendment to allow tenants to waive the protections of the implied warranty, possibly by deleting §1.404 from the statute. This does not mean that the landlord would be relieved of the obligation to comply with the relevant provisions of the housing code, which regulates the conditions in rental housing. Rather, the tenant would not be able to raise the landlord’s failure to maintain the apartment in a habitable condition as a defense to a claim for possession or back rent. Thus, by waiving the protection of the implied warranty, the tenant agrees to pay rent regardless of any housing code violations; also, such violations do not entitle the tenant to move out before the end of the lease term and stop paying rent.</p>

The local tenants’ association, on the other hand, argues that the tenant’s right to withhold rent if the landlord fails to maintain the apartment in a habitable condition is the tenant’s most powerful — and perhaps her only <i>effective</i> — way to induce recalcitrant landlords to comply with the housing code.</p>

It is owned by Hillview Associates (Hillview), a partnership based in California. The general partner of Hillview is William Cavanaugh, a resident of California. Management of Gracious Estates has been delegated to a company known as Tandem Management Services, Inc. (Tandem), also owned by Cavanaugh and the other general partners of Hillview. Tandem employed Kathy Nitz as a regional manager, Gennie Smith as park manager and Doug Cavanaugh as property manager at Gracious Estates.</p>
<p id="c5c75d66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January 1987 tenants at Gracious Estates began to meet informally to discuss their concerns over the physical condition of the trailer court and recent increases in rent. On January 28, 1987, the first meeting of a tenant’s association was held in the clubhouse of Gracious Estates, and approximately 125 tenants came to the meeting. This meeting resulted in an agenda of specific concerns for the health, safety and quality of living in Gracious Estates. A volunteer leadership committee was established for the association, now known as the Gracious Estates Tenant’s Association. In the course of organizing and articulating complaints, tenants contacted the Iowa Attorney General’s office and their state representative.</p>
<p id="c5c75d67-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 9, 1987, a meeting was held between approximately five members of the association, Ms. Nitz and the park maintenance supervisor. The tenants lodged several complaints at this meeting. This meeting lasted approximately one hour and was relatively calm. The relationship between the tenant’s association and the management of Gracious Estates began to erode. The tenants were frustrated with the lack of action taken by the management of Gracious Estates.</p>
<p id="c5c75d68-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A meeting with Ms. Nitz was scheduled for April 15, 1987. A meeting did occur on April 15 between representatives of the tenants association and Ms. Nitz. This “meeting” was held in Nitz’s private office and lasted approximately five to ten minutes. The discussion quickly disintegrated into a shouting match which climaxed in a physical altercation between Nitz and one of the tenants, Kimber Davenport.</p>
<p id="c5c75d69-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After this meeting, the management of the trailer court served ultimatums on all tenants requiring them to sign the park rules or be evicted. Management also sought <span title="892" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-892">p. 892</span>out tenants not in the tenant’s association in an attempt to start a rival tenants’ association favorable to management. On April 22, 1987, Hillview served a thirty-day notice of termination on the following tenants: Tom and Sandra Bloomquist; Kimber and Reva Davenport; Richard and Nellie Swartz; and Donald and Judith Ray. At least one member of each of these married couples was present at the April 15 meeting. A former secretary of Ms. Nitz testified that “they’d [management] get these now, and then the rest later. That way it wouldn’t look like they were doing it because they were members of an association.”</p>
<p id="c5c75d6a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hillview later discovered that the thirty-day notice did not provide specific grounds for termination as required by statute. On June 4, 1987, Hillview again served each of these tenants with a notice of termination which provided a sixty-day period for them to leave. At the end of the sixty-day period, the tenants remained in possession. Hillview then served three-day notices to quit. The tenants remained in the park and Hillview filed a forcible entry and detainer action.</p>

<p id="c5c7838a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1968 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that a landlord was not free to evict a tenant in retaliation for the tenant’s report of housing code violations. As a matter of statutory construction and for reasons of public policy, such an eviction would not be permitted. <i>Edwards v. Habib</i>, 397 F.2d 687, 699 (D.C. Cir. 1968). However, a tenant who proves a retaliatory purpose is not entitled to remain in possession in perpetuity. If the illegal purpose is dissipated, the landlord can, in the absence of legislation or a binding contract, evict the tenant for legitimate reasons or even for no reason at all. The question of permissible or impermissible purpose is one of fact for the court or jury.</p>
<p id="c5c7838b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1979 the Iowa Legislature adopted the <i>Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</i> and the <i>Mobile Home Parks Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.</i> Both acts prohibit retaliatory conduct. <i>See</i> Iowa Code §§562A.36 &amp; 562B.32. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within six months prior to the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation. For the purpose of the statutory subsection “presumption” means the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which could support a finding of its nonexistence.</p>
<p id="c5c7aa9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of statutory construction, we hold this statutory presumption imposes a burden upon the landlord to produce evidence of legitimate nonretaliatory reasons to overcome the presumption. The tenant may then be afforded a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. The burden of proof of the affirmative defense of retaliatory termination of the lease remains upon the tenant. If the landlord does not meet the burden of producing evidence of a nonretaliatory reason for termination, the statutory presumption would compel a finding of retaliatory lease termination. If the landlord does produce evidence of a nonretaliatory purpose for terminating the lease, then the fact-finder must determine from all the evidence whether a retaliatory termination has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Although the burden of producing evidence shifts to the landlord once the tenant has offered evidence of a complaint within six months of the notice of termination, the burden of proof remains with the tenant to establish the affirmative defense.</p>
<p id="c5c7aa9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In deciding whether a tenant has established a defense of retaliatory eviction, we consider the following factors, among others, tending to show the landlord’s primary motivation was not retaliatory.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c7aa9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) The landlord’s decision was a reasonable exercise of business judgment;</p>

</div>
<p id="c5c7aaa5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>V</i></p>
<p id="c5c7aaa6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find the tenants have offered substantial evidence of a retaliatory termination. They were active, vocal members of a newly-formed tenant’s association. They made good faith complaints about the landlord’s failure to maintain the mobile home park in a clean and safe condition. An employee of the landlord testified that certain leases were terminated because the tenants were active members of the tenants association. In response, the landlord has offered substantial evidence of a nonretaliatory reason for termination. The tenants who actively participated in the disturbance and physical abuse of Ms. Nitz during the April 15 meeting were notified of lease termination, other active members of the association were not.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaa7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Ms. Nitz, the tenants surrounded her desk on April 15 and implored her to call California. One of the tenants, Kimber Davenport, placed both hands in the middle of Nitz’s desk, leaned over the desk, shouted that Nitz had a “truck-driver’s mentality” and that she wasn’t a lady. Nitz asked the tenants to leave and all but Mr. and Mrs. Rathburn refused. Ms. Nitz then left her office and, after a cooling-off period, returned and demanded that the other tenants leave the office. She again demanded that they leave and threatened to call the police if they did not. The tenants began to leave. Mr. Davenport was the last to leave, and as he left he continued the verbal abuse of Ms. Nitz and gestured to her with his finger close to her face. According to Ms. Nitz, she pushed his finger away and Davenport struck her in the face, knocking her into a doorjamb. At that point, another tenant, Don Carlson, entered the room and physically removed Davenport.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaa8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Davenport’s testimony concerning the April 15 meeting was very different from Ms. Nitz’s testimony. Davenport testified at the forcible entry and detainer trial that he was polite and reasonable during this meeting. Further, he claimed that he did not place his hands on Nitz’s desk, shout at her, or strike her. Rather, he testified that he pushed her away with an open hand. Davenport’s testimony loses credibility when it is compared with his prior testimony in a criminal case concerning this incident. In his prior testimony, Davenport admitted that he placed his hands in the middle of Ms. Nitz’s desk, shouted insults at her, and struck her.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaa9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several conclusions can fairly be drawn from the evidence. First, the April 15 meeting was initiated by members of a tenant’s association in an attempt to address grievances with the management of the trailer court. This meeting disintegrated into <span title="895" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-895">p. 895</span>a shouting match. The tenants were told to leave three times and they left only after a threat to call the police. We, like the trial court, conclude that Davenport did strike Ms. Nitz in the face as he left the room. He was the principal agitator, quickly leaving the topic of improvements for the park and launching into a personal attack on Ms. Nitz.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under Iowa law, tenants may organize and join a tenant’s association free from fear of retaliation. The tenants may participate in activities designed to legitimately coerce a landlord into taking action to improve living conditions. The presumption of retaliatory eviction in Iowa Code §562B.32 protects legitimate activities of tenant unions or similar organizations.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The resolution of landlord-tenant grievances will normally involve some conflicts and friction between the parties. Arguments, even heated arguments with raised voices, cannot fairly be described as being in violation of proper conduct. There is, however, a limit to the type of conduct that will be tolerated. Kimber Davenport crossed beyond the line of legitimate behavior. Davenport has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the termination of his lease was retaliatory. The termination of the Davenports’ lease was legitimate and thus cannot be said to be retaliation arising from his complaints or union activities.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the statutory presumption of retaliation has been neutralized by the evidence produced by Hillview, we find the evidence of retaliatory eviction concerning tenants Bloomquist, Swartz, and Ray, to be more convincing. Although they were present at the April 15 meeting and did participate in the arguments, they did not encourage or participate in the assault of Ms. Nitz. The landlord’s response by an attempted termination of their leases can reasonably be attributed to their active membership in the tenant’s organization and in response to legitimate complaints they had made.</p>
<p id="c5c7aaad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reject Hillview’s argument that there must be specific intent to retaliate on the part of Hillview’s general partner before the tenants can prevail on a defense of retaliatory eviction. The evidence reveals that the local and regional managers of Gracious Estates made the decision to evict these tenants. The general partner ratified this decision without direct participation in the decision-making process.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The acts of an agent are attributable to the principal. In this situation, to require specific intent by the general partner of a multi-state real estate business would frustrate the intention of Iowa Code §562B.32. Hillview’s interpretation would allow mid-level managers to retaliate against tenant associations and seek refuge by keeping top-level directors uninformed of specific disputes with individual tenants. Tenants Bloomquist, Swartz, and Ray have established by a preponderance of the evidence their affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction. Tenants Davenport have not.</p>

Fout, the defendant below, appeals a summary judgment dismissing his claim of retaliatory eviction based on the provisions of W. Va. Code §§55-3A-3(g), <span title="896" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-896">p. 896</span>which is our summary eviction statute. Imperial Colliery had instituted an eviction proceeding and Fout sought to defend against it, claiming that his eviction was in retaliation for his participation in a labor strike.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case presents two issues: (1) whether a residential tenant who is sued for possession of rental property under W. Va. Code §§55-3A-1, <i>et seq</i>., may assert retaliation by the landlord as a defense, and (2) whether the retaliation motive must relate to the tenant’s exercise of a right incidental to the tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fout is presently employed by Milburn Colliery Company as a coal miner. For six years, he has leased a small house trailer lot in Burnwell, West Virginia, from Imperial Colliery Company. It is alleged that Milburn and Imperial are interrelated companies. A written lease was signed by Fout and an agent of Imperial in June, 1983. This lease was for a primary period of one month, and was terminable by either party upon one month’s notice. An annual rental of $1.00 was payable in advance on January 1 of each year. No subsequent written leases were signed by the parties.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 14, 1986, Imperial advised Fout by certified letter that his lease would be terminated as of March 31, 1986. Fout’s attorney corresponded with Imperial before the scheduled termination date. He advised that due to various family and monetary problems, Fout would be unable to timely vacate the property. Imperial voluntarily agreed to a two-month extension of the lease. A second letter from Fout’s attorney, dated May 27, 1986, recited Fout’s personal problems and requested that Imperial’s attempts to oust Fout be held “in abeyance” until they were resolved. A check for $1.00 was enclosed to cover the proposed extension. Imperial did not reply.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On June 11, 1986, Imperial sued for possession of the property, pursuant to W. Va. Code §§55-3A-1, <i>et seq</i>., in the Magistrate Court of Kanawha County. Fout answered and removed the suit to the circuit court on June 23, 1986. He asserted as a defense that Imperial’s suit was brought in retaliation for his involvement in the United Mine Workers of America and, more particularly, in a selective strike against Milburn. Imperial’s retaliatory motive was alleged to be in violation of the First Amendment rights of speech and assembly, and of the <i>National Labor Relations Act</i>, 29 U.S.C. §§151, <i>et seq</i>. Fout also counter-claimed, seeking an injunction against Imperial and damages for annoyance and inconvenience.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our initial inquiry is whether retaliation by the landlord may be asserted by the tenant as a defense in a suit under W. Va. Code §55-3A-3(g).</p>
<p id="c5c7d1ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears that the first case that recognized retaliatory eviction as a defense to a landlord’s eviction proceeding was <i>Edwards v. Habib</i>, 397 F.2d 687 (D.C. Cir. 1968). [In that case,] the court reviewed at length the goals sought to be advanced by local sanitary and safety codes. It concluded that to allow retaliatory evictions by landlords would seriously jeopardize the efficacy of the codes. A prohibition against such retaliatory conduct was therefore to be implied, even though the regulations were silent on the matter.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states have protected tenant rights either on the <i>Edwards</i> theory or have implied such rights from the tenant’s right of habitability. Others have utilized statutes analogous to section 5.101 of the <i>Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</i>, 7B <span title="897" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-897">p. 897</span>U.L.A. 503 (1985),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11267_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11267_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span> which is now adopted in fifteen jurisdictions. Similar landlord and tenant reform statutes in seventeen other states also provide protection for tenancy-related activities.</p>
<p id="c5c7d1d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under W. Va. Code §37-6-30, a tenant is, with respect to residential property, entitled to certain rights to a fit and habitable dwelling. In <i>Teller v. McCoy</i>, 253 S.E.2d 114 (W. Va. 1978), we spoke at some length of the common law right of habitability which a number of courts had developed to afford protection to the residential tenant. We concluded that these rights paralleled and were spelled out in more detail in W. Va. Code §37-6-30.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central theme underlying the retaliatory eviction defense is that a tenant should not be punished for claiming the benefits afforded by health and safety statutes passed for his protection. These statutory benefits become a part of his right of habitability. If the right to habitability is to have any meaning, it must enable the tenant to exercise that right by complaining about unfit conditions without fear of reprisal by his landlord.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the seminal decision in <i>Edwards</i>, other categories of tenant activity were deemed to be protected. Such activity was protected against retaliation where it bore a relationship to some legitimate aspect of the tenancy. For example, some cases provided protection for attempts by tenants to organize to protect their rights as tenants. Others recognized the right to press complaints directly against the landlord via oral communications, petitions, and “repair and deduct” remedies.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A few courts recognize that even where a tenant’s activity is only indirectly related to the tenancy relationship, it may be protected against retaliatory conduct if such conduct would undermine the tenancy relationship. Typical of these cases is <i>Windward Partners v. Delos Santos</i>, 577 P.2d 326 (Haw. 1978). There a group of month-to-month tenants gave testimony before a state land use commission in opposition to a proposal to redesignate their farm property from “agricultural” to “urban” uses. The proposal was sponsored by the landlord, a land developer. As a result of coordinated activity by the tenants, the proposal was defeated. Within six months, the landlord ordered the tenants to vacate the property and brought suit for possession.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Hawaii Supreme Court noted that statutory law provided for public hearings on proposals to redesignate property, and specifically invited the views of the <span title="898" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-898">p. 898</span>affected tenants. The court determined that the legislative policy encouraging such input would be jeopardized “if . . . [landlords] were permitted to retaliate against . . . tenants for opposing land use changes in a public forum.” 577 P.2d at 333.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Legislature, in giving approval to the retaliation defense, must have intended to bring our State into line with the clear weight of case law and statutory authority outlined above. We accordingly hold that retaliation may be asserted as a defense to a summary eviction proceeding under W. Va. Code §§55-3A-1, <i>et seq.</i>, if the landlord’s conduct is in retaliation for the tenant’s exercise of a right incidental to the tenancy.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fout seeks to bring this case within the <i>Windward</i> line of authority. He argues principally that Imperial’s conduct violated a public policy which promotes the rights of association and free speech by tenants. We do not agree, simply because the activity that Fout points to as triggering his eviction was unrelated to the habitability of his premises.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the foregoing survey of law, we are led to the conclusion that the retaliatory eviction defense must relate to activities of the tenant incidental to the tenancy. First Amendment rights of speech and association unrelated to the tenant’s property interest are not protected under a retaliatory eviction defense in that they do not arise from the tenancy relationship. Such rights may, of course, be vindicated on other independent grounds.</p>

<p id="c5c7f8eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Retaliatory eviction.</b> In the famous case of <i>Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp.</i>, 463 F.2d 853 (D.C. Cir. 1972), the landlord, Diamond Housing, had brought an earlier lawsuit against the month-to-month tenant, Mrs. Robinson, for possession on the ground of nonpayment of rent. The landlord lost that lawsuit when the tenant successfully raised the defense of the landlord’s violation of the warranty of habitability, <i>id.</i> at 858:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5c7f8ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specifically, Mrs. Robinson introduced evidence showing that large pieces of plaster were missing throughout the house, that there was no step from the front walk to the front porch, that the front porch was shaky and unsafe, that there was a wall in the back bedroom which was not attached to the ceiling and which moved back and forth when pressed, that nails protruded along the side of the stairway, that there was a pane of glass missing from the living room window, and that the window frame in the kitchen was so far out of position that one could see into the back yard through the space between it and the wall.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5c7f8ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord brought a second lawsuit against the tenant, attempting to end the month-to-month tenancy by providing 30 days’ notice. (Recall that periodic tenancies renew automatically unless one of the parties notifies the other that it intends to end the relationship.) The landlord hoped to evict Mrs. Robinson not because of nonpayment of rent but simply because the landlord wanted to end the periodic tenancy. The tenant argued that the landlord’s attempt to end the periodic tenancy and evict her was in retaliation for her earlier assertion of her legal right to remain in the apartment because of the landlord’s breach of the implied warranty of habitability. She argued <span title="899" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-899">p. 899</span>that the landlord’s retaliatory motivation constituted a defense to his claim for possession and that she had the right to continue to possess the property.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord argued that he was unable or unwilling to make the legally required repairs on the premises necessary to put the housing in compliance with the housing code and that he intended to take the apartment off the rental market. If he were not entitled to end the month-to-month tenancy and evict the tenant under these circumstances, he would never be able to do so, and the court would have substantially transferred to the tenant the landlord’s possessory rights in the property.</p>
<p id="c5c7f8ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court held that the tenant could successfully raise the defense of retaliatory eviction under these circumstances. Judge J. Skelly Wright argued, <i>id.</i> at 860-868:</p>

<p id="c5c7f8f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“In large measure, the scope and effectiveness of tenant remedies for substandard housing will be determined by the degree of protection given tenants against retaliatory actions by landlords. If a landlord is free to evict or otherwise harass a tenant who exercises his right to secure better housing conditions, few tenants will use the remedies for fear of being put out on the street.” Daniels, <i>Judicial and Legislative Remedies for Substandard Housing: Landlord-Tenant Law Reform in the District of Columbia</i>, 59 Geo. L.J. 909, 943 (1971).</p>
<p id="c5c7f8f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The danger stems not from the possibility that landlords might take low-cost units off the market altogether, but rather from the possibility that they will do so selectively in order to “make an example” of a troublesome tenant who has the temerity to assert his legal rights in court.</p>

<p id="c5c7f8f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, then, it should be noted that the <i>Edwards</i> defense deals with the landlord’s subjective state of mind — that is, with his motive. If the landlord’s actions are motivated by a desire to punish the tenant for exercising his rights or to chill the exercise of similar rights by other tenants, then they are impermissible.</p>
<p id="c5c82004-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is commonplace, however, that a jury can judge a landlord’s state of mind only by examining its objective manifestations. Thus when the landlord’s conduct is “inherently destructive” of tenants’ rights, or unavoidably chills their exercise, the jury may, under well recognized principles, presume that the landlord intended this result. An unexplained eviction following successful assertion of a defense [based on the landlord’s breach of the implied warranty of habitability] falls within this inherently destructive category and hence gives rise to the presumption. Once the presumption is established, it is then up to the landlord to rebut it by demonstrating that he is motivated by some legitimate business purpose rather than by the illicit motive which would otherwise be presumed. We wish to emphasize, however, that the landlord’s desire to remove a tenant who is not paying rent is not such a legitimate purpose. [<i>Brown v. Southall Realty Co.</i>, 237 A.2d 834 (D.C. 1968)] and the housing code guarantee the right of a tenant to remain in possession without paying rent when the premises are burdened with substantial housing code violations making them unsafe and unsanitary. The landlord of such premises who evicts his tenant because he will not pay rent is in effect evicting him for asserting his legal right to refuse to pay rent.</p>

Expression of such a desire begs the further question of why the landlord wishes to remove the unit. If he wishes to remove the unit for some sound business reason, then of course he is free to do so. But a landlord who fails to come forward with a substantial business reason for removing a unit from the market — such as, for example, his financial inability to make the necessary repairs — may be presumed to have done so for an illicit reason.</p>
<p id="c5c82006-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None of this is to say that the landlord may not go out of business entirely if he wishes to do so or that the jury is authorized to inspect his motives if he chooses to commit economic harakiri. There would be severe constitutional problems with a rule of law which required an entrepreneur to remain in business against his will. Thus we hold that the landlord’s right to discontinue rental of all his units in no way justifies a partial closing designed to intimidate the remaining tenants.</p>

How long may the tenant stay?</b> How long may the tenant stay in the premises if the landlord is denied the right to evict the tenant? Most courts hold that the landlord may not evict the tenant until the landlord can show a legitimate, nonretaliatory business reason for the eviction. They may not refuse to renew a lease (or grant a periodic tenancy in place of a term of years) for a retaliatory reason. However, the Utah Supreme Court criticized this approach. Noting that “we cannot saddle the landlord with a perpetual tenant,” and requiring the landlord to show that “his actions are not the result of retaliatory motives” will be a very difficult burden for a landlord to overcome, the court held that the tenant “should be permitted to remain until the landlord has made the repairs required by law.” <i>Building Monitoring System, Inc. v. Paxton</i>, 905 P.2d 1215, 1219 (Utah 1995). The court held that the tenant may be evicted any time after repairs have been made as long as the tenant is also given “sufficient time, without the pressure normally exerted in a holdover eviction proceeding, to find other suitable housing.”</p>

Some states expressly apply the retaliatory eviction doctrine to the landlord’s refusal to renew a tenancy, including a term of years. D.C. Code §45-2552(a); 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 720/1; N.J.

<p id="c5c8200e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some states have interpreted their statutes to apply to nonrenewal of a tenancy and not just eviction. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Houle v. Quenneville</i>, 787 A.2d 1258, 1263 (Vt. 2001) (interpreting 9 Vt. Stat. §4465, Vermont’s statutory prohibition against retaliation, to apply to the nonrenewal of a fixed term lease)<i>.</i> In contrast, some states have held that their statutes prohibit retaliatory eviction of month-to-month tenants but allow landlords to refuse to renew term-of-years or fixed term leases for retaliatory reasons. <i>Frenchtown Villa v. Meadors</i>, 324 N.W.2d 133 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982) (interpreting Mich. Comp. Laws §600.5720). Still other states adopt a middle position, prohibiting retaliatory eviction for a specified time. For example, California prohibits a landlord from retaliating against a tenant for exercising rights protected by the implied warranty for 180 days but allows landlords freedom to seek not to renew a periodic tenancy or to increase the rent or otherwise change the terms of the leasehold after that time. Cal. Civ. Code §1942.5. <i>Accord</i>, Conn. Gen. Stat. §47a-20 (prohibiting eviction for six months after a protected act by a tenant). New York has passed a statute that applies the retaliatory eviction doctrine to nonrenewal of a term of years but provides that “a landlord shall not be required . . . to offer a new lease or a lease renewal for a term greater than one year and after such extension of a tenancy for one year shall not be required to further extend or continue such tenancy.” N.Y.

Tenant remedies, landlord rights.</b> Under URLTA, if a landlord violates the act by retaliating against a tenant, the tenant has several remedies. The tenant may recover possession of the premises, terminate the lease, and recover damages; the tenant also has a defense in any retaliatory action for possession of the premises. URLTA §§4.107, 5.101(b); <i>see also</i> RURLTA §902. URLTA, however, provides that a landlord may recover possession if “(1) the violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant, a member of his family, or other person on the premises with his consent; or (2) the tenant is in default in rent; or (3) compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit.” URLTA §5.101(c); <i>see also</i> RURLTA § 901(c) (providing seven grounds on which a landlord may be excused from a claim of retaliation).</p>

A substantial industry has emerged providing landlords with information about prospective tenants, and among the information that has become available is whether a tenant has been the subject of an eviction action (regardless of the outcome) or even appeared in housing court. <i>See</i> Motoko Rich,<i> A Blacklist for Renters</i>, N.Y. Times, Apr. 8, 2004, at F-1. Moreover, even minor disputes with landlords that result in a judgment against a tenant, for example over the amount of rent due, can have a significant impact on a tenant’s credit score, even if the judgment is promptly paid. This can, in turn, impact the tenant’s future ability not only to rent, but also to obtain a mortgage or any other debt.</p>

<p id="c5c84724-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A landlord owns five buildings. Two of the buildings, including Building 1, are in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The other buildings are in the nearby towns of Somerville, Arlington, and Brookline. The buildings have old furnaces that do not work well. All the tenants have month-to-month leases. Some of the tenants in each building meet to form a tenants’ association to complain to the landlord about inadequate heat and hot water. The landlord promises to fix the problem but does nothing about it. The members of the tenants’ association agree to stop paying rent. In Building 1, about half the tenants stop paying rent. In the other buildings, anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent of the tenants similarly withhold rent.</p>
<p id="c5c84725-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The landlord responds by suing to evict all the tenants in Building 1 on the ground that the landlord intends to convert the building to nonresidential use as an office building. It is crucial to note that the landlord <i>does not</i> ask for possession on the ground that the tenants have breached their leases by not paying rent; they are legally entitled to stop paying rent. Rather, the landlord seeks only to end the periodic tenancies by providing the statutorily required one month’s notice.</p>
<p id="c5c84726-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tenants respond by raising the defense of retaliatory eviction. They appeal to <i>Hillview Associates v. Bloomquist</i> and to <i>Robinson v. Diamond Housing</i>, arguing that the landlord has no right to evict tenants if the landlord’s <i>motive</i> is to retaliate against them for asserting rights guaranteed by the implied warranty of habitability. The landlord responds by arguing that there is an exception in both <i>Hillview</i> and <i>Robinson</i> for landlords who want to go out of business. The landlord claims that he has an absolute right to convert the building from rental housing to use as an office building, regardless of his motive. The tenants, however, argue that the landlord cannot take advantage of that exception unless the landlord goes out of the rental housing business entirely. Since the landlord is retaining four other buildings, they argue, the defense is not available. They conclude that the landlord is using the eviction of these tenants as a way to intimidate the other tenants and prevent them from complaining to the authorities or withholding rent, thus losing the right to evict them, if their allegations are proven.</p>

<p id="c5c8472b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the traditional rule, landlords were immune from liability to tenants for injuries arising out of the condition of the premises. <i>See Bowles v.

Under the current practice in most states, however, landlords <i>are</i> liable to tenants for injuries arising out of the landlord’s negligence, including negligent failure to comply with housing codes or the implied warranty of habitability. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>New Haverford Partnership v.

A negligence claim is based on an allegation that the landlord is at fault or has acted unreasonably by not taking proper precautions or investing sufficiently in safety. A strict liability claim is based on the unreasonably dangerous condition of the building or the landlord’s failure to comply with the housing code, regardless of whether a reasonable landlord would have known of and corrected the defect.</p>

The tenant purchasing housing for a limited period is in no position to inspect for latent defects in the increasingly complex modern apartment buildings or to bear the expense of repair whereas the landlord is in a much better position to inspect for and repair latent defects. The tenant’s ability to inspect is ordinarily substantially less than that of a purchaser of the property.</p>
<p id="c5c8472f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The tenant renting the dwelling is compelled to rely upon the implied assurance of safety made by the landlord.

As one commentator has observed: “If the objective of the application of the stream of commerce approach is to distribute the risk of providing a product to society by allowing an injured plaintiff to find a remedy for injury along the chain of distribution, it will probably fail in the landlord/tenant situation. The cost of insuring risk will not be distributed along the chain of commerce but will probably be absorbed by tenants who will pay increased rents. One could argue that this was not the effect sought by the court in earlier cases which anticipated that the cost of risk would be distributed vertically in the stream of commerce.” (Alice L.

<p id="c5c89569-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Advocates debating the advisability and legitimacy of imposing minimum standards on landlords, particularly in the context of tenant rights such as a nonwaivable implied warranty of habitability, tenant protections against retaliatory eviction, and expanded landlord tort liability, make both rights-based and economic arguments.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114C4_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N114C4_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">18</a></span> <span title="907" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-907">p. 907</span>Many of these arguments apply in the broader debate about regulating landlord and tenant relations, including rent control, regulation of security deposits, and even tenant civil rights protections.</p>
<p id="c5c8956b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to <b>rights-based arguments</b>, recall the discussion of freedom of contract in §1.4, above, in the context of determining whether a given agreement creates a lease or another property relationship. Similar arguments play out for habitability and other tenant rights. On one side, advocates might argue that making particular terms nondisclaimable prevents tenants from agreeing to waive the right to withhold rent in return for lower rent, even if they wish to do so. After all, our legal system allows those accused of crime the right to waive even the most fundamental constitutional trial rights, so why not tenants? On the other side is the argument that no one would voluntarily agree to rent an apartment that did not comply with minimum standards of habitability or similarly waive other central aspects of a rented home; the fact that people agree to do so is evidence not that they affirmatively wanted to agree but that they were forced to agree because they had no legally or practically available alternatives. Consent in this context is illusory because choice is fundamentally constrained.</p>
<p id="c5c8956c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another rights-based argument has to do with the fairness of imposing particular burdens on landlords. Because landlords may have a limited ability to pass along the cost of providing habitable premises to tenants and the cost of other tenant rights, the result is a redistribution of wealth from landlords to tenants. Some would argue that this targeted redistribution is unfair because it places the burden of dealing with poverty on a small subset of the population (that is, landlords) when the obligation to care for poor people should be shared by all members of the community through general taxes to support rental subsidies or welfare programs. The counterargument is that it would be unfair for landlords to make a living by providing substandard housing; in creating an ongoing relationship with their tenants, it is only fair for landlords to conduct those relationships in accordance with minimum standards of decency. Just as it is unlawful to enter a contract of slavery, it should be unlawful to enter a contract by which one agrees to allow someone else to live in deplorable conditions.</p>
<p id="c5c8956d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The debate about mandatory landlord-tenant regulations also raises important questions about individual self-determination and its limits. A concern about paternalism would suggest that individual citizens are the best judges of their own interests; the state should not prevent people from entering into voluntary agreements on the grounds that it is not in their best interest to do so. Institutionally, the argument continues, courts and legislatures are ill equipped to determine what private arrangements best satisfy people’s needs, and a legal structure that begins with freedom of contract as the baseline best allows individuals to pursue their ends in their own way. Countering these propositions are the arguments that any contract by which tenants waive basic rights to habitability is unlikely to represent the actual intent of the parties and because of a variety of well-recognized cognitive limitations, people are actually relatively poor judges of their own long-term interests in many situations. More importantly, some contractual agreements are so fundamentally unfair or unconscionable that they should not be enforced even if the parties have voluntarily and knowingly agreed to them.</p>
<p id="c5c8956e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="908" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-908">p. 908</span><b>Economic arguments</b>, by contrast, tend to focus less on fairness or the relationship between the state and the individual, and more on incentives and the consequences for allocative efficiency of mandatory lease terms. For example, if tenants are willing to live in less well-maintained apartments, they should be able to enter into a contract for lower rent and then have money available to use for other things such as food and clothing. Some also argue that landlords will respond to the additional legal and economic exposure created by new tenant rights by attempting to raise the rent. Either this will pass along the costs of the warranty to tenants or, if tenants are unable to pay a greater rent, may induce landlords to reduce their investment in housing or even leave the rental market, hurting tenants — the very people the change in law is meant to help.</p>
<p id="c5c8956f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, substandard housing creates significant externalities — third-party effects that are not internalized by the parties — such as medical problems for residents and community blight. And predicting, <i>a priori</i>, what effects rights such as the implied warranty will have on the market depends on a host of factors affecting both demand and supply. Whether tenants are harmed or the implied warranty simply redistributes wealth between landlords and tenants without decreasing the supply of housing turns on how price sensitive is demand for housing. Landlords may not be able to pass along costs to tenants and if landlords are earning “economic rents,” which exceed the minimum required to keep the investment in its current use, then other housing providers may be able to enter the market to increase supply. If supply is constrained, and landlords are earning economic rents with high profits, a reduction in those profits may allow them to stay in business while complying with the warranty and still earn more than they could in other businesses.</p>

Covenants against assignment without the prior consent of the lessor have been held not to affect the lessee’s right to sublease, to mortgage the leasehold, or to assign his or her interest to a cotenant. Such covenants also do not prevent transfer of a leasehold interest by will, by bankruptcy, by the personal representative of a deceased tenant, or by transfer among partners, or spouses. Covenants against assignment furthermore do not prohibit transfer of the stock of a corporate tenant, or assignment of a lease to a corporation wholly owned by the tenant.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5c476f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN1084D_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N1084D_ceea918b-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span>&nbsp;Eviction is generally a civil matter.

We recognize, however, that reading statutory provisions into private contracts may have little factual support in the intentions of the particular parties now before us. But, for reasons of public policy, warranties are often implied into contracts by operation of law in order to meet generally prevailing standards of honesty and fair dealing. When the public policy has been enacted into law like the housing code, that policy will usually have deep roots in the expectations and intentions of most people. <i>See</i> Costigan, <i>Implied-in-Fact Contracts and Mutual Assent</i>, 33 Harv.
