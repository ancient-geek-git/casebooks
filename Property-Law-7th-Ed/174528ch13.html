<p id="c5e0154a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, Title VIII of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1968</i>, 42 U.S.C. §3601 <i>et seq</i>., was the last plank in a series of civil rights statutes enacted in the 1960s, and secured passage at President Lyndon Johnson’s urging a week after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The act originally prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, and religion. Congress added sex to the list of protected categories in 1974 and added handicap (disability) and familial status (which covers children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians as well as pregnant women) in 1988.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1003A_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1003A_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span></p>
<p id="c5e0154c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing and in a wide variety of other housing-related contexts. For example, the act covers discrimination in residential finance as well as activities by real estate brokers and appraisers. <i>Id.</i> §3605. The act also applies to land use regulation, and constitutional protections relating to takings, due process, equal protection, the free exercise of religion, and free speech are also important constraints in this context. <i>See</i> Chapter 7, §6; Chapter 14; Chapter 15. Several other federal statutes also prohibit discrimination in important aspects of the real estate market, including the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1866</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§1981-1982; <i>Title VI</i> of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1964</i>, 42 U.S.C. §2000d <i>et seq</i>.; §504 of the <i>Rehabilitation Act of 1973</i>, 29 U.S.C. §794; and the <i>Equal Credit Opportunity Act</i>, 15 U.S.C. §§1691-1691f, all of which we will touch on in this chapter.</p>
<p id="c5e0154d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost every state and many local governments have some kind of fair housing law.

For example, many state laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of marital status, age, or source of income, while an increasing number of state and local laws prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation. In addition, state and local laws may apply to housing that is exempt from the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, such as owner-occupied three-unit buildings or claims that are barred by the federal statute of limitations but timely under state or local law. Finally, as we shall see, courts also respond to discrimination in housing through the traditional tools of equity.</p>

Roommate’s website receives over 40,000 visits a day and roughly a million new postings for roommates are created each year. When users sign up, they must create a profile by answering a series of questions about their sex, sexual orientation and whether children will be living with them. An open-ended “Additional Comments” section lets users include information not prompted by the questionnaire. Users are asked to list their preferences for roommate characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation and familial status. Based on the profiles and preferences, Roommate matches users and provides them a list of housing-seekers or available rooms meeting their criteria. Users can also search available listings based on roommate characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation and familial status.</p>

<p id="c5e14d45-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id</i>. §3604(c) (emphasis added). The reach of the statute turns on the meaning of “dwelling.”</p>
<p id="c5e14d46-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The FHA defines “dwelling” as “any building, structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families.” <i>Id</i>. §3602(b). A dwelling is thus a living unit designed or intended for occupancy by a family, meaning that it ordinarily has the elements generally associated with a family residence: sleeping spaces, bathroom and kitchen facilities, and common areas, such as living rooms, dens and hallways.</p>
<p id="c5e14d47-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would be difficult, though not impossible, to divide a single-family house or apartment into separate “dwellings” for purposes of the statute. Is a “dwelling” a bedroom plus a right to access common areas? What if roommates share a bedroom? Could a “dwelling” be a bottom bunk and half an armoire? It makes practical sense to interpret “dwelling” as an independent living unit and stop the FHA at the front door.</p>
<p id="c5e14d48-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There’s no indication that Congress intended to interfere with personal relationships <i>inside</i> the home. Congress wanted to address the problem of landlords discriminating in the sale and rental of housing, which deprived protected classes of housing opportunities. But a business transaction between a tenant and landlord is quite different from an arrangement between two people sharing the same living space. We seriously doubt Congress meant the FHA to apply to the latter. Consider, for example, the FHA’s prohibition against sex discrimination. Could Congress, in the 1960s, really have meant that women must accept men as roommates? Telling women they may not lawfully exclude men from the list of acceptable roommates would be controversial today; it would have been scandalous in the 1960s.</p>
<p id="c5e14d49-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While it’s possible to read dwelling to mean sub-parts of a home or an apartment, doing so leads to awkward results. And applying the FHA to the selection of roommates almost certainly leads to results that defy mores prevalent when the statute was passed. Nonetheless, this interpretation is not wholly implausible and we would normally consider adopting it, given that the FHA is a remedial statute that we construe broadly. Therefore, we turn to constitutional concerns, which provide strong countervailing considerations.</p>

Rotary Club of Duarte</i>, 481 U.S. 537, 545 (1987). “[C]hoices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the State because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme.” <i>Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees</i>, 468 U.S. 609, 617-18 (1984). Courts have extended the right of intimate association to marriage, child bearing, child rearing and cohabitation with relatives. <i>Id</i>. While the right protects only “highly personal relationships,” <i>IDK, Inc. v. Clark Cnty.</i>, 836 F.2d 1185, 1193 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting <i>Roberts</i>, 468 U.S. at 618), the right isn’t restricted exclusively to family, <i>Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l</i>, 481 U.S. at 545. The right to association also implies a right <i>not</i> to associate. <i>Roberts</i>, 428 U.S. at 623.</p>
<p id="c5e14d4c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To determine whether a particular relationship is protected by the right to intimate association we look to “size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship.” <i>Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l</i>, 481 U.S. at 546. The roommate relationship easily qualifies: People generally have very few roommates; they are selective in choosing roommates; and non-roommates are excluded from the critical aspects of the relationship, such as using the living spaces. Aside from immediate family or a romantic partner, it’s hard to imagine a relationship more intimate than that between roommates, who share living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, even bedrooms.</p>
<p id="c5e14d4d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of a roommate’s unfettered access to the home, choosing a roommate implicates significant privacy and safety considerations. The home is the center of our private lives. Roommates note our comings and goings, observe whom we bring back at night, hear what songs we sing in the shower, see us in various stages of undress and learn intimate details most of us prefer to keep private. Roommates also have access to our physical belongings and to our person. As the Supreme Court recognized, “[w]e are at our most vulnerable when we are asleep because we cannot monitor our own safety or the security of our belongings.” <i>Minnesota v. Olson</i>, 495 U.S. 91, 99 (1990). Taking on a roommate means giving him full access to the space where we are most vulnerable.</p>
<p id="c5e14d4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equally important, we are fully exposed to a roommate’s belongings, activities, habits, proclivities and way of life. This could include matter we find offensive (pornography, religious materials, political propaganda); dangerous (tobacco, drugs, firearms); annoying (jazz, perfume, frequent overnight visitors, furry pets); habits that are incompatible with our lifestyle (early risers, messy cooks, bathroom hogs, clothing borrowers). When you invite others to share your living quarters, you risk becoming a suspect in whatever illegal activities they engage in.</p>
<p id="c5e1745f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Government regulation of an individual’s ability to pick a roommate thus intrudes into the home, which “is entitled to special protection as the center of the private lives of our people.” <i>Minnesota v. Carter</i>, 525 U.S. 83, 99 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). <span title="1027" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1027">p. 1027</span>“Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.” <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, 539 U.S. 558, 562 (2003). Holding that the FHA applies inside a home or apartment would allow the government to restrict our ability to choose roommates compatible with our lifestyles. This would be a serious invasion of privacy, autonomy and security.</p>
<p id="c5e17460-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, women will often look for female roommates because of modesty or security concerns. As roommates often share bathrooms and common areas, a girl may not want to walk around in her towel in front of a boy. She might also worry about unwanted sexual advances or becoming romantically involved with someone she must count on to pay the rent.</p>
<p id="c5e17461-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An orthodox Jew may want a roommate with similar beliefs and dietary restrictions, so he won’t have to worry about finding honey-baked ham in the refrigerator next to the potato latkes. Non-Jewish roommates may not understand or faithfully follow all of the culinary rules, like the use of different silverware for dairy and meat products, or the prohibition against warming non-kosher food in a kosher microwave. Taking away the ability to choose roommates with similar dietary restrictions and religious convictions will substantially burden the observant Jew’s ability to live his life and practice his religion faithfully. The same is true of individuals of other faiths that call for dietary restrictions or rituals inside the home.</p>
<p id="c5e17462-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has dismissed a complaint against a young woman for advertising, “I am looking for a female christian roommate,” on her church bulletin board. In its Determination of No Reasonable Cause, HUD explained that “in light of the facts provided and after assessing the unique context of the advertisement and the roommate relationship involved . . . the Department defers to Constitutional considerations in reaching its conclusions.” <i>Fair Hous. Ctr. of W. Mich. v. Tricia</i>, No. 05-10-1738-8 (Oct. 28, 2010) (Determination of No Reasonable Cause).</p>
<p id="c5e17463-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It’s a “well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.” <i>Frisby v. Schultz</i>, 487 U.S. 474, 483 (1988). “[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.” <i>Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice</i>, 491 U.S. 440, 466 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the FHA can reasonably be read either to include or exclude shared living arrangements, we can and must choose the construction that avoids raising constitutional concerns. Reading “dwelling” to mean an independent housing unit is a fair interpretation of the text and consistent with congressional intent. Because the construction of “dwelling” to include shared living units raises substantial constitutional concerns, we adopt the narrower construction that excludes roommate selection from the reach of the FHA.</p>

<p id="c5e17465-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because we find that the FHA doesn’t apply to the sharing of living units, it follows that it’s not unlawful to discriminate in selecting a roommate.

<p id="c5e17468-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. What did Congress mean by “dwelling”?</b> The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the agency Congress tasked with interpreting the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, has long taken the position that it does not violate the advertising provision of the act, 42 U.S.C. §3604(c), to express a preference with regard to <i>sex</i> if one is not advertising for a “separate unit.” HUD apparently continues to believe that expressed preferences will violate §3604(c) if based on other categories such as race, religion, national origin, disability, or familial status. Memorandum from Roberta Achtenberg, Assistant Secy. for Fair Hous. &amp; Equal Opportunity, U.S. Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., to Fair Hous. &amp; Equal Opportunity Dirs. &amp; Staff (Jan. 9, 1995), <i>available at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/hud doc?id=DOC_11870.pdf</i>.</p>
<p id="c5e17469-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Ninth Circuit in <i>Roommate.com</i> went further, holding that the statute does not apply at all to roommate situations because of the statute’s definition of the term “dwelling.” Do you find Chief Judge Kozinski’s reasoning persuasive? The court does not address the portion of the statutory definition of dwelling that applies the act to “any . . . portion” of a building. Does the opinion make that language irrelevant?</p>
<p id="c5e1746a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the portion of the <i>Roommate.com</i> decision addressing constitutional avoidance, the two examples that Chief Judge Kozinski gave involve gender and religion. Would the same concerns hold if someone refused to accept a paying roommate — as a tenant, subtenant, or co-tenant — because of that person’s race? Does the text of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> provide any reason to distinguish race from other protected categories?</p>
<p id="c5e1746b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other types of living arrangements have also raised questions about the scope of the term “dwelling” in the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. In <i>Lakeside Resort Enterprises, LP v. Board of Supervisors of Palmyra Township</i>, 455 F.3d 154 (3d Cir. 2006), the court considered whether a drug- and alcohol-treatment facility constituted a “dwelling” subject to the act. Citing the reference to a dwelling as including a place “intended for occupancy as . . . a residence,” §3602(b), the court concluded that the issue turns on “whether the facility is intended or designed for occupants who intend to remain” there for “any significant period of time,” and would view the residence “as a place to return to.” 455 F.3d at 158. Although the residents would on average stay only for slightly more than two weeks, because the facility was intended for longer stays, and the residents treated it like a home, the court found that the act applied. <i>Id.</i> at 160. Similar controversies have arisen over homeless shelters. <i>Compare Intermountain Fair Housing Council v. Boise Rescue Mission Ministries</i>, 717 F. Supp. 2d 1101 (D. Idaho 2010) (homeless shelter not a “dwelling” under §3602(b)), <i>with Boykin v. Gray</i>, 895 F. Supp. 2d 199 (D.D.C. 2012) (homeless shelter is covered by the act).</p>
<p id="c5e1746c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What indications are there in the text of the statute about how broadly or narrowly Congress intended the term “dwelling” to be interpreted? If a constitutionally based right of intimate association is one reason to read “dwelling” narrowly, as the court in <span title="1029" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1029">p. 1029</span><i>Roommate.com</i> found, what associational interests might suggest a <i>broader</i> reading of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>?</p>
<p id="c5e19b7d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Intimate association and free speech.</b> The FHA includes a number of exemptions, including for “rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his residence.” §3603(b)(2). This exemption, however, does not apply to §3604(c)’s restrictions on discriminatory advertisements and other statements. As a result, §3604(c) has a broader application than the remaining substantive prohibitions in §3604.</p>
<p id="c5e19b7e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc.</i>, 519 F.3d 666 (7th Cir. 2008), Judge Easterbrook noted that many people who advertise housing for sale or rent qualify for the exemptions in §3603(b). To Judge Easterbrook, the fact that §3604(c) continues to apply independently to create liability in these circumstances raises free speech concerns. <i>Id.</i> at 668 (“[A]ny rule that forbids truthful advertising of a transaction that would be substantively lawful encounters serious problems under the first amendment”). <i>Compare, e.g.</i>,<i> United States v. Space Hunters, Inc</i>., 429 F.3d 416, 425 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding housing information provider’s statements that violated §3604(c) to be commercial speech not protected by the first amendment).</p>
<p id="c5e19b7f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why do you think the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> covers a broader scope of communications in §3604(c) than its direct provisions on sale or rental of housing? Do you agree with Judge Easterbrook that the act’s regulation of discriminatory speech as an independent basis for liability presents a conflict with the first amendment? <i>See generally</i> Robert G. Schwemm,<i> Discriminatory Housing Statements and Section 3604(c): A New Look at the Fair Housing Act’s Most Intriguing Provision</i>, 29 Fordham Urb. L.J. 187 (2001).</p>
<p id="c5e19b80-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. The FHA and on-line advertising.</b> In many parts of the country, housing transactions are increasingly advertised on the Internet. These on-line advertisements, just as with statements posted on physical bulletin boards, are generally covered by §3604(c), even if the underlying transaction falls within the FHA’s exemption in §3603(b). A review of roughly 10,000 Craigslist postings in 10 cities found that “a significant number of on-line housing ads — roughly several hundred on any given day — violate [§3604(c)].” Rigel C. Oliveri, <i>Discriminatory Housing Advertisements On-Line: Lessons from Craigslist</i>, 43 Ind. L. Rev. 1125, 1127-1128 (2010). This study found that the vast majority of the postings were for roommates, and expressed preferences on the basis of familial status. Does <i>Roommate.com</i> change this conclusion?</p>
<p id="c5e19b81-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a newspaper prints a discriminatory advertisement from a third party, the paper is potentially liable under §3604(c). For on-line advertising, however, the <i>Communications Decency Act of 1996</i> (CDA), 47 U.S.C. §230(c)(1), states that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Thus, Craigslist was not liable under §3604(c) for discriminatory roommate advertisements posted on its web site. <i>Chicago Lawyers’ Committee</i>, <i>supra</i>. The CDA’s exemption does not to <span title="1030" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1030">p. 1030</span>apply where an on-line service provider is itself “responsible, in whole or in part for the creation or development” of the discriminatory information, 47 U.S.C. §230(f)(3). In an earlier round of the <i>Roommate.com</i> case, the company was found not to come within this exception when it created questionnaires that asked users to identify themselves by sex, sexual orientation, and marital status and to express their preferences in those categories. <i>Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, L.L.C.</i>, 521 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008). Moreover, the company used that information to create profiles that provided the users’ relevant information and preferences, and it channeled searches and sent e-mails based on the discriminatory preferences its forms had elicited.<i> Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5e19b82-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Subtle signaling.</b> Advertisements that limit housing to whites clearly violate §3604(c). Can a housing provider <i>indirectly</i> demonstrate an interest in customers of a certain race or other protected class?</p>
<p id="c5e19b83-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Ragin v. New York Times Co</i>., 923 F.2d 995 (2d Cir. 1991), the court held that a newspaper’s practice of publishing real estate advertisements almost always showing white models in a city with a significant population of African Americans and other minorities might violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> by showing a discriminatory preference. The district court held that the ultimate issue for the fact finder was whether “[t]o an ordinary reader the natural interpretation of the advertisements published [in the newspaper] is that they indicate a racial preference in the acceptance of tenants.” In affirming the lower court’s opinion, the Second Circuit explained, in an opinion by Judge Ralph Winter:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e19b84-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 3604 (c) states in pertinent part that it is unlawful: “To . . . publish . . . any . . . advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference . . . based on race.” Beginning our analysis with the statutory language, the first critical word is the verb “indicates.” Giving that word its common meaning, we read the statute to be violated if an ad for housing suggests to an ordinary reader that a particular race is preferred or dispreferred for the housing in question. Moreover, the statute prohibits all ads that indicate a racial preference to an ordinary reader whatever the advertiser’s intent.</p>
<p id="c5e19b85-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next question is whether and in what circumstances the use of models may convey an illegal racial message. Advertising is a make-up-your-own world in which one builds an image from scratch, selecting those portrayals that will attract targeted consumers and discarding those that will put them off. Locale, setting, actions portrayed, weather, height, weight, gender, hair color, dress, race and numerous other factors are varied as needed to convey the message intended. A soft-drink manufacturer seeking to envelop its product in an aura of good will and harmony may portray a group of persons of widely varying nationalities and races singing a cheerful tune on a mountaintop. A chain of fast-food retailers may use models of the principal races found in urban areas where its stores are located. Similarly, a housing complex may decide that the use of models of one race alone will maximize the number of potential consumers who respond, even though it may also discourage consumers of other races.</p>
<p id="c5e19b86-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In advertising, a conscious racial decision regarding models thus seems almost inevitable. All the statute requires is that in this make-up-your-own world the creator of an ad not make choices among models that create a suggestion of a racial preference. The <span title="1031" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1031">p. 1031</span>deliberate inclusion of a black model where necessary to avoid such a message seems to us a far cry from the alleged practices that are at the core of the debate over quotas. If race-conscious decisions are inevitable in the make-up-your-own world of advertising, a statutory interpretation that may lead to some race-conscious decisionmaking to avoid indicating a racial preference is hardly a danger to be averted at all costs.</p>

<p id="c5e19b88-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Lior Strahilevitz has argued that as direct statements of discrimination have become less common, housing providers have turned to other methods to signal racial preferences. Strahilevitz argues that providers, thwarted by civil rights laws, have developed the strategy of providing unnecessary amenities not because they are what people actually want, but rather because they send messages to prospective residents. He cites the example of golf courses as a particularly racially polarizing amenity that signals exclusion. <i>See</i> Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, <i>Exclusionary Amenities in Residential Communities</i>, 92 Va. L. Rev. 437 (2006). How should fair housing advocates respond to this kind of subtle signaling? How, if at all, should the law address it?</p>

Other prohibited communications.</b> The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> regulates other communications related to housing. For example, the act makes it unlawful to misrepresent the availability of housing. 42 U.S.C. §3604(d). It likewise prohibits inducing or attempting to induce people to sell or rent “by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood” of people of a particular protected category. <i>Id.</i> §3604(e). This latter provision was passed to remedy the practice of “blockbusting,” where brokers would try to convince white residents to sell by invoking fears about neighborhood integration.</p>

In order to prevail on a claim made under these statutes, plaintiff must prove a discriminatory intent. A violation occurs when race is a factor in a decision to deny a minority applicant the opportunity to rent or negotiate for a rental, but race need not be the only factor in the decision. In addition, §3604(d) of the FHA specifically prohibits dissemination of false information about the availability of housing because of a person’s race. Accordingly, failure to provide a minority applicant with the same information about availability of a rental unit or the terms and conditions for rental as is provided <span title="1033" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1033">p. 1033</span>to white “testers,” results in false information being provided and is cognizable as an injury under the FHA.</p>

<p id="c5e1e9c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three-part burden of proof analysis established in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</i>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), a Title VII employment discrimination case, has been widely applied to FHA and §1982 claims. Under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> analysis, plaintiff first must come forward with proof of a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination. Second, if plaintiff proves a <i>prima facie</i> case, the burden shifts to defendants to produce evidence that the refusal to rent or negotiate for a rental was motivated by legitimate, non-racial considerations. Third, once defendants by evidence articulate non-discriminatory reasons, the burden shifts back to plaintiff to show that the proffered reasons were pretextual.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proof necessary to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case under the FHA also establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of racial discrimination under §1982.

</ol>
<p id="c5e1e9c8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A review of the evidence in this case shows that plaintiff established her <i>prima facie</i> case. Defendants stipulated that Asbury is black. Plaintiff testified that on February 23, 1984, she went to Brougham Estates with her daughter to obtain rental housing. At the rental office at Brougham Estates, Asbury encountered Wanda Chauvin, the manager, and explained to Chauvin that she was being transferred to Kansas City and needed to rent housing. Asbury told Chauvin that she needed to secure housing by the middle of March or the beginning of April. In response, Chauvin said there were no vacancies, but told Asbury she could call back at a later time to check on availability. Chauvin provided no information concerning availability of rental units that would assist Asbury in her efforts to rent an apartment or townhouse at Brougham Estates. Asbury asked for the opportunity to fill out an application, but Chauvin did not give her an application, again stating that there were no vacancies and that she kept no waiting list. Asbury also requested floor plans or the opportunity to view a model unit, and Chauvin refused. Instead, Chauvin suggested Asbury inquire at the Westminister Apartments, an apartment complex housing mostly black families. Although Chauvin did not ask Asbury about her qualifications, plaintiff was employed with the Federal Aviation Authority at a salary of $37,599. Based on her salary, defendants concede that Asbury would likely be qualified to rent an apartment or townhouse at Brougham Estates.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9c9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there was a conflict in the evidence as to the availability of housing at the time Asbury attempted to inspect and negotiate for rental, there was abundant <span title="1034" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1034">p. 1034</span>evidence from which the jury could find that housing was available. Defendants testified that families with a child are housed exclusively in the townhouses at Brougham Estates, and that there were no townhouses available on the date Asbury inquired. Asbury introduced evidence suggesting that both apartments and townhouses were available and, in addition, that exceptions previously had been created to allow children to reside in the apartments.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 24, 1984, the day after Asbury inquired about renting, Asbury’s sister-in-law, Linda Robinson, who is white, called to inquire about the availability of two-bedroom apartments. The woman who answered the telephone identified herself as “Wanda” and invited Robinson to come to Brougham Estates to view the apartments. The following day, February 25, 1984, Robinson went to the rental office at Brougham Estates and met with Wanda Chauvin. Chauvin provided Robinson with floor plans of available one- and two-bedroom apartments at Brougham Estates. Robinson specifically asked Chauvin about rental to families with children, and Chauvin did not tell Robinson that children were restricted to the townhouse units. Robinson accompanied Chauvin to inspect a model unit and several available two-bedroom apartments. Upon inquiry by Robinson, Chauvin indicated that the apartments were available immediately and offered to hold an apartment for her until the next week.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Asbury also provided evidence indicating that townhouses were available for rent. On February 1, 1984, Daniel McMenay, a white male, notified Brougham Estates that he intended to vacate his townhouse. On April 4, 1984, Brougham Estates rented the townhouse vacated by McMenay to John Shuminski, a white male. On March 10, 1984, Randall Hockett, a white male, also rented a townhouse at Brougham Estates. In addition, Asbury provided computer data sheets generated by Brougham Estates which indicated that a third townhouse was unoccupied at the time of her inquiry on February 23, 1984 and remained vacant as of April 10, 1984. There was also evidence that a building which included townhouse units had been closed for the winter but would be available for rent beginning in the spring. On February 22, 1984, one day prior to Asbury’s inquiry into vacancies, James Vance, a white male, paid a deposit for a townhouse which he occupied when the building opened on April 10, 1984. Since Asbury testified that she told Chauvin she did not need to occupy a rental unit until the beginning of April, the jury could have concluded that at least one of the townhouses which was subsequently rented to the white males was available at the time Asbury inquired. Although defendants took the position at trial that the townhouses were closed or out of order for repair and therefore not available to rent, the jury was free to accept the evidence of availability presented by the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since Asbury met her burden of proving a <i>prima facie</i> case of racial discrimination, the burden shifted to defendants to prove a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denial of housing.</p>
<p id="c5e1e9cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>B. Failure of Proof of Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason for Rejection</i></p>
<p id="c5e1e9ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants claimed their legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for rejecting Asbury arose out of the policies at Brougham Estates that families with one child could <span title="1035" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1035">p. 1035</span>rent townhouses but not apartments, and that families with more than one child were not permitted to move into Brougham Estates. Defendants further argued that they made no exceptions to these rules. Defendants contended that in accordance with these rental policies, no appropriate housing was available for Asbury when she inquired. However, plaintiff introduced evidence indicating that exceptions to these rules had been made on several occasions; families with children had rented apartments, and families with more than one child had been permitted to move into Brougham Estates. Asbury was not provided information about the terms and conditions that gave rise to an exception to the policy concerning children being restricted to the townhouses. The jury could therefore find that defendants’ reasons for denying Asbury the opportunity to negotiate for rental were not legitimate and non-discriminatory.</p>
<p id="c5e210df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants also argue that evidence of a high percentage of minority occupancy in Brougham Estates conclusively rebuts the claim of intentional racial discrimination. Although such statistical data is relevant to rebutting a claim of discrimination, statistical data is not dispositive of a claim of intentional discrimination. Moreover, there was other evidence from which the jury could have determined that race was a motivating factor in defendants’ decision to refuse to negotiate with Asbury for a rental unit.</p>
<p id="c5e210e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Sufficiency of Evidence Supporting Punitive Damages Award</i></p>
<p id="c5e210e1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Brougham contends that there was insufficient evidence supporting the jury’s award of punitive damages against him because he never met or dealt with the plaintiff, the actions of Chauvin should not be attributed to him, and he did not promulgate any discriminatory policies or procedures.</p>
<p id="c5e210e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Punitive damages may be awarded against a defendant “when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.” <i>Smith v. Wade</i>, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983). The jury has discretion to award punitive damages to punish outrageous conduct on the part of a defendant and to deter similar conduct in the future.</p>
<p id="c5e210e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff advanced two theories supporting Brougham’s liability for punitive damages: (1) Brougham’s own discriminatory conduct in establishing rental policies, procedures and rules; and (2) his authorization or ratification of discriminatory conduct by Chauvin, his employee. We find sufficient evidence to establish liability under either theory.</p>
<p id="c5e210e4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Asbury presented evidence that Leo Brougham was the managing partner of Brougham Estates and Brougham Management Company. Brougham established all policies, rules and rental procedures for Brougham Estates. Chauvin worked for Brougham who instructed her about the rental policies and procedures. Among the policies and procedures implemented by Brougham were the requirements that Chauvin routinely and untruthfully tell people over the phone that there were no vacancies, whether or not vacancies existed, but that Chauvin then encourage the individuals to come in, inspect the premises and discuss upcoming vacancies. Brougham established the requirement of visual observation of a prospective tenant. <span title="1036" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1036">p. 1036</span>Although a policy that prospective tenants must be visually scrutinized is not necessarily improper, under the circumstances of this case, the jury could have inferred that the policy operated to screen prospective tenants on the basis of race and that, at a minimum, Brougham was callously indifferent to this result of his policy. Indeed, this policy had given rise to several administrative complaints by single black females prior to Asbury’s inquiry about a vacancy. Brougham was aware of previous claims of discriminatory practices in the rental of units at Brougham Estates.</p>
<p id="c5e210e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another policy established by Brougham was that a family with a child could occupy only a townhouse. Chauvin was advised of this policy. Brougham testified that he made no exceptions to the policy, and he testified specifically that no tenant or prospective tenant with a child could obtain permission to be excepted from the rule. Plaintiff, however, produced evidence that exceptions had been created on occasion. Those exceptions had been authorized by Brougham and had been made on an individual basis. From the evidence presented, the jury could have determined that the policies established and implemented by defendant Brougham directly fostered the discrimination which Asbury experienced, that Brougham should have been aware that this might occur, and that Brougham was recklessly or callously indifferent to it happening.</p>
<p id="c5e210e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff also offered evidence tending to prove that Brougham ratified Chauvin’s actions. [After investigating, Brougham] determined [that] Asbury had only one child and therefore fit within the residential policies of Brougham Estates. Furthermore, the jury could have drawn the inference that Brougham’s failure to apologize or otherwise remedy the situation, after personally investigating Asbury’s claim of discrimination at Brougham Estates, was an acceptance and ratification of Chauvin’s treatment of Asbury.</p>
<p id="c5e210e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having reviewed the record in this case, we find that there was substantial evidence supporting and a reasonable basis for the jury’s verdict awarding both compensatory and punitive damages, and we affirm the district court’s decision to deny defendants’ motion for a new trial.</p>

<p id="c5e210ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Who is liable and standards of liability.</b> Although <i>Asbury</i> states that plaintiffs must prove discriminatory intent under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, the Supreme Court recently confirmed, as had the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), that plaintiffs may also raise claims that assert a disparate impact on the basis of a protected category. <i>See Texas Department of Housing &amp; Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.</i>, 135 S. Ct. 2507 (2015);<i> see generally</i> 24 C.F.R. §§100.1-100.500 (HUD’s FHA regulations). <b>Disparate treatment</b> claims involve intentionally treating members of the protected class differently from others so as to deny particular persons housing opportunities. <b>Disparate impact</b> claims allege that a defendant’s actions have a disproportionate, exclusionary effect on members of a protected group that is not justified by legitimate government or business objectives. We will consider the standards that govern disparate impact claims in §3, below.</p>
<p id="c5e210eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1037" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1037">p. 1037</span>In disparate treatment cases, if a plaintiff can demonstrate to the finder of fact sufficient direct evidence of discriminatory intent, such as a statement by a defendant expressing racial animus in the context of a housing decision, then the court need not engage in the three-part framework that <i>Asbury</i> described. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Lindsay v. Yates</i>, 498 F.3d 434, 440 n.7 (6th Cir. 2007). These kinds of cases are relatively uncommon, however, so most disparate treatment claims must rely on circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p id="c5e210ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For such discriminatory intent claims, <i>Asbury</i> describes the traditional elements of a <i>prima facie</i> case under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105A1_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N105A1_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> If the plaintiff can produce evidence of the various elements of the <i>prima facie</i> case, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a nondiscriminatory reason for the differential treatment. If the defendant fails to assert any such justification and the fact finder is persuaded that the plaintiff has proven the <i>prima facie</i> case, the plaintiff is likely to prevail. If the defendant articulates and produces evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions, the plaintiff must then show that those reasons are pretextual. If the plaintiff does so, the jury may (but is not required) to conclude that the real reason for the denial was discriminatory. What reasons did defendant articulate in <i>Asbury</i>? Are they legitimate under the current statute as amended in 1988? How did the plaintiff attempt to show that the proffered reasons were not legitimate and non-discriminatory?</p>
<p id="c5e210ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Asbury</i> demonstrates, employers are generally vicariously liable for the acts of their employees; thus landlords or real estate brokerage firms may be liable if their agents engage in discriminatory conduct. <i>See Holley v. Crank</i>, 400 F.3d 667, 674-675 (9th Cir. 2004). However, officers of corporations are not generally personally liable unless they acted as an employee or agent of the corporation to direct or approve those discriminatory practices. <i>Meyer v. Holley</i>, 537 U.S. 280 (2003).</p>

<p id="c5e23801-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For disparate treatment cases without direct evidence and disparate impact cases, courts often follow a three-part framework, although the specific details at each stage vary depending on the nature of the claim: Generally, a claimant must first establish a <b><i>prima facie</i> case</b>. If so, the party charged with discriminating has the opportunity to demonstrate <b>legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons</b> for her action. Finally, the claimant has the opportunity to show that those reasons are merely a <b>pretext</b>.</p>

<p id="c5e23802-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Remedies.</b> Under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, aggrieved persons may file a lawsuit in federal court for injunctive relief and for compensatory and punitive damages, 42 U.S.C. §3613. Originally, there had been a $1,000 limit on punitive damages, but this cap was eliminated by the <i>Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988</i>, which also extended the statute of limitations from six months to two years.</p>
<p id="c5e23803-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Aggrieved persons may choose instead to file a complaint with HUD, which has the power to investigate and mediate the dispute, as well as to hear and adjudicate the complaint. If HUD has certified a state agency as competent to adjudicate fair housing <span title="1038" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1038">p. 1038</span>disputes, HUD will often refer the complaint to that state agency rather than handle the complaint itself. <i>See</i> §3610(f). If HUD itself investigates the complaint and finds reasonable cause to believe a violation of the law has been committed, it must issue a “charge” on behalf of the aggrieved person, explaining “the facts upon which the Secretary has found reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred.” §3610.</p>
<p id="c5e23804-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a charge is filed, either the complainant or the respondent may elect to have the complaint heard in federal court rather than in an administrative proceeding held by HUD through an administrative law judge (ALJ). <i>See</i> §3612(a). If this option is chosen, HUD will authorize the United States Attorney General to file the lawsuit in federal district court, which is entitled to grant both compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. <i>See</i> §3612(o). If no party elects to go to federal court, HUD will conduct a hearing if the complainant so desires. <i>See</i> §3612(b). The ALJ is empowered to issue injunctive relief as well as assess damages ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 based on the timing and number of prior offenses. <i>See</i> §3610(g)(3). Either the plaintiff or the defendant may appeal the ALJ’s finding to federal court. <i>See</i> §3612(i).</p>
<p id="c5e23805-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the foregoing, the Attorney General is empowered to bring lawsuits against persons who have engaged in a “pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any rights” granted by the act under §3614.</p>

Rev. 455, 509 (2007). <i>See also</i> Margery Austin Turner et al., U.S. Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., <i>Housing Discrimination Against Racial and Ethnic Minorities</i> (2013) (national discrimination study indicates that although overall discrimination against minorities has declined compared to similar studies over four decades, subtle discrimination persists, particularly in terms of the number of units shown to minority renters and home buyers). Many discrimination victims fail to report violations or pursue claims. Moreover, the delay and expense of litigation seriously undermine the deterrent value of the FHA.</p>
<p id="c5e23807-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, a “large amount of rental discrimination against racial minorities may be the result of unconscious bias by landlords who do not see themselves as prejudiced. To change this behavior will require efforts beyond simply more rigorous enforcement of the FHA’s intent-based nondiscrimination commands.” <i>Id.</i> Research by cognitive psychologists has shown that many people are influenced by unconscious racial bias. <i>See</i> Michelle Wilde Anderson &amp; Victoria C. Plaut, <i>Property Law: Implicit Bias and the Resilience of Spatial Colorlines</i>, in <i>Implicit Racial Bias Across the Law</i> (2012); Charles R.

The <i>Civil Rights Act of 1866</i>.</b> <i>Asbury</i> involved claims under both the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> and §1982. Section 1 of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1866</i>, passed pursuant to the thirteenth amendment and reenacted in 1870 after passage of the fourteenth amendment, provides that “[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.” 42 U.S.C. §1982. For more than a century, §1982 was interpreted as prohibiting states from passing statutes that deprived African Americans of the capacity to buy or lease real property. The act was interpreted, however, not to encompass discrimination by private housing providers unless mandated by state legislation. This situation changed in 1968 with <i>Jones v. Alfred Mayer Co.</i>, 392 U.S. 409 (1968), where the Supreme Court held that §1982 applied to private acts of discrimination as well as to discriminatory state action. Today almost all cases brought under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> also allege a violation of §1982.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10644_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10644_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span></p>

Those who are denied housing opportunities in violation of the act clearly may sue to vindicate their rights. It is also clear that the statute protects whites who are denied housing because of their association with minorities, <i>Littlefield v. Mack</i>, 750 F. Supp. 1395 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (white plaintiff was evicted from her apartment and harassed by defendant landlord because her boyfriend was African American and because they had a child), as well as minorities who are even visiting non-minority renters, see<i> Lane v. Cole</i>, 88 F. Supp. 2d 402, 406 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (black invitee who is excluded or coerced into leaving an apartment rented by a white tenant has standing)<i>.</i> White persons are also entitled to bring an action against a realtor who engaged in racial steering on the ground that they have been denied the “right to the important social, professional, business and economic, political and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from living in integrated communities free from discriminatory housing practices.” <i>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman</i>, 455 U.S. at 376-377. The Supreme Court also held in <i>Havens</i> that testers have standing to bring claims in federal court under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> against realtors and sellers who have engaged in racial discrimination. Finally, the Court held that an organization devoted to promoting equal access to housing could bring a lawsuit against a realtor who engaged in steering if it could demonstrate that the defendant’s steering practices caused the organization to <span title="1040" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1040">p. 1040</span>devote extra resources to identify available housing and counteract the defendant’s steering practices. <i>Id.</i> at 379.</p>
<p id="c5e25f1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Racial steering and discriminatory search.</b> Many cases brought under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> concern claims against realtors who have engaged in “racial steering.” This practice involves showing minority customers housing in certain areas and white customers housing in other areas. It also involves not telling minority customers about the availability of housing in certain areas. Such practices violate the act by “otherwise mak[ing] unavailable” housing because of race, <i>United States v. Mitchell</i>, 580 F.2d 789, 791-792 (5th Cir. 1978), and violate the express prohibition against discrimination in “real estate-related transactions” in 42 U.S.C. §3605, which prohibits discrimination by real estate brokers. Steering may also fall afoul of the act’s prohibition against “mak[ing] . . . any statement . . . with respect to the sale and rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination” on the basis of a protected class, 42 U.S.C. §3604(c), a prohibition that includes oral statements.</p>
<p id="c5e25f1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about the preferences of people actually seeking housing? It has traditionally been assumed that while the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> addresses efforts by realtors to steer home buyers and renters, and clearly prohibits discrimination in refusing to sell or rent, the act does not address the discriminatory preferences of people choosing where to live. As Professor Lee Anne Fennell has argued, however, allowing people unfettered choice in where to seek housing can shape the communities — and thus the housing choices — available to everyone else. <i>See</i> Lee Anne Fennell, <i>Searching for Fair Housing</i>, 97 B.U. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2017). Professor Fennell contends that even if the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> cannot be read to address discrimination on the part of those seeking homes, §1982 applies to both sides of a housing transaction and thus should be interpreted to cover such discrimination, at least when it involves race. <i>Id.</i> Part III.A. </p>
<p id="c5e25f1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Testers.</b> Gathering evidence of FHA violations often involves the use of “testers.” Testers are “individuals who, without an intent to rent or purchase a home or apartment, pose as renters or purchasers for the purpose of collecting evidence of unlawful steering practices.” <i>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman</i>, 455 U.S. 363, 373 (1982). Testing is done, for example, by using one or more persons to pose as a potential buyer in seeking assistance from a realtor. The plaintiff in <i>Asbury</i> used a form of testing when her sister-in-law approached the defendant landlord and asked for housing in the same complex in which the plaintiff had been denied housing. Testers may approach a realtor who has told an African American customer that no housing is available in a certain area; if the realtor shows houses in that area to the white buyer that were not shown to the African American buyer, it may be possible to draw an inference that the realtor was discriminating against the initial buyer on account of her race. Similarly, a white tester may approach a seller to see whether the seller offers different terms than were offered to a prior potential African American purchaser.</p>

Unlawful harassment and retaliation.</b> Section 3617 of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> makes it “unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the <span title="1041" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1041">p. 1041</span>exercise or enjoyment of” any “right granted or protected” by the act. Harassment and retaliation claims brought under this provision “account for a significant portion of all FHA claims.” Robert G. Schwemm, <i>Neighbor-on-Neighbor Harassment: Does the Fair Housing Act Make a Federal Case Out of It?</i>, 61 Case West. Res. L. Rev. 865, 865-866 (2011). Such claims can also give rise to criminal liability. <i>See id.</i> at 866 n.11 (citing <i>United States v. Jackson</i>, No. 3:10-CR-00120-KLH (W.D. La. 2010), where a defendant pled guilty to an FHA violation after placing a hangman’s noose in a home’s carport).</p>
<p id="c5e25f1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many cases under §3617 involve harassment or intimidation by neighbors. For a period of time, the Seventh Circuit took a narrow view of §3617 (and the FHA’s primary protection under §3604), following Judge Posner’s opinion in <i>Halprin v. Prairie Single Family Homes of Dearborn Park Association</i>, 388 F.3d 327 (7th Cir. 2004), on the theory that the act applies to people seeking housing, not activity that occurs after acquisition. Five years later, however, the Seventh Circuit reversed course in <i>Bloch v</i>. <i>Frischholz</i>, 587 F.3d 771 (7th Cir. 2009) (en banc), holding that §3617 applies to interference with rights protected by the act even after someone has obtained housing.

As of the year 2000, individuals of Hispanic or African-American ethnicity comprised 20.3% of Nassau County’s population. However, these minority groups comprised a disproportionate share of the County’s low-income population. While constituting 14.8% of all households in Nassau County, African-Americans and Hispanics represented 53.1% of the County’s “very low” income, non-elderly renter households. In addition, African-Americans made up 88% of the County’s waiting list for Section 8 housing [vouchers to fund] rental payments for qualifying low-income tenants in privately-owned buildings.</p>
<p id="c5e2863b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1042" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1042">p. 1042</span>Garden City’s African-American and Hispanic population in the year 2000 was 4.1%. However, excluding the 61% of the minority population representing students living in dormitories, Garden City’s minority population was only 2.6%. [S]everal of the communities surrounding Garden City are “majority-minority,” communities in which minorities make up a majority of the population.</p>
<p id="c5e2863c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the lack of affordable housing has long been a problem for Nassau County, Garden City contains no affordable housing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1072C_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1072C_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span> Indeed, in the past, Garden City and its residents have resisted the introduction of affordable housing into the community.</p>
<p id="c5e2863e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2002, Nassau County[, facing] a budget and infrastructure crisis[,] proposed to sell [a parcel of land containing] the former Nassau County Social Services Building, the parking lots for the Nassau County Supreme Court, a garage, an ancillary building, and additional parking facilities. The Social Services Site consists of two segments: (1) 21.44 acres located on the eastern side of County Seat Drive, the site of the former Social Services building and parking facilities; and (2) an additional 3.03 acres located on the western side of County Seat Drive, on which a County-owned building and a parking garage are located.</p>
<p id="c5e2863f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nassau County planned to sell the Social Services Site to a private developer, hoping to receive at least $30 million for the property. In June 2002, at the County’s request, Garden City began the process of rezoning the Social Services Site. This process was managed by the Garden City Board of Trustees, the elected body which governs Village affairs. In response to the County’s request, the Board of Trustees created a sub-committee [the P-Zone Committee] charged with retaining a planner and reviewing zoning options for the Social Services Site. Garden City also retained the planning firm of Buckhurst Fish and Jacquemart (“BFJ”) to provide a recommendation with regard to the rezoning of the Social Services Site.</p>
<p id="c5e28640-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 29, 2003, BFJ proposed applying “multi-family residential group” or “R-M” zoning controls to this property. R-M zoning would have allowed for the construction of up to 311 residential apartment units on the Site, or 75 single-family homes. BFJ reiterated the proposed R-M zoning in a May 2003 report to the P-Zone Committee, stating that the rezoning would “be likely to generate a net tax benefit to the Village.”</p>
<p id="c5e28641-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 29, 2003, BFJ gave a PowerPoint presentation of its May 2003 report at a public forum. At the forum, designed to solicit public input on the proposal, several residents expressed concern about the impact of 311 residential units on traffic and schools. In response to these citizen concerns, BFJ analyzed these issues further. In July 2003, BFJ issued a revised version of its study, which reiterated the proposal for R-M zoning. BFJ emphasized again that its proposal “would be careful of not overwhelming the neighborhoods with any significant adverse environmental impacts, particularly traffic, visual effects, or burdens on public facilities.” Upon review of the report, the P-Zone Committee adopted BFJ’s recommendation for R-M zoning for the approval of the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p id="c5e28642-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1043" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1043">p. 1043</span>On November 20, 2003, the Garden City Village Board of Trustees unanimously accepted the P-Zone Committee’s recommendation for the rezoning. Having endorsed the proposed rezoning, the Board of Trustees moved Local Law 1-2004 to a public hearing. On January 20, 2004, the Eastern Property Owners’ Association held a meeting at which Trustee [Peter] Bee discussed BFJ’s recommendation for the Social Services Site, [reiterating] that because relatively few schoolchildren resided in existing multi-family housing in Garden City, BFJ and the Board had reasonably predicted that multi-family housing would have less of an impact on schools than single-family housing. [A] majority of the residents “who asked questions or made comments” at the meeting supported restricting the rezoning of the Site to single-family homes. “Residents want[ed] to preserve the single-family character of the Village.” </p>
<p id="c5e28643-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 5, 2004, the Village held [another] public hearing on the proposed rezoning. Residents indicated their opposition to multi-family housing and their preference for single-family homes. One resident emphasized that the proposed multi-family development was not “in the flavor and character of what Garden City is now. Garden City started as a neighborhood of single family homes and it should remain as such.” Others stated, to applause from the audience, that “[w]e’re not against residential, we’re against multi-level residential.” One resident expressed concern about the possibility of “four people or ten people in an apartment and nobody is going to know that.” [Another resident said]: “We left a community in Queens County that started off similar, single family homes, two family homes, town houses that became — six story units. It was originally for the elderly, people who were looking to downsize. It started off that way. Right now you’ve got full families living in one bedroom townhouses, two bedroom co-ops, the school is overburdened and overcrowded.” </p>
<p id="c5e28644-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to public pressure, BFJ and Garden City began modifying the rezoning proposal. By a memorandum to the Board dated May 4, 2004, BFJ scrapped the proposed R-M zoning entirely. Instead, BFJ proposed rezoning the vast majority of the Social Services Site “Residential-Townhouse” (“R-T”), an entirely new zoning classification. The May 2004 proposal only preserved R-M zoning on the 3.03 acres of the Social Services Site west of County Seat Drive, and only by special permit. Thus, the development of multi-family housing would be restricted to less than 15% of the Social Services Site, and only by permit. </p>
<p id="c5e28645-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whereas the previous proposed rezoning took more than a year to come before the Board, the shift to R-T zoning moved rapidly through the Village’s government. BFJ issued a final [Environmental Assessment Form] (EAF) for R-T rezoning in May 2004. Even though BFJ officials testified that a switch from R-M zoning to R-T zoning was a significant change, no draft EAF was ever issued for the R-T rezoning. In addition, the shift from the P-Zone to R-T zoning moved to a public hearing on May 20, 2004. The Trustees further stated at this meeting that they hoped to have a final vote on the rezoning as soon as June 3, 2004, and that the bill had already been referred to the Nassau County Planning Commission. At this meeting, a member of the Garden City community thanked the Board of Trustees for responding to the concerns of residents:</p>

<p id="c5e28647-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On June 3, 2004, Garden City Board of Trustees unanimously adopted the Local Law No. 2-2004 and the Social Services Site was rezoned R-T. The following month, Nassau County issued a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) concerning the Social Services Site under the R-T zoning designation. The RFP stated that the County would not consider bids of less than $30 million.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs were unable to submit a bid meeting the specifications of the RFP. Ismene Speliotis, Executive Director of NYAHC/MHANY, analyzed the R-T zoning and concluded that it was not financially feasible to build affordable housing under R-T zoning restrictions at any acquisition price. The County ultimately awarded the contract to develop the Social Services Site to Fairhaven Properties, Inc. (“Fairhaven”), a developer of single-family homes, for $56.5 million, the highest bid. Fairhaven proposed the development of 87 single-family detached homes, and did not include any townhouses.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the contract was awarded to Fairhaven, NYAHC prepared four proposals, or “pro formas,” for development at the Social Services Site under the R-M zoning designation, with the percentage of affordable and/or Section 8 housing units of the 311 total rental units ranging from 15% to 25%. Plaintiffs’ expert Nancy McArdle evaluated each proposal in conjunction with the racial/ethnic distribution of the available pool of renters and determined that, had NYAHC been able to build housing under any of the four proposals in accordance with the rejected R-M zoning designation, the pool of renters likely to occupy all units, including market-rate, affordable, and Section 8 units, would have likely been between 18% and 32% minority, with minority households numbering between 56 and 101. Under the proposal predicting 18% minority population, NYAHC would have been able to bid $56.1 million for the Social Services Site.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McArdle further analyzed the likely racial composition of the pool of homeowners who could afford to purchase single-family units potentially developed by Fairhaven. She determined that between three and six minority households could afford such a purchase. Thus, while the NYAHC proposals would likely increase racial diversity in Garden City, McArdle testified, the Fairhaven proposal would likely leave the racial composition of Garden City “unchanged.”</p>

<p id="c5e2ad5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court concluded that Garden City’s decision to abandon R-M zoning in favor of R-T zoning was made with discriminatory intent. “The Supreme Court has long held, in a variety of circumstances, that a governmental body may not escape liability under the Equal Protection Clause merely because its discriminatory action was undertaken in response to the desires of a majority of its citizens.” <i>United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ. (Yonkers I)</i>, 837 F.2d 1181, 1224 (2d Cir. 1987); see also <i>Palmore v. Sidoti</i>, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) (“Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.”). We find no clear error in the district court’s determination that Garden City’s decision to abandon R-M zoning was a knowing response to the vocal and racially influenced opposition among Garden City’s citizenry.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Plaintiffs’ Prima Facie Case</i></p>
<p id="c5e2ad60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment “by showing that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the municipal decision-makers themselves or by those to whom the decision-makers were knowingly responsive.” [T]he district court premised its finding of racial discrimination primarily on two factors: (1) “the considerable impact that [the Village’s] zoning decision had on minorities in that community”; and (2) “the sequence of events involved in the Board’s decision to adopt R-T zoning instead of R-M zoning after it received public opposition to the prospect of affordable housing in Garden City.”</p>
<p id="c5e2ad61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court first noted statistical evidence that the original R-M proposal would have created a pool of potential renters with a significantly larger percentage of minority households than the pool of potential renters for the zoning proposal ultimately adopted as law by Garden City. However, in making its finding of discrimination, the district court relied primarily on the sequence of events leading up to the implementation of R-T zoning. The court first noted that Garden City officials and BFJ were initially enthusiastic about R-M zoning. BFJ’s proposal permitted the development of up to 311 multi-family units, and Trustee Bee expressed the opinion at a January 20, 2004 meeting that “Garden City demographically has a need for multi-family housing,” and that “he would keep an open mind but he still felt the recommended zoning change were appropriate.”</p>
<p id="c5e2ad62-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the district court concluded that BFJ and the Board abruptly reversed course in response to vocal citizen opposition to the possibility of multi-family <span title="1046" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1046">p. 1046</span>housing, including complaints that affordable housing with undesirable residents could be built under this zoning. The district court focused on the suddenness of this change. Although the P-Zone Committee had consistently recommended R-M zoning for eighteen months, R-T zoning went from proposal to enactment in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad63-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although now recognizing the oddness and abruptness of this sequence of events, Garden City argues that these facts should not raise any suspicion. The Village contends that because BFJ, the Village Trustees, and Village residents had discussed the zoning of the Site for more than a year, there was no need to spend additional time discussing the same issues once they settled on a preferable lower-density approach. While the adoption of R-T zoning may seem rushed, and appear to be an abrupt change from Garden City’s prior consistent course of conduct, according to Garden City, this was actually just efficient local government. While this may be one reasonable interpretation of the facts, the district court was nevertheless entitled to draw the contrary inference that the abandonment of R-M zoning was an abrupt change and that the “not nearly as deliberative” adoption of R-T zoning was suspect.</p>
<p id="c5e2ad64-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering the sequence of events leading up to the adoption of R-T zoning, the district court also focused closely on the nature of the citizen complaints regarding R-M zoning. Citizens expressed concerns about R-M zoning changing Garden City’s “character” and “flavor.” In addition, contrary to Garden City’s contentions that any references to affordable housing were isolated, citizens repeatedly and forcefully expressed concern that R-M zoning would be used to introduce affordable housing and associated undesirable elements into their community. Residents expressed concerns about development that would lead to “sanitation [that] is overrun,” “full families living in one bedroom townhouses, two bedroom co-ops” and “four people or ten people in an apartment.” Other residents requested that officials “guarantee” that the housing would be “upscale” because of concerns “about a huge amount of apartments that come and depress the market for any co-op owner in this Village.”</p>
<p id="c5e2ad65-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court also noted Garden City residents’ concerns about [the] possibility of creating “affordable housing,” specifically discussing a flyer warning that property values might decrease if apartments were built on the Site and that such apartments might be required to include affordable housing under legislation pending in the State legislature. </p>
<p id="c5e2ad66-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Viewing this opposition in light of (1) the racial makeup of Garden City, (2) the lack of affordable housing in Garden City, and (3) the likely number of minorities that would have lived in affordable housing at the Social Services Site, the district court concluded that Garden City officials’ abrupt change of course was a capitulation to citizen fears of affordable housing, which reflected race-based animus.</p>
<p id="c5e2d477-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find no clear error in the district court’s determination. The tenor of the discussion at public hearings and in the flyer circulated throughout the community shows that citizen opposition, though not overtly race-based, was directed at a potential influx of poor, minority residents. Although no one used explicitly racial language at the Garden City public hearing, Garden City residents expressed concern that R-M zoning would change the “flavor” and “character” of Garden City. Expressing concerns about <span title="1047" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1047">p. 1047</span>the sort of residents who might occupy an eventual complex, one resident feared that the proposed development “could have four people or ten people in an apartment and nobody is going to know that.” And citizens at the public hearing were “yelling” at [the County Executive.] [O]ne resident explained that he had left Queens because apartment buildings originally intended for the elderly resulted in “full families living in one bedroom townhouses, two bedroom co-ops, the school is overburdened and overcrowded. You can’t park your car. The sanitation is overrun.” Another resident stated that she had left Brooklyn to avoid exactly the sort of development potentially available for the Social Services Site.</p>
<p id="c5e2d478-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court concluded that, in light of the racial makeup of Garden City and the likely number of members of racial minorities that residents believed would have lived in affordable housing at the Social Services Site, these comments were code words for racial animus.</p>
<p id="c5e2d479-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Empirical evidence supports the reasonableness of the district court’s conclusion. Indeed, “research suggests that people believe that the majority of public housing residents are people of color, specifically, African American.” Garden City residents expressed concerns about their community becoming like communities with majority-minority populations, such as Brooklyn and Queens. Moreover, “a series of studies have shown that when Whites are asked why they would not want to live near African-Americans (no income level is indicated in the question), common responses relate to the fear of property value decline, increasing crime, decreasing community quality (e.g. physical decay of housing, trash in neighborhood, and unkempt lawns) and increasing violence.” Repeatedly expressing concerns that R-M zoning would lead to a decline in their property values as well as reduced quality of life in their community, Garden City residents urged the Board of Trustees to “keep Garden City what it is” and to “think of the people who live here.” Considering these statements in context, we find that the district court’s conclusion that citizen opposition to R-M zoning utilized code words to communicate their race-based animus to Garden City officials was not clearly erroneous.</p>
<p id="c5e2d47a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Discrimination Vel Non</i></p>
<p id="c5e2d47b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Here, the district court found that Garden City met its minimal burden of production on this issue, as Garden City contended that R-T zoning was adopted instead of R-M zoning because of concerns regarding traffic and school crowding, and because R-T zoning would facilitate the development of townhouses as a residential form.</p>
<p id="c5e2d47c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a defendant meets its burden of production, the sole remaining issue is discrimination <i>vel non</i>. The plaintiffs must prove that the defendants intentionally discriminated against them on a prohibited ground. Here the district court concluded that the shift in zoning had been motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory animus. It then [assessed] whether Garden City would have taken the same action solely on the basis of its purported legitimate reasons for rezoning. Reviewing these alternative rationales, the district court concluded that even accepting these legitimate reasons, <span title="1048" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1048">p. 1048</span>Garden City would not have adopted R-T zoning in the absence of discriminatory animus.</p>
<p id="c5e2d47d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to traffic, Garden City argues that its zoning expert testified that R-T zoning, as compared to R-M zoning, would potentially reduce traffic concerns. While the district court recognized this evidence, it also noted that traffic concerns became important to Garden City officials only after the increase in public opposition to affordable housing. In addition, the district court noted other record evidence suggesting any decrease in traffic between R-M and R-T zoning was de minimis. The district court thus did not err in questioning whether such concerns were sufficiently strong to cancel out any discriminatory animus.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107D6_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N107D6_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span></p>

<p id="c5e2d481-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Integration as a goal of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> and the persistence of segregation.</b> One goal of proponents of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> was to achieve “truly integrated and balanced living patterns,” 114 Cong. Rec. 3422 (1968) (statement of Senator Mondale), at a time of increasing concern about racial segregation. The act expressed this goal not only through its nondiscrimination provisions, but also through a broad mandate to federal agencies, and more importantly the state and local governments that the federal government funds through its programs, to take affirmative steps to respond to the legacy of segregation. 42 U.S.C. §3608(e)(5) (HUD must administer its programs and activities “in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of [the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>]”); §3608(d) (same for other federal agencies); U.S. Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., <i>Fair Housing Planning Guide</i>, Vol. 1, at 1-1 to 1-3 (describing planning tools to implement the “affirmatively furthering” obligation to foster inclusive communities). For an excellent discussion of these mandates and similar obligations in other civil rights statutes, see Olatunde C.A. Johnson, <i>Beyond the Private Attorney General: Equality Directives in American Law</i>, 87 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1339 (2012); <i>see also</i> Thomas Silverstein, <i>State Land Use Regulation in the Era of Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing</i>, 24 J. Affordable Housing &amp; Community. Dev. L. 305 (2015).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1080B_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1080B_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span> Although there are some signs of progress in long-term trends, see Edward Glaeser &amp; Jacob Vigdor, <i>The End of the Segregated Century: Racial Separation in American Neighborhoods</i> 1890-2010 (2012) (noting that African American segregation declined in the nation’s 85 largest metropolitan areas in the first decade of the twenty-first century and that in all but one of the 658 housing markets tracked by the Census Bureau, average segregation is below 1970 levels), segregation on the basis of race remains a persistent challenge in many of the nation’s communities, see Douglas S. Massey,<i> The Legacy of the 1968 Fair Housing Act,</i> 30 Sociological Forum 571, 578-582 (2015) (highlighting, among other <span title="1049" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1049">p. 1049</span>findings, the uneven nature of progress in African American integration, the persistence of hypersegregation, and the increase in segregation for Hispanics)<b>.</b></p>
<p id="c5e2d483-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Integration versus nondiscrimination and the distinction between “intent” and “motive.”</b> The Fair Housing Act’s prohibition on intentional discrimination can conflict with its integration mandate, as was made clear in <i>United States v. Starrett City Associates</i><span class="epub-small-caps">,</span> 840 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir. 1988). The case involved efforts by the owners of a nearly 6,000-unit apartment complex in Brooklyn, New York, to maintain a racially integrated community. Faced with difficulties in attracting a diverse pool of apartment seekers, the owners adopted a tenant screening process that had preserved a community balance of roughly 64 percent white, 22 percent black, and 8 percent Hispanic tenants for more than a decade starting in the mid-1970s. The process sorted qualified applicants by race and then selected tenants from this pool to match the race of tenants leaving when vacancies opened. The owners defended the quota system on the argument that the matching was “not motivated by racial animus” and was necessary to “achieve and maintain integration,” citing expert opinion that white tenants tend to leave communities when the minority population reaches roughly 10 percent to 20 percent. The owners further cited legislative history that suggested that Congress was primarily concerned with segregation, and saw the antidiscrimination provisions of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> as means to that end. The Second Circuit rejected these arguments, holding that the act prohibits discriminatory housing practices regardless of motivation and that when the act’s antidiscrimination and integration imperatives clash, the former prevails.</p>
<p id="c5e2d484-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A dissenting opinion in <i>Starrett City</i> cited Dr. Kenneth Clark to support the idea of allowing racial quotas to prevent “tipping” and thereby to promote the development of integrated communities. Dr. Clark’s testimony provided the factual basis for the ruling in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which focused on the psychological harm that segregated schools inflicted on African American children. Another noted scholar, Professor Derrick Bell, has criticized the use of such quotas. Bell notes that it is wrong for African American citizens to be denied housing they would otherwise get simply because of white prejudice. In effect, when an exclusionary quota is used to prevent tipping, the number of housing units available to African Americans is measured by the extent of white prejudice in the housing complex; the more prejudice, the lower the tipping level and the fewer the units available to African American purchasers or renters. Bell argues that “[a] so-called benign housing quota seems invidious to the blacks excluded by its operation. They are no less victims of housing bias than are those excluded from neighborhoods by restrictive covenants.” Derrick Bell, <i>And We Are Not Saved: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice</i> 153 (1989).</p>

<p id="c5e2fba3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Dale] Winter owned more than twenty rental homes in Sioux City, Iowa. Many of Winter’s tenants were low-income women who received Section 8 housing vouchers (housing vouchers) from the Sioux City Housing Authority (SCHA) to help pay their rent. In 2000, [Jaymie] Quigley, along with her then-husband and her four children, rented a home from Winter. Quigley used a housing voucher to pay her rent.</p>
<p id="c5e2fba4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2002, Quigley informed Winter she was eligible to move into a larger home. Winter drove Quigley in his car to one of Winter’s other properties. Quigley inspected the property, and when she returned to the car, Winter rubbed his hand down Quigley’s arm and said, “[W]ell, how do you like it?” Quigley recalled this incident made her feel “[s]cared” and “yucky.” Quigley, her boyfriend, and her children moved into a different rental property owned by Winter, using a housing voucher to pay the rent.</p>
<p id="c5e2fba5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1051" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1051">p. 1051</span>In 2004, Quigley’s boyfriend moved to Louisiana to visit his ill father. After Quigley’s boyfriend moved out of the house, Winter behaved inappropriately toward Quigley on several other occasions. First, Quigley learned from a neighbor that Winter had been inside Quigley’s house without prior notice when Quigley was not at home. When Quigley went to her bedroom, she noticed her housecoat, which had been hanging on the back of the bedroom door when she left, was now lying on her bed. Quigley confronted Winter about entering the home without giving prior notice, and Winter claimed he had to replace the screen on Quigley’s bedroom window. Quigley’s screen was not damaged and had not been replaced.</p>
<p id="c5e2fba6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One evening, Winter came to inspect Quigley’s house while she was making dinner for her children. On that occasion, Winter stood very close to Quigley and rubbed his genital area. Another time, Winter came to Quigley’s house for an inspection at 9:30 or 10:00 in the evening without giving Quigley prior notice. Quigley’s fourteen year-old sister was staying the night with her, and they were in their pajamas getting ready for bed. While conducting his inspection, Winter followed Quigley and her sister into a bedroom and then a bathroom, which made them feel uncomfortable. Quigley and her sister were watching television, and Winter lay down on Quigley’s sectional couch after he completed the inspection. Winter stayed on the couch for five or ten minutes until Quigley said, “Hey, Dale, we’re going to bed.” Quigley had to tell Winter to leave “at least three times” before he left. Quigley also reported receiving phone calls from Winter at inappropriate times, sometimes as late as 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning. Winter sounded intoxicated when he called, and the phone calls made Quigley feel scared and worried about protecting her children and younger sister.</p>
<p id="c5e2fba7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quigley wanted to move out of the house because of Winter’s conduct, but she would have lost her housing voucher if she broke the lease. Quigley met with her SCHA worker and reported Winter’s inappropriate actions. Quigley asked if she could change the locks on her rental home, but the housing worker told her she could not change the locks unless she gave Winter a key. The housing worker told Quigley she could get out of the lease without losing her housing voucher if Winter agreed to rescind the lease. When Quigley asked Winter to release her from the lease, Winter refused. Thereafter, Quigley changed the locks on her door without giving Winter a key.</p>
<p id="c5e2fba8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About a month and a half before Quigley’s lease ended, Winter showed up at her house while Quigley, her sister, and Quigley’s friend were outside lying in the sun. Quigley approached Winter’s vehicle and inquired whether she would be getting her deposit back. Winter fluttered his hand against Quigley’s stomach and said, “My eagle eyes have not seen everything yet.” Winter followed Quigley to the porch. Quigley observed Winter staring at Quigley’s sister’s chest. Quigley’s sister was wearing shorts and a sport bra, so Quigley told her sister to “go get something on.” Winter said to Quigley’s sister, “You’re really mature. How old are you?” When Quigley said her sister was “only 14,” Winter said, “Well, she looks a lot more mature than you.” Quigley’s friend went to her car to get a cigarette, and Winter noticed the friend had a scar on her back. Winter traced the scar with his finger, without consent, pulling the friend’s pants downward to see where the scar ended. Quigley moved out of the rental home, and Winter did not return her deposit.</p>

<p id="c5e2fbaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2006, Quigley filed a complaint against Winter in the district court, alleging sexual harassment; sex discrimination; and coercion, intimidation, threats, and interference with Quigley’s rights, in violation of the [<i>Fair Housing Act</i>] and the [<i>Iowa Civil Rights Act</i>]. Quigley also asserted a breach of contract claim against Winter based upon Winter’s failure to return Quigley’s deposit. Winter brought a breach of contract counterclaim against Quigley, insisting Quigley owed him unpaid rent and failed to leave the rental home “in a clean and satisfactory condition.” The jury found in favor of Quigley, and against Winter, on Winter’s counterclaim and each of Quigley’s claims, and awarded Quigley $13,685.00 in compensatory damages for the housing claims, $400.00 for Quigley’s breach of contract claim, and $250,000.00 in punitive damages. Following a hearing on [subsequent] motions, the district court entered an order reducing the award of punitive damages from $250,000.00 to $20,527.50.</p>
<p id="c5e2fbab-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Hostile Housing Environment Created by Sexual Harassment</i></p>
<p id="c5e2fbac-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a preliminary matter, Winter questions whether a claim for hostile housing environment created by sexual harassment is actionable under the FHA. We conclude it is. <i>See Neudecker v. Boisclair Corp.</i>, 351 F.3d 361, 364 (8th Cir. 2003) (recognizing a cause of action under the FHA for hostile housing environment created by disability harassment and citing, with approval, cases from other jurisdictions recognizing an FHA claim for hostile housing environment created by sexual harassment); <i>see also DiCenso v. Cisneros</i>, 96 F.3d 1004, 1008 (7th Cir. 1996) (recognizing an FHA claim for hostile housing environment created by sexual harassment); <i>Honce v. Vigil</i>, 1 F.3d 1085, 1089-90 (10th Cir. 1993) (same).</p>
<p id="c5e2fbad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, Winter insists there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict in favor of Quigley on her hostile housing environment created by sexual harassment claim. In this case, there was sufficient evidence to support a hostile housing environment claim if a reasonable jury could find Quigley proved by a preponderance of the evidence Winter subjected her to unwelcome sexual harassment, and the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to interfere with or deprive Quigley of her right to use or enjoy her home. <i>See DiCenso</i>, 96 F.3d at 1008 (“Applied to the housing context, a claim [of hostile housing environment caused by sexual harassment] is actionable ‘when the offensive behavior unreasonably interferes with use and enjoyment of the premises.’ ” (quoting <i>Honce</i>, 1 F.3d at 1090) (“The harassment must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the housing arrangement.”)).</p>
<p id="c5e322be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Winter denies he subjected Quigley to sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, and, alternatively, any sexual harassment Quigley experienced was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to support the jury’s verdict. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Quigley, we conclude Quigley presented sufficient evidence of numerous unwanted interactions of a sexual nature that interfered with Quigley’s use and enjoyment of her home. Quigley testified Winter subjected her to unwanted touching on two occasions, made sexually suggestive comments, rubbed his genitals <span title="1053" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1053">p. 1053</span>in front of her, placed several middle of the night phone calls to her home, made repeated unannounced visits, and, on one occasion, while Winter lay on Quigley’s couch, had to be told to leave her home at least three times before he complied. We emphasize that Winter subjected Quigley to these unwanted interactions in her own home, a place where Quigley was entitled to feel safe and secure and need not flee, which makes Winter’s conduct even more egregious.</p>
<p id="c5e322bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>“Quid Pro Quo” Sexual Harassment</i></p>
<p id="c5e322c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Winter next contends the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law on Quigley’s “quid pro quo” sexual harassment claim. “ ‘Quid pro quo’ harassment occurs when housing benefits are explicitly or implicitly conditioned on sexual favors.” <i>Honce</i>, 1 F.3d at 1089; <i>cf</i>. <i>Ogden v. Wax Works, Inc.</i>, 214 F.3d 999, 1006 n.8 (8th Cir. 2000) (“To prevail on her [employment discrimination] quid pro quo claim, [plaintiff] needed to prove (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment in the form of sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; (3) the harassment was based on sex; and (4) her submission to the unwelcome advances was an express or implied condition for receiving job benefits or her refusal to submit resulted in a tangible job detriment.” (citation omitted)).</p>
<p id="c5e322c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the evidence of “quid pro quo” harassment was not overwhelming, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Quigley, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict. Specifically, when Quigley inquired about the likelihood of receiving her deposit back from Winter, Winter fluttered his hand against Quigley’s stomach and said, “My eagle eyes have not seen everything yet.” The jury could reasonably infer Winter was telling Quigley the return of her deposit was conditioned upon Winter seeing more of Quigley’s body or even receiving a sexual favor, which would amount to “quid pro quo” sexual harassment. We will not disturb the jury’s verdict.</p>
<p id="c5e322c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Coercion, Intimidation, or Interference with Housing Rights</i></p>
<p id="c5e322c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Winter maintains the district court should not have denied Winter’s post-trial motion on Quigley’s coercion, intimidation, and interference claim under 42 U.S.C. §3617. Winter contends Quigley’s claim was “essentially a retaliation claim” and Quigley failed to prove retaliation.</p>
<p id="c5e322c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">24 C.F.R. §100.400 gives the following examples of conduct prohibited by 42 U.S.C. §3617:</p>

As Quigley points out, retaliation is only one form of conduct prohibited under §3617. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Quigley, we conclude there was more than sufficient evidence of coercion, intimidation, and interference with Quigley’s enjoyment of her housing rights, other than retaliation, to support the jury’s verdict.</p>
<p id="c5e322ca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>Punitive Damages</i></p>
<p id="c5e322cb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We first address Winter’s contention that the district court erred in allowing the jury to consider punitive damages. “The [FHA] provides for the recovery of punitive damages by victims of discriminatory housing practices.” <i>Badami v. Flood</i>, 214 F.3d 994, 997 (8th Cir. 2000) (citing 42 U.S.C. §3613(c)(1) (1994)). We apply the same standard for punitive damages in [FHA] cases as we do in employment discrimination and 42 U.S.C. §1983 civil rights cases. “Punitive damages are appropriate in a federal civil rights action ‘when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.’ ” <i>Id</i>. at 997.</p>
<p id="c5e322cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court determined Quigley had presented sufficient evidence to justify instructing the jury on punitive damages, because Winter admitted at trial he knew sexual harassment was unlawful, he had been a landlord for many years and managed many properties, he had worked with various governmental agencies to provide subsidized housing, and his lease agreement with Quigley stated he, as the landlord, was not to discriminate on the basis of sex. We agree with the district court. The district court did not err in submitting punitive damages for the jury’s consideration.</p>
<p id="c5e322cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury found Quigley was entitled to punitive damages in the amount of $250,000.00, and the district court entered judgment. Winter then filed a motion to amend the judgment to reduce the punitive damages award. The district court noted the punitive damages award was more than eighteen times the compensatory damages award ($13,685.00) and found the award was excessive and did not comport with due process. The district court reduced the award to $20,527.50, which amounted to one and a half times the compensatory damages award, “for the simple reason that [Winter’s] conduct . . . can be considered only as to what he said and did directly to [Quigley].”</p>
<p id="c5e348de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quigley challenges the district court’s analysis, arguing the jury’s punitive damages award complied with due process and the original award should be reinstated. To assess the reasonableness or excessiveness of a punitive damages award, we consider: (1) “the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct,” (2) the ratio between punitive damages and actual harm (compensatory damages), and (3) “the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.” <i>BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore</i>, 517 U.S. 559, 575, 580-81 (1996).</p>
<p id="c5e348df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Winter’s conduct was reprehensible. Quigley lived alone with small children at the time of Winter’s harassment, and she had few, if any, alternative housing options. Quigley’s financial vulnerability was evidenced by her need for Section 8 housing vouchers. Winter held a certain level of power over Quigley and her family. Winter <span title="1055" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1055">p. 1055</span>repeatedly subjected Quigley to inappropriate conduct during Quigley’s tenancy, and Winter’s conduct was unquestionably intentional and more than churlish. Most significant, Winter’s conduct intruded upon Quigley’s sense of security in her own home. However, as we explain below, we do not believe the degree of reprehensibility of Winter’s conduct justifies the jury’s large punitive damages award.</p>
<p id="c5e348e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing we are not bound by a rigid mathematical formula, we nevertheless, are persuaded a single-digit multiplier is appropriate in the present case. We take our guidance from the Supreme Court’s assessment of single-digit multipliers. Quigley was awarded $13,685.00 in compensatory damages, which is not a nominal amount. We find the circumstances of this case and due process do not justify a punitive damages award eighteen times greater than the compensatory damages and, agreeing with the district court, conclude the jury’s punitive damage award was excessive.</p>
<p id="c5e348e1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn then to the final <i>Gore</i> factor, a comparison between the punitive damages award and the civil and criminal penalties available for comparable misconduct. “[A] reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should ‘accord “substantial deference” to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.’ ” <i>Gore</i>, 517 U.S. at 583. Quigley points out 42 U.S.C. §3614 permits the Attorney General to commence a civil action against “any person . . . engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by the [FHA].” Section 3614(d)(1)(C), as adjusted by the <i>Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990</i>, Pub. L. No. 101-410, §5(a)(4), 104 Stat. 891, and 29 C.F.R. §85.3(b)(3), states a court may grant relief for a first violation in an amount not exceeding $55,000.</p>
<p id="c5e348e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we agree with the district court that the jury’s punitive damage award was excessive, we disagree with the district court’s assessment that $20,527.50, which is one and a half times the compensatory award, sufficiently reflects the reprehensibility of Winter’s conduct. We conclude an appropriate punitive damages award in this case is $54,750. This amount is four times greater than Quigley’s compensatory damages ($13,685.00), which we find is an appropriate ratio under the circumstances of this case. This amount comports with due process, while achieving the statutory and regulatory goals of retribution and deterrence.</p>

<p id="c5e348e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Sex discrimination by a landlord.</b> Although the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> does not expressly define sexual harassment as sex discrimination, <i>Quigley</i> illustrates how courts have reached that conclusion nonetheless. <i>See also Williams v. Poretsky Management, Inc.</i>, 955 F. Supp. 490 (D. Md. 1996) (sexual harassment of tenant by building superintendent violates <i>Fair Housing Act</i>). <i>Cf. Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</i>, 477 U.S. 57 (1986) (interpreting Title VII of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1964</i> to define sexual harassment as sex discrimination in the employment context). Some state laws, by contrast, explicitly define sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination. <i>See Edouard v. Kozubal</i>, No. 98-BPR-0957, 2002 WL 977225 (MCAD) (Mass. Commn. Against Discrimination, 2002) (applying Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B §1(18)).</p>
<p id="c5e348e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1056" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1056">p. 1056</span><b>2. How severe must the harassment be?</b> In <i>DiCenso v. Cisneros</i>, 96 F.3d 1004 (7th Cir. 1996), when the landlord came to the tenant’s apartment to collect the rent he caressed her arm and back, and said that if she could not pay the rent, she could “take care of it in other ways”; when she slammed the door in his face, he called her a “bitch” and a “whore.” The Seventh Circuit noted that employment discrimination cases had recognized sex discrimination in the context of a “hostile environment” and that those cases required the employer’s conduct to be “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment,” <i>id</i>. at 1008 (quoting<i> Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</i>, 510 U.S. 16, 21 (1993)), and that this one incident did not rise to that level. Do you agree? <i>See</i> Michele Adams, <i>Knowing Your Place: Theorizing Sexual Harassment at Home</i>, 40 Ariz. L. Rev. 17 (1998) (arguing that housing discrimination should be subject to different standards than employment discrimination because of the importance of the home as a safe place).</p>
<p id="c5e348e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Would the plaintiff in <i>DiCenso</i> have a remedy under §3604(c)? <i>See</i> Robert G. Schwemm &amp; Rigel C. Oliveri, <i>A New Look at Sexual Harassment Under the Fair Housing Act: The Forgotten Role of §3604(c)</i>, 2002 Wis. L. Rev. 771, 814-815 (arguing in the affirmative).</p>
<p id="c5e348e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Domestic violence and the <i>Fair Housing Act.</i></b> Victims of domestic violence can subsequently suffer housing discrimination as a result. For example, landlords sometimes evict survivors of domestic violence under “zero-tolerance” policies that mandate eviction for criminal activity or because of complaints by other tenants. <i>See</i> Lenora M. Lapidus, <i>Doubly Victimized: Housing Discrimination Against Victims of Domestic Violence</i>, 11 J. Gender, Soc. Poly. &amp; L. 377 (2003). A handful of cases have addressed whether such evictions constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, given that the overwhelming majority of victims of domestic violence are women. For example, in <i>Bouley v. Young-Sabourin</i>, 394 F. Supp. 2d 675 (D. Vt. 2005), a woman had called the police after her husband attacked her in the apartment they had rented with their two children upstairs from their landlord. The woman obtained a restraining order against her husband, who eventually pled guilty to criminal charges related to the incident. Three days after the assault, the landlord visited the woman, attempting to resolve the dispute, and allegedly sought to engage in a discussion of religion. The victim got upset and the landlord left. Later that day, the landlord served the victim with a notice of eviction, citing a provision of the lease that provided that the tenant “will not use or allow said premises or any part thereof to be used for unlawful purposes, in any noisy, boisterous or any other manner offensive to any other occupant of the building.” Ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court held that the victim had presented a <i>prima facie</i> case of sex discrimination (and discrimination on the basis of religion) under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>.</p>
<p id="c5e348e9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Title VI of the <i>Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013</i>, Pub. L. No. 113-4, 127 Stat. 54 (Mar. 7, 2013), reauthorized provisions of the former <i>Violence Against Women Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §14043e <i>et seq</i>., that, since 2005, had provided victims of domestic violence with some protection from eviction. The 2013 <i>Reauthorization <span title="1057" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1057">p. 1057</span>Act</i> expanded these protections to include a much wider range of federally subsidized housing programs than the earlier 2005 version.</p>
<p id="c5e348ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Sexual orientation.</b> It is quite clear that a landlord commits race discrimination if she refuses to rent to a white female tenant because that tenant’s boyfriend is African American. By analogy, it appears clear that a refusal to rent to someone who is gay commits sex discrimination because the denial is based on the sex of the persons to whom the prospective tenant is attracted or has a relationship. In addition, such a landlord is engaged in a form of sex stereotyping by assuming that tenants should have sexual partners only of the opposite sex. <i>See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</i>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (sex discrimination in employment when employer engaged in sex stereotyping by not giving partnership to a woman who was deemed “too masculine”). However, no court has held that discrimination in the housing market on the basis of sexual orientation constitutes sex discrimination, partly because only about 20 states have statutes expressly prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations or housing on the basis of sexual orientation, see §2.5, below, and the courts have interpreted the antidiscrimination laws not to show evidence of a legislative intent to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p id="c5e36ffb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Enforcement and attorneys’ fees.</b> Courts may award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party in an FHA action. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §3613(c). Courts usually apply the “lodestar” approach to determining attorneys’ fees, which calculates the entitlement based on a determination of hours reasonably expended and reasonable hourly rates. Can you see why attorneys’ fee questions are particularly important in cases like <i>Quigley</i>?</p>

Stat. tit. 9 §4503(a). Defendants claim that the court’s findings on disparate-treatment discrimination are clearly erroneous because the evidence did not show any intent to discriminate, [and] the court committed plain error by holding Ernest LaBrie personally liable for unfair housing practices. We affirm.</p>
<p id="c5e3700d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 1, 1981, Linda and Ernest LaBrie purchased Limehurst Mobile Home Park. The Park consists of thirty-three mobile home lots. Most of the residents own their own mobile homes and rent only the lot. LaBrie, Inc. purchased the Park from Ernest and Linda LaBrie on October 30, 1987. Ernest and Linda LaBrie are the sole corporate officers and shareholders of LaBrie, Inc. Ernest LaBrie is the president, and Linda LaBrie is the vice-president and treasurer. The office of LaBrie, Inc. is in their home. The Park is managed primarily by Linda, who is responsible for renting units, collecting rent, and making all general management decisions. She also sets policies, rules, and lease terms, and approves residents for tenancy. Ernest is primarily responsible for maintenance under the direction of Linda but is aware of the decisions made by Linda.</p>
<p id="c5e3700e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the LaBries purchased the Park, the lease term on occupancy stated “that only one family shall occupy a mobile home on a permanent basis.” In 1982, the LaBries changed the occupancy provision to:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e3700f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lessees, who have entered into a lease agreement after April 1, 1982, shall <i>not</i> be permitted to have <i>children under the age of 18 years</i> reside in their mobile home unit.

<p id="c5e37010-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In July 1988, the occupancy provision was essentially the same but stated in addition, “This age restriction applies to all lots at Limehurst Mobile Home Park based on VSA 9-4508(b).”</p>
<p id="c5e39721-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In April 1989, the occupancy provision was revised to state:</p>

</div>
<p id="c5e39723-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Currently, only one mobile home in the Park houses a family with a minor child. This family moved into the Park prior to 1982. No persons with minor children moved into the Park after the LaBries purchased it, even after the occupancy provision was changed from adults-only to a two-occupant maximum. The population of the Park declined from May 1981 to May 1990, from ninety-five residents to sixty residents. The LaBries also own two other mobile home parks, four homes leased as residential units, and twelve mobile homes throughout Vermont. There are minor children living in many of these homes.</p>
<p id="c5e39724-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scott and Luanne McCarthy purchased a mobile home in the Park for $7,000 in August 1986. Linda LaBrie sent them a letter on August 1, 1986, accepting their application, and stating: “We remind you that Limehurst Mobile Home Park is an adult park and if you should have children in the future you will be required to vacate Limehurst Mobile Home Park prior to the arrival of said child.” In July 1989, the McCarthys contacted a broker to sell their mobile home because Luanne was pregnant. The broker determined that the McCarthys should ask $18,000 for their home.</p>
<p id="c5e39725-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The McCarthys’ son was born September 18, 1989. When they returned home from the hospital, they found a letter from Linda LaBrie informing them that they must vacate the premises “upon arrival of your third occupant.” Following the letter, the McCarthys received telephone calls, visits, and additional letters from Linda LaBrie telling them to vacate the Park. On December 28, 1989, the McCarthys were served with a summons and complaint for eviction brought by the LaBries in the name of LaBrie, Inc. d/b/a Limehurst Mobile Home Park.</p>
<p id="c5e39726-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the McCarthys informed the LaBries that they had accepted a deposit for the sale of their home, the LaBries delayed the sale, indicating that they would not act on the purchasers’ application until the eviction action was resolved. The purchasers’ application was approved February 25, 1990, and the McCarthys sold their mobile home on March 2, 1990, for $13,000. At trial, the broker testified that one-half of potential purchasers were ineligible because a minor child in the family put them over the occupancy limit. There was conflicting evidence regarding the value of the home, but the court determined that the fair market value of the home at the time of the sale was $13,000.</p>
<p id="c5e39727-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From September 1989 through March 1990, while living at the Park, Luanne McCarthy felt humiliated by Linda LaBrie’s demands to vacate the premises. Consequently, she did not leave her home often. She was unable to sleep and had chest pains. The McCarthys moved from the Park to the home of Scott McCarthy’s parents, where they had to share a family room in the basement with their newborn child. Luanne McCarthy worried about their inability to find their own housing; her chest pains increased and she was given two medications to relieve stress.</p>
<p id="c5e39728-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The McCarthys filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, which commenced this action in Washington Superior Court in October 1990, alleging that defendants LaBrie, Inc., Linda LaBrie, and Ernest LaBrie violated the <i>Fair Housing and <span title="1060" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1060">p. 1060</span>Public Accommodations Act</i>, Vt. Stat. tit. 9 §4503(a)(1)-(3), by discriminating against persons intending to occupy a dwelling with one or more minor children. The Commission contended that the restrictive occupancy limit for the Park (1) was adopted for the purpose of discriminating against persons with minor children by either limiting or eliminating them from occupancy in the Park, and (2) although facially neutral, has an unlawful discriminatory impact because it excluded persons with minor children in significant numbers. Defendants maintained that the occupancy limit was necessary due to limited water and septic capacity.</p>
<p id="c5e39729-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, both parties presented expert testimony on the capacity of the septic system and water supply at the Park. Defendants’ expert testified that the septic system at the Park was adequate to serve a maximum of sixty-six people. The court found that the expert had not performed the tests necessary to properly assess the potential capacity of the septic system, and concluded that there was no credible evidence that the system could not support an increase in population in the Park. Similarly, the court found that there was no credible evidence that water supply or water pressure was inadequate to serve more than sixty-six people. Although the court acknowledged the LaBries’ fear that problems — which had existed prior to installation of a new well and replacement of their leachfields — would reoccur, it concluded that the LaBries have less restrictive alternatives available to them than the two-person occupancy limit.</p>
<p id="c5e3972a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court concluded that plaintiff had established that the McCarthys were evicted due to the presence of a minor child, and that persons with minor children were constructively denied access to housing in the Park by the two-person occupancy limit. Further, the court concluded that defendants had not established the occupancy limit as a legitimate business necessity arising from septic and water capacities of the Park. Accordingly, the court held that defendants had violated Vt. Stat. tit. 9 §4503(a) and awarded the McCarthys $2,700 in attorney’s fees for the eviction proceeding, $1,500 for the emotional distress and humiliation suffered as a result of defendants’ actions, $3,000 for loss of civil rights caused by the eviction and by restricting potential purchasers, and $3,000 in punitive damages. The court also awarded the Human Rights Commission civil penalties of $6,000. In subsequent orders, the court permanently enjoined defendants from adopting or enforcing a two-person-per-lot occupancy limit at the Limehurst Mobile Home Park, and awarded plaintiff $51,072 in attorney’s fees, $2,194.39 for expenses and $240 for discovery costs. Defendants appeal.</p>
<p id="c5e3972b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Vermont Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act</i> (FHPA), Vt. Stat. tit. 9 §§4500-4507, prohibits discrimination in renting “a dwelling or other real estate to any person because of the race, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, religious creed, color, national origin or handicap of a person, or because a person intends to occupy a dwelling with one or more minor children, or because a person is a recipient of public assistance.” Vt. Stat. tit. 9 §4503(a)(1). Discrimination on the basis of age, or because a person intends to occupy a dwelling with one or more minor children, has been prohibited in the rental of dwelling units in Vermont since 1986.</p>
<p id="c5e3972c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mobile home lot rentals were, however, covered by a separate provision enacted in 1988, which did not strictly prohibit discrimination on the basis of age or because a person intended to occupy a dwelling with one or more minor children. The <span title="1061" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1061">p. 1061</span>mobile-home-lot-rental provision was repealed in 1989, when the Legislature revised Vermont’s housing discrimination laws to comply with the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i> Amendments of 1988. Thus, Vermont’s general housing-discrimination provision has been applicable to the rental of mobile home lots since 1989.</p>
<p id="c5e3972d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">FHPA is patterned on Title VIII of the <i>Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act)</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3631, and therefore, in construing FHPA, we consider cases construing the federal statute. Courts analyzing Title VIII, the federal housing-discrimination statute, often rely on cases analyzing Title VII, the federal employment-discrimination statute. Accordingly, we also consider Vermont and federal employment-discrimination law in analyzing the instant case.</p>
<p id="c5e3972e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff alleged violations of FHPA under two theories of discrimination law: (1) disparate treatment — defendants intentionally discriminated against members of a statutorily protected category because of their membership in that group, and (2) disparate impact — defendants’ facially neutral policy has a disproportionate effect on a statutorily protected category. The trial court found defendants liable for housing discrimination under both theories. We do not address defendants’ challenges to the trial court’s finding of disparate impact because we uphold the trial court’s decision on the theory of disparate treatment.</p>
<p id="c5e3972f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants first claim that the court erred in finding disparate treatment or intent to discriminate in the absence of any direct evidence of discrimination against persons with minor children. Intentional discrimination may be shown by circumstantial or direct evidence. Thus, the short answer to defendants’ challenge is that no direct evidence is necessary to prove a disparate-treatment discrimination claim. Indeed, direct evidence of unlawful discrimination is often difficult to obtain.</p>
<p id="c5e39730-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, however, plaintiff presented direct evidence of discrimination. [E]vidence of a discriminatory practice prior to civil rights legislation, coupled with a post-legislation pattern of maintaining the status quo, may be sufficient to establish the intent to continue the discrimination through a neutral policy. In this case, the trial court found that defendants clearly excluded minor children from the Park prior to 1989. That year, Vermont’s mobile-home-lot-rental provision was repealed, and defendants changed the occupancy provision in their leases from adults-only to a two-person maximum. Although the new occupancy provision appears neutral on its face, defendants have maintained the status quo at the Park — no minor children have moved into the Park since defendants purchased it. This evidence is sufficient to infer that the two-person occupancy limit was adopted for the purpose of eliminating or limiting persons with minor children from the Park. Based on defendants’ actions against the McCarthys and defendants’ pattern and practice of excluding minor children from the Park, we conclude that there was no clear error in the trial court finding an intent to discriminate against persons intending to occupy a dwelling with one or more minor children.</p>
<p id="c5e39731-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to Vt. Stat. tit. 9 §4504(4), defendants assert as an affirmative defense that their actions against the McCarthys were based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory occupancy limit. Section 4504(4) provides that the unfair-housing-practices provisions do not apply “to limit a landlord’s right to establish and enforce legitimate business <span title="1062" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1062">p. 1062</span>practices necessary to protect and manage the rental property, such as the use of references. However, this subdivision shall not be used as a pretext for discrimination in violation of this section.” FHPA is a remedial statute; thus, we construe it generously and read exemptions narrowly.</p>
<p id="c5e39732-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, defendants maintained that their occupancy limit is based on legitimate septic and water capacity considerations. They presented evidence that the septic system at the Park was capable of handling a maximum of sixty-six people — or two persons per lot. They also presented evidence on the limits of the Park’s water supply. The trial court rejected this defense, finding that defendants had failed to present credible evidence that an increase in the number of occupants per living unit would adversely affect the septic or water systems. It also found that there are less restrictive alternatives available to defendants. The court, therefore, concluded that the business necessity advanced by defendants was not legitimate, but rather, a mere pretext for discriminating against persons with minor children.</p>
<p id="c5e39733-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i> has an occupancy restriction provision, which allows only reasonable local, state or federal restriction on the maximum number of occupants per dwelling. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C.A. §3607(b)(1). Courts have found privately imposed occupancy limits, such as the limit imposed by defendants in this case, to unreasonably limit or exclude persons with minor children, and therefore, violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> United States v. Lepore</i>, 816 F. Supp. 1011, 1023 (M.D. Pa. 1991) (court cannot conclude two-person-per-mobile-home lot limitation is reasonable when defendants have never attempted any water-saving or septic-system alternatives). We agree that a privately enforced occupancy limit must be at minimum reasonable. Defendants failed to show that their actions against the McCarthys were reasonable or that the sixty-six-person limit was reasonable.</p>

<p id="c5e39736-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Familial versus marital status.</b> The FHA prohibits discrimination based on familial status, which does not cover <b>marital status</b>. <i>See White v. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</i>, 475 F.3d 898, 906 (7th Cir. 2007). However, a number of state and local antidiscrimination statutes do explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of marital status. In <i>McCready v. Hoffius</i>, 586 N.W.2d 723 (Mich. 1998), defendants were found to have violated the Michigan <i>Civil Rights Act</i>, Mich. Comp. Laws §37.2502(1), by refusing to rent to an unmarried couple. The court interpreted the statutory phrase “marital status” to apply to both married and unmarried individuals and rejected the argument that the defendant landlords were discriminating based on the conduct of unmarried cohabitation. The landlords’ objection was primarily that their refusal to rent was constitutionally protected “free exercise” of religion. The court initially rejected this religious defense under the first amendment and the Michigan constitution, finding the statute validly to apply as a neutral law of general applicability with no religious motivation. The court later vacated the decision and remanded the case to determine whether the statute violated the landlords’ free exercise rights by requiring them to rent to a cohabiting unmarried couple, 593 N.W.2d 545 (Mich. <span title="1063" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1063">p. 1063</span>1999). Do you agree with the court’s initial approach or does a neutral statute that requires landlords to rent in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs unconstitutionally infringe on the free exercise of religion?</p>

<p id="c5e39739-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> A landlord refused to rent to a childless married couple when they refused to sign a document stating that they would not have children while living in the apartment and would move if the wife became pregnant. <i>Wasserman v. Three Seasons Association No. 1, Inc.</i>, 998 F. Supp. 1445 (S.D. Fla. 1998). They sued the landlord under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, claiming discrimination because of familial status. The landlord contended that the couple is not covered by 42 U.S.C. §3602(k) because they were not yet living with a child, and the woman was not pregnant. The prospective tenants contended, however, that they were “aggrieved persons” entitled to bring a lawsuit. The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> defines “aggrieved person” to include “any person who — (1) claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice; or (2) believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.” §3602(i). Judge James Lawrence King ruled in favor of the landlord, ruling that plaintiffs were not “aggrieved persons” within the meaning of the FHA because their claimed injury did not bear a sufficient nexus to actual discrimination against members of a protected class. What is the plaintiffs’ argument that the landlord did violate the FHA? What is the defendant’s response? How should the court have ruled?</p>
<p id="c5e3973a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> A lesbian couple applies for a foster parents license. Before they are licensed by the state, they notify their landlord of their intention to act as foster parents. The landlord objects and sues to evict them. The tenants argue that they are protected by the “familial status” provisions of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> because, as foster parents, they would be the “designee” of the children’s legal guardian (the state agency in charge of the child). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §3602(k)(2). The landlord contends that they are not protected by the statute since they have not yet been designated as foster parents and are not yet living with a foster child. Moreover, the landlord points to the qualification in the definition of “familial status” in §3602(k), which states that “[t]he protections against discrimination on the basis of familial status shall apply to any person who is pregnant or is in the process of securing legal custody of any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years.” The landlord notes that prospective foster parents are not “pregnant”; moreover, they are not in the process of “securing legal custody” since the state is the legal guardian of foster children and foster parents are mere “designees” of the state. Are prospective foster parents protected by the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>? For one view, see<i> Gorski v. Troy</i>, 929 F.2d 1183 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding that they are protected by the FHA).</p>

The tenant argued that the lease term discriminated against her on the basis of marital status. The court found that the man was not a member of the tenant’s “immediate family” and that it would not constitute marital status discrimination to enforce the covenant. Do you agree?</p>

<p id="c5e3be54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ann Hacklander-Ready and Maureen Rowe appeal from a decision affirming the Madison Equal Opportunity Commission’s (MEOC) Decision and Order which found that they refused to rent housing to Carol Sprague as their housemate because of her sexual orientation, in violation of §3.23(4)(a) of the <i>Madison General Ordinances</i> (MGO).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B7E_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10B7E_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span> We conclude that the trial court correctly found that §3.23, MGO, unambiguously applied to housemates at the time this action arose.</p>
<p id="c5e3be56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At all times relevant to this action Hacklander-Ready leased a four-bedroom house. She had the owner’s permission to allow others to live with her and share in the payment of rent. In the fall of 1988, Maureen Rowe began living with Hacklander-Ready and paying rent. In April 1989 they advertised for housemates to replace two women who were moving out. They chose Sprague from among numerous applicants. They knew her sexual orientation when they extended their offer to her. Sprague accepted their offer and made a rent deposit on May 4, 1989. However, the following day Hacklander-Ready informed Sprague that they were withdrawing their offer because they were not comfortable living with a person of her sexual orientation.</p>
<p id="c5e3be57-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sprague filed a complaint with MEOC alleging that appellants discriminated against her on the basis of sexual orientation, contrary to §3.23(4)(a), MGO.</p>

<p id="c5e3be5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sprague claims that §3.23, MGO, was intended to apply to housemate arrangements.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BB6_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10BB6_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> Section 3.23(4), MGO, unambiguously prohibits any person having right of rental to refuse to rent to any person because of the person’s sexual orientation. Hacklander-Ready concedes that she held the lease to the house and that she had the right to rent the property to others. Further, she and Rowe admit that the sole reason they withdrew their offer was Sprague’s sexual orientation. Finally, the room that appellants sought to rent falls within the definition of housing under §3.23(2)(b), MGO, as a part of a building intended as a place of habitation for one or more human beings.</p>
<p id="c5e3be60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While appellants correctly argue that a statute is ambiguous if it may be construed in different ways by reasonably well-informed persons, we fail to see any reasonable interpretation that would make §3.23, MGO, inapplicable in this case. Appellants also correctly note that a court may resort to construction if the literal meaning of a statute produces an absurd or unreasonable result. However, applying §3.23(4) to the rental of a room within a house with shared common areas is not unreasonable or absurd. Because we find that the ordinance clearly and unambiguously applies to the subleasing of housing by a person having the right of rental, our inquiry in this respect is at an end.</p>
<p id="c5e3be61-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants argue that to apply the ordinance to the lease of housing by a tenant to a housemate makes §3.24(4)(a), MGO, unconstitutional in its application. Appellants cite many cases which they argue support their constitutional challenge: <i>NAACP v. Alabama</i>, 357 U.S. 449 (1958); <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); <i>Moore v. City of East Cleveland</i>, 431 U.S. 494 (1977). However, those cases deal either with the right to privacy in the home or family or the right to engage in first amendment activity free of unwarranted governmental intrusion. Appellants gave up their unqualified right to such constitutional protection when they rented housing for profit. <span title="1066" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1066">p. 1066</span>The restrictions placed by the Madison City Council on persons who rent housing for profit are not unreasonable and do not encroach upon appellant’s constitutional protections. We therefore reject appellants’ challenge to the constitutionality of §3.24, MGO, as applied.</p>

<p id="c5e3e574-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Prohibiting housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</b> In a landmark study, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published the first national assessment of housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. The study used nearly 7,000 matched-pair testers to study the experience of same-sex couples searching on-line for rental housing in 50 randomly selected housing markets across the country. The study concluded that “[s]ame-sex couples are significantly less likely than heterosexual couples to get favorable responses to e-mail inquiries about electronically advertised rental housing,” and that “heterosexual couples were favored over gay male couples in 15.9 percent of tests and over lesbian couples in 15.6 percent of tests.” M. Davis &amp; Co., et al., U.S. Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., <i>An Estimate of Housing Discrimination Against Same-Sex Couples</i> vii (2013).</p>
<p id="c5e3e575-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> does not address sexual orientation, but at least 20 states have passed statutes that specifically or by judicial interpretation prohibit housing discrimination on that basis. For example, the <i>Wisconsin Equal Rights Law</i>, Wis. Stat. §106.50(1), provides that “all persons shall have an equal opportunity for housing regardless of . . . sexual orientation.” Sexual orientation is defined as “having a preference for heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, having a history of such a preference or being identified with such a preference.” Wis. Stat. §111.32(13m). The statute provides that it is unlawful to discriminate “[b]y refusing to sell [or] rent . . . housing,” §106.50(2)(a), and “[by] engaging in the harassment of a tenant,” §106.50(2)(f).</p>
<p id="c5e3e576-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other jurisdictions that prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation include California, Cal. Civ. Code §51, Cal. Govt. Code §12955; Colorado, Colo. Rev. Stat. §24-34-502; Connecticut, Conn. Gen. Stat. §§46a-81a &amp; 46a-81e; the District of Columbia, D.C. Code §§2-1402.21; Hawai`i, Haw.

<p id="c5e3e577-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More than 200 cities also have passed local ordinances prohibiting discrimination in the real estate market based on sexual orientation or gender identity. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Boston Code tit. 12, ch. 40; Chicago Mun.

Housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in federal housing programs.</b> HUD has issued a rule, <i>Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity</i>, 77 Fed. Reg. 5662 (Feb. 3, 2012), “to ensure that its core programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.” <i>Id.</i> Given evidence “that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families are being arbitrarily excluded from housing opportunities,” <i>id.</i>, the rule requires that eligibility determinations for a variety of HUD-assisted housing be made without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status, generally prohibits inquiries by HUD-funded providers into these issues when making housing available, and broadens the definition of family in a number of programs.</p>
<p id="c5e3e579-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the agency’s first enforcement action under the new rule, Bank of America settled a claim brought by a lesbian couple who were denied a mortgage because they were not married. Bank of America agreed to pay a fine of $7,500 and update its fair lending training. <i>See</i> HUD Announces Agreement with Bank of America to Settle LGBT Discrimination Claim (Press Release Jan. 2, 2013). In 2012, HUD insured roughly 15 percent of all single-family home-purchase loans, see FHA Single Family Activity in the Home-Purchase Market Through July 2012, <i>available at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/ HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/fhamktsh/fhamkt</i>, which means that the new rule will reach both traditional housing subsidy programs as well as a significant portion of general single-family home purchases.</p>

Housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a roommate.</b> The <i>Sprague</i> court found that the ordinance unambiguously applied to choices of roommates. Do you agree? Does the Ninth Circuit’s decision in <i>Roommate.com</i> (<i>see</i> §1.3, above) suggest arguments on the other side?</p>
<p id="c5e3e57b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a cooperative corporation.</b> In <i>170 West 85 Street HDFC v. Jones</i>, 673 N.Y.S.2d 830 (Civ. Ct. 1998), the court held that a cooperative corporation may have engaged in unlawful discrimination because of sexual orientation when it refused to allow Vance Jones, the gay life partner of Richard Watts, an owner of a cooperative apartment who had died of AIDS, to purchase the unit and remain living there. The proprietary lease provided that the corporation could not “unreasonably withhold consent to assignment of the lease and a transfer of the Shares to a financially responsible member of the Shareholder’s <i>family</i> (other than the Shareholder’s spouse, as to whom no consent is required) who shall have accepted all the terms and conditions of this lease.” <i>Id.</i> at 834 (emphasis in original). Both a New York City ordinance and the lease itself prohibited the corporation from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Citing an earlier rent control case that defined a gay life partner to be a “family” member for the purpose of succeeding to rights in a rent-controlled apartment, <i>Braschi v. Stahl Associates</i>, 543 N.E.2d 49 (N.Y. 1989), the court noted that Jones fit within a “more comprehensive definition of family member.” 673 N.Y.S.2d at 834. This would thus negate the corporation’s assertion that Jones was “a licensee whose license had expired, thereby vitiating <span title="1068" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1068">p. 1068</span>any independent non-discriminatory grounds which [it] could have asserted to obtain possession of the subject apartment.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5e3e57c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Damages.</b> In <i>Application of 119-121 East 97th Street Corp. v. New York City Commission on Human Rights</i>, 642 N.Y.S.2d 638 (App. Div. 1996), the court upheld a damages award of $100,000 for mental anguish and imposed a civil penalty of $25,000 against landlords who had engaged in highly abusive conduct toward a gay tenant with AIDS. The defendants had burglarized the tenant’s apartment, disabled his door locks, turned off his electricity, refused to accept his timely rent checks, refused to renew his lease, and commenced eviction proceedings against him. They had also verbally and physically accosted him in public, calling him a “faggot punk,” “male whore,” and “sicko.” They knew he had AIDS and told him they hoped he died. They left threatening messages on his answering machine, distributed a notice to tenants in his building informing them of his Human Rights complaint and HIV status, and warned the tenants not to cooperate with him. The court upheld the damages award on the ground that the abuse was both “horrendous” and malicious, <i>id.</i> at 644:</p>

The award herein will not only compensate complainant for the mental distress he suffered but will also serve as a deterrent to others who might emulate petitioners’ actions. An agenda of spite, malice and bias, acted upon over an extended period of time, resulting in the severe emotional and mental abuse of a tenant, seriously ill with AIDS, will not be met with half-hearted sanctions or “slaps on the wrist,” and we concur in the award for mental anguish.</p>

<p id="c5e40ca1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. <i>Background.</i> [T]he AHVP subsidy program for temporary housing was established following the abolition of rent control in the Commonwealth by popular initiative. <i>See</i> 1995 Mass. Acts ch. 179, §16. The statute called on the Executive Office of Communities and Development, now the Department of Housing and Community Development (department), to “establish and administer a <i>transitional</i> rental assistance program” for “eligible and qualified handicapped persons of low income,” and to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the program (emphasis added). <i>Id.</i> The statute specifies that program participants pay a monthly rent on a rental unit limited to between twenty-five and thirty per cent of their income, with the department paying the remainder of the costs of the unit. Consistent with the transitional nature of the subsidy, the statute also provides that “all participants in the program shall be <i>required,</i> as a condition of their participation to accept suitable permanent affordable housing in accordance with regulations established by [the department] once such housing becomes available” (emphasis added). <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5e40ca2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Pursuant to the enabling statute, the department created the AHVP, limiting eligibility to nonelderly, low income, handicapped persons. <i>See</i> 760 Code Mass. Regs. §53.03. Among the requirements of program participation is that, “[w]hen a Participant chooses or is required to move, the Participant shall give a calendar month’s written notice to the [local agency administering the program] and to the Owner or Owner’s Agent.” 760 Code Mass. Regs. §53.07.</p>
<p id="c5e433b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To administer the program, the department created a standard form lease to be signed by all landlords and tenants participating in the program (AHVP lease). Under the AHVP lease, tenancy is for a term of one year and is automatically extended from year to year unless either the landlord or the tenant gives sixty days’ notice of election not to renew the lease. The AHVP lease does not allow either the landlord or the tenant to terminate the lease early, except for certain enumerated reasons that constitute “good cause.” In those cases, a landlord may terminate the lease on thirty days’ notice, and a tenant on one month’s notice. To further implement the transitional program, the department created an AHVP voucher, which every participant in the program must sign. The voucher requires participants to “[a]ttempt to locate other suitable housing for which [the] AHVP subsidy is not necessary.” The voucher and standard form lease each specify that the AHVP participant must give one calendar month’s notice to both the landlord and the housing authority if suitable permanent housing is found.</p>
<p id="c5e433b4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">DiLiddo, who was disabled after an automobile accident in 1994, was issued an AHVP voucher by the Cambridge Housing Authority in April, 1998. In late May, 1998, <span title="1071" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1071">p. 1071</span>DiLiddo viewed an apartment located at 2 Belvedere Place, in Cambridge. [After expressing interest in the apartment and informing the landlord’s agent, Oxford Street Realty, Inc. (Oxford), and its principal, Jeffrey W. Indeck, that she held an AHVP voucher, Oxford initially agreed to rent her the apartment but reneged after concluding that several of the AHVP form lease provisions were “unreasonable and excessive.” Specifically, Indeck objected to the provisions that would terminate the lease on one calendar month’s notice “when the Tenant becomes a participant in another housing subsidy program, or when the Tenant secures Suitable Permanent Housing, as defined” in 760 Code Mass. Regs. §53.02. Indeck testified at his deposition that he believed that these provisions placed an “unreasonable” burden on landlords.]</p>
<p id="c5e433b5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. <i>The “requirement” provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, §4(10).</i> The question presented is a narrow one of statutory interpretation: Is the one-month termination provision of the AHVP lease a “requirement” of the AHVP, and, if so, is it a requirement that a landlord may reject for purported financial reasons without running afoul of the housing antidiscrimination law?</p>
<p id="c5e433b6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relevant section of Gen. Laws ch. 151B makes it unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against recipients of rental assistance or housing subsidies “because of any requirement” of the “housing subsidy program.” Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, §4(10). The language is unambiguous. By its plain terms, a “requirement” is “[s]omething that is required; a necessity.” <i>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</i> 1533 (3d ed. 1992). [D]efendants suggest that the department lacked the authority to require that a landlord use the AHVP lease because neither the statute nor the regulations mandate any particular form of lease. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, §4(10), does not limit the scope of the term “requirement” to a statutory provision or regulation, and their argument misconstrues the legitimate reach of the department’s authority.</p>
<p id="c5e433b7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Legislature granted the department broad authority to “establish and administer” a transitional housing subsidy program. 1995 Mass. Acts ch. 179, §16. The development of a standard form AHVP lease containing clauses designed to implement the program’s transitional character is well within the bounds of the department’s mandate from the Legislature.</p>
<p id="c5e433b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants argue that, even if the termination provisions of the AHVP lease are “requirements” of the AHVP for purposes of our antidiscrimination law, they may refuse to accept those requirements so long as they had a “legitimate, non-discriminatory reason” for doing [so]. Put another way, they contend that, because they rejected the AHVP based on a good faith attempt to serve the landlord’s economic interests and not from any discriminatory “animus,” they may not be held liable for housing discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, §4(10). But it is Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, itself, not the defendants’ conception of what should or should not constitute discrimination, that delineates what is “legitimate” and “nondiscriminatory” under the statute. The statute contains no language requiring a showing of “animus.”</p>
<p id="c5e433b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants urge that we read into the statute an exception that would allow landlords to reject a participant in any housing subsidy program whose requirements could cause the landlord “substantial economic harm.” We may not rewrite the <span title="1072" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1072">p. 1072</span>statute’s clear terms. The General Court was aware that [the statute] imposed financial burdens on landlords, and it made various policy judgments striking the balance between those burdens and the public interest in making housing accessible and affordable for disabled persons. Absent a challenge to the reach of the statute itself, or a challenge to the scope of the implementing regulations, we may not strike a different balance.</p>
<p id="c5e433ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The AHVP housing subsidy program affects relatively few individuals. But if landlords or their agents are permitted to reject for their own reasons the “requirements” of the AHVP program, that could have, as the Commonwealth argues, “a potentially widespread and profound impact on the ability of residents in the Commonwealth to utilize any rental assistance voucher to locate and then actually obtain affordable housing.” The General Court has spoken unambiguously. The defendants have proffered no basis for us to ignore its mandate.</p>

Many disparate impact cases involve land use regulations and related laws; the standards that govern such claims are similar to those governing private-party practices, but can have some differences when it comes to evaluating whether a challenged practice or policy is justified.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D91_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D91_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span></p>

(ICP), a nonprofit housing assistance corporation, argued that the point system the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs had used to allocate low-income housing tax credits perpetuated segregation by disproportionately placing such housing in predominantly minority communities. The District Court found that ICP had established a prima facie case of disparate impact, citing both the fact that “from 1999-2008, [the Department] approved tax credits for 49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only approved 37.4% of proposed non-elderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas,” and that “92.29% of [low-income housing tax credit] units in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts with less than 50% Caucasian residents.” Id. at 2514 (quoting 749 F. Supp. 2d 486, 499 (N.D. Tex. 2010)). The District Court then found that, assuming the Department’s interests in the point system were legitimate, it had failed to demonstrate that there were no less discriminatory alternatives. The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, citing a newly promulgated regulation from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 24 C.F.R. §100.500, that set a different framework for evaluating disparate impact claims.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC2_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10DC2_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span> The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the threshold question whether such claims are, in fact, cognizable.</p>
<p id="c5e45adb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By a 5-4 vote, the Court answered yes. Noting that the act makes it unlawful to “otherwise make unavailable” housing because of race or other characteristic, 42 U.S.C. §3604(a), the Court cited cases that had upheld disparate impact claims in employment discrimination under §703(a) of Title VII and §4(a) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 with similar language focused on the consequences of actions rather than “the mindset of actors.” 135 S. Ct. at 2518. The statutory phrase “because of race,” the Court continued, does not require a showing of intentional discrimination. The Court also noted that Congress had more than once endorsed prior lower-court case law that had interpreted the act to include a disparate impact claim. </p>
<p id="c5e45adc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court then focused on the purpose of the act — “to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s economy,” <i>id.</i> at 2521 — to bolster its statutory argument. </p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e45add-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These unlawful practices include zoning laws and other housing restrictions that function unfairly to exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without any sufficient justification. Suits targeting such practices reside at the heartland of disparate-impact liability. The availability of disparate-impact liability, furthermore, has allowed private <span title="1075" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1075">p. 1075</span>developers to vindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect their property rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbitrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring the construction of certain types of housing units. Recognition of disparate-impact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncovering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as disparate treatment. In this way disparate-impact liability may prevent segregated housing patterns that might otherwise result from covert and illicit stereotyping.</p>

<p id="c5e45adf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite this clear statutory and purposive argument, the Court held that limitations on disparate-impact claims are necessary to avoid “serious constitutional questions.” <i>Id.</i> at 2522. Such claims must focus on the “‘removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers,’ not the displacement of valid governmental policies.” <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co</i>., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971)). Thus, “housing authorities and private developers” must be given “leeway to state and explain the valid interest served by their policies [in a way that is] analogous to the business necessity standard under Title VII.” <i>Id</i>. Similarly, “a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity,” a standard the Court described as a “robust causality requirement.” <i>Id</i>. And remedial orders must be limited to eliminating the offending practice and should be race-neutral where possible. <i>Id</i>. at 2524.</p>

The four factors are (1) the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2) evidence of discriminatory intent, though not enough to satisfy the constitutional standard of <i>Washington v. Davis</i>; (3) the defendant’s interest in the challenged conduct; and (4) whether the plaintiff seeks affirmative relief or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide housing. <i>Arlington Heights II</i>, 558 F.2d at 1290.</p>
<p id="c5e48203-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One month after <i>Arlington Heights II,</i> the Third Circuit adopted a burden-shifting framework similar to that already in use in Title VII employment cases. [<i>Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo</i>, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977).] Under this approach, the plaintiff makes a <i>prima facie</i> case by showing that the defendant’s action has a discriminatory effect. <i>Id.</i> The defendant can rebut this by showing a justification which “serve[s], in <span title="1077" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1077">p. 1077</span>theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide interest” and by showing that “no alternative course of action could be adopted that would enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory impact.” <i>Id.</i> at 149.</p>
<p id="c5e48204-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A decade later, the <i>Huntington</i> court sought to merge <i>Rizzo</i> and <i>Arlington Heights II</i>. Under the <i>Huntington</i> framework, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that the “challenged practice of the defendant actually or predictably results in racial discrimination.” [<i>Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington</i>, 844 F.2d 926, 934 (2d Cir. 1988).] The defendant can rebut this case by showing that its “actions furthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.” The court then balances the four <i>Arlington Heights II</i> factors to determine whether to grant relief. <i>Id.</i> at 936.</p>
<p id="c5e48205-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These competing approaches spawned a variety of others. One source of disagreement was the role, if any, of the <i>Arlington Heights II</i> factors. A few courts have used the factors as part of the prima facie case. This approach has been widely rejected as making the plaintiff’s case too difficult. Other courts applied the <i>Arlington Heights II</i> factors only in cases involving public defendants. Still others discarded the second <i>Arlington Heights II</i> factor — proof of discriminatory intent — and weighed the remaining three, reasoning that intent was relevant only in disparate treatment cases. More recently, most federal circuits have abandoned the <i>Arlington Heights II</i> factors altogether. Yet, at least one circuit and several district courts have continued to balance.</p>
<p id="c5e48206-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Huntington</i>’s burden-shifting framework has also morphed. Several courts changed <i>Huntington</i>’s two burdens into three. This test still requires plaintiffs to show a discriminatory effect, but rebutting defendants need to provide only a bona fide, nondiscriminatory justification. Once the defendant offers an appropriate justification, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show an alternative that would serve the defendant’s interest with less discriminatory effect. Courts adopting this approach explain that requiring the plaintiff to propose an alternative gives the plaintiff the ultimate burden of proving a violation and has the advantage that “neither party is saddled with having to prove a negative (the nonexistence of bona fide reasons or the absence of less discriminatory alternatives).” [<i>Hispanics United v. Village of Addison</i>, 988 F. Supp. 1130, 1162 (N.D. Ill. 1997).]</p>
<p id="c5e48207-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, a much smaller number of federal courts have applied a variant of the disparate treatment test from <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</i>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), a leading employment discrimination case, to resolve disparate impact FHA claims. Under this approach, the plaintiff must prove a discriminatory effect, which the defendant may rebut by offering a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its rule. Instead of the plaintiff then showing a less discriminatory alternative, the plaintiff shows the defendant’s offered reason is a pretext.</p>

In establishing a disproportionate effect, plaintiffs can rely on local statistics, but national statistics may be deemed relevant as well in unusual cases. Statistics focus on the relative <i>percentages</i> of people in each group affected by the policy rather than their absolute numbers. <i>See Graoch Associates #33, L.P. v.

The requirement that an entity’s interest be substantial is analogous to the Title VII requirement that an employer’s interest in an employment practice with a disparate impact be job related. [T]he more general standard of substantiality [recognizes that] there is no single objective, such as job-relatedness, against which every practice covered by the Fair Housing Act could be measured. The determination of whether goals, objectives, and activities are of substantial interest to a respondent or defendant such that they can justify actions with a discriminatory effect requires a case-specific, fact-based inquiry.

The district court concluded that Plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of disparate impact, finding that Garden City’s rejection of R-M zoning in favor of R-T zoning had a significant disparate impact on minorities because it “largely eliminated the potential for the type of housing that minorities were disproportionately likely to need — namely, affordable rental units.” But the district court also found that R-T zoning advanced certain legitimate, bona fide governmental interests, noting that R-T zoning (1) would have reduced traffic and (2) would have provided for the construction of townhouses.

Because Congress afforded HUD the authority to implement the FHA, under <i>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</i>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), this Court must defer to the agency’s reasonable interpretation unless “the intent of Congress is clear.” The Supreme Court implicitly adopted HUD’s approach.</p>

<p id="c5e4f75d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Applying disparate impact theory to public actors.</b> In dealing with public defendants, courts are often reluctant to second guess policy justifications. Indeed, once a governmental entity provides a justification for its policy, some courts have held that this ends the matter. The First Circuit decision in <i>Langlois v. Abington Housing Authority</i>, 207 F.3d 43 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, holds that if the defendant has a “valid justification” for its policy that amounts to a “legitimate and substantial goal,” then the defendant should prevail. As Judge Boudin explained, “we do not think that the courts’ job is to ‘balance’ objectives, with individual judges deciding which seem to them more worthy.” <i>Id.</i> at 50-51. Most courts have traditionally taken the view, expressed by the Second Circuit in <i>Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington</i>, 844 F.2d 926, 937 (2d Cir.), <i>aff’d per curiam</i>, 488 U.S. 15 (1988), that courts must balance the justification for the policy against the disparate impact, adding another step to the analysis. Once the plaintiff has shown a disproportionate effect or an effect that perpetuates segregation, and the defendant has provided a valid justification for its policy, courts must weigh the adverse impact against the defendant’s justification. HUD’s discriminatory effects regulation now governs at the final stage of the analysis, but leaves much room in application, as <i>MHANY</i> illustrates. </p>
<p id="c5e4f75e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Perpetuation of segregation as a basis for liability.</b> Early circuit court <i>Fair Housing Act cases</i> involving land use restrictions or decisions that impeded projects that would have provided integrated housing in predominantly white areas held that the act could be violated if municipal defendants’ actions had the effect of “perpetuating segregation.” <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Huntington Branch, NAACP, supra</i>; <i>Resident Advisory Board v.

Perpetuation of segregation cases are much less common than disparate impact cases, but courts continue to distinguish these two as independent ways to establish discriminatory effects. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Mount Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc. v.

The town refused to rezone and the developer sued, claiming that the failure to rezone had a discriminatory effect on African Americans because they were less likely than white persons to be able to afford single-family homes in the town and that this effect violated the equal protection clause. Only 27 of the town’s 64,000 residents were African American. Applying its ruling in <i>Washington v. Davis</i>, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment was violated only if a state actor engaged in intentional or purposeful discrimination and that racially disproportionate impacts of neutral governmental policies did not violate the state’s obligation to provide equal protection of the laws. Plaintiff had to prove that a discriminatory purpose was a “motivating factor” in the governmental decision in order to establish a constitutional violation. <i>Accord, City of Cuyahoga Falls v.

<p id="c5e4f762-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1.</b> A suburban municipality just outside a major city has a zoning law that limits construction to single-family homes on one-acre lots with a small commercial district for shops and restaurants. Multi-family housing, whether in townhouses or apartment buildings, is prohibited throughout the town. As discussed in Chapter 7, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held in <i>Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel</i>, 336 A.2d 713 (N.J. 1975), that the state constitution required municipalities to allow affordable housing to be built somewhere in the community of sufficient quantity to meet the town’s “fair share” of the regional need for housing for low- and moderate-income families. Imagine you are in a state that has not adopted <i>Mount Laurel</i> and has no state statute that parallels the doctrine. A housing developer purchases land in the town, obtains subsidies from government and nonprofit sources, and seeks a variance or rezoning to enable it to build affordable multi-family housing. When the town denies the variance and refuses to rezone the land, the developer sues the town claiming that the zoning law violates the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> because excluding multi-family housing effectively excludes all affordable housing and this has a disparate impact on several groups protected by the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> that have a high percentage of families with low or moderate incomes, including race, sex, familial status, and handicap. Does the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> require every state to adopt some version of the <i>Mount Laurel</i> doctrine? What are the best arguments on either side?</p>
<p id="c5e4f763-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> After Hurricane Katrina, St. Bernard Parish, located just outside New Orleans, was devastated by the flood. When a developer proposed to build four mixed-income rental apartment complexes designed to provide affordable housing, city officials at first reacted favorably, but when public opposition developed after a local editorial suggested that crime would increase if the development went forward and that the community would turn into a “ghetto with drugs, crime, vandalism, and violence,” the city council reacted by passing ordinances prohibiting the construction of multi-family housing and the rental of single-family homes to anyone other than a blood <span title="1084" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1084">p. 1084</span>relative of the owner without a special permit. In litigation challenging these ordinances as causing a disparate impact on African Americans in violation of the FHA, Judge Helen Berrigan found that African Americans were “85% more likely to live in structures with more than five units than Caucasian households.” She further found that the moratorium reduced the supply of rental properties, and while only 25 percent of white families lived in rental housing with more than five units, more than 50 percent of African Americans did so. Finally, she found that African Americans were more likely than whites to come within the income guidelines making them eligible for affordable housing. The city defended the suit by citing a number of nondiscriminatory reasons for the ordinances, each of which was found by the judge to be unsupported by the evidence. <i>Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v.

<p id="c5e51e7f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Brenda Janush (“plaintiff”) suffers from a severe mental health disability. Plaintiff’s treating psychiatrist, Dr. David Kilgore, has testified that plaintiff’s pets, two birds and two cats, lessen the effects of this disability by providing her with companionship and are necessary to her mental health.</p>
<p id="c5e51e80-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 6, 1999, plaintiff signed a rental agreement for an apartment in Pensione Esperanza, a low-income apartment building run by [Charities Housing Development Corp. (CHD)], a non-profit corporation affiliated with Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County. Paragraph 23 of the rental agreement contains a “no pets” clause. Plaintiff did not alert CHD to the presence of her animals prior to moving into the apartment on January 2, 2000. On January 10, 2000, a maintenance worker discovered plaintiff’s animals in the apartment. Discussions ensued between plaintiff and defendants over whether plaintiff would be allowed to keep the animals in the apartment and under what conditions. The parties disagree as to what offers and counter-offers were made. Essentially, plaintiff alleges that defendants harassed her and refused to offer any reasonable accommodation. Defendants allege that they were willing to accommodate plaintiff’s requests, at least in part, but plaintiff refused to provide <span title="1085" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1085">p. 1085</span>requested documentation such as proof that the animals had been vaccinated. On February 7, 2000, defendants filed eviction proceedings against plaintiff. On March 26, 2000, plaintiff moved out of Pensione Esperanza.</p>
<p id="c5e51e81-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff filed suit on March 10, 2000, principally alleging discrimination based on defendants’ refusal to reasonably accommodate plaintiff’s disability as required by the Fair Housing Act, as well as other federal and state law causes of action. Defendants now move to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>
<p id="c5e51e82-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To establish a prima facie case of housing discrimination based on an alleged “refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling[,]” 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(3), a plaintiff must show that: (1) she suffers from a handicap as defined in 42 U.S.C. §3602(h); (2) defendant knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it; (3) accommodation of the handicap “may be necessary” to afford plaintiff an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling; and (4) defendants refused to make such accommodation.</p>
<p id="c5e51e83-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants argue that the core allegation in each of plaintiff’s claims is that she was entitled to keep her animals as a reasonable accommodation. Notwithstanding the brevity of defendants’ moving papers (three pages of legal argument) and the frankness of their position (“[t]his issue is important to defendants because, given the number of low-income residents they serve, there is a very real risk that the no-pet policy at Pensione Esperanza will be overrun with demands for ‘accommodations’ by persons who claim to need the companionship of a variety of animals.”), defendants have failed to point out which elements of which causes of actions plaintiff has failed to adequately plead. Nor have defendants cited a single case in their moving papers.</p>
<p id="c5e51e84-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal basis for defendants’ motion appears to be the assertion that California’s definition of a “service dog” should be read into the federal statute to create a bright-line rule that accommodation of animals other than service dogs is per se unreasonable. <i>See</i> Cal. Civ. Code. §54.1(b)(6)(C)(iii). Although the federal regulations specifically refer to accommodation of seeing-eye dogs, there is no indication that accommodation of other animals is per se unreasonable under the statute. In fact, the federal regulations provide a broad definition of service animals. “Service animal means any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. . . .” 28 C.F.R. §36.104. Even if plaintiff’s animals do not qualify as service animals, defendants have not established that there is no duty to reasonably accommodate non-service animals. As plaintiff has adequately plead that she is handicapped, that defendants knew of her handicap, that accommodation of the handicap may be necessary and that defendants refused to make such accommodation, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.</p>
<p id="c5e51e85-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal law prohibits the failure to reasonably accommodate disabled persons in residential housing. “It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.” 24 C.F.R. §100.204(a). Whether a particular accommodation is reasonable under the circumstances is the <span title="1086" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1086">p. 1086</span>type of fact-intensive, case-specific determination that will infrequently be appropriate for resolution on summary judgment. Whether it is a reasonable accommodation for this landlord to allow this disabled tenant to keep animals in an apartment where pets are not generally permitted strikes the court as inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment based on the showing made to date.</p>
<p id="c5e51e86-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, plaintiff has not yet had the opportunity to conduct any discovery. Specifically, plaintiff has not been able to discover the likely costs or administrative burdens that would be imposed on the defendants if they were to accommodate her. Accordingly, plaintiff’s request to defer resolution of summary judgment until such time as she has had an opportunity to conduct adequate discovery is well taken. Without some evidence as to the burden plaintiff’s requested accommodation will impose on defendants, the court is unable to balance that burden against the benefit to plaintiff of the requested accommodation and the court is accordingly unable to make a determination that plaintiff’s request is necessarily unreasonable.</p>
<p id="c5e51e87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court is not unsympathetic to defendants’ concerns regarding a flood of accommodation requests. However, the law imposes on defendants the obligation to consider each request individually and to grant requests that are reasonable. Defendants have no obligation to grant unreasonable requests. The court respects defendants’ charitable mission, and suspects that the burden of individually considering accommodation requests from disabled tenants and granting reasonable requests will not prevent defendants from fulfilling that mission. Unless a tenant has a disability, the reasonable accommodation issue does not arise.</p>

Reasonable accommodations and modifications for persons with disabilities.</b> It is clearly a violation of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> to refuse to rent or sell housing to an individual because of that individual’s disability. A significant number of fair housing cases, however, turn on the statute’s provisions for reasonable accommodations and reasonable modifications.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110EB_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N110EB_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span> Under §3604(f)(3)(B), the provision at issue in <i>Janush</i>, it is unlawful to refuse “to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford” individuals with disabilities “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” Under §3604(f)(3)(A), by contrast, it is unlawful to refuse “to permit, at the expense of the [disabled] person, reasonable modifications of existing premises” if such modifications may be necessary for full enjoyment of the premises, subject to a landlord’s right to require restoration of the interior. Courts have noted that the obligation to <i>permit</i> tenants to pay for their own reasonable modifications can cover different activities, most notably new construction or rebuilding of facilities, than the obligation on landlords to <i>make</i> <span title="1087" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1087">p. 1087</span>reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Reyes v. Fairfield Properties</i>, 661 F. Supp. 2d 249, 258-262 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (not a failure to make a reasonable accommodation even though the landlord refused to pay to install a ramp and widen doors for a disabled child in a wheelchair).</p>
<p id="c5e51e8c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the First Circuit recently noted, refusal to make a reasonable accommodation for an individual with a disability is a third theory of liability under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, in addition to disparate treatment and disparate impact. <i>Astralis Condominium Association v. Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development</i>, 620 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir. 2010). For reasonable accommodation claims, courts generally require plaintiffs to demonstrate that they are disabled; that the party from whom they requested an accommodation knew, or reasonably should have known, of the disability; that a reasonable accommodation that may be necessary to afford the plaintiff an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the housing was requested; and that the reasonable accommodation was refused. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> id.</i></p>
<p id="c5e51e8d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">HUD’s FHA regulations contain several examples of the landlord’s obligations to permit reasonable modifications, 24 C.F.R. §100.203(c):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e51e8e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Example (1): A tenant with a handicap asks his or her landlord for permission to install grab bars in the bathroom at his or her own expense. It is necessary to reinforce the walls with blocking between studs in order to affix the grab bars. It is unlawful for the landlord to refuse to permit the tenant, at the tenant’s own expense, from making the modifications necessary to add the grab bars. However, the landlord may condition permission for the modification on the tenant agreeing to restore the bathroom to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted. It would be reasonable for the landlord to require the tenant to remove the grab bars at the end of the tenancy. The landlord may also reasonably require that the wall to which the grab bars are to be attached be repaired and restored to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. However, it would be unreasonable for the landlord to require the tenant to remove the blocking, since the reinforced walls will not interfere in any way with the landlord’s or the next tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises and may be needed by some future tenant.</p>
<p id="c5e51e8f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Example (2): An applicant for rental housing has a child who uses a wheelchair. The bathroom door in the dwelling unit is too narrow to permit the wheelchair to pass. The applicant asks the landlord for permission to widen the doorway at the applicant’s own expense. It is unlawful for the landlord to refuse to permit the applicant to make the modification. Further, the landlord may not, in usual circumstances, condition permission for the modification on the applicant paying for the doorway to be narrowed at the end of the lease because a wider doorway will not interfere with the landlord’s or the next tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5e51e90-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The regulation pertinent to the landlord’s duty to make reasonable accommodations in rules and practices, 24 C.F.R. §100.204, contains the following examples:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e51e91-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Example (1): A blind applicant for rental housing wants to live in a dwelling unit with a seeing eye dog. The building has a “no pets” policy. It is a violation of §100.204 for the owner or manager of the apartment complex to refuse to permit the applicant to live in the apartment with a seeing eye dog because, without the seeing eye dog, the blind person will not have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.</p>
<p id="c5e544a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1088" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1088">p. 1088</span>Example (2): Progress Gardens is a 300 unit apartment complex with 450 parking spaces which are available to tenants and guests of Progress Gardens on a “first come first served” basis. John applies for housing in Progress Gardens. John is mobility impaired and is unable to walk more than a short distance and therefore requests that a parking space near his unit be reserved for him so he will not have to walk very far to get to his apartment. It is a violation of §100.204 for the owner or manager of Progress Gardens to refuse to make this accommodation. Without a reserved space, John might be unable to live in Progress Gardens at all or, when he has to park in a space far from his unit, might have great difficulty getting from his car to his apartment unit. The accommodation therefore is necessary to afford John an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The accommodation is reasonable because it is feasible and practical under the circumstances.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5e544a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In recent years, a number of cases have involved reasonable accommodations for assistance animals in residences that have no-pet policies. Courts have taken varying approaches to resolving these cases. Some, like <i>Janush</i>, have taken a broad view of the importance of such animals to individuals with disabilities, even when the animals might not qualify as “service animals” such as a seeing-eye dog.</p>
<p id="c5e544a4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of courts have been more skeptical, however, relying on the argument that to be a reasonable accommodation, an animal must meet the definition of a “service animal” provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), namely that the animal be “individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability.” 28 C.F.R. §36.104. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Inle v. Association of Apartment Owners of 2987 Kalakaua</i>, 304 F. Supp. 2d 1245 (D. Haw. 2003), <i>aff’d on other grounds</i>, 453 F.3d 1175 (9th Cir. 2006) (assertion by resident disabled by depression, anxiety, and dizziness, that his dog was trained to provide emotional support was insufficient to make the dog a “service animal” for purposes of reasonable accommodation claim); <i>see also Meadowland Apartments v. Schumacher</i>, 813 N.W.2d 618 (S.D. 2012) (not a violation of the FHA for landlord to evict a mentally disabled tenant for, among other things, keeping a dog without notifying landlord, even though tenant had left a doctor’s note about the dog with her rent). HUD has taken the position that the ADA’s narrow definition of “service animal” does not control the question whether keeping a given animal might be a reasonable accommodation for purposes of the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. <i>See</i> Memorandum from Sara K. Pratt, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Programs, to FHEO Regional Directors and Regional Counsel, <i>New ADA Regulations and Assistance Animals as Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</i> (Feb. 17, 2011).</p>

The <i>Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</i> </b>In addition to the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, the <i>Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973</i> prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded programs. A provision in the act, 29 U.S.C. §794, commonly referred to as Section 504 because of the statute’s original bill numbering, provides in relevant part that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e544a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be <span title="1089" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1089">p. 1089</span>subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</p>

<p id="c5e544a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although disagreements and uncertainties may arise about what constitutes “federal financial assistance,” the statute clearly applies to any direct transfer payments made by the government, such as those made to public housing programs and for individual tenant vouchers for use in paying for private housing. <i>See Housing Authority of Lake Charles v. Pappion</i>, 540 So. 2d 567 (La. Ct. App. 1989) (housing vouchers); <i>Whittier Terrace Associates v. Hampshire</i>, 532 N.E.2d 712 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989) (private housing subsidized by HUD).</p>
<p id="c5e544a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases also address the issue of identifying which persons with disabilities are “otherwise qualified” for the program financed by federal funds under the <i>Federal Rehabilitation Act</i>. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Fialka-Feldman v. Oakland University Board of Trustees</i>, 678 F. Supp. 2d 576, 584 (E.D. Mich. 2009). In <i>Pappion</i>, <i>supra</i>, the court held that a paranoid schizophrenic tenant was not “otherwise qualified” to remain in a subsidized housing project because he interfered with the quiet enjoyment of other tenants by making loud noises, threatening other residents, and engaging in “bizarre” behavior. In <i>City Wide Associates v. Penfield</i>, 564 N.E.2d 1003 (Mass. 1991), however, the court found that a tenant in Section 8 housing who suffered from a mental disability manifested by her hearing voices was “otherwise qualified” despite the fact that she had responded to the auditory hallucinations by striking the walls of the apartment, causing superficial damage amounting to less than one month’s rent. The court justified its holding on the ground that the tenant had not disturbed the quiet enjoyment of neighboring tenants and had promised to obtain counseling.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11194_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11194_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">15</a></span></p>

A tenant whose daughter’s health condition requires a full-time attendant argues that the owner violated the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>’s reasonable accommodation provisions by refusing to waive the charges for her attendant. The Ninth Circuit has held that the regulation would violate §3604(f)(3)(B) if it had an “unequal impact” on persons with disabilities and resulted in an “exclusionary effect” so long as the financial impact on the landlord was not “unduly burdensome.” <i>United States v. California Mobile Home Park Management Co.</i>, 29 F.3d 1413 (9th Cir. 1994). Do you agree with this formulation of what §3604(f)(3)(B) requires?

<p id="c5e544b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Familystyle [of St. Paul, Inc.] provides rehabilitative services to mentally ill persons and operates residential group homes for them in St. Paul, Minnesota. Familystyle sought special use permits for the addition of three houses to its existing campus of group homes, intending to expand its capacity from 119 to 130 mentally ill persons. Twenty-one of Familystyle’s houses, including the three proposed additions, are clustered in a one and one-half block area. On the condition that Familystyle would work to disperse its facilities, the St. Paul City Council issued temporary permits for the three additional houses. Familystyle failed to meet the conditions of the special use permits, and the permits expired. After St. Paul denied renewal of the permits, Familystyle exchanged its license for one excluding the three additional houses.</p>
<p id="c5e544b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relying upon the provisions of the <i>Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988</i>, Familystyle challenges the city ordinance and state laws that bar the addition of these three houses to its campus.</p>
<p id="c5e56bca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Minnesota requires facilities that provide residential services for people with mental illness and retardation to be licensed. Minnesota seeks through the licensing of group homes to place the mentally ill in the least restrictive environment possible and to allow them “the benefits of normal residential surroundings.” Minn. Stat. §245A.11, <span title="1091" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1091">p. 1091</span>subd. 1. “Care, treatment, and deinstitutionalization of mentally ill adults [is] a matter of special state concern” in Minnesota. <i>Nw. Residence, Inc. v. City of Brooklyn Ctr.</i>, 352 N.W.2d 764, 772 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984).</p>
<p id="c5e56bcb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An integral part of the licensing process guarantees that residential programs are geographically situated, to the extent possible, in locations where residential services are needed, where they would be a part of the community at large, and where access to other necessary services is available. Minn. Stat. §245A.11, subd. 4. This licensing requirement reflects the goal of deinstitutionalization — a philosophy of creating a full range of community-based services and reducing the population of state institutions.</p>
<p id="c5e56bcc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill is advanced in Minnesota by requiring a new group home to be located at least a quarter mile from an existing residential program unless the local zoning authority grants a conditional use or special use permit. Minn. Stat. §245A.11, subd. 4. The St. Paul zoning code similarly requires community residential facilities for the mentally impaired to be located at least a quarter of a mile apart.</p>
<p id="c5e56bcd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Familystyle argues that the Minnesota and St. Paul dispersal requirements are invalid because they limit housing choices of the mentally handicapped and therefore conflict with the language and purpose of the 1988 Amendments to the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. We disagree. We perceive the goals of non-discrimination and deinstitutionalization to be compatible. Congress did not intend to abrogate a state’s power to determine how facilities for the mentally ill must meet licensing standards. Minnesota’s dispersal requirements address the need of providing residential services in mainstream community settings. The quarter-mile spacing requirement guarantees that residential treatment facilities will, in fact, be “in the community,” rather than in neighborhoods completely made up of group homes that re-create an institutional environment — a setting for which Familystyle argues. We cannot agree that Congress intended the <i>Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988</i> to contribute to the segregation of the mentally ill from the mainstream of our society. The challenged state laws and city ordinance do not affect or prohibit a retarded or mentally ill person from purchasing, renting, or occupying a private residence or dwelling.</p>
<p id="c5e56bce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state plays a legitimate and necessary role in licensing services for the mentally impaired. We agree with the district court that the dispersal requirement as part of the licensure process is a legitimate means to achieve the state’s goals in the process of deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill.</p>

<p id="c5e56bd1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Disparate impact and reasonable accommodation in land use regulation.</b> Courts have generally held that land use restrictions having the effect of excluding group homes for people with disabilities violate the FHA both because they impose an unjustified disparate impact — making housing “unavailable” under 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(1) — and because they fail to accord with the requirement to make reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities, as required by §3604(f)(3)(B). However, some courts have been more deferential to the policy goals asserted by local <span title="1092" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1092">p. 1092</span>governments. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Oxford House-C v. City of St. Louis,</i> 77 F.3d 249 (8th Cir. 1996) (ordinance limiting group homes to eight residents did not violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> because the city had legitimate interests in decreasing congestion, traffic, and noise in residential areas). In <i>Brandt v. Chebanse</i>, 82 F.3d 172 (7th Cir. 1996), the court held that a city did not violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> when it refused to grant a variance that would have allowed a property owner to establish a four-unit residence for persons with disabilities in an area restricted to single-family homes. According to Judge Frank Easterbrook, no disparate impact claim could be brought because the city agreed to allow the plaintiff to establish her multi-unit residence in another part of town and the city was not required, as a reasonable accommodation, to relax its restrictions on multi-family occupancy in the single-family home neighborhood, <i>id.</i> at 175:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e56bd2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The variance is not necessary to allow handicapped persons to live in Chebanse, for those capable of independent living (the only ones who could use the proposed structure) could live as easily, if somewhat more expensively, in new or remodeled single-family houses. Brandt does not argue that the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> requires municipalities to eliminate rules that increase the expense of housing for all persons equally. Is the proposed accommodation “reasonable” in the sense that it is cost-justified? Again, not on this record. The costs include an increased potential for flooding and the loss of whatever tranquility single-family zoning offers to a neighborhood with little corresponding benefit — for the proposed multi-unit building could be built as easily in the many tracts of suburbia or rural America already open to multi-family buildings. Unless the <i>Fair Housing Act</i> has turned the entire United States into a multi-family dwelling zone, Brandt must lose. It doesn’t, so she does.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5e56bd3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do you agree with this reasoning? What would the argument be on the other side? </p>
<p id="c5e56bd4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Segregation of individuals with disabilities.</b> Under HUD’s regulations implementing the <i>Rehabilitation Act</i>, recipients of federal assistance are prohibited from providing “different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with [disabilities] or to any class of individuals with [disabilities] from that provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with [disabilities] with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others.” 24 C.F.R. §8.4(b)(1)(iv). This mandate is an attempt to balance the imperatives of integration with the recognition that some services are more effective if targeted to individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p id="c5e56bd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beginning in the 1950s, a movement began to shut down state-run psychiatric facilities, which were often dehumanizing warehouses for the mentally ill. Between 1955 and 1994, the national population of severely mentally ill patients in public psychiatric hospitals was reduced from 558,239 to 71,619. E. Fuller Torrey, <i>Out of the Shadows: Confronting America’s Mental Illness Crisis</i> 8-9 (1997). This deinstitutionalization was predicated on providing individuals with disabilities the ability to live in community settings, where there is a sufficient amount of supportive housing, but that has proven to be an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p id="c5e56bd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Olmstead v. L.C.</i>, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), a case involving the public services provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§12131-12165, the Supreme <span title="1093" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1093">p. 1093</span>Court held that “[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.” <i>Id.</i> at 597. Accordingly, states must “provide community-based treatment for persons with mental disabilities” when such placement is clinically appropriate. <i>Id.</i> at 607. <i>Olmstead</i> has been called the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> of the disability rights movement, and HUD has issued guidance to recipients of federal financial assistance on how to further the goals of the decision. <i>See Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development on the Role of Housing in Accomplishing the Goals of</i> Olmstead (June 4, 2013), <i>available at</i> <a target="_blank" href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=OlmsteadGuidnc060%20413.pdf" class="epub-externalref">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=OlmsteadGuidnc060 413.pdf</a>.</p>
<p id="c5e56bd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Olmstead</i>’s integrationist vision, however, raises a number of questions. For example, can a housing provider design a facility to serve individuals with a particular type of disability, such as a group home for individuals with physical, but not mental, disabilities? Can individuals with disabilities themselves choose to exclude others with dissimilar disabilities? In <i>Beckert v. Our Lady of Angels Apartments, Inc.</i>, 192 F.3d 601 (6th Cir. 1999), the court held that it was permissible for a federally subsidized facility to provide housing to elderly physically disabled tenants to the exclusion of individuals with mental disabilities. <i>Id.</i> at 607. <i>Beckert</i> relied on the language of the statute authorizing the particular subsidy at issue, so it may be limited in its reach, but the issue the court faced has become a significant flashpoint. <i>See</i> Henry Korman, <i>Clash of the Integrationists: The Mismatch of Civil Rights Imperatives in Supportive Housing for People with Disabilities</i>, 26 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 3 (2007).</p>
<p id="c5e56bd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Spacing requirements for group homes.</b> In <i>Horizon House Developmental Services, Inc. v. Town of Upper Southampton</i>, 804 F. Supp. 683 (E.D. Pa. 1992), <i>aff’d</i>, 995 F.2d 217 (3d Cir. 1993), a case similar to <i>Familystyle</i>, the court invalidated a municipal spacing requirement for group homes. A nonprofit organization leased two single-family homes, each housing three or four people with mental disabilities. The township then enacted an ordinance that (a) prohibited group homes providing permanent care or professional supervision within 3,000 feet of one another or within 3,000 feet of any educational, religious, recreational, or institutional entity; (b) required a six-foot-high fence surrounding group homes; and (c) required a conditional use permit. The ordinance also defined “single-family homes” to exclude group homes for purposes of the zoning ordinance. The ordinance was later amended, reducing the spacing requirement from 3,000 to 1,000 feet. Judge Lowell A. Reed, Jr. held that the ordinance violated the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, rejecting the town’s claim that the ordinance was rationally tailored to promote integration of persons with mental retardation into the community. Citing <i>United States v. Starrett City Associates</i>, 840 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir. 1988),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN112BE_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N112BE_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span> Judge Reed noted that “integration is not an adequate justification” under the <i>Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988</i> for a zoning requirement that “disadvantages a class of people protected” by the act by “indefinitely limiting access of that class to housing, by setting an upper limit or cap or quota on the number of persons with handicap who may live in the Township.” 804 F. Supp. at 695. <i>Familystyle</i> justified the spacing requirement, not as <span title="1094" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1094">p. 1094</span>an effort to achieve integration, but as necessary to promote the mental health of group home residents. Is this sufficient to distinguish it from <i>Horizon House</i>? Is <i>Familystyle</i> consistent with <i>Starrett City Associates</i>? If not, which case is correctly decided?</p>
<p id="c5e56bda-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Limits on the number of unrelated persons who can live together.</b> In <i>Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc.</i>, 514 U.S. 725 (1995), a nonprofit organization, Oxford House-Edmonds, attempted to open a group home for 10 to 12 adults recovering from drug addiction and alcoholism. Although the town zoning law allowed any number of “family” members related by “genetics, adoption, or marriage” to live together, it limited to five the number of unrelated persons who could live together. Oxford House challenged the zoning restriction as discriminatory against persons with disabilities, both because it made a dwelling “unavailable . . . because of a handicap,” §3604(f)(1)(A), and because the town failed to make “reasonable accommodations” in its “rules, policies [and] practices, §3604(f)(3)(B).” The town defended by pointing to the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>’s exemption for “any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.” 42 U.S.C. §3607(b)(1). The Supreme Court found the exemption unavailable on the ground that the town’s law did not prescribe “the maximum number of occupants” a dwelling unit could house because it did not limit the number of traditional family members who could live together. Justice Ginsburg wrote: “We hold that §3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the family-defining kind, <i>i.e.</i>, provisions designed to foster the family character of a neighborhood. Instead, §3607(b)(1)’s absolute exemption removes from the FHA’s scope only total occupancy limits, <i>i.e.</i>, numerical ceilings that serve to prevent overcrowding in living quarters.” 514 U.S. at 728.</p>
<p id="c5e56bdb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Homeless shelters and sex discrimination.</b> In <i>Doe v. Butler</i>, 892 F.2d 315 (3d Cir. 1989), three women who had been victims of domestic violence charged that the city of Butler, Pennsylvania had violated the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>’s prohibition on sex discrimination when the city refused to approve a temporary shelter for abused women and children. The city’s denial was based primarily on a zoning provision that limited transitional shelters to six residents plus staff, despite the argument from the shelter provider that only a larger facility would be economically feasible. Rejecting a challenge to this limit on the size of shelters, the court stated that the limit’s impact on women “does not alone establish discriminatory effect, because the resident limitation would have a comparable effect on males if the transitional dwelling was established for a different group, such as, for example, recovering male alcoholics.” <i>Id.</i> at 323. Can you think of a counterargument to this proposition? How might the exclusion of shelters for battered women impose a disparate impact on women as compared to men?</p>

To integrate these immigrants into the community more effectively, the city council passes an ordinance prohibiting all immigrants from buying or renting homes or apartments on the same block as another <span title="1095" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1095">p. 1095</span>immigrant family. Under the reasoning of <i>Familystyle</i>, would such an ordinance be enforceable under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>? Suppose the ordinance prohibits any African American family from living next door to another African American family as a means to combat racial segregation. Does this violate the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>? </p>
<p id="c5e592ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> An organization buys a house to set up a group home for mentally disabled persons. Opposition to the group home develops in the neighborhood. In response to community pressure, the city amends its zoning ordinance to require that all facilities housing more than four unrelated persons together have one parking space off the street for every two residents. The city council justifies the ordinance by noting that unrelated persons are more likely to have separate cars, whereas family members may share a vehicle and that residents in group homes need more parking for supervisors, visitors, and doctors. Moreover, the city is relatively built up and most houses do not have off-street parking. Streets are quite congested, and parking spaces are hard to find. The effect of the ordinance, however, is to make it financially impossible to set up the group home in the city. The organization sues the city, arguing that the new ordinance violates the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. What arguments could you make on behalf of the plaintiffs? On behalf of the defendant city? What should the court do?</p>

If the lender is unable to do so, the foreclosure proceeding will be dismissed and the lender left to its remedies at law.</p>
<p id="c5e592fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Major Jahn K. Foy, a reserve officer, was engaged on active duty, when foreclosure proceedings were initiated against her property, 517 Rogers Avenue in Brooklyn, which is located within a minority neighborhood. The thirty year note and mortgage dated July of 2000 carried an interest rate of nine and one half percent (9½%).</p>
<p id="c5e592ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Previously, Major Foy moved to reform the mortgage pursuant to <i>New York Military Law</i> claiming, in essence, that her ability to comply with the terms of the 9½% <span title="1096" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1096">p. 1096</span>mortgage was materially affected by her deployment on several tours of active duty over the course of the past several years.

Research has revealed that when minorities subjected to discrimination represent a very small percentage of the population, the cost of discrimination falls mainly upon the minority, however when they represent a larger segment of society, the cost of discrimination falls upon both the minorities and the majority as currently evidenced by the world wide subprime mortgage meltdown.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113AA_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N113AA_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span></p>

<p id="c5e5ba1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Equity, which abhors unconscionable and unjust results, mandates a shift in the burden of proof to the plaintiff-lender to demonstrate that the loan is not discriminatory. Indeed, our decisional law has long since recognized that a litigant “seeking affirmative judicial action in equity . . . may not succeed if [the litigant] is asking [for] an inequitable or unconscionable result.” <i>Monaghan v. May</i>, 273 N.Y.S. 475 (App. Div. 1934). Moreover, “[i]n the absence of legislation, courts of equity have exercised jurisdiction in suits for the foreclosure of mortgages to fix the time and terms of sale and to refuse to confirm sales upon equitable grounds where they were found to be unfair or inadequacy of price was so gross as to shock the conscience.” <i>Home Building and Loan Ass’n v.

<p id="c5e5ba21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Lending discrimination.</b> Discrimination has long been a significant problem in mortgage markets. <i>See</i> Robert G. Schwemm &amp; Jeffrey L. Taren, <i>Discretionary Pricing, Mortgage Discrimination, and the Fair Housing Act</i>, 45 Harv. C.R.-C.L. Rev. 375, 385-390 (2010). This discrimination can take several forms. Early in the development of modern home-finance, during the New Deal, federal policies encouraged “redlining,” which is the practice of not providing loans in minority neighborhoods. The term derives from a practice originated by a federal agency created during the New Deal, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC). HOLC, which was created in 1933 to refinance distressed mortgages, set about to examine cities across the country and create color-coded “residential security maps” that sorted urban and suburban neighborhoods into “A,” “B,” “C,” or “D” ratings. These letter grades were used to evaluate the quality of loans that might be made in those neighborhoods. “A” neighborhoods were generally white and usually native born while the lowest rated neighborhoods, “D,” were generally African American. On the HOLC maps, “D” neighborhoods were colored red, and lenders were discouraged from lending in those areas. <i>See</i> Kenneth T. Jackson, <i>Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States</i> 199-203 (1985). This approach, subsequently adopted by the Federal Housing Administration, a federal agency that insures mortgages, shaped the landscape of home lending for decades in the twentieth century.</p>
<p id="c5e5ba22-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, in the run-up to the subprime crisis, the outright denial of loans became less of a problem than the provision of loans on terms that were disadvantageous <span title="1099" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1099">p. 1099</span>to minority borrowers. <i>See</i> Alan M. White, <i>Borrowing While Black: Applying Fair Lending Laws to Risk-Based Mortgage Pricing</i>, 60 S.C. L. Rev. 677, 678 (2009). Several common practices reinforced unequal access to credit. For example, some criteria in underwriting — which is the process of evaluating borrowers for loans — include factors, such as the value of property used for collateral, that reflect structural disadvantages for minority borrowers. This practice is often referred to as reverse redlining, because it makes unfair loans more, rather than less, available to particular neighborhoods. Minority borrowers have also been treated unfairly where banks have given loan officers discretion to vary the terms of loans from objective criteria. And even where underwriting is standardized and facially nondiscriminatory, minority borrowers have often been steered into subprime loan products that have higher interest rates and less favorable terms. <i>See</i> Schwemm &amp; Taren, <i>supra</i>; White, <i>supra</i>. Many minority borrowers, moreover, were drawn into homeownership before the subprime crisis with inadequate resources to weather the subsequent downturn, leading to significantly worse outcomes for those borrowers when the crash hit. <i>See</i> Patrick Bayer et al., <i>The Vulnerability of Minority Homeowners in the Housing Boom and Bust</i> (ERID Working Paper Number 145) (Apr. 29, 2013).</p>
<p id="c5e5ba23-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the wake of the subprime crisis, lenders have significantly tightened underwriting standards to ensure that borrowers have the ability to repay and new regulations have been implemented that focus on policing the process of origination. <i>See</i> Chapter 12, §4.2. Although these new regulations are an important corrective to the abusive practices that induced many homeowners to take out unsustainable loans, one consequence of the new standards is that mortgages are now more difficult to obtain for minority home buyers. <i>See</i> William C. Apgar, <i>Getting on the Right Track: Improving Low-Income and Minority Access to Mortgage Credit After the Housing Bust</i> (2012), <i>available at http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/publications/getting-right-track-improving-low-income-and-minority-access-mortgage-credit.</i></p>
<p id="c5e5ba24-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Fair lending laws.</b> Fair lending is regulated primarily through the <i>Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974</i> (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§1691-1691f, and the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>. ECOA bars discrimination in all credit transactions, including home lending, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age. 15 U.S.C. §1691(a). The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> specifically bars “any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions,” which includes the “making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance secured by residential real estate,” from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. §3605<i>.</i><span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11493_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N11493_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">24</a></span> Fair lending is <span title="1100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1100">p. 1100</span>also regulated under state consumer protection statutes and, as <i>M &amp; T Mortgage Corp.</i> demonstrates, through the traditional tools of equity.</p>
<p id="c5e5ba26-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</i>, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (the <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i>) (codified as amended in scattered sections of the U.S. Code) brought a number of changes to the regulatory landscape of fair lending at the federal level. The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> gave the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) supervisory, enforcement, and rulemaking authority for ECOA and the <i>Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975</i> (HMDA), 12 U.S.C. §2801 <i>et seq</i>. The <i>Fair Housing Act</i> is still enforced by HUD and the Justice Department. The <i>Dodd-Frank Act</i> also defined “fair lending” as “fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit for consumers.” 12 U.S.C. §5481(13). This definition has not yet been the subject of CFPB rulemaking or case law, but it has the potential, through CFPB oversight of lending institutions, to expand significantly the breadth of consumer protection for fair access to credit. Can you see how?</p>
<p id="c5e5ba27-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Enforcement and aggregation.</b> In HMDA, Congress provided advocates an important tool to understand lenders’ aggregate lending practices. <i>See</i> Carol Necole Brown, <i>Intent and Empirics: The Race to the Subprime</i>, 93 Marq. L. Rev. 907 (2010). HMDA requires lenders to track and disclose a wide variety of information not only about the loans they make, but about loan applications as well. This information includes the race, ethnicity, and gender of borrowers and applicants, which can reveal discriminatory patterns in lending practices.</p>
<p id="c5e5e138-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because direct evidence of lending discrimination is rare, it has been important for plaintiffs to use HMDA data and the tool of class action certification to aggregate sufficient comparative data to demonstrate either that an individual minority borrower has been treated less favorably than non-minority borrowers or that given practices have discriminatory effects. Schwemm &amp; Taren, <i>supra</i>, at 389. However, the Supreme Court has narrowed the interpretation of one of the factors courts use to evaluate whether to grant a group of litigants class-action status. In <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</i>, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), the Court considered a potential class of over a million female Wal-Mart employees who alleged that they suffered a disparate impact on the basis of sex because of decisions made by supervisors across the country on pay and promotion issues. Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires “commonality” to certify a class of plaintiffs, and the Supreme Court ruled that this requirement could not be met in <i>Dukes</i> given the individual discretion granted to supervisors. Because so much of the evidence of discriminatory lending involves statistical analysis of patterns and practices attributable to individual loan officers, the <i>Dukes</i> case makes it significantly more difficult for fair-lending plaintiffs to obtain class status. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>In re Countrywide Finance Corp. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation</i>, 708 F.3d 704 (6th Cir. 2013) (class certification denied on lack of commonality for African American and Hispanic borrowers who alleged that they were charged higher loan rates as a result of the subjective component of mortgage lender’s loan-pricing policy).</p>
<p id="c5e5e139-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What other tools can advocates for fair lending use to respond to discriminatory lending practices, if aggregate litigation is now more difficult?</p>

Fair lending and mortgage securitization.</b> In <i>Adkins v. Morgan Stanley</i>, No. 12 CV 7667(HB), 2013 WL 3835198 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), African American homeowners sued Morgan Stanley, arguing that its policies and practices caused a lender, New Century Mortgage Company, to target borrowers in the Detroit area for loans that had a disparate impact upon African Americans under the <i>Fair Housing Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §3601 <i>et seq.</i> (FHA). Morgan Stanley moved to dismiss the FHA claim. Judge Harold Baer denied the motion. Judge Baer, accepting the allegations of the complaint for purposes of the motion, noted the plaintiffs’ argument for how Morgan Stanley could have violated the FHA:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e5e13b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From 2004 to 2007, “New Century was among the most notoriously predatory of the subprime lenders operating at that time.” (Compl. ¶2.) Plaintiffs’ theory here is that Morgan Stanley discriminated against African Americans when New Century issued predatory loans and that they did so as a result of Morgan Stanley’s conduct. That conduct consisted of “five interrelated and centralized policies and practices” to securitize New Century’s loans. (<i>Id.</i> ¶36.) First, Morgan Stanley “routinely purchased loans” with excessive debt-to-income (“DTI”) ratios. (<i>Id.</i> ¶¶44-45.) High DTI ratios indicate that the loan is larger than the borrower can afford. Second, Morgan Stanley “regularly purchase[d] and securitize[d] mortgage loans from New Century where the [loan-to-value ratio] . . . exceeded 100%.” (<i>Id.</i> ¶51.) High loan-to-value ratios, which compare the amount of the loan to the value of the home, are loans where the borrower faces a greater risk of delinquency or foreclosure. Third, Morgan Stanley required New Century to issue loans with adjustable rates and prepayment penalties. Morgan Stanley also “purchased and securitized large numbers of New Century mortgage loans with balloon payment features,” exacerbating a borrower’s financial risk. (<i>Id.</i> ¶60.) Fourth, Morgan Stanley provided necessary funding — in the form of warehouse lending, precommitments to purchase loans, and funding for loan closings — to New Century that allowed it to remain in business. Once New Century’s funding dried up in 2007, the firm entered bankruptcy. (<i>Id.</i> ¶69.) Fifth, Morgan Stanley purchased loans that “deviated substantially from basic underwriting standards,” going so far as to “encourage[ ] lending tactics that increased the levels of risk associated with individual loans.” (<i>Id.</i> ¶¶73, 75.) According to Plaintiffs, by creating the conditions under which New Century originated toxic loans, Morgan Stanley caused African-American borrowers to fall prey to those loans at a disproportionate rate, or put another way, to make this homeowner nightmare come true.</p>

These high risk loans, the complaint continued, generated elevated rates of foreclosure, and disproportionately so for African American borrowers. As a result of Morgan Stanley’s policies, “a high-cost loan originated by New Century was more than six times as likely to be in a 90%-plus minority neighborhood than the average loan originated in the Detroit region,” <i>id.</i> (quoting Compl. ¶119), and “an African-American borrower in a minority neighborhood had a 21% greater chance of receiving a high-cost loan than a similarly-situated white borrower in a white neighborhood.” <i>Id.</i> (quoting Compl. ¶122.)

Indeed, “[b]y 2012, banks had foreclosed on 100,000 homes [in Detroit], which drove down the city’s total real estate value by 30 percent and spurred a mass exodus of nearly a quarter million people.” Laura Gottesdiener, <i>Detroit’s Debt Crisis: Everything Must Go,</i> Rolling Stone, June 20, 2013. The resulting blight stemming from “60,000 parcels of vacant land” and “78,000 vacant structures, of which 38,000 are estimated to be in potentially dangerous condition” has further strained Detroit’s already taxed resources. Kevyn D. Orr, <i>Financial and Operating Plan</i> 9 (2013). And as residents flee the city, Detroit’s shrinking ratepayer base renders its financial outlook even bleaker. <i>Id.</i> Given these conditions, it is not difficult to conclude that Detroit’s current predicament, at least in part, is an outgrowth of the predatory lending at issue here. <i>See</i> Monica Davey &amp; Mary Williams Walsh, <i>Billions in Debt, Detroit Tumbles Into Insolvency</i>, N.Y. Times, July 18, 2013, at A1 (listing Detroit’s “shrunken tax base but still a huge, 139-square-mile city to maintain” as one factor contributing to the city’s financial woes).</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5e5e141-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs here have successfully alleged a disparate impact under the FHA. [A] prima facie case under the FHA on a disparate impact theory requires only that Plaintiffs allege “that an outwardly neutral practice actually or predictably has a discriminatory effect; that is, has a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on minorities, or perpetuates segregation.” <i>Fair Hous. in Huntington Comm. Inc. v. Town of Huntington, N.Y.</i>, 316 F.3d 357, 366 (2d Cir. 2003). Plaintiffs here have met their pleading burden. First, they have identified the policy that they allege has a disproportionate impact on minorities. That policy consisted of Morgan Stanley (1) routinely purchasing both stated income loans and loans with unreasonably high debt-to-income ratios, (2) routinely purchasing loans with unreasonably high loan-to-value ratios, (3) requiring that New Century’s loans include adjustable rates and prepayment penalties as well as purchasing loans with other high-risk features, (4) providing necessary funding to New Century, and (5) purchasing loans that deviated from basic underwriting standards. Plaintiffs go on to state that these policies resulted in “New Century aggressively target[ing] African American borrowers and communities . . . for the Combined-Risk Loans.” (Compl. ¶81.) Indeed, Plaintiffs allege in detail the effect that New Century’s lending had upon the <span title="1103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1103">p. 1103</span>African American community in the Detroit area. (Compl. ¶¶115-122). That lending, according to Plaintiffs, was a direct result of Morgan Stanley’s policies. And while Plaintiffs do not allege that they qualified for better loans, they allege discrimination based only upon the receipt of these predatory, toxic loans that placed them at high financial risk. These risks exist regardless of Plaintiffs’ qualifications. On a motion to dismiss, these allegations are sufficient to demonstrate a disparate impact.</p>
<p id="c5e5e142-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Morgan Stanley argues that the FHA does not reach Plaintiffs’ theory here. But as an entity “engage[d] in residential real estate-related transactions,” Morgan Stanley — as a loan purchaser and mortgage securitizer — falls within the scope of the FHA. 42 U.S.C. §3605(a). And as such, the FHA prohibits Morgan Stanley both from discriminating in “making available” real-estate related transactions as well as discriminating “in the terms or conditions of such a transaction.” §3605(a); <i>see also</i> 24 C.F.R. §100.125 (“It shall be unlawful for any . . . entity engaged in the purchasing of loans or other debts or securities . . . to impose different terms or conditions for such purchases, because of race. . . .”).</p>
<p id="c5e5e143-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Morgan Stanley’s policies themselves resulted in Plaintiffs suffering a disparate impact. Indeed, Morgan Stanley’s policies set the terms and conditions on which it would purchase loans from New Century. For example, “Morgan Stanley placed at least two employees onsite at New Century full-time when conducting due diligence on loans it would purchase for securitization.” (Compl. ¶75.) When a “full documentation loan” indicated that a borrower could not afford a particular loan, “Morgan Stanley would shred the documentation and tell the originator to get a new, ‘stated income’ loan.” (<i>Id.</i>) This stated income loan would appear less risky and permit the borrower to qualify, but would do nothing to change the fact that the borrower could not afford the loan. Thus the terms and conditions governing Morgan Stanley’s loan purchases directly resulted in a disparate impact when they caused New Century to issue toxic loans to Plaintiffs.</p>

<p id="c5e5e145-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Morgan Stanley’s argument in <i>Adkins</i> that the FHA does not reach securitization was predicated on the idea that merely purchasing loans from a lender could not create a disparate impact under the FHA, regardless of the resulting actions a lender might take. Judge Baer rejected this argument in denying the motion to dismiss, but that does not necessarily end the case. Despite the plaintiffs’ successfully alleged <i>prima facie</i> case of disparate impact, Morgan Stanley may have the opportunity to prove “that the challenged practice,” which is to say its securitization practices, were “necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests.” 24 C.F.R. §100.500(c). What business justifications might Morgan Stanley offer for why the mortgages it purchased were beneficial to consumers rather than harmful, or were otherwise legitimate? If the plaintiffs in <i>Adkins</i> were then to attempt to prove “that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect,” <i>id.</i>, what would their best arguments be? How should these competing arguments be assessed in light of the harms the plaintiffs alleged?</p>

The predatory loans, as identified by the City, include: high-cost loans (i.e., those with an interest rate at least three percentage points above a federally established benchmark), subprime loans, interest-only loans, balloon payment loans, loans with prepayment penalties, negative amortization loans, no documentation loans, and adjustable rate mortgages with teaser rates (i.e., a lifetime maximum rate greater than the initial rate plus 6%). The City alleged that by steering minorities toward these predatory loans, Bank of America caused minority-owned properties throughout Miami to fall into unnecessary or premature foreclosure, depriving the City of tax revenue and forcing it to spend more on municipal services (such as police, firefighters, trash and debris removal, etc.) to combat the resulting blight.</p>

There is a well-established statutory and common law basis for the supervision of purchasers of streams of income to insure that the purchase of income from lotteries or settlements is not accomplished at a high rate of interest. <i>See e.g.</i>,<i> In re Cabrera</i>, 765 N.Y.S.2d 208 (Sup. Ct. 2003); <i>In re Settlement Capital Corp.</i>, 769 N.Y.S.2d 817 (Sup. Ct. 2003). This Court has found that an interest rate of nine percent which is the judgment interest rate, is reasonable and has approved those applications where all other circumstances being equal a rate no greater than that is charged.</p><p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="c5e59304-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a"><span class="epub-footnotenum-ref"><a href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#ftN113AA_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" id="note-N113AA_ceeab89e-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span>&nbsp;Gary S.
