<p id="c5ebadaf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Property rights serve “twin roles — as protector of individual rights against other citizens, and as safeguard against excessive government interference.” Jeremy Paul, <i>The Hidden Structure of Takings Law</i>, 64 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1393, 1402 (1991). Property rights mediate disputes by defining legal relations among people regarding control of valued resources. Property rights are not absolute because owners do not live alone; their rights are limited to protect the legitimate interests of other owners and of non-owners who may be affected by the exercise of those property rights. Because property rights must be limited to protect the property and personal rights of others, the state must have the power to <i>define</i> the scope of property rights so as to establish the basic framework of legal relationships in the market and to ensure that property rights are not exercised in ways that infringe on the legitimate interests of other owners or the public at large. Thus, the state must have the power to pass laws regulating and limiting the use of property to protect public health, safety, and welfare.</p>
<p id="c5ebadb0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, granting the state the power to define property rights leaves individuals vulnerable to state infringement of those rights. The state may misuse its power to define property rights and go too far, thereby taking property rights away from owners to which they should be entitled. Property rights not only protect people against other persons but serve as a bulwark against state power. By delegating power to individuals and groups to control specific resources, the state attempts to decentralize power relationships. Individuals, rather than officials in a centralized state bureaucracy, have control of many of society’s most valued resources. To maintain this decentralization, owners must be protected from having their property rights seized or unduly infringed by the state. Property rights must be <i>defended</i> from illegitimate encroachment by the state.</p>
<p id="c5ebadb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1110" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1110">p. 1110</span>This dual role of property law creates an awful dilemma. How can the state both <i>define</i> property rights and be <i>limited</i> by them? If the state can simply redefine the incidents of property to readjust relations among private persons, then property rights cannot serve as a limit to state power. Some limits must be imposed on the state’s ability to redefine property rights in order to <i>defend</i> property owners from illegitimate governmental power. But if the definition of property rights is frozen while circumstances change, the state is deprived of the ability to regulate the use of property to promote the general welfare. Professor Paul notes that “[t]o reconcile American law’s double-edged reliance on property concepts, [we] must successfully distinguish between the courts’ role as definers and defenders of property rights.” <i>Id.</i> at 1415.</p>
<p id="c5ebadb2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One strategy for managing the state’s dual role is to impose constitutional limits on the state’s power to reconfigure property rights. To that end, many legal systems specifically provide for some form of constitutional protection of property against government encroachment. In a legal system with robust judicial review, constitutionally protecting property empowers courts to police the behavior of government actors to ensure that, in carrying out their duties, they do not act in ways that violate constitutionally protected property rights. By finding some particular state action to violate the Constitution, courts place limits on the state that can only be undone through constitutional amendment. Determining the proper boundaries of this judicial review of the actions of other state actors within a democratic system is one of the deep questions of constitutional theory, one whose contours are more properly explored in a course dedicated to constitutional law. In the last two chapters of this book, our focus will be on the U.S. Constitution’s protection of private property against government intrusion.</p>
<p id="c5ebadb3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many provisions in the U.S. Constitution interact with property rights in some way. For example, the regulation of land use can implicate both the religion and speech clauses of the first amendment. <i>See</i> Chapter 7, §6. Other provisions, such as the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures” in the fourth amendment, U.S. Const., amend. IV, and even the third amendment’s prohibition against the quartering of troops “in any house,” U.S. Const., amend. III, protect property rights against specific types of government action. The U.S. Constitution, however, more directly and broadly protects property in both the fifth and fourteenth amendments. The fifth amendment’s due process clause states that “no person shall . . . be deprived of . . . property, without due process of law.” The fourteenth amendment has very similar due process language. And the fifth amendment’s takings clause prohibits the government from taking “private property” for “public use” without “just compensation.” In this chapter, we will discuss the due process clause, as well as the very similar doctrines that courts have adopted under the rubric of the fourteenth amendment’s equal protection clause. In the next chapter, we will explore the complex body of law that courts have developed under the takings clause.<span title="1111" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1111">p. 1111</span></p>

<p id="c5ebadb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice H<span class="epub-small-caps">ARLAN</span> F<span class="epub-small-caps">ISKE</span> S<span class="epub-small-caps">TONE</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5ebadb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Acting under the Cedar Rust Act of Virginia, Va. Code §§885-893 (1924), defendant in error, the state entomologist, ordered the plaintiffs in error to cut down a large number of ornamental red cedar trees growing on their property, as a means of preventing the communication of a rust or plant disease with which they were infected to the apple orchards in the vicinity.</p>
<p id="c5ebadba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Virginia statute presents a comprehensive scheme for the condemnation and destruction of red cedar trees infected by cedar rust. By section 1 it is declared to be unlawful for any person to “own, plant or keep alive and standing” on his premises any red cedar tree which is or may be the source or “host plant” of the communicable plant disease known as cedar rust, and any such tree growing within a certain radius of any apple orchard is declared to be a public nuisance, subject to destruction. Section 2 makes it the duty of the state entomologist, “upon the request in writing of ten or more reputable freeholders of any county or magisterial district, to make a preliminary investigation of the locality . . . to ascertain if any cedar tree or trees . . . are the source of, harbor or constitute the host plant for the said disease . . . and constitute a menace to the health of any apple orchard in said locality, and that said cedar tree or trees exist within a radius of two miles of any apple orchard in said locality.” If affirmative findings are so made, he is required to direct the owner in writing to destroy the trees and, in his notice, to furnish a statement of the “fact found to exist whereby it is deemed necessary or proper to destroy” the trees and to call attention to the law under which it is proposed to destroy them. Section 5 authorizes the state entomologist to destroy the trees if the owner, after being notified, fails to do so.</p>
<p id="c5ebadbb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As shown by the evidence and as recognized in other cases involving the validity of this statute, cedar rust is an infectious plant disease in the form of a fungoid organism which is destructive of the fruit and foliage of the apple, but without effect on the value of the cedar. Its life cycle has two phases which are passed alternately as a growth on red cedar and on apple trees. It is communicated by spores from one to the other over a radius of at least two miles. It appears not to be communicable between trees of the same species, but only from one species to the other, and other plants seem not to be appreciably affected by it. The only practicable method of controlling the disease and protecting apple trees from its ravages is the destruction of all red cedar trees, subject to the infection, located within two miles of apple orchards.</p>
<p id="c5ebadbc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The red cedar, aside from its ornamental use, has occasional use and value as lumber. It is indigenous to Virginia, is not cultivated or dealt in commercially on any substantial scale, and its value throughout the state is shown to be small as compared with that of the apple orchards of the state. Apple growing is one of the principal agricultural pursuits in Virginia. The apple is used there and exported in large quantities. Many millions of dollars are invested in the orchards, which furnish employment for a large portion of the population, and have induced the development of attendant railroad and cold storage facilities.</p>
<p id="c5ebadbd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1112" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1112">p. 1112</span>On the evidence we may accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Appeals that the state was under the necessity of making a choice between the preservation of one class of property and that of the other wherever both existed in dangerous proximity. It would have been none the less a choice if, instead of enacting the present statute, the state, by doing nothing, had permitted serious injury to the apple orchards within its borders to go on unchecked. When forced to such a choice the state does not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another which, in the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public. It will not do to say that the case is merely one of a conflict of two private interests and that the misfortune of apple growers may not be shifted to cedar owners by ordering the destruction of their property; for it is obvious that there may be, and that here there is, a preponderant public concern in the preservation of the one interest over the other. And where the public interest is involved preferment of that interest over the property interest of the individual, to the extent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every exercise of the police power which affects property.</p>
<p id="c5ebadbe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not weigh with nicety the question whether the infected cedars constitute a nuisance according to the common law; or whether they may be so declared by statute. For where, as here, the choice is unavoidable, we cannot say that its exercise, controlled by considerations of social policy which are not unreasonable, involves any denial of due process.</p>

<p id="c5ebd4d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. The impossibility of doing nothing.</b> Can the government stay out of this kind of conflict? What if, instead of destroying the cedar trees, the government refused to take any action at all? In that case, the government would seem to have made a choice to let the costs of the cedar rust fall on apple orchards. How should the government go about choosing which property owner to favor? Would payment of compensation to either the cedar tree owners or the apple tree owners change the nature of the government’s dilemma? If so, who should pay that compensation? The government (meaning taxpayers)? The benefited private parties?</p>
<p id="c5ebd4d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Nuisance.</b> If the owners of orchards brought a nuisance action against the owners of nearby cedar trees, would they be likely to prevail? If a court found the cedar trees to be a nuisance, would an injunction requiring the cedar tree owners to destroy their trees violate the property rights of the cedar tree owners? If not, should a legislature (or administrative agency) be able to make the same determination in the absence of a lawsuit?</p>
<p id="c5ebd4d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Harm prevention versus benefit conferral.</b> Is the government in <i>Miller</i> acting to prevent owners of cedar trees from harming apple orchards or is it harming cedar tree owners to confer a benefit on the owners of apple orchards? The apple tree owners could argue that the cedar tree owners were harming them by maintaining trees on their property that were causing great destruction on neighboring apple <span title="1113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1113">p. 1113</span>orchards. The cedar tree owners could respond that they had done nothing wrong; that the problem was with the delicate nature of apple trees, and that they should not be made to pay for the costs of protecting the apple trees from disease. Indeed, in a case very similar to <i>Miller</i>, the Florida Supreme Court required compensation to be paid to owners of the state-destroyed trees. <i>Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services v. Mid-Florida Growers, Inc.</i>, 521 So. 2d 101, 103 (Fla. 1988) (holding that the state had to pay just compensation when it destroyed healthy orange trees to prevent the spread of citrus canker because “destruction of the healthy trees benefited the entire citrus industry and, in turn, Florida’s economy, thereby conferring a public benefit rather than preventing a public harm”). <i>See also Rose Acre Farms, Inc. v. United States</i>, 373 F.3d 1177 (1st Cir. 2004) (egg producer entitled to compensation when more eggs were taken than necessary to respond to a salmonella outbreak). In the context of government regulation of incompatible land uses, is there any way to distinguish between harm prevention and benefit conferral?</p>

<p id="c5ebd4d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fourteenth amendment’s equal protection clause says: “No state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
</div>
<p id="c5ebd4d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All laws classify people, either explicitly or implicitly, for the purposes of achieving some regulatory goal. Do classifications of different property owners violate the equal protection clause by treating them differently from one another? Consider the typical zoning code, which permits some owners to engage only in residential use of their land while permitting others to engage in either commercial or residential uses. In assessing whether such a legal classification violates the requirements of equal protection, courts engage in a means-ends analysis that asks whether the classification chosen (the means) bears a sufficiently strong relationship to the goals the state is seeking to accomplish (the ends). How tightly the means must be tied to the ends varies based on the particular kind of classification the state is trying to use.</p>
<p id="c5ebd4da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Certain classifications, such as racial distinctions, are deemed inherently suspect and therefore presumptively unconstitutional. They will be upheld only if they are strictly necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest. Other classifications, such as those based on sex, are deemed to be sometimes relevant but often invalid. They are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny. They must bear a substantial relationship to an important government objective. Classifications not included in the first two categories, such as those used in most regulation of property, are presumptively permissible. They are subject to a very deferential rational basis test. Applying these standards, differential treatment of various classes of property owners under a typical zoning law will be upheld if the classification is (at least arguably) rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. This test will almost always be satisfied.<span title="1114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1114">p. 1114</span></p>

<p id="c5ebfbf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent Grace Olech and her late husband Thaddeus asked petitioner Village of Willowbrook to connect their property to the municipal water supply. The Village at first conditioned the connection on the Olechs granting the Village a 33-foot easement. The Olechs objected, claiming that the Village only required a 15-foot easement from other property owners seeking access to the water supply. After a 3-month delay, the Village relented and agreed to provide water service with only a 15-foot easement.</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Olech sued the Village claiming that the Village’s demand of an additional 18-foot easement violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Olech asserted that the 33-foot easement demand was “irrational and wholly arbitrary”; that the Village’s demand was actually motivated by ill will resulting from the Olechs’ previous filing of an unrelated, successful lawsuit against the Village; and that the Village acted either with the intent to deprive Olech of her rights or in reckless disregard of her rights.</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Court dismissed the lawsuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause. Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that a plaintiff can allege an equal protection violation by asserting that state action was motivated solely by a “spiteful effort to ‘get’ him for reasons wholly unrelated to any legitimate state objective.” It determined that Olech’s complaint sufficiently alleged such a claim. We granted certiorari to determine whether the Equal Protection Clause gives rise to a cause of action on behalf of a “class of one” where the plaintiff did not allege membership in a class or group.</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a “class of one,” where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment. In so doing, we have explained that “the purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the State’s jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.” <i>Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County</i>, 260 U.S. 441, 445 (1923).</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That reasoning is applicable to this case. Olech’s complaint can fairly be construed as alleging that the Village intentionally demanded a 33-foot easement as a condition of connecting her property to the municipal water supply where the Village required only a 15-foot easement from other similarly situated property owners. The complaint also alleged that the Village’s demand was “irrational and wholly arbitrary” and that the Village ultimately connected her property after receiving a clearly adequate 15-foot easement. These allegations, quite apart from the Village’s subjective motivation, are sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but do not reach the alternative theory of “subjective ill will” relied on by that court. . . .  </p>

<p id="c5ebfbf6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Solicitor General and the village of Willowbrook have expressed concern lest we interpret the Equal Protection Clause in this case in a way that would transform many ordinary violations of city or state law into violations of the Constitution. It might be thought that a rule that looks only to an intentional difference in treatment and a lack of a rational basis for that different treatment would work such a transformation. Zoning decisions, for example, will often, perhaps almost always, treat one landowner differently from another, and one might claim that, when a city’s zoning authority takes an action that fails to conform to a city zoning regulation, it lacks a “rational basis” for its action (at least if the regulation in question is reasonably clear).</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, however, does not directly raise the question whether the simple and common instance of a faulty zoning decision would violate the Equal Protection Clause. That is because the Court of Appeals found that in this case respondent had alleged an extra factor as well — a factor that the Court of Appeals called “vindictive action,” “illegitimate animus,” or “ill will.”</p>
<p id="c5ebfbf8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the presence of that added factor in this case is sufficient to minimize any concern about transforming run-of-the-mill zoning cases into cases of constitutional right. For this reason, along with the others mentioned by the Court, I concur in the result.</p>

The equal protection challenge may be most likely to succeed when the facts of the case present some reason to think that the city was motivated by animus against the group in question, even where the group is not normally understood to be a “suspect classification” subject to less deferential scrutiny. <i>See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center</i>, 473 U.S. 432 (1985) (city violates equal protection clause when it requires group homes for persons with mental retardation to seek special permits to operate but does not impose this requirement on other group homes such as fraternities or nursing homes, and city can present no legitimate government justification for the differential treatment but is based solely on an “irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded”); <i>cf. Romer v. Evans</i>, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996) (striking down state constitutional amendment that barred local governments from enacting protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and noting that “laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected”).</p>

<p id="c5ebfbfe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A town’s zoning ordinance requires setbacks of ten feet in a particular area of the town. The zoning board routinely grants variances from this restriction as long <span title="1116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1116">p. 1116</span>as construction is kept five feet away from the boundary and none of the abutting neighbors objects. This practice violates the express terms of the zoning ordinance itself, as well as the state’s zoning enabling act, both of which allow variances to be granted only if the owner can demonstrate extreme hardship. An owner applies for a variance to add a dining room onto her single-family home, seeking to build it so that it will be five feet from the boundary of her property. One of the four abutting neighbors objects, and the zoning board denies the variance. The owner sues the town, claiming that this deprives her of equal protection of the laws, citing <i>Willowbrook v. Olech</i>, 528 U.S. 562 (2000)<i>.</i> The owner points out that two of her neighbors in the immediate neighborhood were granted variances to build structures that extended to five feet from the border of their properties. The zoning board defends the denial on the ground that it is rational to allow neighbors veto power over variances because such variances will affect their property more than that of anyone else. The owner contends that this effective delegation of discretion to the neighbors denies her equal protection of law. Who is right? What else might you need to know about the owner and her neighbors to evaluate this question?</p>

<p id="c5ebfc05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fifth amendment’s due process clause says: “No person shall . . . be deprived of . . . property, without due process of law.” The fourteenth amendment has a similar clause, which says: “nor shall any state deprive any person of . . . property, without due process of law.”</p>
</div>
<p id="c5ebfc06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the notion of “due process” appears to be merely procedural, courts have interpreted the Constitution’s due process clauses to provide both procedural and substantive protection for property owners. Procedurally, several issues are often at stake in litigation over whether the government has complied with due process when it deprives a person of property: (1) the adequacy of notice to the owner; (2) the quality of the decision maker (especially its neutrality); (3) the opportunity of the owner to be heard (either before or after the deprivation); (4) an opportunity to present evidence to the decision maker; (5) an opportunity to confront witnesses and evidence and cross-examine or contest them; (6) the right to have an attorney present; and (7) the right to have a formal decision rendered based on a fixed record and with a statement of the reasons for the decision that can provide a basis for appeal. <i>See</i> Ronald E. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, 3 <i>Treatise on Constitutional Law</i> §17.8 (a) (2013).</p>
<p id="c5ebfc07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court applies a sliding scale to determine how much process is due to an owner before the state may deprive her of property. As the Court put it in the leading case of <i>Matthews v. Eldridge</i>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the law balances several factors in determining whether a deprivation satisfies the requirements of procdetermination that it was unreasonable to repairedural due process:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5ebfc08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1117" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1117">p. 1117</span>First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requisites would entail.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5ebfc09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Substantively, the due process clause protects owners from deprivation of “property” rights by “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. <i>Nectow v. City of Cambridge</i>, 277 U.S. 183, 187-188 (1928). <i>Accord, Pennell v. City of San Jose</i>, 485 U.S. 1, 11 (1988) (due process is violated if law is “arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt”); <i>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp</i>., 429 U.S. 252, 263 (1977) (owners have a “right to be free from arbitrary or irrational zoning actions”); <i>Town of Rhine v. Bizzell</i>, 751 N.W.2d 780, 793-794 (Wis. 2008) (zoning ordinance presumed valid unless “clearly arbitrary and unreasonable in the restricted sense that it has no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare”). As with equal protection, in determining whether a state action is arbitrary in the forbidden sense, courts usually apply a deferential means-ends analysis that asks whether the state’s action (or means) is rationally related to a permissible government goal (or end). The difference is this requirement for some minimal fit between means and ends under the rubric of substantive due process applies to all government actions, and not just those involving the creation of legal categories. In a sense, courts treat rational basis review under the due process clause as defining the outer limits of state police-power action. To constitute a valid exercise of the state’s police power, all state action must be minimally rational and must be directed toward some permissible public goal.</p>

Situated on these properties are three structures — two former residential homes and one barn/garage — all of which have been unoccupied and generally unmaintained for over 30 years. In January 2009, defendant city of Brighton’s (the City) building and code enforcement officer, James Rowell (the building official), informed plaintiffs via written notice that these three structures had been deemed “unsafe” in violation of the Brighton Code of Ordinances, and further constituted public nuisances in violation of Michigan common law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101F5_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N101F5_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> Plaintiffs were also informed of the building official’s additional <span title="1118" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1118">p. 1118</span>determination that it was unreasonable to repair these structures consistent with the standard set forth in BCO §18-59, which provides in its entirety as follows:</p>

However, despite having previously agreed to allow the building official interior access, plaintiffs thereafter refused entry, causing the City to petition for and obtain administrative search warrants. On May 27, 2009, the building official and several other representatives of the City inspected the structures and found over 45 unsafe conditions therein. The hearing resumed on June 4, 2009, and June 18, 2009, during which the city council received written reports and heard oral testimony from both parties on the issues of the City’s findings and conclusions pursuant to the interior and exterior inspection of the premises, as well as its cost estimates for the structures’ repair versus their demolition. On July 16, 2009, the city council unanimously affirmed the building official’s determination that the structures were unsafe under all ten of the standards set forth in BCO §18-46.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1021B_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1021B_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> The city council likewise found that plaintiffs had been maintaining unsafe structures in violation of <span title="1120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1120">p. 1120</span>[city ordinance], that the structures were unreasonable to repair under BCO §18-59, and that demolition was required within 60 days of its decision.</p>

<p id="c5ec2339-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs make two facial constitutional attacks upon BCO §18-59. First, they assert that the ordinance violates substantive due process by permitting demolition of an unsafe structure without extending to its owner an option to repair, because denying a property owner the chance to repair an unsafe structure does not advance the City’s otherwise legitimate interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the Brighton citizenry. Second, plaintiffs argue that the ordinance violates procedural due process by failing to provide a procedure to safeguard a property owner’s right to choose whether to repair a structure municipally deemed unsafe before the City orders it demolished. We will address plaintiffs’ arguments in this order; before proceeding further, however, we find it necessary to make two critical observations.</p>
<p id="c5ec233a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we emphasize that this is a <i>facial</i> challenge to BCO §18-59; plaintiffs do not challenge the ordinance’s application in a particular instance. A party challenging the facial constitutionality of an ordinance faces an extremely rigorous standard. To prevail, plaintiffs must establish that “ ‘no set of circumstances exists under which the [ordinance] would be valid’ ” and “ ‘[t]he fact that the . . . [ordinance] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient’ ” to render it invalid.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1026D_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1026D_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> Indeed, “ ‘if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain [the ordinance], the existence of the state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed’ ” and the ordinance upheld.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10278_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10278_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> Finally, because facial <span title="1121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1121">p. 1121</span>attacks, by their nature, are not dependent on the facts surrounding any particular decision, the specific facts surrounding plaintiffs’ claim are inapposite.</p>
<p id="c5ec4a4d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, and particularly noteworthy here, we emphasize that analysis of substantive and procedural due process involves two separate legal tests. While the touchstone of due process, generally, is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government, the substantive component protects against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power, whereas the procedural component is fittingly aimed at ensuring constitutionally sufficient procedures for the protection of life, liberty, and property interests. </p>
<p id="c5ec4a4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A. General Due Process Principles</i></p>

If, however, a life, liberty or property interest is found to exist and to be threatened by the City’s conduct, the next two queries will address what process is due before the government can interfere with that interest. Because the Due Process Clause offers two separate types of protections — substantive and procedural — separate inquiries must examine whether these protections have been provided.</p>
<p id="c5ec4a53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs allege that their property rights have been violated by the City’s decision to order their structures demolished without providing them with the option to repair the structures.

Substantive due process analysis must begin with a careful description of the asserted right, for there has “always been reluctan[ce] to expand the concept of substantive due process” given that “[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C4_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102C4_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> Where the right asserted is not fundamental, the government’s interference with that right need only be reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102CF_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102CF_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span></p>
<p id="c5ec4a5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A zoning ordinance must similarly stand the test of reasonableness — that it is reasonably necessary for the preservation of public health, morals, or safety — and it is presumed to be so until the plaintiff demonstrates otherwise. Accordingly, a plaintiff may successfully challenge a local ordinance on substantive due process grounds, and therefore overcome the presumption of reasonableness, by proving either “that there is no reasonable governmental interest being advanced by the present zoning classification itself . . . or, secondly, that an ordinance [is] unreasonable because of the purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use from the area in question.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102F0_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102F0_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span> The reasonableness of the ordinance thus becomes the test of its legality.</p>
<p id="c5ec4a5c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mindful of these principles, we begin by describing the right asserted by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are not generally arguing that they have a categorical right of property use or possession, but assert a much more limited constitutional right; namely, that encompassed within the Due Process Clause’s protection of property is a property owner’s right to repair a structure municipally deemed “unsafe” before that structure can be demolished. However, we are unaware of any court that has ever granted a property owner the fundamental right of an absolute repair option involving property that has fallen into such disrepair as to create a risk to the health and safety of the public. Indeed, that conclusion would hardly be compatible with the line of cases in which this Court and the United States Supreme Court have held that reasonableness is essential to the validity of an exercise of police power affecting the general rights of the land owner by restricting the character of the owner’s use, which would include the opportunity to repair unsafe structures. The right asserted by plaintiffs, then, cannot be <span title="1123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1123">p. 1123</span>considered fundamental. Therefore, to demonstrate a violation on substantive due process grounds, plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the unreasonable-to-repair presumption set forth in BCO §18-59 does not bear any reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.</p>
<p id="c5ec4a5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">BCO §18-59 was enacted pursuant to the City’s police powers, and its purpose is to abate a public nuisance by requiring repairs or demolition of unsafe structures. It is firmly established that nuisance abatement, as a means to promoting public health, safety, and welfare, is a legitimate exercise of police power<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10302_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10302_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span> and that demolition is a permissible method of achieving that end.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1030A_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1030A_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span> Certainly, then, there can be no dispute that the public interest that BCO §18-59 is intended to serve — protecting the health and welfare of the citizens of Brighton by eliminating the hazards posed by dangerous and unsafe structures — is a legitimate one. What is in dispute, however, is whether the unreasonable-to-repair presumption bears a reasonable relationship to that interest.</p>
<p id="c5ec4a60-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals found it did not. In the Court of Appeals’ view, to refuse a willing and able property owner the option to repair property that has been deemed unsafe because of the City’s view of the unreasonableness of the cost does no more to advance this permissible legislative objective than does allowing corrective repairs to be made in the first instance. In our view, however, if permitting demolition of unsafe structures (notwithstanding the willingness and financial ability of property owners to undertake corrective repairs) is not unconstitutional in itself, it does not become so simply because it is shown to be less desirable than some other action. While affording a property owner the opportunity to perform corrective repairs is one method by which the dangers posed by an unsafe structure may be remedied, it is by no means the only method — much less the only <i>constitutional</i> method — of doing so. As long as certain minimum standards have been met, and the ordinance does not encroach upon a property owner’s fundamental rights, the decision to exceed those standards by providing a property owner with an automatic right of repair, as some municipalities have chosen to do, is a policy judgment, not a constitutional mandate.</p>
<p id="c5ec7171-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, to satisfy substantive due process, the infringement of an interest that is less than fundamental, such as the right asserted here, requires no more than a reasonable relationship between the governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose. This standard allows a municipal body sufficient latitude to decide, as the City has, that certain considerations favor using one means, i.e., demolition, rather than another, i.e., repairing. Enacting an ordinance that presumes repairs will be unreasonable to undertake if the cost of those repairs exceeds 100 percent of the property’s value before it became unsafe protects children and others from the risk of increased injury, reduces the opportunity for crime, and aids in the maintenance of property values and marketability of lands. Any one of these purposes is reasonably related to the City’s interest in promoting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens <span title="1124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1124">p. 1124</span>and it is presumed that the City acted for such reasons, or for any other valid reason, in enacting BCO §18-59.</p>
<p id="c5ec7172-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without question, property owners have a constitutional right of property use, but this does not translate into an absolute constitutional right to repair unsafe structures. Moreover, even assuming that plaintiffs had a protected interest in repairing the unsafe structures at issue here before that property could be subject to demolition, BCO §18-59 is reasonably related to several governmental interests, and thus did not facially violate substantive due process. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ asserted private right of repair must yield to the City’s higher governmental interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.</p>
<p id="c5ec7173-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the unreasonable-to-repair presumption in BCO §18-59 can only be overcome upon a showing of economic reasonableness, i.e., that repair costs would not exceed “100 percent of the true cash value of the structure as reflected on the city assessment tax rolls prior to the building becoming an unsafe structure.” There is, however, no textual support for this interpretation because BCO §18-59 does not specify the manner in which the unreasonable-to-repair presumption may be overcome. A showing of reasonableness could therefore be established by presenting a viable repair plan; evidence from the challenger’s own experts that, contrary to the City’s estimates, the repair costs would not exceed 100 percent of the property value; or evidence that the structure subject to demolition has some sort of cultural, historical, familial, or artistic value. </p>
<p id="c5ec7174-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, even if the relationship between BCO §18-59 and the City’s interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare is debatable, we need more than a mere difference of opinion to establish a substantive due process violation, and plaintiffs have failed to make such a showing. Accordingly, the presumption of constitutionality favors the ordinance’s validity, and we may not second-guess the City’s policy judgment in enacting it.</p>
<p id="c5ec7175-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the burden necessary to invalidate BCO §18-59 on substantive due process grounds, it must be sustained.</p>
<p id="c5ec7176-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>C. Procedural Due Process</i></p>
<p id="c5ec7177-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn now from the claim that the City may not, by virtue of BCO §18-59, deprive plaintiffs of their asserted property interest without first affording them the opportunity to repair a structure deemed unsafe by the City, to plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim that the City may not order demolition on the basis of the procedures BCO §18-59 provides. Well established is the assurance that deprivation of a significant property interest cannot occur except by due process of law. While the meaning of the Due Process Clause and the extent to which due process must be afforded has been the subject of many disputes, there can be no question that, at a minimum, due process of law requires that deprivation of life, liberty, or property by adjudication must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10339_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10339_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">14</a></span> To comport with these <span title="1125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1125">p. 1125</span>procedural safeguards, the opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

<p id="c5ec717b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To determine whether BCO §18-59 provides property owners the process to which they are constitutionally entitled, we first review in some detail the procedures the City has employed through this ordinance. The City’s demolition process ordinarily begins with an inspection of a particular structure followed by a determination by the city manager, or some other agent designated by the City, that the structure is unsafe pursuant to any one or more of the ten factors delineated in BCO §18-46 and is, therefore, subject to demolition. This determination triggers BCO §18-59, which requires that the city manager, or the city manager’s designee, determine the cost to repair the structure and compare that cost to the structure’s true cash value as reflected in assessment tax rolls before the structure became unsafe. If the cost to repair exceeds the structure’s true cash value, then the structure is presumed to be a public nuisance subject to demolition. If not, the structure remains in its unsafe condition but may not, at this point, be subject to demolition. In either case, the city manager must then serve the structure’s owner with written notice pursuant to BCO §18-52. If the city manager has determined that the structure at issue can be made safe, the notice must identify the required repairs and improvements with which the property owner must comply within a reasonable time or face demolition. However, if, as in this case, the city manager determines that the structure cannot be made safe, the notice must indicate that demolition will ensue. Moreover, following either determination, the notice must inform the property owner of the right to appeal the city manager’s determination to the city council pursuant to BCO §18-61. Within ten calendar days of receipt of this notice, the property owner must notify the City of his or her intent to accept or reject the terms of the notice.</p>
<p id="c5ec717c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "> If the owner rejects the terms of the notice and submits a written appeal that “state[s] the basis for the appeal,” “[t]he owner or his agent shall have an opportunity to be heard by the city council at a regularly scheduled council meeting.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10359_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10359_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">16</a></span> The city council then has the discretion to “affirm, modify, or reverse all or part of the determination of the city manager, or his designee.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1035F_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1035F_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">17</a></span> If the owner receives an adverse final decision <span title="1126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1126">p. 1126</span>from the city council, the owner “may appeal th[at] decision to the county circuit court by filing a complaint within 20 calendar days from the date of the decision.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10369_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10369_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">18</a></span></p>
<p id="c5ec9890-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because this is a facial constitutional challenge, plaintiffs do not argue that the City failed to properly execute or enforce this procedural system. Instead, plaintiffs contend that the City’s procedural system results in an unconstitutional deprivation of a property interest absent due process of law because it fails to give the owner of an unsafe structure the procedural protection of a repair option before that property may be demolished. Because this argument is simply the substantive due process argument recast in procedural due process terms, the argument meets with the same fate.</p>
<p id="c5ec9891-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least as it pertains to this facial challenge, due process was satisfied by giving plaintiffs the right to an appeal before the city council and the opportunity to appeal that decision to the circuit court.</p>
<p id="c5ec9892-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essence of due process is the requirement that “a person in jeopardy of serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.” All that is necessary, then, is that the procedures at issue be tailored to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard to ensure that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case, which must generally occur before they are permanently deprived of the significant interest at stake. Here, there is no dispute that if the city manager orders a structure to be demolished under BCO §18-59, aggrieved parties, such as plaintiffs, have the right to appeal that determination to the city council under BCO §18-61. Although BCO §18-59 creates a presumption that an unsafe structure shall be demolished as a public nuisance if the cost to repair the structure would exceed 100 percent of the structure’s true cash value as reflected in the assessment tax rolls before the structure became unsafe, this presumption is rebuttable. To rebut this presumption and avoid demolition, the aggrieved party need only show that the repair is reasonable, a showing that may be achieved by economic or noneconomic means. It is then within the city council’s discretion to “affirm, modify, or reverse all or part of the determination of the city manager, or his designee.” When the city council decides, as it did here, to affirm the determination of the building official based on the evidence before it, that adverse ruling does not render an aggrieved party’s opportunity to be heard any less meaningful. To the contrary, it shows that the procedures in place are sufficient to provide property owners with notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p id="c5ec9893-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, vital to the assessment of what process is due in this case is the tenet that substantial weight must be given to the procedures provided for by those individuals holding legislative office — including members of a city council with whom the electorate has entrusted the duty of protecting the health and safety of all citizens — for “[i]t is too well settled to require citation that a statute must be treated with the deference due to a deliberate action of a coordinate branch of our State government. . . .”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1037E_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1037E_ceeadfb0-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">19</a></span> This is especially so where, as here, in addition to providing the aggrieved <span title="1127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1127">p. 1127</span>party with an effective process for asserting his or her claim before any demolition, the prescribed procedures also ensure the right to a hearing, as well as to subsequent judicial review, before the denial of the aggrieved party’s claim becomes final. For these reasons, we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a facial procedural due process violation where they received all the process to which they were constitutionally entitled. </p>

<p id="c5ec9897-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Deference.</b> Courts applying this means-ends, due process analysis are usually extremely deferential to the elected political branches. That deference makes substantive due process claims exceedingly difficult for property owners to win. Is the Michigan Supreme Court too deferential to the city in <i>Bonner</i>?  In assessing the reasonableness of the demolition statute, what reasons does the court identify? Do the reasons proffered by the court need to relate to the reasonableness of requiring demolition or the reasonableness of refusing to allow the owner to repair the premises?  From a due process point of view, is there any meaningful difference between those two state actions or would the same reasons that justify one necessarily justify the other?</p>
<p id="c5ec9898-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Defining “property” for the Constitution.</b> The text of the U.S. Constitution neither creates property interests nor defines what it means by “property.” When considering federal constitutional property claims, where do courts turn in order to give content to the concept of property? This definitional puzzle actually has two different dimensions. First, as a threshold matter, courts need to determine what sorts of interests qualify as “property” in order to define the reach of the Constitution’s property protections. If some valuable legal interest is not “property” for the purposes of the fifth amendment’s due process clause, for example, its deprivation by a governmental actor cannot violate the requirements of due process, at least as they relate to property (as opposed to “life” and “liberty”). <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board</i>, 527 U.S. 666, 673-674 (1999) (no due process violation where the interest affected by state action did not qualify as “property”). Similarly, if an interest is not “private property” for the purposes of the fifth amendment’s takings clause, its taking by the government for public use does not trigger the requirement of just compensation. <i>See Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment</i>, 477 U.S. 41, 55-56 (1986); <i>Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States</i>, 348 U.S. 272 (1955). <i>See</i> Chapter 15, §1.4.</p>
<p id="c5ec9899-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the interests that the Supreme Court considers when applying the due process and takings clauses are not themselves created by the Constitution, see<i> Board of Regents v. Roth</i>, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), the question of the reach of those provisions is one of federal constitutional law. <i>See Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales</i>, 545 U.S. 748 (2005). The Court has not always been attentive to this threshold “reach” question, and it has employed different ways of answering it in different cases. Generally speaking, the Court seems to apply a broader definition of property for due process claims than for takings claims.<i> See</i> Thomas W. Merrill, <i>The Landscape of Constitutional Property</i>, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 886-894 (2000).</p>
<p id="c5ec989a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1128" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1128">p. 1128</span>For due process claims, the Court has rejected the position that “all civil rights of pecuniary value” count as “property.” <i>College Savings Bank</i>, 527 U.S. at 673-674. Nevertheless, the Court has embraced an extremely broad conception of “property” for due process purposes, particularly in procedural cases. As the Court put it in <i>Board of Regents v. Roth</i>, “the property interests protected by procedural due process extend well beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money.” 408 U.S. at 571. According to the Court, the “hallmark” of property protected by the due process clause is an entitlement that “cannot be removed except for cause.” <i>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.</i>, 455 U.S. 422, 430 (1982); <i>see also Town of Castle Rock</i>, 545 U.S. at 756 (“[A] benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.”). This means that, when considering due process claims, courts have treated as “property” a great many interests that would not be treated as such in other legal contexts. These include professional licenses, government benefits, and even certain forms of government employment. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>, 419 U.S. 565 (1975) (treating the right to a public education as property for procedural due process purposes); <i>Perry v. Sindermann</i>, 408 U.S. 593, 599-600 (1972) (treating an informal tenure arrangement at a junior college as a property interest for due process purposes); <i>Goldberg v. Kelly</i>, 397 U.S. 254 (1970) (welfare benefits treated as property for procedural due process purposes); <i>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of State of New Mexico</i>, 353 U.S. 232 (1957) (law license is property for due process purposes); <i>see also</i> Merrill, <i>supra</i>, at 956-957.</p>
<p id="c5ec989b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the takings context, on the other hand, the Court has tended to draw the circle more narrowly. <i>See</i> Merrill, <i>supra</i>, at 957. In <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), for example, five members of the Court agreed that the “private property” protected by the takings clause was a narrower category than “property” for due process purposes. While due process “property” includes general obligations to pay money, the five Justices reasoned, to count as “private property” for takings purposes, the interest in question must constitute a discrete thing, or what Justice Kennedy called in his concurring opinion a “specific property interest,” such as money contained in a specific bank account. <i>Id.</i> at 540-542 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>
<p id="c5ec989c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second dimension of the definitional problem arises when courts need to actually apply federal constitutional standards to the specific legal interests created by state or federal law. In order to apply constitutional property norms, courts need to ascertain the precise content of an owner’s legal rights. For example, in determining whether some state restriction of an owner’s land use has “taken” the owner’s property for public use without just compensation, a court needs to know whether the owner had the right to engage in the restricted use to begin with. In carrying out this task, courts turn to the body of law from which the property interest arises, whether that be state property law or federal statute. <i>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.</i>, 467 U.S. 986, 1001 (1984).</p>

The bulk of the parcel was zoned for industrial uses, but one vacant part of <span title="1129" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1129">p. 1129</span>the parcel was limited to residential use. Although the vacant part was 100 feet wide, the master who heard the case found that the city might widen the street in such a manner as to reduce the depth of that lot to 65 feet and that as a result, “no practical use can be made of the land in question for residential purposes, because . . . there would not be adequate return on the amount of any investment for the development of the property.” The Supreme Court held that the statute, as applied to this portion of the land, impermissibly infringed on constitutionally protected property rights. The Court explained its result, <i>id.</i> at 187-189:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5ec989e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The last finding of the master is: “I am satisfied that the districting of the plaintiff’s land in a residence district would not promote the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of that part of the defendant city, taking into account the natural development thereof and the character of the district and the resulting benefit to accrue to the whole city and I so find.”</p>
<p id="c5ec989f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is made pretty clear that because of the industrial and railroad purposes to which the immediately adjoining lands to the south and east have been devoted and for which they are zoned, the locus is of comparatively little value for the limited uses permitted by the ordinance.</p>
<p id="c5ec98a0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We quite agree with the opinion expressed below that a court should not set aside the determination of public officers in such a matter unless it is clear that their action “has no foundation in reason and is a mere arbitrary or irrational exercise of power having no substantial relation to the public health, the public morals, the public safety or the public welfare in its proper sense.” <i>Euclid v. Ambler Co.</i>, [272 U.S.] at 395.</p>
<p id="c5ec98a1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An inspection of a plat of the city upon which the zoning districts are outlined, taken in connection with the master’s findings, shows with reasonable certainty that the inclusion of the locus in question is not indispensable to the general plan. The boundary line of the residential district before reaching the locus runs for some distance along the streets, and to exclude the locus from the residential district requires only that such line shall be continued 100 feet further along Henry street and thence south along Brookline street. There does not appear to be any reason why this should not be done. Nevertheless, if that were all, we should not be warranted in substituting our judgment for that of the zoning authorities primarily charged with the duty and responsibility of determining the question. But that is not all. The governmental power to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of the land owner by restricting the character of his use, is not unlimited, and, other questions aside, such restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Here, the express finding of the master, already quoted, confirmed by the court below, is that the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the part of the city affected will not be promoted by the disposition made by the ordinance of the locus in question. This finding of the master, after a hearing and an inspection of the entire area affected, supported, as we think it is, by other findings of fact, is determinative of the case. That the invasion of the property of plaintiff in error was serious and highly injurious is clearly established; and, since a necessary basis for the support of that invasion is wanting, the action of the zoning authorities comes within the ban of the Fourteenth Amendment and cannot be sustained.</p>

<p id="c5ec98a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court had just two years earlier upheld comprehensive zoning in <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926) against a facial attack on the <span title="1130" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1130">p. 1130</span>statute, but left open the possibility that it might revisit that judgment in an as-applied challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 395 (noting that “when, if ever, the provisions set forth in the ordinance in tedious and minute detail, come to be concretely applied to particular premises . . . or to particular conditions, or to be considered in connection with specific complaints, some of them, or even many of them, may be found to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable”). <i>See</i> Chapter 7, §1.2. Since <i>Nectow</i>, however, the Supreme Court has not found any zoning ordinances to violate substantive due process on grounds of irrationality, leaving the policing of constitutional due process in zoning primarily to the state courts.</p>
<p id="c5ecbeb3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Vagueness.</b> Due process is also implicated in zoning statutes that are unconstitutionally vague. In <i>Cunney v. Board of Trustees of Village of Grand View, New York</i>, 660 F.3d 612 (2d Cir. 2011), an owner of a parcel situated between the Hudson River and a street called River Road had applied for permits to improve his house. In order to preserve views of the river, the Village’s zoning ordinance limited the height of buildings that abutted River Road to no more than “four and one-half (4½) feet above the easterly side of River Road.” The owner obtained the requisite permits for his project based on height measurements that appeared to conform to this provision. However, the Village denied a certificate of occupancy after construction based on a report from the Village engineer, who took measurements that seemed to indicate that the height restriction had been violated. The property was on a slope running along River Road and throughout the permitting and approval process, it had been unclear where exactly on that slope compliance with the ordinance should be measured. The Second Circuit held that the statute violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because it failed to give the owner “a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,” <i>id.</i> at 621 (quoting <i>Hill v. Colorado</i>, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000)), and because the statute failed to provide explicit standards for the officials charged with applying it, <i>id.</i> at 622. For a discussion of vagueness in the context of aesthetic zoning, see Chapter 7, §6.1.</p>
<p id="c5ecbeb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Michigan Supreme Court in <i>Bonner</i> observed that the demolition ordinance in that case “does not specify the manner in which the unreasonable-to-repair presumption may be overcome.”  That is, the ordinance offers no standards to guide or constrain decisions by the city council about whether to override the rebuttable presumption against allowing owners to repair structures where the costs of doing so would exceed the structure’s market value.  If, in a future case, the city council were to refuse to override the presumption, would its action necessarily be arbitrary?  How might the city council blunt the charge of arbitrariness?  Is the lack of a standard relevant to the Bonners’ facial challenge or only to a future, as-applied challenge?  <i>See Kosalka v. Town of Georgetown</i>, 752 A.2d 183 (Me. 2000) (striking down a zoning ordinance as impermissibly vague because it “fails to furnish a guide which will enable those to whom the law is to be applied to reasonably determine their rights”). </p>

Retroactivity.</b> Whenever property rules change, lawmakers must confront the question whether to apply the new rule to property interests created prior to the change. The potential for new rules to unsettle (or even destroy) existing property <span title="1131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1131">p. 1131</span>rights raises potential constitutional concerns. Under the due process clause, courts evaluate the retroactive application of a new property rule according to due process standards that assess whether the state’s application of the new rule to existing property entitlements is itself rationally related to a permissible government purpose. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>American Express Travel Related Services, Inc. v. Sidamon-Eristoff</i>, 669 F.3d 359 (3d Cir. 2012) (retroactive application of shortened period for unclaimed property statute to existing travelers checks did not violate due process because it had a conceivable rational basis). But, while the substance of the inquiry concerning the fundamental fairness of retroactivity remains the same as due process analysis in other contexts, judges considering retroactivity questions sometimes seem to apply a more exacting scrutiny. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</i>, 524 U.S. 498, 547 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). <i>But see id.</i> at 557 (“[A] law that is fundamentally unfair because of its retroactivity is a law that is basically arbitrary [in violation of the usual Due Process principles].”) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Can you think of a situation in which the retroactive application of an otherwise valid new property rule would not pass muster under a rational basis, due process review?</p>

<p id="c5ecbeb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>City of Wilmington v. Hill,</i> 657 S.E.2d 670 (N.C. Ct. App. 2008), the court held unconstitutional a city ordinance that prohibited owners from renting their property and effectively required owners to occupy their own homes. The owner had constructed a garage apartment, and the city interpreted the zoning law to require the owner to reside either in the main residence or in the garage apartment. The court held that the zoning enabling act did not delegate power to the city to pass such a law because it allowed municipalities to regulate the “use” of property, not their ownership or the identity of the possessor. The court then noted that the due process clause requires laws to have a “substantial relation to the public health, the public morals, the public safety or the public welfare” and that courts should defer to legislatures in debatable cases. <i>Id.</i> at 673. Suppose the court had held that a requirement that owners occupy their homes serves no legitimate public purpose and thus is invalid under the due process clause.

<p id="c5ece5d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Belle Terre is a village on Long Island’s north shore of about 220 homes inhabited by 700 people. Its total land area is less than one square mile. It has restricted land use to one-family dwellings excluding lodging houses, boarding houses, fraternity houses, or multiple-dwelling houses. The word “family” as used in the ordinance means, “[o]ne or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit, exclusive of household servants. A number of persons but not exceeding two (2) living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit though not related by blood, adoption, or marriage shall be deemed to constitute a family.”</p>
<p id="c5ece5d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellees, the Dickmans, are owners of a house in the village and leased it in December 1971 for a term of 18 months to Michael Truman. Later Bruce Boraas became a colessee. Then Anne Parish moved into the house along with three others. These six are students at nearby State University at Stony Brook and none is related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage. When the village served the Dickmans with an “Order to Remedy Violations” of the ordinance, the owners plus three tenants thereupon brought this action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for an injunction and a judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case brings to this Court a different phase of local zoning regulations from those we have previously reviewed. <i>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co</i>., 272 U.S. 365 (1926), involved a zoning ordinance classifying land use in a given area into six categories.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The main thrust of <i>Euclid</i> in the mind of the Court was in the exclusion of industries and apartments, and as respects that it commented on the desire to keep residential areas free of “disturbing noises”; “increased traffic”; the hazard of “moving and parked automobiles”; the “depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities.” The ordinance was sanctioned because the validity of the legislative classification was “fairly debatable” and therefore could not be said to be wholly arbitrary.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the ordinance segregated one area only for one race, it would immediately be suspect under the reasoning of <i>Buchanan v. Warley</i>, 245 U.S. 60 (1917), where the Court invalidated a city ordinance barring a black from acquiring real property in a white residential area by reason of an 1866 Act of Congress, 42 U.S.C. §1982, and an 1870 Act, §17, now 42 U.S.C. §1981, both enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present ordinance is challenged on several grounds: that it interferes with a person’s right to travel; that it interferes with the right to migrate to and settle within a State; that it bars people who are uncongenial to the present residents; that it expresses the social preferences of the residents for groups that will be congenial to them; that social homogeneity is not a legitimate interest of government; that the restriction of those whom the neighbors do not like trenches on the newcomers’ rights of privacy; that it is of no rightful concern to villagers whether the residents are married or unmarried; that the ordinance is antithetical to the Nation’s experience, ideology, and self-perception as an open, egalitarian, and integrated society.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1133">p. 1133</span>We find none of these reasons in the record before us. It is not aimed at transients. It involves no “fundamental” right guaranteed by the Constitution, such as voting, the right of association, the right of access to the courts, or any rights of privacy. We deal with economic and social legislation where legislatures have historically drawn lines which we respect against the charge of violation of the Equal Protection Clause if the law be “reasonable, not arbitrary” and bears “a rational relationship to a [permissible] state objective.”</p>
<p id="c5ece5d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said, however, that if two unmarried people can constitute a “family,” there is no reason why three or four may not. But every line drawn by a legislature leaves some out that might well have been included. That exercise of discretion, however, is a legislative, not a judicial, function.</p>
<p id="c5ece5d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is said that the Belle Terre ordinance reeks with an animosity to unmarried couples who live together. There is no evidence to support it; and the provision of the ordinance bringing within the definition of a “family” two unmarried people belies the charge.</p>
<p id="c5ece5da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ordinance places no ban on other forms of association, for a “family” may, so far as the ordinance is concerned, entertain whomever it likes.</p>
<p id="c5ece5db-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The regimes of boarding houses, fraternity houses, and the like present urban problems. More people occupy a given space; more cars rather continuously pass by; more cars are parked; noise travels with crowds.</p>
<p id="c5ece5dc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A quiet place where yards are wide, people few, and motor vehicles restricted are legitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to family needs. This goal is a permissible one. The police power is not confined to elimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is ample to lay out zones where family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.</p>
<p id="c5ece5dd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice T<span class="epub-small-caps">HURGOOD</span> M<span class="epub-small-caps">ARSHALL</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5ece5de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My disagreement with the Court today is based upon my view that the ordinance in this case unnecessarily burdens appellees’ First Amendment freedom of association and their constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy.</p>
<p id="c5ece5df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The freedom of association is often inextricably entwined with the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy. The right to “establish a home” is an essential part of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. And the Constitution secures to an individual a freedom “to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home.” <i>Stanley v. Georgia</i>, 394 U.S. 557, 565 (1969). Constitutionally protected privacy is, in Mr. Justice Brandeis’ words, “as against the Government, the right to be let alone . . . the right most valued by civilized man.” <i>Olmstead v. United States</i>, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (dissenting opinion). The choice of household companions — of whether a person’s “intellectual and emotional needs” are best met by living with family, friends, professional associates, or others — involves deeply personal considerations as to the kind and quality of intimate relationships within the home. That decision surely falls within the ambit of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution.</p>
<p id="c5ece5e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1134" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1134">p. 1134</span>The instant ordinance discriminates on the basis of just such a personal lifestyle choice as to household companions. It permits any number of persons related by blood or marriage, be it two or twenty, to live in a single household, but it limits to two the number of unrelated persons bound by profession, love, friendship, religious or political affiliation, or mere economics who can occupy a single home. Belle Terre imposes upon those who deviate from the community norm in their choice of living companions significantly greater restrictions than are applied to residential groups who are related by blood or marriage, and compose the established order within the community. The village has, in effect, acted to fence out those individuals whose choice of lifestyle differs from that of its current residents.</p>
<p id="c5ece5e1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because I believe that this zoning ordinance creates a classification which impinges upon fundamental personal rights, it can withstand constitutional scrutiny only upon a clear showing that the burden imposed is necessary to protect a compelling and substantial governmental interest.</p>
<p id="c5ece5e2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A variety of justifications have been proffered in support of the village’s ordinance. It is claimed that the ordinance controls population density, prevents noise, traffic and parking problems, and preserves the rent structure of the community and its attractiveness to families. [T]hese are all legitimate and substantial interests of government. But I think it clear that the means chosen to accomplish these purposes are both overinclusive and underinclusive, and that the asserted goals could be as effectively achieved by means of an ordinance that did not discriminate on the basis of constitutionally protected choices of lifestyle. The ordinance imposes no restriction whatsoever on the number of persons who may live in a house, as long as they are related by marital or sanguinary bonds — presumably no matter how distant their relationship. Nor does the ordinance restrict the number of income earners who may contribute to rent in such a household, or the number of automobiles that may be maintained by its occupants. In that sense the ordinance is underinclusive. On the other hand, the statute restricts the number of unrelated persons who may live in a home to no more than two. It would therefore prevent three unrelated people from occupying a dwelling even if among them they had but one income and no vehicles. While an extended family of a dozen or more might live in a small bungalow, three elderly and retired persons could not occupy the large manor house next door. Thus the statute is also grossly overinclusive to accomplish its intended purposes.</p>
<p id="c5ed0cf3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are some 220 residences in Belle Terre occupied by about 700 persons. The density is therefore just above three per household. The village is justifiably concerned with density of population and the related problems of noise, traffic, and the like. It could deal with those problems by limiting each household to a specified number of adults, two or three perhaps, without limitation on the number of dependent children. The burden of such an ordinance would fall equally upon all segments of the community. It would surely be better tailored to the goals asserted by the village than the ordinance before us today, for it would more realistically restrict population density and growth and their attendant environmental costs. Various other statutory mechanisms also suggest themselves as solutions to Belle Terre’s problems — rent control, limits on the number of vehicles per household, and so forth, but, of course, <span title="1135" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1135">p. 1135</span>such schemes are matters of legislative judgment and not for this Court. Appellants also refer to the necessity of maintaining the family character of the village. There is not a shred of evidence in the record indicating that if Belle Terre permitted a limited number of unrelated persons to live together, the residential, familial character of the community would be fundamentally affected.</p>
<p id="c5ed0cf4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By limiting unrelated households to two persons while placing no limitation on households of related individuals, the village has embarked upon its commendable course in a constitutionally faulty vessel. I would find the challenged ordinance unconstitutional. But I would not ask the village to abandon its goal of providing quiet streets, little traffic, and a pleasant and reasonably priced environment in which families might raise their children. Rather, I would commend the village to continue to pursue those purposes but by means of more carefully drawn and even-handed legislation.</p>

<p id="c5ed0d04-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant, Mrs. Inez Moore, lives in her East Cleveland home together with her son, Dale Moore Sr., and her two grandsons, Dale, Jr., and John Moore, Jr. The two boys are first cousins rather than brothers; we are told that John came to live with his grandmother and with the elder and younger Dale Moores after his mother’s death.</p>
<p id="c5ed3415-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In early 1973, Mrs. Moore received a notice of violation from the city, stating that John was an “illegal occupant” and directing her to comply with the ordinance. When she failed to remove him from her home, the city filed a criminal charge. Mrs. Moore moved to dismiss, claiming that the ordinance was constitutionally invalid on its face. Her motion was overruled, and upon conviction she was sentenced to five days in jail and a $25 fine. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed after giving full consideration to her constitutional claims, and the Ohio Supreme Court denied review. We noted probable jurisdiction of her appeal.</p>
<p id="c5ed3416-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c5ed3417-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The city argues that our decision in <i>Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas</i>, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), requires us to sustain the ordinance attacked here. But one overriding factor sets this case apart from <i>Belle Terre</i>. The ordinance there affected only unrelated individuals. It expressly allowed all who were related by “blood, adoption, or marriage” to live together, and in sustaining the ordinance we were careful to note that it promoted “family needs” and “family values.” East Cleveland, in contrast, has chosen to regulate the occupancy of its housing by slicing deeply into the family itself. This is no mere incidental result of the ordinance. On its face it selects certain categories of relatives who may live together and declares that others may not. In particular, it makes a crime of a grandmother’s choice to live with her grandson in circumstances like those presented here.</p>
<p id="c5ed3418-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a city undertakes such intrusive regulation of the family, neither <i>Belle Terre</i> nor <i>Euclid</i> [<i>v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926)], governs; the usual judicial deference to the legislature is inappropriate. The city seeks to justify [the ordinance] as a means of preventing overcrowding, minimizing traffic and parking congestion, and avoiding an undue financial burden on East Cleveland’s school system. Although these are legitimate goals, the ordinance before us serves them marginally, at best. For example, the ordinance permits any family consisting only of husband, wife, and unmarried children to live together, even if the family contains a half dozen licensed drivers, each with his or her own car. At the same time it forbids an adult brother and sister to share a household, even if both faithfully use public transportation. The ordinance would permit a grandmother to live with a single dependent son and children, even if his school-age children number a dozen, yet it forces Mrs. Moore to find another dwelling for her grandson John, simply because of the presence of his uncle and cousin in the same household. We need not labor the point. Section 1341.08 has but a tenuous relation to alleviation of the conditions mentioned by the city.</p>
<p id="c5ed3419-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation’s history <span title="1137" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1137">p. 1137</span>and tradition. It is through the family that we inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values, moral and cultural. Ours is by no means a tradition limited to respect for the bonds uniting the members of the nuclear family. The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially grandparents sharing a household along with parents and children has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition. Over the years millions of our citizens have grown up in just such an environment, and most, surely, have profited from it. Even if conditions of modern society have brought about a decline in extended family households, they have not erased the accumulated wisdom of civilization, gained over the centuries and honored throughout our history, that supports a larger conception of the family. Out of choice, necessity, or a sense of family responsibility, it has been common for close relatives to draw together and participate in the duties and the satisfactions of a common home. Especially in times of adversity, such as the death of a spouse or economic need, the broader family has tended to come together for mutual sustenance and to maintain or rebuild a secure home life. This is apparently what happened here.</p>
<p id="c5ed341a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not such a household is established because of personal tragedy, the choice of relatives in this degree kinship to live together may not lightly be denied by the State. [T]he Constitution prevents East Cleveland from standardizing its children and its adults by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns.</p>

<p id="c5ed341d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I write to underscore the cultural myopia of the arbitrary boundary drawn by the East Cleveland ordinance in the light of the tradition of the American home that has been a feature of our society since our beginning as a Nation the “tradition” in the plurality’s words, “of uncles, aunts, cousins, and especially grandparents sharing a household along with parents and children. . . .” The line drawn by this ordinance displays a depressing insensitivity toward the economic and emotional needs of a very large part of our society.</p>
<p id="c5ed341e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In today’s America, the “nuclear family” is the pattern so often found in much of white suburbia. J. Vander Zanden, <i>Sociology: A Systematic Approach</i> 322 (3d ed. 1975). The Constitution cannot be interpreted, however, to tolerate the imposition by government upon the rest of us of white suburbia’s preference in patterns of family living. The “extended family” that provided generations of early Americans with social services and economic and emotional support in times of hardship, and was the beachhead for successive waves of immigrants who populated our cities, remains not merely still a pervasive living pattern, but under the goad of brutal economic necessity, a prominent pattern virtually a means of survival for large numbers of the poor and deprived minorities of our society. For them compelled pooling of scant resources requires compelled sharing of a household.</p>
<p id="c5ed341f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “extended” form is especially familiar among black families. We may suppose that this reflects the truism that black citizens, like generations of white immigrants before them, have been victims of economic and other disadvantages that would worsen if they were compelled to abandon extended, for nuclear, living patterns. Even <span title="1138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1138">p. 1138</span>in husband and wife households, 13% of black families compared with 3% of white families include relatives under 18 years old, in addition to the couple’s own children. In black households whose head is an elderly woman, as in this case, the contrast is even more striking: 48% of such black households, compared with 10% of counterpart white households, include related minor children not offspring of the head of the household.</p>
<p id="c5ed3420-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not wish to be understood as implying that East Cleveland’s enforcement of its ordinance is motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose: The record of this case would not support that implication. But the prominence of other than nuclear families among ethnic and racial minority groups, including our black citizens, surely demonstrates that the “extended family” pattern remains a vital tenet of our society. It suffices that in prohibiting this pattern of family living as a means of achieving its objectives, appellee city has chosen a device that deeply intrudes into family associational rights that historically have been central, and today remain central, to a large proportion of our population.</p>
<p id="c5ed3421-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice J<span class="epub-small-caps">OHN</span> P<span class="epub-small-caps">AUL</span> S<span class="epub-small-caps">TEVENS</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="c5ed3422-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my judgment the critical question presented by this case is whether East Cleveland’s housing ordinance is a permissible restriction on appellant’s right to use her own property as she sees fit. Long before the original States adopted the Constitution, the common law protected an owner’s right to decide how best to use his own property. The holding in <i>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365 (1926), that a city could use its police power, not just to abate a specific use of property which proved offensive, but also to create and implement a comprehensive plan for the use of land in the community, vastly diminished the rights of individual property owners. It did not, however, totally extinguish those rights. On the contrary, that case expressly recognized that the broad zoning power must be exercised within constitutional limits.</p>
<p id="c5ed3423-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Litigation involving single-family zoning ordinances is common. These cases delineate the extent to which the state courts have allowed zoning ordinances to interfere with the right of a property owner to determine the internal composition of his household. The intrusion on that basic property right has not previously gone beyond the point where the ordinance defines a family to include only persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Indeed, state courts have not always allowed the intrusion to penetrate that far. There appears to be no precedent for an ordinance which excludes any of an owner’s relatives from the group of persons who may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.</p>
<p id="c5ed3424-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Chief Justice B<span class="epub-small-caps">URGER</span>, in dissent, would not have reached the constitutional issue on the argument that appellant could have, but did not, apply for a variance under the ordinance, a proposition the majority rejected.]</p>

<p id="c5ed3426-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my view, the appellant’s claim that the ordinance in question invades constitutionally protected rights of association and privacy is in large part answered by the <i>Belle Terre</i> decision. To suggest that the biological fact of common ancestry necessarily <span title="1139" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1139">p. 1139</span>gives related persons constitutional rights of association superior to those of unrelated persons is to misunderstand the nature of the associational freedoms that the Constitution has been understood to protect. Freedom of association has been constitutionally recognized because it is often indispensable to effectuation of explicit First Amendment guarantees. But the scope of the associational right, until now, at least, has been limited to the constitutional need that created it; obviously not every “association” is for First Amendment purposes or serves to promote the ideological freedom that the First Amendment was designed to protect. The “association” in this case is not for any purpose relating to the promotion of speech, assembly, the press, or religion. And wherever the outer boundaries of constitutional protection of freedom of association may eventually turn out to be, they surely do not extend to those who assert no interest other than the gratification, convenience, and economy of sharing the same residence.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b37-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]ppellant contends that the importance of the “extended family” in American society requires us to hold that her decision to share her residence with her grandsons may not be interfered with by the State. This decision, like the decisions involved in bearing and raising children, is said to be an aspect of “family life” also entitled to substantive protection under the Constitution. Without pausing to inquire how far under this argument an “extended family” might extend, I cannot agree. When the Court has found that the Fourteenth Amendment placed a substantive limitation on a State’s power to regulate, it has been in those rare cases in which the personal interests at issue have been deemed “ ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’ ” <i>See Roe v. Wade</i>, 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973), quoting <i>Palko v. Connecticut</i>, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937). The interest that the appellant may have in permanently sharing a single kitchen and a suite of contiguous rooms with some of her relatives simply does not rise to that level.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b38-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice B<span class="epub-small-caps">YRON</span> W<span class="epub-small-caps">HITE</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b39-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Moore’s interest in having the offspring of more than one dependent son live with her qualifies as a liberty protected by the Due Process Clause; but, because of the nature of that particular interest, the demands of the Clause are satisfied once the Court is assured that the challenged proscription is the product of a duly enacted or promulgated statute, ordinance, or regulation and that it is not wholly lacking in purpose or utility. That under this ordinance any number of unmarried children may reside with their mother and that this number might be as destructive of neighborhood values as one or more additional grandchildren is just another argument that children and grandchildren may not constitutionally be distinguished by a local zoning ordinance.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b3a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That argument remains unpersuasive to me. Here the head of the household may house himself or herself and spouse, their parents, and any number of their unmarried children. A fourth generation may be represented by only one set of grandchildren and then only if born to a dependent child. The ordinance challenged by appellant prevents her from living with both sets of grandchildren only in East Cleveland, an area with a radius of three miles and a population of 40,000. The ordinance thus denies appellant the opportunity to live with all her grandchildren in this particular suburb; <span title="1140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1140">p. 1140</span>she is free to do so in other parts of the Cleveland metropolitan area. If there is power to maintain the character of a single-family neighborhood, as there surely is, some limit must be placed on the reach of the “family.” Had it been our task to legislate, we might have approached the problem in a different manner than did the drafters of this ordinance; but I have no trouble in concluding that the normal goals of zoning regulation are present here and that the ordinance serves these goals by limiting, in identifiable circumstances, the number of people who can occupy a single household. The ordinance does not violate the Due Process Clause.</p>

<p id="c5ed5b3f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2010, 41 percent of children were born to unmarried parents. Joyce A. Martin et al., <i>Births: Final Data for 2010</i>, 61 Natl. Vital Stats. Rep. 1, 8 (2012). Does that suggest that the constitutionality of zoning that restricts who may live in certain neighborhoods to people related by blood, marriage, or adoption (as many such ordinances hold) should be evaluated solely or even primarily through a prism of “tradition”?</p>
<p id="c5ed5b40-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. State constitutional protection of nontraditional families.</b> Many state courts accept the reasoning of <i>Belle Terre</i> and interpret their constitutions as lacking protection for nontraditional family access to real property. <i>See, e.g., McMaster v. Columbia Board of Zoning Appeals</i>, 719 S.E.2d 660 (S.C. 2011); <i>Ames Rental Property Association v. City of Ames</i>, 736 N.W.2d 255 (Iowa 2007).</p>
<p id="c5ed5b41-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A minority of state courts, however, have held that their state constitutions provide <i>greater</i> protection for nontraditional family access to real property than the federal constitution, as construed by the Supreme Court in <i>Belle Terre</i>. For example, <i>Charter Township of Delta v. Dinolfo</i>, 351 N.W.2d 831 (Mich. 1984), involved a challenge to a single-family ordinance that limited single-family residences to two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption, and not more than one other unrelated person. Members of The Work of Christ Community had formed two “families” that each included not only a husband, wife, and children, but also six unrelated adults. Acknowledging that <i>Belle Terre</i> had affirmed the constitutionality of a nearly identical ordinance, the Michigan Supreme Court nonetheless held that the ordinance violated the due process clause of the Michigan constitution:</p>

<p id="c5ed5b42-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff lists the objectives of this ordinance: preservation of traditional family values, maintenance of property values and population and density control. We cannot disagree that those are not only rational but laudable goals. Where the difficulty arises, however, is when plaintiff attempts to convince us that the classification at <span title="1141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1141">p. 1141</span>hand — limiting to two the number of unrelated persons who may occupy a residential dwelling together or with a biological family — is reasonably related to the achievement of those goals. It is precisely this rational relationship between the means used to achieve the legislative goals that must exist in order for this deprivation of the defendants’ use of their property to pass the due process test.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, plaintiff attempts to have us accept its assumption that different and undesirable behavior can be expected from a functional family. Yet, we have been given not a single argument in support of such an assumption, only the assumption. Defendants, on the other hand, relying on decisions from other jurisdictions construing their own state constitutions, present a compelling argument that the means are not rationally related to the end sought.</p>
<p id="c5ed5b44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those states that have rejected <i>Belle Terre</i> have stressed that a line drawn near the limit of the traditional family is both over- and under-inclusive. Unrelated persons are artificially limited to as few as two, while related families may expand without limit. Under the instant ordinance, twenty male cousins could live together, motorcycles, noise, and all, while three unrelated clerics could not. A greater example of over- and under-inclusiveness we cannot imagine. The ordinance indiscriminately regulates where no regulation is needed and fails to regulate where regulation is most needed.</p>

<p id="c5ed8261-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice W<span class="epub-small-caps">ILLIAM</span> R<span class="epub-small-caps">EHNQUIST</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="c5ed8262-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner was a joint owner, with her husband, of an automobile in which her husband engaged in sexual activity with a prostitute. A Michigan court ordered the automobile forfeited as a public nuisance, with no offset for her interest, notwithstanding her lack of knowledge of her husband’s activity. We hold that the Michigan court order did not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5ed8263-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Detroit police arrested John Bennis after observing him engaged in a sexual act with a prostitute in the automobile while it was parked on a Detroit city street. Bennis was convicted of gross indecency. The State then sued both Bennis and his wife, petitioner Tina B. Bennis, to have the car declared a public nuisance and abated as such under §§600.3801 and 600.3825 of Michigan’s Compiled Laws.</p>
<p id="c5ed8264-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner defended against the abatement of her interest in the car on the ground that, when she entrusted her husband to use the car, she did not know that he would use it to violate Michigan’s indecency law. The Wayne County Circuit Court rejected this argument, declared the car a public nuisance, and ordered the car’s abatement. In reaching this disposition, the trial court judge recognized the remedial discretion he had under Michigan’s case law. He took into account the couple’s ownership of “another automobile,” so they would not be left “without transportation.” He also mentioned his authority to order the payment of one-half of the sale proceeds, after the deduction of costs, to “the innocent co-title holder.” He declined to order such a division of sale proceeds in this case because of the age and value of the car (an 11-year-old Pontiac sedan recently purchased by John and Tina Bennis for $600); he commented in this regard: “[T]here’s practically nothing left minus costs in a situation such as this.”</p>
<p id="c5ed8265-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The gravamen of petitioner’s due process claim is . . . [that she] was entitled to contest the abatement by showing she did not know her husband would use it to violate Michigan’s indecency law. But a long and unbroken line of cases holds that an owner’s interest in property may be forfeited by reason of the use to which the property is put even though the owner did not know that it was to be put to such use.</p>
<p id="c5ed8266-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our earliest opinion to this effect is Justice Story’s opinion for the Court in <i>The Palmyra</i>, 12 Wheat. 1, 6 L. Ed. 531 (1827). The Palmyra, which had been commissioned as a privateer by the King of Spain and had attacked a United States vessel, was captured by a United States war ship and brought into Charleston, South Carolina, for adjudication. On the Government’s appeal from the Circuit Court’s acquittal of the vessel, it <span title="1143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1143">p. 1143</span>was contended by the owner that the vessel could not be forfeited until he was convicted for the privateering. The Court rejected this contention, explaining: “The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing.” <i>Id.</i>, at 14.</p>
<p id="c5ed8267-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Van Oster v. Kansas</i>, 272 U.S. 465 (1926), this Court upheld the forfeiture of a purchaser’s interest in a car misused by the seller. Van Oster purchased an automobile from a dealer but agreed that the dealer might retain possession for use in its business. The dealer allowed an associate to use the automobile, and the associate used it for the illegal transportation of intoxicating liquor. The State brought a forfeiture action pursuant to a Kansas statute, and Van Oster defended on the ground that the transportation of the liquor in the car was without her knowledge or authority. This Court rejected Van Oster’s claim:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5eda978-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not unknown or indeed uncommon for the law to visit upon the owner of property the unpleasant consequences of the unauthorized action of one to whom he has entrusted it. . . .  [C]ertain uses of property may be regarded as so undesirable that the owner surrenders his control at his peril.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5eda979-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Id.</i>, at 467-468.</p>
<p id="c5eda97a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding this well-established authority rejecting the innocent-owner defense, petitioner argues that we should in effect overrule it by importing a culpability requirement from cases having at best a tangential relation to the “innocent owner” doctrine in forfeiture cases. She cites <i>Foucha v. Louisiana</i>, 504 U.S. 71 (1992), for the proposition that a criminal defendant may not be punished for a crime if he is found to be not guilty. She also argues that our holding in <i>Austin v. United States</i>, 509 U.S. 602 (1993), that the Excessive Fines Clause limits the scope of civil forfeiture judgments, “would be difficult to reconcile with any rule allowing truly innocent persons to be punished by civil forfeiture.”</p>
<p id="c5eda97b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Austin</i>, the Court held that because “forfeiture serves, at least in part, to punish the owner,” forfeiture proceedings are subject to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against excessive fines. 509 U.S. at 618. In this case, Michigan’s Supreme Court emphasized with respect to the forfeiture proceeding at issue: “It is not contested that this is an equitable action,” in which the trial judge has discretion to consider “alternatives [to] abating the entire interest in the vehicle.” [527 N.W.2d 483, 495 (Mich. 1994).]</p>
<p id="c5eda97c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, forfeiture also serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose. Forfeiture of property prevents illegal uses “both by preventing further illicit use of the [property] and by imposing an economic penalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable.” <i>Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co.</i>, 416 U.S. 663, 687 (1974). This deterrent mechanism is hardly unique to forfeiture. For instance, because Michigan also deters dangerous driving by making a motor vehicle owner liable for the negligent operation of the vehicle by a driver who had the owner’s consent to use it, petitioner was also potentially liable for her husband’s use of the car in violation of Michigan negligence law. Mich. Comp. Laws §257.401 (1990). “The law thus builds a secondary defense against a forbidden use and precludes evasions by dispensing <span title="1144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1144">p. 1144</span>with the necessity of judicial inquiry as to collusion between the wrongdoer and the alleged innocent owner.” <i>Van Oster</i>, 272 U.S., at 467-468.</p>
<p id="c5eda97d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner also claims that the forfeiture in this case was a taking of private property for public use in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. But if the forfeiture proceeding here in question did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, the property in the automobile was transferred by virtue of that proceeding from petitioner to the State. The government may not be required to compensate an owner for property which it has already lawfully acquired under the exercise of governmental authority other than the power of eminent domain. <i>United States v. Fuller</i>, 409 U.S. 488, 492 (1973).</p>
<p id="c5eda97e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At bottom, petitioner’s claims depend on an argument that the Michigan forfeiture statute is unfair because it relieves prosecutors from the burden of separating co-owners who are complicit in the wrongful use of property from innocent co-owners. This argument, in the abstract, has considerable appeal. Its force is reduced in the instant case, however, by the Michigan Supreme Court’s confirmation of the trial court’s remedial discretion, and petitioner’s recognition that Michigan may forfeit her and her husband’s car whether or not she is entitled to an offset for her interest in it.</p>
<p id="c5eda97f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude today, as we concluded 75 years ago, that the cases authorizing actions of the kind at issue are “too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced.” The State here sought to deter illegal activity that contributes to neighborhood deterioration and unsafe streets. The Bennis automobile, it is conceded, facilitated and was used in criminal activity. Both the trial court and the Michigan Supreme Court followed our longstanding practice, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan is therefore affirmed.</p>
<p id="c5eda980-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice C<span class="epub-small-caps">LARENCE</span> T<span class="epub-small-caps">HOMAS</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="c5eda981-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Court notes, evasion of the normal requirement of proof before punishment might well seem “unfair.” One unaware of the history of forfeiture laws and 200 years of this Court’s precedent regarding such laws might well assume that such a scheme is lawless — a violation of due process.</p>
<p id="c5eda982-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is ultimately a reminder that the Federal Constitution does not prohibit everything that is intensely undesirable. As detailed in the Court’s opinion and the cases cited therein, forfeiture of property without proof of the owner’s wrongdoing, merely because it was “used” in or was an “instrumentality” of crime has been permitted in England and this country, both before and after the adoption of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p id="c5eda983-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Improperly used, forfeiture could become more like a roulette wheel employed to raise revenue from innocent but hapless owners whose property is unforeseeably misused, or a tool wielded to punish those who associate with criminals, than a component of a system of justice. When the property sought to be forfeited has been entrusted by its owner to one who uses it for crime, however, the Constitution apparently assigns to the States and to the political branches of the Federal Government the primary responsibility for avoiding that result.</p>
<p id="c5eda984-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="1145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1145">p. 1145</span>Justice R<span class="epub-small-caps">UTH</span> B<span class="epub-small-caps">ADER</span> G<span class="epub-small-caps">INSBURG</span>, concurring.</p>
<p id="c5eda985-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it bears emphasis that the car in question belonged to John Bennis as much as it did to Tina Bennis. At all times he had her consent to use the car, just as she had his. And it is uncontested that Michigan may forfeit the vehicle itself. The sole question, then, is whether Tina Bennis is entitled not to the car, but to a portion of the proceeds (if any there be after deduction of police, prosecutorial, and court costs) as a matter of constitutional right.</p>
<p id="c5eda986-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, it was “critical” to the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court that the nuisance abatement proceeding is an “equitable action.” That means the State’s Supreme Court stands ready to police exorbitant applications of the statute. It shows no respect for Michigan’s high court to attribute to its members tolerance of, or insensitivity to, inequitable administration of an “equitable action.”</p>
<p id="c5eda987-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nor is it fair to charge the trial court with “blatant unfairness” in the case at hand. That court declined to order a division of sale proceeds, as the trial judge took pains to explain, for two practical reasons: the Bennises have “another automobile,” and the age and value of the forfeited car (an 11-year-old Pontiac purchased by John and Tina Bennis for $600) left “practically nothing” to divide after subtraction of costs.</p>
<p id="c5eda988-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Michigan, in short, has not embarked on an experiment to punish innocent third parties. Nor do we condone any such experiment. Michigan has decided to deter Johns from using cars they own (or co-own) to contribute to neighborhood blight, and that abatement endeavor hardly warrants this Court’s disapprobation.</p>
<p id="c5eda989-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice J<span class="epub-small-caps">OHN</span> P<span class="epub-small-caps">AUL</span> S<span class="epub-small-caps">TEVENS</span>, with whom Justice S<span class="epub-small-caps">OUTER</span> and Justice B<span class="epub-small-caps">REYER</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5eda98a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would reverse because petitioner is entirely without responsibility for [her husband’s] act. Fundamental fairness prohibits the punishment of innocent people.</p>
<p id="c5eda98b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In other contexts, we have regarded as axiomatic that persons cannot be punished when they have done no wrong. I would hold now what we have always assumed: that the principle is required by due process.</p>
<p id="c5eda98c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unique facts of this case demonstrate that petitioner is entitled to the protection of that rule. Without knowledge that he would commit such an act in the family car, or that he had ever done so previously, surely petitioner cannot be accused of failing to take “reasonable steps” to prevent the illicit behavior. She is just as blameless as if a thief, rather than her husband, had used the car in a criminal episode.</p>
<p id="c5eda98d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Forfeiture of an innocent owner’s property that plays a central role in a criminal enterprise may be justified on reasoning comparable to the basis for imposing liability on a principal for an agent’s torts. Just as the risk of <i>respondeat superior</i> liability encourages employers to supervise more closely their employees’ conduct, so the risk of forfeiture encourages owners to exercise care in entrusting their property to others. But the law of agency recognizes limits on the imposition of vicarious liability in situations where no deterrent function is likely to be served; for example, it exonerates the employer when the agent strays from his intended mission and embarks on a “frolic of his own.” In this case, petitioner did not “entrust” the car to her husband on the night in question; he was entitled to use it by virtue of their joint ownership. There is no <span title="1146" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1146">p. 1146</span>reason to think that the threat of forfeiture will deter an individual from buying a car with her husband — or from marrying him in the first place — if she neither knows nor has reason to know that he plans to use it wrongfully.</p>
<p id="c5eda98e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The absence of any deterrent value reinforces the punitive nature of this forfeiture law. But petitioner has done nothing that warrants punishment. She cannot be accused of negligence or of any other dereliction in allowing her husband to use the car for the wholly legitimate purpose of transporting himself to and from his job. She affirmatively alleged and proved that she is not in any way responsible for the conduct that gave rise to the seizure. If anything, she was a victim of that conduct. In my opinion, these facts establish that the seizure constituted an arbitrary deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>

<p id="c5eda990-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The forfeiture of vessels pursuant to the admiralty and maritime law has a long, well-recognized tradition, evolving as it did from the necessity of finding some source of compensation for injuries done by a vessel whose responsible owners were often half a world away and beyond the practical reach of the law and its processes. The prospect of deriving prompt compensation from <i>in rem</i> forfeiture, and the impracticality of adjudicating the innocence of the owners or their good-faith efforts in finding a diligent and trustworthy master, combined to eliminate the owner’s lack of culpability as a defense.</p>
<p id="c5eda991-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This forfeiture cannot meet the requirements of due process. Nothing in the rationale of the Michigan Supreme Court indicates that the forfeiture turned on the negligence or complicity of petitioner, or a presumption thereof, and nothing supports the suggestion that the value of her co-ownership is so insignificant as to be beneath the law’s protection.</p>
<p id="c5edd0a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, and with all respect, I dissent.</p>

East Cleveland</i>, 431 U.S. 494 (1977), involved the role of tradition in defining the scope of constitutional rights. <i>See</i> §3.2<i>,</i> above. What role does tradition play in the majority and dissents in <i>Bennis</i>?</p>
<p id="c5edd0a6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Public nuisance, seizure of property, and crime control.</b> In recent years, local governments have used public nuisance ordinances to abate a wide variety of activities related to crime, including ordinances that even declare certain gang-related activities to be a public nuisance.<i> See People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna</i>, 929 P.2d 596, 608, 615 (Cal. 1997) (upholding injunction against gang members “[s]tanding, sitting, walking, driving, gathering, or appearing anywhere in public view . . . with any other known [fellow gang] member”). The practice of civil forfeiture of property connected to alleged criminal activity has grown steadily in recent decades, with proceeds collected by the Justice Department increasing from $27 million in 1985 to nearly $4.2 billion in 2012. <i>See</i> Sarah Stillman, <i>Taken</i>, The New Yorker, Aug. 12, 2013. Advocates <span title="1147" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1147">p. 1147</span>have raised concerns that civil forfeiture, particularly by cash-strapped local governments, is rife with abuse and that it is difficult for parties whose property is seized by the police to challenge those seizures because the costs of doing so often outstrip the value of the property. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5edd0a7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Keshbro, Inc. v. City of Miami</i>, 801 So. 2d 864 (Fla. 2001), the Florida Supreme Court upheld the temporary closure of a motel that had been the site of numerous drug and prostitution offenses but overturned an order closing an apartment complex for one year when it had been the site of only two illegal drug sales. The court held that the city had taken the property of the apartment complex owner without just compensation because the illegal activity was not so pervasive as to constitute either a private or public nuisance. Did the court rule correctly? Is this result consistent with <i>Bennis</i>?</p>
<p id="c5edd0a8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Eviction of innocent public housing tenants.</b> In <i>Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker</i>, 535 U.S. 125 (2002), the Supreme Court interpreted a federal statute to allow eviction of innocent public housing tenants when members of their households have engaged in illegal drug use or sales on or off the housing site. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §1437d(<i>l</i>)(6) (requiring public housing authorities to use leases that provide that “any drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant’s household, or any guest or other person under the tenant’s control, shall be cause for termination of [the] tenancy”). <i>See also</i> 24 C.F.R. §966.4(e)(12). The Court found no constitutional problem with forfeiture of property owned by an innocent party even if that tenant had done everything possible to prevent family members from using or selling drugs on the ground that the government was acting as an owner-landlord placing conditions in the lease with which the tenants voluntarily concurred and not as a sovereign regulating the lease terms or punishing an innocent party because of the criminal acts of another. Is this holding consistent with the holding in <i>Keshbro</i>?
