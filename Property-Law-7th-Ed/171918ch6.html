Nontrespassory interferences with the property rights of others can occur when the use of <i>one’s own property</i> harms the property interests of one’s neighbors. Such conflicts may arise in a wide variety of situations, including pollution, noise, odors, criminal activity, excavation undermining lateral support of neighboring land, flooding, and blocking access to light and air.</p>
<p id="c56f2a53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because use of one’s land often affects other landowners, the privilege to use one’s property is limited by the legal rights of other owners to be protected from uses that unreasonably harm their use or enjoyment of their own property. At the same time, the right to be secure from conduct that interferes with one’s use or enjoyment of property is not absolute. Because interests in free use often clash with interests in security, we cannot provide absolute protection for either. As the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> notes, “[i]t is an obvious truth that each individual in a community must put up with a certain amount of annoyance, inconvenience and interference and must take a certain amount of risk in order that all may get on together.” <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §822, cmt. g (1977). However, free use rights must be limited when “the harm or risk to one is greater than he ought to be required to bear under the circumstances, at least without compensation.” <i>Id</i>.</p>

<p id="c56f516c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the context of land use disputes, one owner is seeking to be secure from harms caused by another owner’s land use; the question is whether to protect the plaintiff’s interest in security from harm or the defendant’s interest in freedom of action. Regulating an activity harms those who wish to engage in it either by banning it or by making it more expensive. Failing to regulate an activity also has harmful consequences: it authorizes one owner to interfere with or even destroy the interests of others in the use and enjoyment of their property. Deciding not to protect property interests by failing to prohibit harmful use of land is as much a regulatory choice as choosing to prohibit or limit such uses.</p>
<p id="c56f516d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like most economists, Coase eschews moral judgment and attempts to remain studiously neutral as between the conflicting activities. The only question is which activity causes more harm. This suggests that the central question is the <i>magnitude</i> of the harms on both sides and not their <i>character</i>. This assumption seems innocuous when the two activities are equally legitimate, such as the conflict between the confectioner and the doctor or between the cattle rancher and the farmer. But is this assumption always warranted? Take the pollution example. It is true that regulation of the polluting activity may reduce the amount of the product created by that activity, and we would like to know what this cost is before we choose to regulate the conduct to avoid the pollution. This does not necessarily mean that we are — or should be — indifferent as between an economic activity that causes pollution and one that does not cause pollution. </p>

We care, for example, about the distribution of costs and benefits; it is wrong to make some people bear a disproportionate share of the burdens necessary to promote social welfare. In addition, some values are more fundamental than others. For example, the law deems an unprivileged intrusion on property to be a trespass whether or not the benefits of entry outweigh the costs, giving individual interests in possession a privileged status. How do we determine which interests are fundamental? How should we evaluate costs and benefits that are hard to describe in monetary terms: should we assign numbers to account for the magnitude of such costs and benefits, or should we evaluate those considerations in another way?</p>

<p id="c56f9f9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plaintiffs and the defendant all reside on a dead-end road, Triton Lane, in rural Jefferson County, Illinois. Larry and Frances Dobbs live on a parcel of property that is directly north of Wiggins’s property, and Wayne and Lorena Richard lived on a parcel of property that lies north of the Dobbs property. The Dobbses and the Richards have lived on their property for approximately 30 years. Wiggins purchased his property on Triton Lane in 1995, built a home and dog kennels on the property, and began raising, training, and kenneling bird dogs. On November 19, 2007, the Dobbses and the Richards filed a complaint against Wiggins that alleged that barking dogs on the Wiggins property constituted a private nuisance.</p>
<p id="c56f9f9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court began a two-day bench trial on the plaintiffs’ complaint on April 15, 2009. At the trial, Larry Dobbs testified that . . . Wiggins’s property was directly south of his property line. Larry testified that he enjoyed working outside in his garden, in his flower bed, and around his fish pond, sitting outside on his deck, and hosting cookouts for family members. According to Larry, at first Wiggins “didn’t have that many” dogs, and the dogs did not bark much. However, the noise from barking dogs kenneled on Wiggins’s property grew worse over time. In an attempt to alleviate some of the noise, Larry planted a row of cedar trees on his property.</p>
<p id="c56f9f9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Larry told the court that his house was approximately 200 to 250 yards from a barn where Wiggins kenneled many of his dogs. Larry testified that the barking was constant, day and night. The dogs might bark for two straight hours, take a break, and start barking again, but there was never any extended period of time in which they completely quit barking. Larry stated that in 2007 the barking was at its worst. When he went outside to do chores, he did not spend any time outside enjoying his property like he had in the past. He used to enjoy having his windows at his home open, but he now keeps them shut because of the barking noise. According to Larry, the noise was worse during the summer months as compared to the winter months. Larry approached Wiggins sometime in August of 2007 to complain about the noise. [Larry] testified that the noise was less at the time of the trial than in July of 2007 because there were fewer dogs on Wiggins’s property; however, the barking noise was still a problem that made it hard for him to enjoy his property. He testified that he could hear the barking from inside his house. Wiggins testified that on February 16, 2009, the parties inspected Wiggins’s kennels in preparation for the trial, and at that time, he counted a total of 69 dogs on Wiggins’s property. During the inspection, whenever someone arrived, the dogs barked for 20 to 30 minutes before quieting down. After the dogs quieted down, they could carry on a normal conversation in front of the kennels.</p>
<p id="c56f9f9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Frances testified that she had been married to Larry for 16 years and had lived on their property on Triton Lane since that time. Frances noticed the noise from Wiggins’s barking dogs sometime after Wiggins purchased his property. Frances described the barking as “[e]xcessive, continuous, chronic barking.” Frances testified: “I’m an early riser and sometimes I would be up five, six in the morning and they would be barking <span title="341" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-341">p. 341</span>and continue barking for hours. Then, you know, they might quit for half an hour, couple of minutes. Sometimes I would think, oh, thank goodness, you know, they’ve quit barking and I’d step outside and here they go again and I would have to go back into the house.” Prior to Wiggins kenneling dogs on his property, Frances liked to open the windows to her home in the springtime and let fresh air in. Now she no longer liked to open her windows because of Wiggins’s barking dogs. Frances claimed that the barking could be heard inside and that she had to turn on a radio or television to drown out the noise. She testified that a lot of nights, she could not go to sleep because of the noise. [T]he barking noise had caused her stress and restricted her and Larry from enjoying any outside activities in their yard.</p>
<p id="c56f9f9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wayne Richard testified that he had lived on Triton Lane with his wife for 30 years. Wayne testified that his house was 200 to 250 yards north of the Dobbs house. He estimated that his house was approximately 500 yards northwest of Wiggins’s property. His house and the Dobbs house were the houses closest to Wiggins’s property. Wayne testified that he liked to garden, mow, and race lawnmowers with his grandson in his yard. In the evenings, he liked to sit outside on his patio and listen to the sounds of nearby wildlife, including coyotes, turkeys, geese, and occasionally, nearby cattle. He testified that the coyotes howling would cause Wiggins’s dogs to start barking.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Wayne, . . . the noise from the dogs on Wiggins’s property gradually increased over time. He stated that it was noticeable in 2007 and became a “real nuisance” to him in 2007. He testified, “[W]e can’t do anything outside without hearing the dogs.” Wayne used to like having his windows open, but with the windows open, he could hear the dogs barking from everywhere in the house. He had to close his windows, and he usually turned on his television or his radio so he could not hear the barking. Wayne had been to the Dobbses’ property and heard the dogs barking inside and outside of their house as well.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wayne testified that he had two conversations about the dogs with Wiggins. According to Wayne, Wiggins stated that he wanted to be a good neighbor and had bought some device to quiet the dogs but that he was “within his rights” regardless of how many dogs were barking. Wiggins told Wayne that he moved to the country so he could raise the dogs, and Wayne responded that he moved to the country to get away from noise.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wayne’s wife, Lorena (Lori), testified that she enjoyed various activities outside, including gardening, reading, playing with kids, and cooking out. Now everything she did outside was “to the accompaniment of barking dogs.” She did not invite people over for an outside activity very often anymore because of the noise. She used to like to keep the windows in her house open in the spring before it got too hot, but they did not open the windows as often because of the barking, and they no longer slept with the windows open. According to Lori, when Wiggins moved into the area, he started raising dogs and the noise began to escalate as he accumulated more dogs. Lori testified that, in 2006, she could no longer ignore the noise. Every time she was outside — morning, noon, and evening — she could hear the dogs barking, whining, howling, and yipping. The noise got worse in 2007 and continued through 2009 at the same frequency and intensity.</p>

She was a longtime friend of Larry Dobbs and his family. McKowen testified that when she and her husband, Nolan, were outside on their property, they could hear Wiggins’s dogs barking to the south. During her visits at the Dobbs residence in 2007, McKowen could hear the dogs barking outside every time she visited, which she felt was very annoying.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Charles Downey lived on Triton Lane approximately one mile north of the Dobbs residence, and he had lived there for nearly 30 years. He had been to the Dobbs house at various times and had heard the dogs barking at the Dobbs home. Downey described the barking as “quite a bit louder” at the Dobbs property and testified that the barking would be annoying to listen to all the time. Downey testified that he also, from time to time, helped Wiggins at his property, including feeding his dogs and horses. In addition, Downey designed and built some of Wiggins’s kennels. Downey estimated that in 2007 Wiggins had more than 100 dogs on his property.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Martin Boykin of the Jefferson County Animal Control testified that in January of 2008, he responded to Triton Lane in response to a complaint that a dog owned by the Dobbses was acting aggressively, trying to bite people, and not allowing the mail to be delivered. On that occasion, he spoke with both Wiggins and Larry Dobbs near their property line for at least a half an hour. In describing the barking coming from the Wiggins property during this visit, Boykin testified: “You could hear somewhat some barking but nothing to — you couldn’t really tell, I mean, a number of dogs or anything like that. It wasn’t nothing loud or, you know, anything that would disturb anyone, I would assume.” He told the circuit court that he did not believe the barking level was “disturbing.” He testified that he had not been to the property except on that one occasion.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wiggins testified that he had been involved in raising and training bird dogs since he was a child helping his grandfather raise and train bird dogs. Wiggins testified that from 2002 to 2008, he has had a total income of $139,295 from selling his bird dogs. Wiggins testified that after he moved to his Triton Lane property and built his kennels, he asked Larry several times every year whether his dogs bothered him in any way. According to Wiggins, Larry always told him that the dogs were not a problem and that he could not hear them. Wiggins testified that he had hundreds of such conversations with Larry over the years. However, in a conversation on August 11, 2007, Larry told Wiggins that the barking was out of control and asked him to do something about it. According to Wiggins, that was the first time Larry had complained about the barking in the 15 years he had lived there. At that time, he owned approximately 100 dogs. After that conversation, Wiggins made attempts to reduce the noise level. Wiggins believed that because of these measures, the dogs were quieter at the time of the trial than they had been in 2007.</p>
<p id="c56f9fa7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 21, 2009, the circuit court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The court found that, although Wiggins’s land was well-suited for a dog kennel, the barking dogs resulted in an invasion of the plaintiffs’ interest in the use and enjoyment of their lands and that the gravity of the harm done to the plaintiffs outweighed the utility of Wiggins’s dog kennels. The court ordered Wiggins to decrease the number of dogs <span title="343" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-343">p. 343</span>in his possession to no more than six, to kennel his dogs in the southern region of his property, and to take all the steps necessary to adequately suppress any noise caused by any barking dogs. Wiggins filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>
<p id="c56fc6b8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first argument that Wiggins raises on appeal is that the circuit court’s finding that his dogs constituted a nuisance was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>
<p id="c56fc6b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[A]n appellate court will defer to the findings of the circuit court unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence.” <i>Chicago Investment Corp. v. Dolins</i>, 481 N.E.2d 712 (Ill. 1985). Accordingly, in the present case, we will review the circuit court’s finding that the barking dogs constituted a nuisance under the manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard.</p>
<p id="c56fc6ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“A private nuisance is a substantial invasion of another’s interest in the use and enjoyment of his or her land.” <i>Willmschen v. Trinity Lakes Improvement Ass’n</i>, 840 N.E.2d 1275 (Ill. App. 2005). “The invasion must be either intentional or negligent, and unreasonable.” <i>Id.</i> at 553. In determining whether particular conduct constitutes a nuisance, the standard is the conduct’s effect on a reasonable person. The Illinois Supreme Court has frequently stated that a nuisance must be physically offensive to the senses to the extent that it makes life uncomfortable. An invasion constituting a nuisance can include noise, smoke, vibration, dust, fumes, and odors produced on the defendant’s land and impairing the use and enjoyment of neighboring land. Whether the complained-of activity constitutes a nuisance is generally a question of fact. In an action to enjoin a private nuisance, the circuit court must balance the harm done to the plaintiffs against the benefit caused by the defendant’s use of the land and the suitability of the use in that particular location.</p>
<p id="c56fc6bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Woods v. Khan</i>, 420 N.E.2d 1028 (Ill. App. 1981), the plaintiffs brought a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants’ poultry business as a private nuisance. The plaintiffs lived within a mile of the defendants’ poultry business in rural Godfrey, Illinois, and they had lived there before the defendants built their facility in the area. The neighborhood was zoned agricultural, and many of the plaintiffs raised livestock on their own property. The plaintiffs complained that the poultry facility resulted in bad odors and swarms of flies and that the intensity of both varied from day to day. Some of the plaintiffs were required to seal their houses when the odor and insects were at their worst, and some plaintiffs cut back on outdoor activities and quit inviting guests to their homes. Some plaintiffs complained of breathing difficulties, sore throats, and nausea.</p>
<p id="c56fc6bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Woods</i>, the court concluded “that the trial court properly determined that the odors and flies were sufficiently bothersome to justify injunctive relief.” In weighing the gravity of the harm to the plaintiffs against the utility of the defendants’ business and the suitability of its location, the court stated that the following questions had to be answered: “(1) Are the defendants engaged in a useful enterprise? (2) Is this area of rural Godfrey well suited for an egg production facility? (3) Which came first, the chickens or the plaintiffs? (4) Can the odors and flies be reduced? (5) Is modification of the facility practical?” The court concluded that although the poultry facility was a vital industry, the poultry facility was the “newcomer to the area” and was located too close to several residences.</p>
<p id="c56fc6bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>As noted above, in order to prove an actionable nuisance, the plaintiffs had the burden of proving that barking dogs constituted an invasion that was substantial, intentional or negligent, and unreasonable. The plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for the circuit court to find the elements necessary to conclude that the barking dogs from the Wiggins property constituted a nuisance.</p>
<p id="c56fc6be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for the circuit court to find that the barking noise emanating from the Wiggins property was substantial. In determining whether the noise was substantial, the circuit court had to consider the effect it would have on a normal person of ordinary habits and sensibilities. The circuit court found that the plaintiffs were not “unduly sensitive” and were not “delicate, fastidious, [or] pursuing a dainty way of life.” This finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Wiggins disputed the extent of the barking and presented conflicting evidence on that issue, but the circuit court, as the trier of fact, determined the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence. We cannot say that the circuit court’s finding of a substantial invasion of the plaintiffs’ properties was unsupported by the facts presented at the trial.</p>
<p id="c56fc6bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he circuit court [also] found that the noise nuisance was unreasonable. The resolution of this question of fact required the circuit court to weigh the gravity of the harm done to the plaintiffs against the utility of Wiggins’s kennels and the suitability of the location of his kennels.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c56fc6c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That although the Defendant is operating a small business on his property, the gravity of the harm done to the Plaintiffs outweighs the utility of the Defendant’s business and the suitability of the location of that business. To make this finding the Court balanced the following:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c56fc6c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) Defendant is engaged in a useful business (raising bird dogs);</p>

</div>
</div>
<p id="c56fedd6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court was charged with the task of balancing these conflicting interests to determine whether the intentional invasion of barking noise was an unreasonable invasion and, therefore, an actionable private nuisance. The circuit court heard enough evidence to conclude that 69 or more dogs kenneled on Wiggins’s property caused an unreasonable noise invasion that interfered with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their nearby land. The appellate court is not permitted to “substitute its judgment on questions of fact fairly submitted, tried, and determined from the evidence which did not greatly preponderate either way.” <i>Maple v. Gustafson</i>, 603 N.E.2d 508 (Ill. 1992). Accordingly, we must affirm the circuit court’s finding that the barking from the dogs kenneled on Wiggins’s property constituted a private nuisance.</p>
<p id="c56fedd7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="345" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-345">p. 345</span>Wiggins argues, alternatively, that even if the plaintiffs sufficiently established that his dogs constituted a nuisance, the remedy issued by the circuit court was improper because it effectively terminated his business without affording him an opportunity to reduce or abate the nuisance. The granting of an injunction is within a trial court’s discretion, and on appeal, the reviewing court will only reverse a circuit court’s ruling when the circuit court manifestly abused its discretion. The mere existence of a nuisance does not automatically entitle the plaintiffs to injunctive relief against the nuisance. “Equity will not, as a matter of course, order relief in nuisance cases until all the circumstances and consequences of such action are considered.” <i>Tamalunis v. City of Georgetown</i>, 542 N.E.2d 402 (Ill. App. 1989).</p>
<p id="c56fedd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, the circuit court entered a permanent injunction requiring Wiggins to decrease the number of dogs in his possession to no more than six, to kennel the dogs only at a location in the southern region of his property, and to take all the steps necessary to adequately suppress any noise caused by the dogs barking. It was not against the manifest weight of the evidence for the circuit court to find that the number of dogs Wiggins kenneled on his property at the time of the trial, 69 dogs or more, constituted a private nuisance given the testimony concerning the noise level even after Wiggins attempted measures to reduce the noise. However, the evidence at the trial was insufficient to support a finding that Wiggins must reduce the number of dogs in his possession to six in order to abate the nuisance. Therefore, an injunction requiring him to reduce the number of dogs in his possession to six or less was an abuse of discretion under the facts presented at the trial.</p>
<p id="c56fedd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence at the trial suggested that Wiggins might be able to correct the nuisance by reducing the number of dogs to some number fewer than 69 but greater than 6. Wiggins began kenneling dogs on his property beginning in 1995, and he did so for more than 10 years without any complaints from his neighbors. The evidence at the trial included testimony describing several measures Wiggins took after August of 2007 to reduce the barking noise. The circuit court found that these measures were insufficient to abate the noise nuisance from the 69 or more barking dogs. However, the evidence presented at the trial was insufficient to determine the maximum number of dogs that could be maintained on the property without causing a private nuisance.</p>
<p id="c56fedda-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The restraint imposed by an injunction should not be more extensive than is reasonably required to protect the interests of the party in whose favor it is granted[ ] and should not be so broad as to prevent defendant from exercising his rights.” <i>People ex rel. Traiteur v. Abbott</i>, 327 N.E.2d 130 (Ill. App. 1975).</p>
<p id="c56feddb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court found that Wiggins’s canine business was a useful business located in an appropriate rural area, and we believe that further evidence is necessary for the circuit court to determine the proper scope of injunctive relief. The circuit court had insufficient evidence to consider all the circumstances and consequences of injunctive relief limiting Wiggins to six dogs, and we believe that the scope of the injunction was an abuse of discretion based on the evidence before the circuit court. Without further evidence, we cannot determine whether the circuit court’s injunction was too broad in scope, creating an unnecessary hardship on Wiggins. We do not offer any opinion on the number of dogs Wiggins should be limited to kenneling on his <span title="346" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-346">p. 346</span>property; we only conclude that the evidence presented at the trial was insufficient to determine the appropriate remedy. Accordingly, we remand this cause for further proceedings relevant to the scope of the injunctive relief necessary to abate the noise nuisance.</p>

<p id="c56fede1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Page County Appliance Center, Inc. (Appliance Center), sued Honeywell, Inc. (Honeywell), and ITT Electronic Travel Services, Inc. (ITT), for nuisance and tortious interference with business relations. Defendants appeal from judgment entered on jury verdicts awarding compensatory and punitive damages. Honeywell appeals from a judgment rendered against it on ITT’s cross-claim for indemnification. We reverse and remand for new trial.</p>
<p id="c56fede2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appliance Center has owned and operated an appliance store in Shenandoah, Iowa, since 1953. . . . Before 1980, [the owner, John Pearson,] had no reception trouble with his display televisions. In early January 1980, however, ITT placed one of its computers with Central Travel Service in Shenandoah as part of a nationwide plan to lease computers to retail travel agents. Central Travel was separated by only one other business from the Appliance Center. This ITT computer was manufactured, installed, and maintained by Honeywell.</p>
<p id="c57014f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereafter many of Pearson’s customers told him his display television pictures were bad; on two of the three channels available in Shenandoah he had a difficult time “getting a picture that was fit to watch.” After unsuccessfully attempting several remedial measures, in late January 1980, he finally traced the interference to the operations of Central Travel’s computer. Both defendants concede Pearson’s problems were caused by radiation leaking from the Honeywell computer.</p>
<p id="c57014f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After Pearson complained to Kay Crowell, owner of Central Travel,] Honeywell technicians made repeated trips to make various unsuccessful adjustments to the computer. They found the computer was operating properly; the interference-causing radiation was a design and not a service problem.</p>
<p id="c57014f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Honeywell engineers effected a 70 percent improvement in the television reception by certain modifications of the computer in the fall of 1980. Pearson, still dissatisfied, started this action in December. While the suit was pending, Honeywell further modified the computer, finally alleviating Pearson’s problems in May 1982.</p>
<p id="c57014f6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial a Honeywell senior staff engineer admitted the technology to manufacture a non-radiation-emitting computer was available long before it developed this computer, but opined it would have been neither cost nor consumer effective to utilize that technology. He testified Honeywell believed it had corrected Pearson’s problems in the fall of 1980.</p>
<p id="c57014f7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Appliance Center’s case against Honeywell and ITT finally was submitted to the jury on the theories of nuisance and tortious interference with prospective business relations. It asked for only injunctive relief against Kay Crowell, doing business <span title="347" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-347">p. 347</span>as Central Travel Service. The latter’s motion for summary judgment was sustained. The jury found for the Appliance Center against the remaining defendants on both theories, and further found the Appliance Center should recover $71,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in exemplary damages. . . . Trial court awarded ITT full indemnity against Honeywell, in the amount of $221,000, together with attorney fees and costs. Both defendants appeal from the judgment in favor of Appliance Center; Honeywell additionally appeals from the judgment awarding ITT indemnity.</p>
<p id="c57014f8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our analysis of ITT’s first contention must start with Iowa Code section 657.1, which in relevant part states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c57014f9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever is . . . an obstruction to the free use of property, so as essentially to interfere with the . . . enjoyment of . . . property, is a nuisance, and a civil action by ordinary proceedings may be brought to enjoin and abate the same and to recover damages sustained on account thereof.</p>
</div>
<p id="c57014fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Narrowing our focus, we note the Appliance Center is alleging a “private nuisance,” that is, an actionable interference with a person’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of his or her property. It also is apparent that if Central Travel’s computer emissions constitute a nuisance it is a “nuisance <i>per accidens</i>, or in fact” — a lawful activity conducted in such a manner as to be a nuisance.</p>
<p id="c57014fb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Principles governing our consideration of nuisance claims are well established. One’s use of property should not unreasonably interfere with or disturb a neighbor’s comfortable and reasonable use and enjoyment of his or her estate. A fair test of whether the operation of a lawful trade or industry constitutes a nuisance is the reasonableness of conducting it in the manner, at the place, and under the circumstances shown by the evidence. Each case turns on its own facts and ordinarily the ultimate issue is one of fact, not law. The existence of a nuisance is not affected by the intention of its creator not to injure anyone. Priority of occupation and location — “who was there first” — is a circumstance of considerable weight.</p>
<p id="c57014fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the alleged nuisance is claimed to be offensive to the person, courts apply the standard of “normal persons in a particular locality” to measure the existence of a nuisance. This normalcy standard also is applied where the use of property is claimed to be affected. “The plaintiff cannot, by devoting his own land to an unusually sensitive use, . . . make a nuisance out of conduct of the adjoining defendant which would otherwise be harmless.” W. Prosser, <i>The Law of Torts</i> §87, at 579 (4th ed. 1971).</p>
<p id="c57014fd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us, ITT asserts the Appliance Center’s display televisions constituted a hypersensitive use of its premises as a matter of law, and equates this situation to cases involving light thrown on outdoor theater screens in which light-throwing defendants have carried the day. . . . </p>
<p id="c57014fe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot equate the rare outdoor theater screen with the ubiquitous television that exists, in various numbers, in almost every home. Clearly, the presence of televisions on any premises is not such an abnormal condition that we can say, as a matter of law, that the owner has engaged in a peculiarly sensitive use of the property. This consideration, as well as related considerations of unreasonableness, gravity of harm, utility of conduct, and priority of occupation, are factual determinations that should <span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>have been submitted to the jury in this case. We find no trial court error in refusing to direct a verdict on this ground.</p>
<p id="c57014ff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">ITT’s second contention asserts trial court should have directed a verdict in its favor because it did not participate in the creation or maintenance of the alleged nuisance. We have noted ITT was engaged in a multimillion dollar, national program to lease computers to travel agencies. It owned this computer and leased it to Central Travel. It was to ITT that the agency first turned when the effect of the computer radiation became apparent. ITT continued to collect its lease payments; the computer did not operate for the benefit of Crowell alone. The jury could have found ITT evidenced some measure of its responsibility, as owner of the computer, in contacting Honeywell and making belated inquiries regarding Appliance Center’s problems both to Pearson and Crowell.</p>
<p id="c5703c10-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An action for damages for nuisance need not be predicated on negligence. Nuisance ordinarily is considered as a condition, and not as an act or failure to act on the part of the responsible party. A person responsible for a harmful condition found to be a nuisance may be liable even though that person has used the highest possible degree of care to prevent or minimize the effect.</p>
<p id="c5703c11-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where there is reasonable doubt whether one of several persons is substantially participating in carrying on an activity, the question is for the trier of fact. We hold such reasonable doubt existed on the record made in this case, and trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict on this ground.</p>
<p id="c5703c12-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Honeywell asserts trial court should have granted its motion for directed verdict because, even though it manufactured the computer, Central Travel and ITT were in control of the instrument at all relevant times; thus Honeywell did not have the legal right to terminate its use. Honeywell devotes ten and one-half pages of its brief to this thesis without mentioning that it had an ongoing contract to service and maintain the computer.</p>
<p id="c5703c13-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of what we have written [above] applies here. Again, the issue is one of material participation. Honeywell’s design permitted radiation to escape this computer, although technology was available to minimize this effect. Apparently factors of cost and ease of service access weighed more in the design decision. Honeywell was the only party with the technological know-how to control the radiation leakage. Its maintenance contract with ITT clearly absolved it of any liability if anyone else made any alterations or additions to the equipment, and reserved the right to terminate the agreement should that occur. As with ITT, we think Honeywell’s material participation was an issue for the finder of fact.</p>
<p id="c5703c14-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Trial court’s instructions required Appliance Center to prove defendants “unreasonably” interfered with the Center’s use and enjoyment of its property. Honeywell and ITT objected, in essence, that this permitted the jury to judge “unreasonableness” in a vacuum; that the instructions made no attempt to define the unreasonableness concept. Because reasonableness under our nuisance decisions ordinarily is a question for the jury, the court on retrial should provide more guidance for the jury.</p>
<p id="c5703c15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bates v. Quality Ready Mix Co</i>., 154 N.W.2d 852, 857 (Iowa 1968), we noted that reasonableness is a function of the manner in which, and the place where, defendant’s <span title="349" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-349">p. 349</span>business is conducted, and the circumstances under which defendant operates. Additional factors . . . include priority of location, character of the neighborhood, and the nature of the alleged wrong. The “character and gravity of the resulting injury” is, in fact, “a major factor in determining reasonableness,” <i>Montgomery v. Bremer County Board of Supervisors,</i> 299 N.W.2d 687, 697 (Iowa 1980). Balanced against the gravity of the wrong is the utility and meritoriousness of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
<p id="c5703c16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another instruction given in this case stated that “[o]ne who contributes to the creation or continuance of a nuisance may be liable.” ITT objected that neither this instruction nor any other informed the jury that a defendant’s conduct must be a “substantial factor” in bringing about the alleged harm. Upon retrial the instructions should incorporate this requirement.</p>
<p id="c5703c17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both Honeywell and ITT objected because the court did not submit to the jury the issue whether Appliance Center was devoting its premises to an unusually sensitive use. The discussion in division I is relevant here. We hold defendants were entitled to have this question resolved by the jury.</p>
<p id="c5703c18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We reverse and remand with instructions to set aside the judgment in favor of Appliance Center against Honeywell and ITT, and the judgment entered on ITT’s cross-claim against Honeywell.

Unreasonable harm to the use and enjoyment of land.</b> How do the courts determine when an interference with the use and enjoyment of land is unreasonable? First, they must determine what interests are encompassed by the right to the “use and enjoyment of land.” Those interests include freedom from pollution, noise, odors, and smoke. Is the market value of the plaintiff’s property (by itself) such an interest? If not, why not? Second, they need to determine how serious the interference must be for a nuisance to be present. Traditionally, the court required the harm to be <b>substantial</b> before it could give rise to a nuisance claim. Third, if defendant has substantially interfered in the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of land, how do we determine whether that harm is <b>unreasonable</b>? For intentional nuisances, the focus of the reasonableness inquiry is on the impact of the defendant’s conduct on the plaintiff. Courts ask whether the defendant’s conduct creates consequences for the plaintiff that a typical landowner should not be expected to bear. The question is whether those consequences exceed a reasonable threshold beyond which the court will conclude that the defendant has created a nuisance.

<p id="c570633e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Malice may also be relevant to the court’s evaluation of the defendant’s conduct. For example, many states will grant injunctions against so-called <b>spite fences</b> constructed for the sole purpose of blocking their neighbors’ light and air. When such fences serve no purpose other than the builders’ desire to hurt their neighbors, some states will grant an injunction ordering the fence torn down. <i>See Wilson v. Handley</i>, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 263 (Ct. App. 2002) (<i>applying</i> Cal. Civ. Code §841.4); <i>DeCecco v. Beach</i>, 381 A.2d 543 (Conn. 1977) (<i>applying</i> Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-570); <i>Gertz v. Estes</i>, 879 N.E.2d 617 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008) (applying Ind. Code §§32-26-10-1 and -2). <i>But see Maioriello v. Arlotta</i>, 73 A.2d 374 (Pa. 1950) (refusing to enjoin a spite fence). Why should malice figure in the nuisance calculus?</p>
<p id="c570633f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Intentional nuisance, negligence, ultrahazardous activities, and nuisances <i>per se</i><i>.</i></b> Intentional nuisance must be distinguished from <b>negligence</b>. Negligence law prohibits and provides remedies for unreasonable <i>conduct</i>; this implies a judgment that a reasonable person would have foreseen the harm and prevented it. Intentional nuisance focuses primarily on the <i>result</i> of the conduct rather than the conduct itself; the question is not whether the defendant’s conduct was unreasonable but whether the interference suffered by the plaintiff is unreasonable. Such interference is unreasonable under nuisance law if it involves substantial harm that an owner should not have to bear for the good of society. Thus, conduct that is not negligent (because the defendant took due care to avoid the harm) may still constitute a nuisance (because the conduct in fact results in harm to the neighbors’ property interests that is <span title="351" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-351">p. 351</span>not justified by the social utility of the conduct causing it). Conversely, where the defendant’s conduct is negligent, defendant may be liable under a negligence theory even if the impact on the plaintiff would not otherwise rise to the level of a substantial interference.</p>
<p id="c5706340-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts impose strict liability on landowners if they engage in <b>ultrahazardous activities</b> that cause harm to neighboring land. In such cases, nontrespassory conduct may result in liability without a need to prove either negligence or the unreasonableness and substantial harm requirements of nuisance doctrine. Some cases have imposed strict liability on landowners who have stored toxic waste on their property. <i>See, e.g., T &amp; E Industries v. Safety Light Corp</i>., 587 A.2d 1249 (N.J. 1991); <i>State v. Ventron Corp</i>., 468 A.2d 150 (N.J. 1983).</p>
<p id="c5706341-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some activities may be so disfavored that they will be held to constitute nuisances no matter where they take place or what consequences they generate — so-called <b>nuisances <i>per se</i></b>. An example would be criminal activity such as property routinely used for illegal drug manufacture or sale. Otherwise lawful activities may constitute nuisances because they are “a right thing in a wrong place — like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.” <i>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.</i>, 272 U.S. 365, 388 (1962). For example, in one Texas case, the trial court affirmed a jury’s finding that a 21-story tall apartment building constituted a nuisance because of its location within a neighborhood primarily made up of detached, single-family homes. <i>See Loughhead v. 1717 Bissonnet, L.L.C.</i>, No. 2013-26155, 2014 WL 8774060 (Tex. Dist. May 1, 2014), <i>reversed in part</i> ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tex. App. 2016). </p>
<p id="c5708a52-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Who can be sued?</b> Can a manufacturer of a hazardous substance be sued for damages for nuisance when it leaks through the ground and causes harm to neighboring land? <i>Page County</i> adopts the general rule that imposes liability on any actor who “materially participated” in causing the harm. <i>See also Parks Hiway Enterprises, LLC v. CEM Leasing, Inc.</i>, 995 P.2d 657, 667 (Alaska 2000) (question is whether defendant’s conduct was a “substantial factor” in causing the harm). What factors led the court to determine that the evidence showed that Honeywell contributed to the harm? Would Honeywell have been liable if its only participation was the design and sale of the computer? <i>Compare Hall v. Phillips</i>, 436 N.W.2d 139 (Neb. 1989) (manufacturer and distributor of herbicide liable for nuisance), <i>and New York v. Fermenta ASC Corp.</i>, 630 N.Y.S.2d 884 (Sup. Ct. 1995) (holding the manufacturer and distributor of a herbicide liable for trespass when it broke down in the soil after usage by customers and a chemical byproduct leached through the soil and invaded the public water supply), <i>with Parks Hiway Enterprises, supra</i> (gas producer not liable for nuisance merely because it produced the gas that bled into neighboring land).</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5708a54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Not too early.</b> The doctrine of <b>anticipatory nuisance</b> governs lawsuits to bar a nuisance before the challenged use is actually in place. Most courts agree that a claimant seeking an injunction against a use that is not yet in place must prove with near certainty that the use, once in place, will constitute a nuisance. <i><span title="352" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-352">p. 352</span>See, e.g., Simpson v. Kollasch</i>, 749 N.W.2d 671 (Iowa 2008) (“An anticipated nuisance will not be enjoined unless it clearly appears a nuisance will necessarily result from the act.”);<i> Duff v. Morgantown Energy Associates</i>, 421 S.E.2d 253 (W. Va. 1992) (“[T]o warrant injunctive relief as to a prospective nuisance, the fact that it will be a nuisance if so used must be made clearly to appear, beyond all ground of fair questioning.’ ”). However, once a nuisance-causing activity is built, the waste of dismantling the operation may weigh against finding a nuisance. How does the difficulty of obtaining an injunction on a theory of anticipatory nuisance affect the usefulness of nuisance law as a tool for regulating land use conflicts?</p>
<p id="c5708a55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Not too late.</b> Nuisance claimants must sue before the statute of limitations expires. Many courts distinguish between <b>temporary</b> and <b>permanent</b> nuisances. A permanent nuisance either irreparably injures the plaintiff’s property or is of such a character that it is likely to continue indefinitely; in such a case, the statute of limitations for bringing a claim begins at the time the nuisance begins. In contrast, a temporary nuisance occurs intermittently or can be alleviated by changes in the defendant’s conduct. For temporary nuisances, the claim “accrues anew upon each injury.” <i>Schneider National Carriers</i>, 147 S.W.3d at 270, 272.</p>

<p id="c5708a56-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Nuisance defenses.</b> Two common defenses to nuisance claims are (1) that the defendant got there first and (2) that the plaintiff is too sensitive:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5708a57-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Temporal priority, and “coming to the nuisance.”</b> The fact that a harmful activity was established first will weigh in favor of the defendant. When the plaintiff comes to the nuisance, one can argue that she created the problem herself. An owner who builds a house next to a pig farm should not be surprised at the resulting odors. For this reason, in all states, it will be harder for a plaintiff to prevail in a nuisance case if she came to the nuisance. At the same time, coming to the nuisance is not an absolute defense; it may be wrong to continue operating a polluting activity once it becomes surrounded by numerous other homes and businesses. Some statutes do make it an absolute defense in certain cases that the plaintiff came to the nuisance.</p>
<p id="c5708a58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When owners come to the nuisance, the courts may enjoin the offending activity on the condition that those who came to the nuisance compensate the prior developer for the costs associated with shutting down and/or relocating. In <i>Spur Industries v. Webb</i>, 494 P.2d 700 (Ariz. 1972), for example, a developer built a residential community near a cattle ranch. Ordinarily, it would be possible to convince a court that the smells generated by a cattle ranch constitute a substantial and unreasonable interference in the use and enjoyment of residential property. However, because the homeowners “came to the nuisance,” they had a much harder time convincing the court that the cattle feedlot should be shut down than they would have had if the residential community had been established first. This is probably why the court in <i>Spur</i> granted the plaintiffs an injunction only on the condition that they compensate the defendant for the costs that relocation would impose on him.</p>

<p id="c5708a5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states have passed <b>right to farm</b> statutes that protect farmers from liability for nuisance if their farms were established before surrounding residential property was constructed.

CSX Transportation, Inc</i>., 906 S.W.2d 460 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (no remedy for plaintiff who had an extremely rare allergy to fumes from railroad ties near his land). Nuisance law aims to protect owners’ reasonable interests in the use and enjoyment of their land. In <i>Page County</i>, the court considered but ruled out the argument that the defendant’s conduct should not be judged a nuisance because the plaintiff was abnormally sensitive. Do you agree with its conclusion that the plaintiff was not abnormally sensitive to electromagnetic interference? If the plaintiff were a homeowner complaining that she suffered interference with her television reception due to the defendant’s business, do you think the court would have found the harm to rise to the level of a nuisance? Would the answer change between the 1980s and today?</p>

<p id="c570b16d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Aesthetic nuisance and stigma.</b> Although most nuisance cases involve physical harm to land or discomfort or danger to persons, the doctrine is broad enough to encompass any conduct that causes unreasonable and substantial harm to the use and enjoyment of land. Thus, nuisance claims have been brought against owners who have allowed their property to be overrun by drug dealers, thereby interfering with the interests of landowners in the neighborhood. <i>Lew v. Superior Court,</i> 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 42 (Ct. App. 1993). In several cases, homeowners have been enjoined from lavish displays of lights and loud Christmas music that drew an enormous influx of visitors to a residential neighborhood. <i>See, e.g., Osborne v. Power</i>, 908 S.W.2d 340 (Ark. 1995); <i>Rodrigue v. Copeland</i>, 475 So. 2d 1071 (La. 1985).</p>
<p id="c570b16e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have historically been reluctant to find visual annoyances, by themselves, to be nuisances in the absence of physical manifestations, such as foul odors, or threats to health or safety. Mere unsightliness, the usual account goes, was not enough to ground a nuisance claim. <i>See</i> Note, <i>Aesthetic Nuisance: An Emerging Cause of Action</i>, 45 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1075, 1080-1087 (1970); Note, Dix W. Noel, <i>Unaesthetic Sights as Nuisances</i>, 25 Cornell L.Q. 1, 1-5, 8 (1939). In recent years, however, courts have been more willing to find a nuisance on the basis of mere visual harm. <i>See Rattigan v. Wile</i>, 841 N.E.2d 680, 689 (Mass. 2006) (“[T]he modern trend is toward recognition that aesthetic considerations may legitimately generate public and private concern.”); <i>Foley v. Harris</i>, 286 S.E.2d 186, 190-191 (Va. 1982) (unsightly junked cars on lot were a nuisance); John Copeland Nagle, <i>Moral Nuisances</i>, 50 Emory L.J. 265, 286-287 (2001) (detecting a judicial trend in favor of recognizing aesthetic nuisances). <i>But see</i> Henry E. Smith, <i>Exclusion and Property Rules in the Law of Nuisance</i>, 90 Va. L. Rev. 965, 999-1000 (2004) (describing courts as continuing to reject claims of aesthetic nuisance). Despite this trend, courts remain reluctant to do so where the claim of harm is based <span title="354" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-354">p. 354</span>on a mere difference in taste. They seem more likely to find a visual nuisance where there is some evidence of malice or spite. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Rattigan</i>, at 688-690. The general trend toward accepting nuisance claims based on aesthetic harm seems consistent with the basic premises of nuisance law, particularly where there are strong, widely shared norms against the particular type of land use that generates the visual harm.</p>
<p id="c570b16f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>DeSario v. Industrial Excess Land Fill Inc.</i>, No. 89-570 (Ohio Ct. Common Pleas 1994), a jury awarded the owners of noncontaminated property within two miles of a toxic waste dump $6.7 million in damages for the loss of their property value caused by the “stigma” of being near the dump.

For example, in <i>Adams v. Star Enterprises</i>, 51 F.3d 417 (4th Cir. 1995), the court refused to allow owners of property adjacent to land contaminated by a leak at an oil distribution facility to recover damages for mere fear of future health effects or for diminution in the value of their property absent a showing of detectable, physical encroachment on their property. <i>Accord, Smith v. Kansas Gas Service Co.</i>, 169 P.3d 1052, 1063 (Kan. 2007) (no nuisance when natural gas escaped from a facility in the absence of physical injury to properties or interference with use and enjoyment “distinct from the claim that the property’s value has diminished because of marketplace fear or stigma”).

Private landowners could obtain a remedy against a public nuisance only if they suffered some special damage different from that generally suffered by the public as a whole. The <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i>, however, provides that any member of the public affected by the activity should be able to bring a lawsuit, and this seems to represent the trend in the law. <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §821c (1979). Statutes may authorize individuals to bring claims to abate public nuisances. <i>See Kellner v. Capelini</i>, 516 N.Y.S.2d 827 (Civ.

Climate change as a public nuisance.</b> In 2004, several states (along with nonprofit land trusts) sued various electric utilities, arguing that their emission of greenhouse gases — and the resultant changes in the climate — constituted a public nuisance under state and federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court held that federal environmental laws preempted the plaintiffs’ federal common law claims, but left open the possibility that the plaintiffs might have surviving nuisance claims under state law. <i>See American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</i>, 131 S. Ct. 2527 (2011). At least one federal court has subsequently held that state law nuisance claims are also preempted by federal environmental laws. <i>See Comer v.

In light of the difficulty of proving anticipatory nuisance and the costs of abating nuisances once they are in place, does this shift make sense? Federal legislation includes the <i>Clean Air Act</i>, 42 U.S.C. §§7401-7642; the <i>Clean Water Act</i>, 33 U.S.C. §§1251-1376; the <i>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act</i> (the <i>Superfund Act</i>, or <i>CERCLA</i>), 42 U.S.C. §§6901-9657; and the <i>Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986</i> (SARA), Pub.

The illegal activities have attracted a large number of drug buyers and users into the neighborhood, disrupting a formerly quiet neighborhood of brownstone homes and turning the area into a drug market. The landlord is a real estate company engaged in the business of renting housing. The landlord in no way encouraged or participated in the illegal activities, but has failed to do anything to remedy the problem. Twenty neighbors bring a lawsuit against the landlord claiming the landlord’s use of its property constitutes a nuisance.

<p id="c570ffa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we noted above, nuisance cases always involve two questions: (1) the determination of the entitlement to engage in a use or to be free from the harm caused by someone else’s use and (2) the choice of a remedy. As Guido Calabresi and A. Douglas Melamed observed in an extremely influential law review article, there are typically two types of remedies in the nuisance context: injunctions and damages, or in their terminology, “property rules” and “liability rules.” <i>See</i> Guido Calabresi &amp; A. Douglas Melamed, <i>Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral</i>, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089 (1972).</p>
<p id="c570ffa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Property rules</b> (injunctions) fix an absolute entitlement either to engage in the conduct (<i>no liability</i>) or to be secure from the harm (<i>injunctive relief ordering defendant to stop committing the harm</i>). With property rules, the parties are free to bargain to give up their rights to commit or be free from the harm. The price of the entitlement would therefore be fixed by private bargaining rather than by a court order.</p>
<p id="c570ffa3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Liability rules</b> (damages), in contrast, prohibit one party from interfering with the interests of the other unless the party is willing to pay an amount determined by a court of law or some other authoritative third party. If the plaintiff is entitled to be protected from the harm by a liability rule, then defendant’s failure to prevent the harm subjects the defendant to damages. Conversely, if defendant is entitled to engage in the harmful activity, protecting that entitlement with a liability rule means that the plaintiff will be able to obtain an injunction stopping that activity if it compensates the defendant for the economic losses associated with stopping the activity; this later remedy is called a <b>purchased</b> or <b>conditional injunction</b>. A plaintiff will be granted an injunction only if it pays damages to compensate defendant for its losses.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104B0_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N104B0_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span></p>

Wiggins</i>, where a plaintiff is seeking only injunctive relief, the two stages can seem to collapse into one. While this is understandable, the failure to keep the entitlement question separate from the remedial, balancing of utilities question is the source of some confusion in nuisance law. The <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §826(a), for example, appears to mix these two questions when it defines a land use as “unreasonable” (<i>i.e</i>., a nuisance) where the “gravity of the harm [to the plaintiff] outweighs the utility of the actor’s conduct.” If the question at the entitlement stage were simply a matter of balancing the utilities, a defendant’s actions would be allowed to impose enormous costs on its neighbors just because the defendant’s use is a socially valuable one. If that were the law, what kinds of land uses would it favor?</p>
<p id="c5714dd5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nuisance law permits the decision maker to consider the utility of the defendant’s conduct at both stages, but the relevance of that utility will be different in the two stages. In determining whether to classify the defendant’s conduct as a nuisance, courts weigh the utility of the defendant’s conduct in the defendant’s favor. That is, a defendant whose behavior is socially beneficial gets more leeway to impose costs on its neighbors, but the focus remains on the impact of the defendant’s conduct on the plaintiff. The fact that a defendant’s conduct is socially valuable is not decisive. In contrast to the entitlement stage, where the focus is on the impact on the plaintiff, the costs and benefits of the defendant’s conduct is a central consideration at the remedial stage.</p>

<p id="c57174eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant operates a large cement plant near Albany. These are actions for injunction and damages by neighboring land owners alleging injury to property from <span title="359" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-359">p. 359</span>dirt, smoke and vibration emanating from the plant. A nuisance has been found after trial, temporary damages have been allowed; but an injunction has been denied. The public concern with air pollution arising from many sources in industry and in transportation is currently accorded ever wider recognition accompanied by a growing sense of responsibility in State and Federal Governments to control it. Cement plants are obvious sources of air pollution in the neighborhoods where they operate.</p>
<p id="c57174ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But there is now before the court private litigation in which individual property owners have sought specific relief from a single plant operation. The threshold question raised by the division of view on this appeal is whether the court should resolve the litigation between the parties now before it as equitably as seems possible; or whether, seeking promotion of the general public welfare, it should channel private litigation into broad public objectives.</p>
<p id="c57174ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court performs its essential function when it decides the rights of parties before it. Its decision of private controversies may sometimes greatly affect public issues. Large questions of law are often resolved by the manner in which private litigation is decided. But this is normally an incident to the court’s main function to settle controversy. It is a rare exercise of judicial power to use a decision in private litigation as a purposeful mechanism to achieve direct public objectives greatly beyond the rights and interests before the court. Effective control of air pollution is a problem presently far from solution even with the full public and financial powers of government. In large measure adequate technical procedures are yet to be developed and some that appear possible may be economically impracticable.</p>
<p id="c5719bfe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems apparent that the amelioration of air pollution will depend on technical research in great depth; on a carefully balanced consideration of the economic impact of close regulation; and of the actual effect on public health. It is likely to require massive public expenditure and to demand more than any local community can accomplish and to depend on regional and interstate controls.</p>
<p id="c5719bff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A court should not try to do this on its own as a by-product of private litigation and it seems manifest that the judicial establishment is neither equipped in the limited nature of any judgment it can pronounce nor prepared to lay down and implement an effective policy for the elimination of air pollution. This is an area beyond the circumference of one private lawsuit. It is a direct responsibility for government and should not thus be undertaken as an incident to solving a dispute between property owners and a single cement plant — one of many — in the Hudson River valley.</p>
<p id="c5719c00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cement making operations of defendant have been found by the court of Special Term to have damaged the nearby properties of plaintiffs in these two actions. That court, as it has been noted, accordingly found defendant maintained a nuisance and this has been affirmed at the Appellate Division.

<p id="c5719c01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ground for the denial of injunction, notwithstanding the finding both that there is a nuisance and that plaintiffs have been damaged substantially, is the large disparity in economic consequences of the nuisance and of the injunction.

For reasons which will be developed the court chooses the latter alternative.</p>
<p id="c5719c07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the injunction were to be granted unless within a short period — e.g., 18 months — the nuisance be abated by improved methods, there would be no assurance that any significant technical improvement would occur. Moreover, techniques to eliminate dust and other annoying by-products of cement making are unlikely to be developed by any research the defendant can undertake within any short period, but will depend on the total resources of the cement industry nationwide and throughout the world. The problem is universal wherever cement is made.</p>
<p id="c5719c08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For obvious reasons the rate of the research is beyond control of defendant. If at the end of 18 months the whole industry has not found a technical solution a court would be hard put to close down this one cement plant if due regard be given to equitable principles. On the other hand, to grant the injunction unless defendant pays plaintiffs such permanent damages as may be fixed by the court seems to do justice between the contending parties. All of the attributions of economic loss to the properties on which plaintiffs’ complaints are based will have been redressed.</p>
<p id="c5719c09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limitation of relief granted is a limitation only within the four corners of these actions and does not foreclose public health or other public agencies from seeking proper relief in a proper court. It seems reasonable to think that the risk of being required to pay permanent damages to injured property owners by cement plant owners would itself be a reasonable effective spur to research for improved techniques <span title="361" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-361">p. 361</span>to minimize nuisance. The power of the court to condition on equitable grounds the continuance of an injunction on the payment of permanent damages seems undoubted. [P]ermanent damages are allowed where the loss recoverable would obviously be small as compared with the cost of removal of the nuisance.</p>
<p id="c571c31a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus it seems fair to both sides to grant permanent damages to plaintiffs which will terminate this private litigation. The theory of damage is the “servitude on land” of plaintiffs imposed by defendant’s nuisance. The judgment, by allowance of permanent damages imposing a servitude on land, which is the basis of the actions, would preclude future recovery by plaintiffs or their grantees. This should be placed beyond debate by a provision of the judgment that the payment by defendant and the acceptance by plaintiffs of permanent damages found by the court shall be in compensation for a servitude on the land.</p>
<p id="c571c31b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The orders should be reversed, without costs, and the cases remitted to Supreme Court, Albany County to grant an injunction which shall be vacated upon payment by defendant of such amounts of permanent damage to the respective plaintiffs as shall for this purpose be determined by the court.</p>

<p id="c571c31d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I see grave dangers in overruling our long-established rule of granting an injunction where a nuisance results in substantial continuing damage. In permitting the injunction to become inoperative upon the payment of permanent damages, the majority is, in effect, licensing a continuing wrong. It is the same as saying to the cement company, you may continue to do harm to your neighbors so long as you pay a fee for it. Furthermore, once such permanent damages are assessed and paid, the incentive to alleviate the wrong would be eliminated, thereby continuing air pollution of an area without abatement.</p>
<p id="c571c31e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that some courts have sanctioned the remedy here proposed by the majority in a number of cases, but . . . [i]n those cases, the courts, in denying an injunction and awarding money damages, grounded their decision on a showing that the use to which the property was intended to be put was primarily for the public benefit. Here, on the other hand, it is clearly established that the cement company is creating a continuing air pollution nuisance primarily for its own private interest with no public benefit. This kind of inverse condemnation may not be invoked by a private person or corporation for private gain or advantage. The promotion of the interests of the polluting cement company has, in my opinion, no public use or benefit. Nor is it constitutionally permissible to impose servitude on land, without consent of the owner, by payment of permanent damages where the continuing impairment of the land is for a private use.</p></div></div>

<p id="c571c321-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Stage 1 and stage 2.</b> If the defendant’s conduct was so valuable, why did the court in <i>Boomer</i> even find it to be a nuisance? Atlantic Cement’s behavior was reasonable on the social level in the sense that it increased overall social utility, but the costs <span title="362" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-362">p. 362</span>of the defendant’s activity were not fairly distributed. The concentrated nature of the harm generated by the defendant’s cement factory violated the individual plaintiff’s right to security; the harm was greater than any individual should be forced to bear for the good of society. Requiring damages but not awarding an injunction, therefore, was consistent with a determination that the activity was efficient — it increased social utility to allow it to go forward because its overall benefits vastly outweighed its costs (the stage 2 nuisance inquiry) — but that the costs of the activity were unfairly distributed (the stage 1 nuisance inquiry) — the plaintiff’s property interests were being unfairly sacrificed. Resorting to a damages remedy where the costs of an injunction would be too high (relative to the benefit it would generate) gives courts a way to recompense the wrong being perpetrated on the plaintiff while allowing a socially valuable use to continue. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Loughhead v. 1717 Bissonnet, L.L.C.</i>, No. 2013-26155, 2014 WL 8774060 (Tex. Dist. May 1, 2014) (finding an apartment building to be a nuisance, but declining to enjoin its construction).</p>
<p id="c571c322-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Responses to <i>Boomer</i>.</b> After the <i>Boomer</i> decision, the American Law Institute (partially) endorsed the court’s approach in a revision of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts.</i> Section 826(b) of the <i>Restatement (Second)</i> supplements the (confusing) balancing test §826(a) with a test that provides for damages when “the harm caused by the conduct is serious and the financial burden of compensating for this and similar harm to others would not make the continuation of the conduct not feasible.” Does the infeasibility of paying damages suggest that (taking into account the costs of the defendant’s conduct for the plaintiff) the defendant’s conduct is not cost effective? If so, why should the defendant escape paying damages if their payment would put it out of business? What about the possibility that the defendant’s activities generate positive externalities — benefits that accrue to others and that are not reflected in the defendant’s balance sheets?</p>
<p id="c571c323-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. How much of an innovation?</b> Although injunctions are the most common remedy for nuisance, the law in most jurisdictions is that a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to injunctive relief just because the defendant’s conduct constitutes a nuisance. Instead, the question whether to grant an injunction (and the proper scope of that injunction) rests with the sound discretion of the trial court. The court in <i>Boomer</i> characterized its use of a damages remedy in that case as a dramatic innovation because it believed that the prior law <i>required</i> an injunction to issue automatically and without exception upon determining a defendant’s conduct to constitute a nuisance. While there was at least one earlier case to that effect in New York, the usual practice once a nuisance has been found was (and continues to be) to balance the utilities before granting an injunction. Courts applied a presumption in favor of granting injunctive relief to successful plaintiffs but refused to do so where the cost of the injunction to the defendant dramatically outweighed the value of the injunction to the plaintiff. <i>See</i> Douglas Laycock, <i>The Neglected Defense of Undue Hardship (and the Doctrinal Train Wreck in</i> Boomer v. Atlantic Cement), 4 J. Tort L. 1, 7-19 (2012). Professor Laycock describes how the majority in <i>Boomer</i> distorted the legal landscape in New York, confusing generations of subsequent legal scholars. He concludes, “[T]he bottom line <span title="363" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-363">p. 363</span>is that <i>Boomer</i> was no innovation. The opinion could have been written as a straightforward application of the undue hardship defense with only one or at most a few exceptional cases.” <i>Id.</i></p>

<p id="c571ea3b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This action involves alleged pesticide contamination of organic farm fields in central Minnesota. Appellant Paynesville Farmers Union Cooperative Oil Company (“Cooperative”) is a member owned farm products and services provider that, among other things, applies pesticides to farm fields. Respondents Oluf and Debra Johnson (“Johnsons”) are organic farmers. The Johnsons claim that while the Cooperative was spraying pesticide onto conventionally farmed fields adjacent to the Johnsons’ fields, some pesticide drifted onto and contaminated the Johnsons’ organic fields. The Johnsons sued the Cooperative on theories including trespass, nuisance, and negligence per se and sought damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p id="c571ea3c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before discussing the factual background of this case, it is helpful to briefly summarize the organic farming regulations at issue. American organic farming is regulated by the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. §§6501-6523 (2006) (“OFPA”), and the associated federal regulations in the National Organic Program, 7 C.F.R. §205 (2012) (“NOP”). Minnesota has adopted the OFPA and the NOP as its state organic farming law.</p>
<p id="c571ea3d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the OFPA and the NOP regulations, a producer cannot market its crops as “organic,” and receive the premium price paid for organic products, unless the producer is “certified” by an organic certifying agent. Among numerous other requirements, the NOP provides that land from which crops are intended to be sold as organic must “[h]ave had no prohibited substances . . . applied to it for a period of 3 years immediately preceding harvest of the crop.” 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1065C_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1065C_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> Under the NOP regulations, crops may not be sold as organic if the crops are shown to have a prohibited substance on them at levels that are greater than 5 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency’s tolerance level for that substance. 7 C.F.R. §205.671.</p>
<p id="c571ea3f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In June 2007, the Johnsons filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (“MDA”), alleging that the Cooperative had contaminated one of their transitional soybean fields<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10666_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10666_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span> through pesticide drift. The subsequent MDA investigation verified that on June 15, 2007, a date when winds were blowing toward the Johnsons’ fields at 9 to 21 miles per hour, the Cooperative sprayed Status (diflufenzopyr <span title="364" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-364">p. 364</span>and dicamba) and Roundup Original (glyphosate) onto a conventional farmer’s field immediately adjacent to one of the Johnsons’ transitional soybean fields. The MDA informed the Johnsons that there was no tolerance for diflufenzopyr in soybeans (organic, transitional, or conventional) and that, pending chemical testing, the MDA would “determine if there [would] be any harvest prohibitions” on the Johnsons’ soybeans. After receiving the results of the chemical testing, the MDA informed the parties that test results revealed that the chemical dicamba was present, but below detection levels. The MDA also reported that the chemicals diflufenzopyr and glyphosate were not present. Because only one of the three chemicals was present based on its testing, the MDA concluded that “it can not be proven if the detections were from drift.” And even though the testing did not find diflufenzopyr, the MDA still required that the Johnsons plow down a small portion of the soybeans growing in the field because of “the presence of dicamba” and based on the “visual damage” observed to this crop. In response to this MDA directive, the Johnsons destroyed approximately 10 acres of their soybean crop.</p>
<p id="c5721151-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Johnsons also reported the alleged pesticide drift to their organic certifying agent, the Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA), as they were required to do under the NOP. In an August 27, 2007 letter, the OCIA stated that there may have been chemical drift onto a transitional soybean field and that chemical testing was being done. The Johnsons were also told that “[i]f the analysis indicate[d] contamination,” they would have to “take this land back to the beginning of 36-month transition.” Based on the OCIA’s letter, and the dicamba found by the MDA, the Johnsons took the transitional soybean field back to the beginning of the 3-year transition process. In other words, the Johnsons did not market soybeans harvested from this field as organic for an additional 3 years.</p>
<p id="c5721152-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On July 3, 2008, the Johnsons reported another incident of alleged contamination to the MDA. The MDA investigator did not observe any plant injury, but chemical testing revealed a minimal amount of glyphosate in the Johnsons’ transitional alfalfa. The Johnsons reported another incident of drift on August 1, 2008. The MDA “did not observe any plant injury to the alfalfa field or plants, grass and weeds,” but chemical testing revealed the presence, at minimal levels, of chloropyrifos. The MDA concluded that drift from the Cooperative’s spraying caused both of the positive test results. After receiving these test results, the Johnsons took the affected alfalfa field out of organic production for an additional 3 years.</p>
<p id="c5721153-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based on the presence of pesticides in their fields, the Johnsons filed this lawsuit against the Cooperative, alleging trespass, nuisance, negligence per se, and battery.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1067A_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1067A_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">5</a></span> They sought damages and a permanent injunction prohibiting the Cooperative from spraying pesticides within a half mile of the Johnsons’ fields.</p>
<p id="c5721155-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a hearing, the district court granted the Cooperative summary judgment on all of the Johnsons’ claims, denied the Johnsons’ motion to amend, and vacated the temporary injunction. The district court concluded that the Johnsons’ trespass claim <span title="365" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-365">p. 365</span>failed as a matter of law, relying on the court of appeals decision in <i>Wendinger v. Forst Farms, Inc</i>., 662 N.W.2d 546, 550 (Minn. App. 2003), which held that Minnesota does not recognize trespass by particulate matter.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1068C_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N1068C_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">6</a></span> The district court also concluded that all of the Johnsons’ negligence per se and nuisance claims failed as a matter of law because the Johnsons lacked evidence of damages. This determination was based on the court’s conclusion that because there was no evidence that any chemical on the Johnsons’ crops exceeded the 5 percent tolerance level in 7 C.F.R. §205.671, the Johnsons could have sold their crops as organic and therefore the Johnsons did not prove damages. Because the Johnsons did not have any “evidence of damages based on the NOP regulations,” the court concluded that all of the Johnsons’ claims must be dismissed.</p>
<p id="c5721157-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals reversed and remanded. We granted the Cooperative’s petition for review.</p>
<p id="c5721158-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>I.</i></p>
<p id="c5721159-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We turn first to the question of whether, as the district court held, the Johnsons’ trespass claim fails as a matter of law. The Johnsons assert that the Cooperative trespassed when it sprayed pesticide onto a neighboring conventional field and wind carried the pesticide, as particulate matter, onto the Johnsons’ land. The Johnsons contend “that as long as there is damage to the land resulting from deposition of particulate matter’ a viable claim for trespass exists.” The Cooperative argues that the invasion of particulate matter does not, as a matter of law, constitute a trespass in Minnesota.</p>
<p id="c572115a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Minnesota, a trespass is committed where a plaintiff has the “right of possession” to the land at issue and there is a “wrongful and unlawful entry upon such possession by defendant.” <i>All Am. Foods, Inc. v. Cnty. of Aitkin</i>, 266 N.W.2d 704, 705 (Minn. 1978). Actual damages are not an element of the tort of trespass. In the absence of actual damages, the trespasser is liable for nominal damages. Finally, because trespass is an intentional tort, reasonableness on the part of the defendant is not a defense to trespass liability.</p>
<p id="c572115b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have not specifically considered the question of whether particulate matter can result in a trespass. The “gist of the tort” of trespass, however, is the “intentional interference with rights of exclusive possession.” Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts §50 at 95 (2000). In other words, the tort of trespass is committed when a person “intentionally enters or causes direct and tangible entry upon the land in possession of another.” <i>Id.</i>, §50 at 95 (footnotes omitted). And the defendant’s entry must be done “by means of some physical, tangible agency” in order to constitute a trespass. James A. Henderson, Jr. et al., The Torts Process 386 (7th ed. 2007). Our case law is consistent with this traditional formulation of trespass because we have recognized that a trespass can occur when a person or tangible object enters the plaintiff’s land.</p>
<p id="c572115c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="366" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-366">p. 366</span>When people or tangible objects enter the plaintiff’s land without permission, these entries disturb the landowner’s right to exclusively possess her land. But the disruption to the landowner’s exclusive possessory interest is not the same when the invasion is committed by an intangible agency, such as the particulate matter at issue here. Such invasions may interfere with the landowner’s use and enjoyment of her land, but those invasions do not require that the landowner share possession of her land in the way that invasions by physical objects do.</p>
<p id="c572386d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals forged new ground in this case and extended Minnesota trespass jurisprudence when it held that a trespass could occur through the entry of intangible objects, such as the particulate matter at issue here. The court looked outside Minnesota to support the holding it reached.</p>
<p id="c572386e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bradley</i> [<i>v. Am. Smelting &amp; Ref. Co</i>., 709 P.2d 782 (1985)], the Washington Supreme Court held that particulate matter deposited on the plaintiff’s land from the defendant’s copper smelter could constitute a trespass. 709 P.2d at 784, 790. And in <i>Borland</i> [<i>v. Sanders Lead Co</i>., 369 So. 2d 523 (Ala. 1979)], the Alabama Supreme Court upheld a trespass claim based on the defendant’s “emission of lead particulates and sulfoxide gases” that the plaintiffs alleged accumulated on their property. 369 So. 2d at 525-26.</p>
<p id="c572386f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he expansion of the tort of trespass in cases such as <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Borland</i> to include invasions by intangible matter potentially “subject[s] countless persons and entities to automatic liability for trespass absent any demonstrated injury.” <i>John Larkin, Inc.</i> [<i>v. Marceau</i>], 959 A.2d 551, 555 (Vt. 2008). To guard against that result, the courts in both <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Borland</i> required that it be reasonably foreseeable that the intangible matter “result in an invasion of plaintiff’s possessory interest,” and that the invasion caused “substantial damages” to the plaintiff’s property. <i>Borland</i>, 369 So. 2d at 529; <i>accord Bradley</i>, 709 P.2d at 791. This formulation of trespass, however, conflicts with our precedent defining the elements of trespass. Under Minnesota trespass law, entry upon the land that interferes with the landowner’s right to exclusive possession results in trespass whether that interference was reasonably foreseeable or whether it caused damages.</p>
<p id="c5723870-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not only is the rule from the <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Borland</i> courts inconsistent with our trespass precedent, but the rule in those cases also blurs the line between trespass and nuisance. Traditionally, trespasses are distinct from nuisances: “[t]he law of nuisance deals with indirect or intangible interference with an owner’s use and enjoyment of land, while trespass deals with direct and tangible interferences with the right to exclusive possession of land.” Dobbs, <i>supra</i>, §50 at 96. But in cases like <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Borland</i>, the courts “call[ ] the intrusion of harmful microscopic particles” a trespass and not a nuisance, and then “us[e] some of the techniques of nuisance law to weigh the amount and reasonableness of the intrusion.” Dobbs, <i>supra</i>, §50 at 96.</p>
<p id="c5723871-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Johnsons argue that <i>Bradley</i> and <i>Borland</i> reflect the modern view of trespass and urge us to likewise abandon the traditional distinctions between trespass and nuisance when considering invasions by particulate matter. We decline the Johnsons’ invitation to abandon the traditional distinctions between trespass and nuisance law. Our trespass jurisprudence recognizes the unconditional right of property owners to <span title="367" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-367">p. 367</span>exclude others through the ability to maintain an action in trespass even when no damages are provable. The rule the Johnsons advocate, and that the court of appeals adopted, erodes this right because it imposes on the property owner the obligation to demonstrate that the invasion causes some consequence. Imposing this restriction on a trespass claim is inconsistent with our precedent that provides a remedy to a property owner “for any trivial trespass.” <i>Romans</i> [<i>v. Nadler</i>], 14 N.W.2d 482, 486 (Minn. 1944). Moreover, it is not necessary for us to depart from our traditional understanding of trespass because other causes of action — nuisance and negligence — provide remedies for the type of behavior at issue in this case.</p>
<p id="c5723872-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Johnsons’ claim is that the Cooperative’s actions have prevented them from using their land as an organic farm, not that any action of the Cooperative has prevented the Johnsons from possessing any part of their land. The Johnsons’ claim is one for nuisance, not trespass. We therefore hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the Johnsons’ trespass claim failed as a matter of law.</p>

<p id="c5723874-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that the Johnsons’ trespass claim fails as a matter of law, we turn next to their nuisance and negligence per se claims. The Johnsons allege that the pesticide drift from the Cooperative’s spraying constituted a nuisance because it caused an interference with their use and enjoyment of their land. The Johnsons also allege that the pesticide drift constitutes negligence per se, asserting that the Cooperative violated Minn. Stat. §18B.07 (2010) by “direct[ing] . . . pesticide[s] onto property beyond the boundaries of the target site,” using the pesticides in a manner inconsistent with their labels, and endangering the Johnsons’ agricultural products. The Johnsons seek loss of profits under both the nuisance and negligence per se claims based on their alleged inability to market their crops as organic under 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b). In addition, the Johnsons claim damages for actual crop losses, inconvenience, and adverse health effects.</p>
<p id="c5723875-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court dismissed the Johnsons’ nuisance and negligence per se claims because the court concluded that the Johnsons had not proven damages. Specifically, the court concluded that the Johnsons had no evidence of damages “from any alleged drift because there is no evidence said drift caused [the Johnsons] to lose their organic certification and there is no evidence that [the Johnsons] could not still sell their crops as organic since the levels of prohibited substances were below the applicable tolerance levels.” Based on this conclusion, the court granted the Cooperative summary judgment and dismissed the Johnsons’ nuisance and negligence per se claims.</p>
<p id="c5723876-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A.</i></p>
<p id="c5725f87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Johnsons argue that they had to remove certain fields from organic production for 3 years because pesticides were “applied to” those fields in violation of 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b). As a result, the Johnsons claim they lost the ability to market crops from that field as organic, and therefore lost the opportunity to seek the premium prices commanded by organic products. For its part, the Cooperative argues that the phrase “applied to it” in 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b), unambiguously means that the organic farmer <span title="368" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-368">p. 368</span>intentionally applied the prohibited substance to the field. Because the Johnsons did not apply pesticides to the field, the Cooperative argues that section 205.202(b) does not restrict the Johnsons’ sale of organic products.</p>
<p id="c5725f88-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we read the phrase “applied to it” in 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b), within the context of the OFPA’s focus on regulating the practices of the producer of organic products, we conclude that this phrase unambiguously regulates behavior by the producer. In other words, in order for products to be sold as organic, the organic farmer must not have applied prohibited substances to the field from which the product was harvested for a period of 3 years preceding the harvest.</p>
<p id="c5725f89-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Johnsons read section 205.202(b), any amount of pesticide, no matter how it came into contact with the field, would require that the field be taken out of organic production for 3 years. [T]he OFPA and NOP would not need a provision allowing crops with minimum levels of pesticide on them (i.e., less than 5 percent) to be sold as organic because such crops would necessarily have been harvested from fields ineligible for organic production. We are not to adopt an interpretation that renders one section of the regulatory scheme a nullity. <i>See Markham v. Cabell</i>, 326 U.S. 404, 409 (1945).</p>
<p id="c5725f8a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having concluded that “applied to it” refers to situations where the producer has applied prohibited substances to the field, we must consider whether the district court correctly dismissed the Johnsons’ nuisance and negligence per se claims based on 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b). In other words, the question presented is whether the Johnsons created an issue for trial that the Cooperative’s pesticide drift required the Johnsons to remove their field from organic production due to 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b). We conclude that they did not.</p>
<p id="c5725f8b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Johnsons, their certifying agent, OCIA, directed them to take their soybean fields out of organic production for 3 years. But any such directive was inconsistent with the plain language of 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b). It was also inconsistent with the OFPA because the Johnsons presented no evidence that any residue exceeded the 5 percent tolerance level in 7 C.F.R. §205.671. The certifying agent’s erroneous interpretation of section 205.202(b) and the OFPA was the proximate cause of the Johnsons’ injury, but the Johnsons cannot hold the Cooperative liable for the certifying agent’s erroneous interpretation of the law. The Johnsons’ remedy for the certifying agent’s error was an appeal of that determination because it was “inconsistent with the” OFPA. 7 U.S.C. §6520(a)(2).</p>

<p id="c5725f8d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our conclusion that the district court properly dismissed the Johnsons’ negligence per se and nuisance claims based on 7 C.F.R. §205.202(b), does not, however, end our analysis of those claims. [T]he Johnsons claim that the MDA required them to destroy a portion of their transitional soybeans affected by the alleged 2007 drift because of “the presence of dicamba” on and “visual damage” to the soybeans. The Johnsons argue that the Cooperative is liable, under nuisance and negligence per se theories, for damages resulting from the destruction of these soybeans. Because the district court failed to address whether there were any genuine issues of material fact on this aspect <span title="369" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-369">p. 369</span>of the Johnsons’ nuisance and negligence per se claims, we hold that the court erred when it dismissed these claims.</p>
<p id="c5725f8e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the Johnsons’ nuisance claim alleges that pesticides below the recommended dosage can spur weed growth and that they have had to take extra measures to control weeds in 2007 and 2008 as a result of drift onto their fields from the Cooperative’s actions. They also contend that the drift caused additional record-keeping and other burdens in connection with the operation of their farm. Finally, they allege that Oluf Johnson suffers from “cotton mouth, swollen throat and headaches” when exposed to pesticide drift. In <i>Highview North Apartments v. County of Ramsey</i>, we held that “disruption and inconvenience” caused by a nuisance are actionable damages. 323 N.W.2d 65, 73 (Minn. 1982). The “inconvenience” and adverse health effects the Johnsons allege are the type of claims contemplated in <i>Highview North Apartments</i>, and if proven, they may affect the Johnsons’ ability to use and enjoy their land and thereby constitute a nuisance. <i>See</i> Minn. Stat. §561.01. Because the district court failed to address whether there are any genuine issues of material fact on this aspect of the Johnsons’ nuisance claim, we hold that the court erred when it dismissed the nuisance claim.</p></div></div>

<div class="epub-heading cc-font-xlarge left"><h3><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5725f90-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Notes and Questions</p></h3></div>
<p id="c5725f91-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Nuisance and trespass.</b> Some harms that were traditionally not counted as trespasses clearly involve the physical invasion of land. For example, air pollution involves the physical invasion of land by smoke particles, but it has usually been characterized as a nuisance rather than a trespass. And courts have sometimes used principles drawn from nuisance law to analyze whether an injunction is the appropriate for repeated, low-grade trespasses.<i> See, e.g.</i>, <i>Casteel v. Town of Afton</i>, 287 N.W. 245 (Iowa 1939).</p>
<p id="c57285a2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts have tried to distinguish trespass from nuisance by arguing that a trespass must be “direct,” such as a bullet fired across land, and that smoke particles carried by the wind constitute an “indirect” invasion and therefore do not qualify as an intentional invasion. Other courts have sometimes held that trespass requires invasion by physical objects that are larger than microscopic particles. But the trend is to focus not so much on the size of the particles as on the nature of the interest the plaintiff is asserting. According to Prosser and Keeton,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c57285a3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]respass is an invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in the exclusive possession of his land, while nuisance is an interference with his use and enjoyment of it. The difference is that between walking across his lawn and establishing a bawdy house next door; between felling a tree across his boundary line and keeping him awake at night with the noise of a rolling mill.</p>
</div>
<p id="c57285a4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts §87, at 622. In other words, the interest being protected by trespass law is the plaintiff’s possessory interest in the land. Nuisance concerns one owner’s use of her own land that interferes with her neighbor’s use and enjoyment of his property. The interest being protected is not the right to exclusive possession but instead the right to quiet enjoyment of the land.</p>
<p id="c57285a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="370" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-370">p. 370</span>Under this interest-focused approach, we might conceivably understand the same invasion of a plaintiff’s property by particles as both a trespass and a nuisance, or as either of the two. <i>See, e.g., Amaral v. Cuppels</i>, 831 N.E.2d 915 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005);<i> H.E. Stevenson et al. v. E.I. Du</i><i>p</i><i>ont de Nemours,</i> 327 F.3d 400 (5th Cir. 2003) (applying Texas law); <i>Gill v. LDI</i>, 19 F. Supp. 2d 1188 (W.D. Wash. 1998); <i>Hoery v. United States</i>, 64 P.3d 214 (Colo. 2003); <i>New York v. Fermenta ASC Corp.</i>, 630 N.Y.S.2d 884 (Sup. Ct. 1995). For example, in <i>Bradley v. American Smelting &amp; Refining Co.</i>, 709 P.2d 782 (Wash. 1985), which the court discussed in <i>Johnson</i>, the Washington Supreme Court allowed plaintiffs to proceed on both trespass and nuisance claims against a factory emitting arsenic and cadmium that fell on plaintiffs’ land. However, the court in <i>Bradley</i> made two significant changes in trespass law as it applied to microscopic particles. It held, first, that a trespass could occur only if the particles fell to the ground and stayed there rather than dissipating through the air. Second, the court held that liability for trespass by such particles could be found only if plaintiffs could prove substantial damage. The court justified this change by arguing that a “reconciliation must be found between the interest of the many who are unaffected by the possible poisoning and the few who may be affected.” 709 P.2d at 785. It further explained that “[n]o useful purpose would be served by sanctioning actions in trespass by every landowner within a hundred miles of a manufacturing plant. Manufacturers would be harassed and the litigious few would cause the escalation of costs to the detriment of the many.” <i>Id</i>. at 791. <i>Accord, Public Service Co. of Colorado v. Van Wyck</i>, 27 P.3d 377, 390 (Colo. 2001) (“[I]n Colorado, an intangible intrusion may give rise to claim for trespass, but only if an aggrieved party is able to prove physical damage to the property caused by such intangible intrusion”). In light of these modifications of traditional trespass law by the court in <i>Bradley</i>, what is the benefit (if any) of characterizing a claim as a trespass by microscopic particles rather than as a traditional nuisance claim? Other courts, like the court in <i>Johnson</i>, reject the <i>Bradley</i> approach, holding instead that physical invasion by dust, noise, and vibration does not constitute a trespass, although it may well be a nuisance. <i>See, e.g., Adams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co</i>., 602 N.W.2d 215 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999).</p>

<p id="c572acc4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this action, plaintiff-appellee sought to enjoin the defendants-appellants from proceeding with the construction of the addition to the Fontainebleau (it appears to have been roughly eight stories high at the time suit was filed), alleging that the construction would interfere with the light and air on the beach in front of the Eden Roc and cast a shadow of such size as to render the beach wholly unfitted for the use and enjoyment of its guests, to the irreparable injury of the plaintiff; further, that the construction of such addition on the north side of defendants’ property, rather than the south side, was actuated by malice and ill will on the part of the defendants’ president toward the plaintiff’s president; and that the construction was in violation of a building ordinance requiring a 100-foot setback from the ocean.

<p id="c572acc5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants’ answer denied the material allegations of the complaint, pleaded laches and estoppel by judgment.</p>
<p id="c572acc6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The chancellor heard considerable testimony on the issues made by the complaint and the answer and, as noted, entered a temporary injunction restraining the defendants from continuing with the construction of the addition.

In this case it is clear from the evidence that the proposed use by the Fontainebleau will materially damage the Eden Roc. There is evidence indicating that the construction of the proposed annex by the Fontainebleau is malicious or deliberate for the purpose of injuring the Eden Roc, but it is scarcely sufficient, standing alone, to afford a basis for equitable relief.</p>
</div>
<p id="c572acc8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is indeed a novel application of the maxim <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>. This maxim does not mean that one must never use his own property in such a way as to do any injury to his neighbor. It means only that one must use his property so as not to injure the lawful <i>rights</i> of another. In <i>Reaver v. Martin Theatres</i>, 52 So. 2d 682, 683 (Fla. 1951), under this maxim, it was stated that “it is well settled that a property owner may put his own property to any reasonable and lawful use, so long as he does not thereby deprive the adjoining landowner of any right of enjoyment of his property <i>which is recognized and protected by law, and so long as his use is not such a one as the law will pronounce a nuisance</i>.” [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
<p id="c572d3d9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No American decision has been cited, and independent research has revealed none, in which it has been held that — in the absence of some contractual or statutory obligation — a landowner has a legal right to the free flow of light and air across the adjoining land of his neighbor. Even at common law, the landowner had no legal right, in the absence of an easement or uninterrupted use and enjoyment for a period of 20 years, to unobstructed light and air from the adjoining land. And the English doctrine of “ancient lights” has been unanimously repudiated in this country.</p>
<p id="c572d3da-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There being, then, no legal right to the free flow of light and air from the adjoining land, it is universally held that where a structure serves a useful and beneficial purpose, it does not give rise to a cause of action, either for damages or for an injunction under the maxim <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>, even though it causes injury to another by cutting off the light and air and interfering with the view that would otherwise be available over adjoining land in its natural state, regardless of the fact that the structure may have been erected partly for spite.</p>
<p id="c572d3db-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no reason for departing from this universal rule.

But to change the universal rule — and the custom followed in this state since its inception — that adjoining landowners have an equal right under the law to build to the line of their respective tracts and to such a height as is desired by them (in the absence, of course, of building restrictions or regulations) amounts, in our opinion, to judicial legislation.</p>

This case thus involves a conflict between one landowner (Glenn Prah, the plaintiff) interested in unobstructed access to sunlight across adjoining property as a natural source of energy and an adjoining landowner (Richard D. Maretti, the defendant) interested in the development of his land.</p>
<p id="c572d3e3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the complaint, the plaintiff is the owner of a residence which was constructed during the years 1978-1979. The complaint alleges that the residence has a solar system which includes collectors on the roof to supply energy for heat and hot water and that after the plaintiff built his solar-heated house, the defendant purchased the lot adjacent to and immediately to the south of the plaintiff’s lot and commenced planning construction of a home. The complaint further states that when the plaintiff learned of defendant’s plans to build the house he advised the defendant that if the house were built at the proposed location, defendant’s house would substantially and adversely affect the integrity of plaintiff’s solar system and could cause plaintiff other damage. Nevertheless, the defendant began construction. The complaint further alleges that the plaintiff is entitled to “unrestricted use of the sun and its solar power” and demands judgment for injunctive relief and damages.</p>
<p id="c572d3e4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff’s home was the first residence built in the subdivision, and although plaintiff did not build his house in the center of the lot it was built in accordance with applicable restrictions. Plaintiff advised defendant that if the defendant’s home were built at the proposed site it would cause a shadowing effect on the solar collectors which would reduce the efficiency of the system and possibly damage the system. To avoid these adverse effects, plaintiff requested defendant to locate his home an additional <span title="374" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-374">p. 374</span>several feet away from the plaintiff’s lot line, the exact number being disputed. Plaintiff and defendant failed to reach an agreement on the location of defendant’s home before defendant started construction.</p>
<p id="c572d3e5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We consider first whether the complaint states a claim for relief based on common law private nuisance. This state has long recognized that an owner of land does not have an absolute or unlimited right to use the land in a way which injures the rights of others. The rights of neighboring landowners are relative; the uses by one must not unreasonably impair the uses or enjoyment of the other. When one landowner’s use of his or her property unreasonably interferes with another’s enjoyment of his or her property, that use is said to be a private nuisance.</p>
<p id="c572d3e6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The private nuisance doctrine has traditionally been employed in this state to balance the rights of landowners, and this court has recently adopted the analysis of private nuisance set forth in the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts.</i> The <i>Restatement</i> defines private nuisance as “a nontrespassory invasion of another’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.” <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §821D (1977). The phrase “interest in the private use and enjoyment of land” as used in §821D is broadly defined to include any disturbance of the enjoyment of property.</p>
<p id="c572d3e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the defendant’s obstruction of the plaintiff’s access to sunlight appears to fall within the <i>Restatement</i>’s broad concept of a private nuisance as a nontrespassory invasion of another’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land, the defendant asserts that he has a right to develop his property in compliance with statutes, ordinances and private covenants without regard to the effect of such development upon the plaintiff’s access to sunlight. In essence, the defendant is asking this court to hold that the private nuisance doctrine is not applicable in the instant case and that his right to develop his land is a right which is <i>per se</i> superior to his neighbor’s interest in access to sunlight. This position is expressed in the maxim “cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos,” that is, the owner of land owns up to the sky and down to the center of the earth. The rights of the surface owner are, however, not unlimited.</p>
<p id="c572d3e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant is not completely correct in asserting that the common law did not protect a landowner’s access to sunlight across adjoining property. At English common law a landowner could acquire a right to receive sunlight across adjoining land by both express agreement and under the judge-made doctrine of “ancient lights.” Under the doctrine of ancient lights if the landowner had received sunlight across adjoining property for a specified period of time, the landowner was entitled to continue to receive unobstructed access to sunlight across the adjoining property. Under the doctrine the landowner acquired a negative prescriptive easement and could prevent the adjoining landowner from obstructing access to light.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10898_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10898_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">7</a></span></p>
<p id="c572d3ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although American courts have not been as receptive to protecting a landowner’s access to sunlight as the English courts, American courts have afforded some protection to a landowner’s interest in access to sunlight. American courts honor express easements to sunlight. American courts initially enforced the English common law <span title="375" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-375">p. 375</span>doctrine of ancient lights, but later every state which considered the doctrine repudiated it as inconsistent with the needs of a developing country. Indeed, for just that reason this court concluded that an easement to light and air over adjacent property could not be created or acquired by prescription and has been unwilling to recognize such an easement by implication.</p>
<p id="c572d3eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many jurisdictions in this country have protected a landowner from malicious obstruction of access to light (the spite fence cases) under the common law private nuisance doctrine. If an activity is motivated by malice it lacks utility and the harm it causes others outweighs any social values. . . . Thus a landowner’s interest in sunlight has been protected in this country by common law private nuisance law at least in the narrow context of the modern American rule invalidating spite fences.</p>
<p id="c572fafc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This court’s reluctance in the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century to provide broader protection for a landowner’s access to sunlight was premised on three policy considerations. First, the right of landowners to use their property as they wished, as long as they did not cause physical damage to a neighbor, was jealously guarded.</p>
<p id="c572fafd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, sunlight was valued only for aesthetic enjoyment or as illumination. Since artificial light could be used for illumination, loss of sunlight was at most a personal annoyance which was given little, if any, weight by society.</p>
<p id="c572fafe-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, society had a significant interest in not restricting or impeding land development. This court repeatedly emphasized that in the growth period of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries change is to be expected and is essential to property and that recognition of a right to sunlight would hinder property development.</p>
<p id="c572faff-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considering these three policies, this court concluded that in the absence of an express agreement granting access to sunlight, a landowner’s obstruction of another’s access to sunlight was not actionable. These three policies are no longer fully accepted or applicable. They reflect factual circumstances and social priorities that are now obsolete.</p>
<p id="c572fb00-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, society has increasingly regulated the use of land by the landowner for the general welfare.</p>
<p id="c572fb01-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, access to sunlight has taken on a new significance in recent years. In this case the plaintiff seeks to protect access to sunlight, not for aesthetic reasons or as a source of illumination but as a source of energy. Access to sunlight as an energy source is of significance both to the landowner who invests in solar collectors and to a society which has an interest in developing alternative sources of energy.</p>
<p id="c572fb02-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, the policy of favoring unhindered private development in an expanding economy is no longer in harmony with the realities of our society. The need for easy and rapid development is not as great today as it once was, while our perception of the value of sunlight as a source of energy has increased significantly.</p>
<p id="c572fb03-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts should not implement obsolete policies that have lost their vigor over the course of the years. The law of private nuisance is better suited to resolve landowners’ disputes about property development in the 1980’s than is a rigid rule which does not recognize a landowner’s interest in access to sunlight. As we said in <i>Ballstadt v. Pagel</i>, 232 N.W. 862 (Wis. 1930), “What is regarded in law as constituting a nuisance in <span title="376" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-376">p. 376</span>modern times would no doubt have been tolerated without question in former times.” We read <i>State v. Deetz</i>, 224 N.W.2d 407 (Wis. 1974), as an endorsement of the application of common law nuisance to situations involving the conflicting interests of landowners and as rejecting per se exclusions to the nuisance law reasonable use doctrine.</p>
<p id="c572fb04-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Deetz</i> the court abandoned the rigid common law common enemy rule with respect to surface water and adopted the private nuisance reasonable use rule, namely that the landowner is subject to liability if his or her interference with the flow of surface waters unreasonably invades a neighbor’s interest in the use and enjoyment of land. <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i>, §§822, 826, 829 (1977). This court concluded that the common enemy rule which served society “well in the days of burgeoning national expansion of the mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries” should be abandoned because it was no longer “in harmony with the realities of our society.” <i>Deetz</i>, <i>supra</i>, 224 N.W.2d 407. We recognized in <i>Deetz</i> that common law rules adapt to changing social values and conditions.</p>
<p id="c572fb05-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet the defendant would have us ignore the flexible private nuisance law as a means of resolving the dispute between the landowners in this case and would have us adopt an approach, already abandoned in <i>Deetz</i>, of favoring the unrestricted development of land and of applying a rigid and inflexible rule protecting his right to build on his land and disregarding any interest of the plaintiff in the use and enjoyment of his land. This we refuse to do.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108E9_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N108E9_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span></p>
<p id="c572fb08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Private nuisance law, the law traditionally used to adjudicate conflicts between private landowners, has the flexibility to protect both a landowner’s right of access to sunlight and another landowner’s right to develop land. Private nuisance law is better suited to regulate access to sunlight in modern society and is more in harmony with legislative policy and the prior decisions of this court than is an inflexible doctrine of non-recognition of any interest in access to sunlight across adjoining land.</p>
<p id="c572fb09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We therefore hold that private nuisance law, that is, the reasonable use doctrine as set forth in the <i>Restatement</i>, is applicable to the instant case. Recognition of a nuisance claim for unreasonable obstruction of access to sunlight will not prevent land development or unduly hinder the use of adjoining land. It will promote the reasonable use and enjoyment of land in a manner suitable to the 1980’s. That obstruction of access to light might be found to constitute a nuisance in certain circumstances does not mean that it will be or must be found to constitute a nuisance under all circumstances. The result in each case depends on whether the conduct complained of is unreasonable.</p>
<p id="c572fb0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="377" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-377">p. 377</span>Accordingly we hold that the plaintiff in this case has stated a claim under which relief can be granted. Nonetheless we do not determine whether the plaintiff in this case is entitled to relief. In order to be entitled to relief the plaintiff must prove the elements required to establish actionable nuisance, and the conduct of the defendant herein must be judged by the reasonable use doctrine.</p>
<p id="c572fb0b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The circuit court concluded that because the defendant’s proposed house was in conformity with zoning regulations, building codes and deed restrictions, the defendant’s use of the land was reasonable. This court has concluded that a landowner’s compliance with zoning laws does not automatically bar a nuisance claim.</p>
<p id="c572fb0c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[O]ur examination of the record leads us to conclude that the record does not furnish an adequate basis for the circuit court to apply the proper legal principles on summary judgment. The application of the reasonable use standard in nuisance cases normally requires a full exposition of all underlying facts and circumstances. Too little is known in this case of such matters as the extent of the harm to the plaintiff, the suitability of solar heat in that neighborhood, the availability of remedies to the plaintiff, and the costs to the defendant of avoiding the harm. Summary judgment is not an appropriate procedural vehicle in this case when the circuit court must weigh evidence which has not been presented at trial.</p>
<p id="c572fb0d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the plaintiff has stated a claim of common law private nuisance upon which relief can be granted, the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>

<p id="c572fb0f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority concludes that this court’s past reluctance to extend protection to a landowner’s access to sunlight beyond the spite fence cases is based on obsolete policies which have lost their vigor over the course of the years. The three obsolete policies cited by the majority are: (1) Right of landowners to use their property as they desire as long as no physical damage is done to a neighbor; (2) In the past, sunlight was valued only for aesthetic value, not a source of energy; and (3) Society has a significant interest in not impeding land development. . . . The majority has failed to convince me that these policies are obsolete.</p>
<p id="c5732220-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I firmly believe that a landowner’s right to use his property within the limits of ordinances, statutes, and restrictions of record where such use is necessary to serve his legitimate needs is a fundamental precept of a free society which this court should strive to uphold.</p>
<p id="c5732221-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case, we are dealing with an action which seeks to restrict the defendant’s private right to use his property, notwithstanding a complete lack of notice of restriction to the defendant and the defendant’s compliance with applicable ordinances and statutes. The plaintiff who knew of the potential problem before the defendant acquired the land seeks to impose such use restriction to accommodate his personal, private benefit — a benefit which could have been accommodated by the plaintiff locating his home in a different place on his property or by acquiring the land in question when it was for sale prior to its acquisition by the defendant.</p>
<p id="c5732222-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The right of a property owner to lawful enjoyment of his property should be vigorously protected, particularly in those cases where the adjacent property owner could <span title="378" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-378">p. 378</span>have insulated himself from the alleged problem by acquiring the land as a defense to the potential problem or by provident use of his own property.</p>
<p id="c5732223-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority concludes that sunlight has not heretofore been accorded the status of a source of energy, and consequently it has taken on a new significance in recent years. Solar energy for home heating is at this time sparingly used and of questionable economic value because solar collectors are not mass produced, and consequently, they are very costly. Their limited efficiency may explain the lack of production.</p>
<p id="c5732224-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Regarding the third policy the majority apparently believes is obsolete (that society has a significant interest in not restricting land development) . . . , I concede the law may be tending to recognize the value of aesthetics over increased volume development and that an individual may not use his land in such a way as to harm the public. The instant case, however, deals with a private benefit. [At the same time, it] is clear that community planners are acutely aware of the present housing shortages, particularly among those two groups with limited financial resources, the young and the elderly. While the majority’s policy arguments may be directed to a cause of action for public nuisance, we are presented with a private nuisance case which I believe is distinguishable in this regard.</p>
<p id="c5732225-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would submit that any policy decisions in this area are best left for the legislature. “What is desirable’ or advisable’ or ought to be’ is a question of policy, not a question of fact. What is necessary’ or what is in the best interest’ is not a fact and its determination by the judiciary is an exercise of legislative power when each involves political considerations.” <i>In re City of Beloit,</i> 155 N.W.2d 633, 636 (Wis. 1968). . . . I would concur with these observations of the trial judge: “While temptation lingers for the court to declare by judicial fiat what is right and what should be done, under the facts in this case, such action under our form of constitutional government where the three branches each have their defined jurisdiction and power, would be an intrusion of judicial egoism over legislative passivity.”</p>
<p id="c5732226-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order for a nuisance to be actionable in the instant case, the defendant’s conduct must be “intentional and unreasonable.” It is impossible for me to accept the majority’s conclusion that Mr. Maretti, in lawfully seeking to construct his home, may be intentionally and unreasonably interfering with the plaintiff’s access to sunlight.</p>
<p id="c5732227-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I conclude that plaintiff’s solar heating system is an unusually sensitive use. In other words, the defendant’s proposed construction of his home, under ordinary circumstances, would not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the usual person’s property. . . . “The plaintiff cannot, by devoting his own land to an unusually sensitive use, such as a drive-in motion picture theater easily affected by light, make a nuisance out of conduct of the adjoining defendant which would otherwise be harmless.”</p>
<p id="c5732228-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I further believe that the majority’s conclusion that a cause of action exists in this case thwarts the very foundation of property law. Property law encompasses a system of filing and notice in a place for public records to provide prospective purchasers with any limitations on their use of the property. Such a notice is not alleged by the plaintiff. Only as a result of the majority’s decision did Mr. Maretti discover that a legitimate action exists which would require him to defend the design and location of his home against a nuisance suit, notwithstanding the fact that he located and began to build his house within the applicable building, municipal, and deed restrictions.</p>
<p id="c5732229-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="379" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-379">p. 379</span>I believe the facts of the instant controversy present the classic case of the owner of a solar collector who fails to take any action to protect his investment. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Prah disclosed his situation to Mr. Maretti prior to Maretti’s purchase of the lot or attempted to secure protection for his solar collector prior to Maretti’s submission of his building plans to the architectural committee. Such inaction should be considered a significant factor in determining whether a cause of action exists.</p>
<p id="c573222a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I do not believe that an adjacent lot owner should be obliged to experience the substantial economic loss resulting from the lot being rendered unbuildable by the contour of the land as it relates to the location and design of the adjoining home using solar collectors.</p></div></div>

<p id="c573222d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Light and air.</b> The vast majority of courts in the United States would hold that, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, owners have absolute rights to develop their property without liability for any interference with their neighbor’s interests in light and air. <i>See also</i> Sara C. Bronin, <i>Solar Rights</i>, 89 B.U. L. Rev. 1217, 1250-1257 (2009) (describing general failure of nuisance claims to permit solar power). This is often expressed by saying that no easement for light and air exists unless a contract creates it. One exception to this principle is that some courts will enjoin “spite fences” — structures that are erected for the <i>sole purpose</i> of maliciously harming the neighbor by interfering with her access to sunlight. <i>DeCecco v. Beach,</i> 381 A.2d 543 (Conn. 1977) (applying Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-570); <i>Gertz v. Estes</i>, 879 N.E.2d 617 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008) (applying Ind. Code §§32-26-10-1 and -2). <i>But see Maioriello v. Arlotta</i>, 73 A.2d 374 (Pa. 1950) (holding that owners may build so as to obstruct light, air, and view of adjoining landowners, even though the structure serves no useful purpose and is erected solely to annoy the adjoining owner).</p>
<p id="c573493e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another state that has joined the Wisconsin Supreme Court in using nuisance doctrine to adjudicate conflicts over light and air in some instances is New Hampshire. In <i>Tenn v. 889 Associates, Ltd.</i>, 500 A.2d 366 (N.H. 1985), for example, Justice David Souter applied nuisance law to a claim that construction of a building would interfere with light and air of the building next to it. Explicitly rejecting the rule in <i>Fontainebleau</i>, Justice Souter wrote:</p>

<p id="c573493f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present defendant urges us to adopt the <i>Fontainebleau</i> rule and thereby to refuse any common law recognition to interests in light and air, but we decline to do so. If we were so to limit the ability of the common law to grow, we would in effect be rejecting one of the wise assumptions underlying the traditional law of nuisance: that we cannot anticipate at any one time the variety of predicaments in which protection of property interests or redress for their violation will be justifiable. For it is just this recognition that has led the courts to avoid rigid formulations for determining when an interference with the use of property will be actionable, and to rest instead on the flexible rule that actionable, private nuisance consists of an unreasonable as well as a substantial interference with another person’s use and enjoyment of his property. That is, because we <span title="380" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-380">p. 380</span>have to anticipate that the uses of property will change over time, we have developed a law of nuisance that protects the use and enjoyment of property when a threatened harm to the plaintiff owner can be said to outweigh the utility of the defendant owner’s conduct to himself and to the community.</p>

<p id="c5734945-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Economists recognize different definitions of the term <b>efficiency</b>. An action is <b>Pareto efficient</b> if it makes someone better off without making anyone worse off. Perfectly voluntary transactions are considered Pareto efficient. Economic analysis of law, however, often uses <b>Kaldor-Hicks efficiency</b>, which defines an action as efficient if its benefits outweigh its costs, even if someone is made worse off.</p>

<p id="c5734946-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Externalities.</b> Economic analysis of law seeks to identify the most efficient rule of law, generally by evaluating the costs and benefits of different alternatives. Traditional analysis of efficiency in nuisance cases starts from the notion of externalities. <b>Externalities</b> are costs imposed on third parties that are not taken into account in the actor’s own cost-benefit determinations. The factory owner in <i>Boomer</i>, for example, harms neighboring homeowners by causing pollution. This harm is a cost of the factory’s economic activity; it is a loss that must be borne by society as a consequence of operation of the factory. Yet, unless the law intervenes, the factory’s owner will not take account of this cost in determining whether its operations are profitable; a rationally self-interested factory will go forward with the activity even if the net social costs of its activity outweigh the benefits. Classical economic analysis of nuisance sought to make the factory to pay for and thereby <b>internalize</b> the external harms that its operation causes. By requiring the company to account to society for the harm it caused, the factory’s private cost-benefit calculations would be made congruent with the social cost-benefit calculation; its decisions about the level and manner of operation will therefore promote social welfare.</p>
<p id="c5734947-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-381">p. 381</span><b>2. Coase Theorem.</b> In his famous article <i>The Problem of Social Cost</i>, 3 J.L. &amp; Econ. 1 (1960), Ronald Coase criticized the argument that property owners should necessarily be required to internalize their external costs.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5734948-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Joint costs.</b> As discussed in §1, Coase observed that externalities are reciprocal. In <i>Boomer</i>, for example, if the houses were not located near the factory, there would be no problem. It therefore is not obvious that the factory must internalize the costs it imposes. It could as easily be said that the homeowners should internalize the costs of engaging in a sensitive use like homeowning by compensating the factory for its losses associated with shutting down or installing pollution control devices. A better way to understand the situation, Coase argued, is to consider the problem as involving <i>joint costs</i> that each activity imposes on the other. The problem is to determine who should bear the burden of avoiding it.</p>
<p id="c5734949-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Subsequent bargains.</b> Another crucial part of Coase’s analysis is that parties are free to bargain around any legal allocation of entitlements. Even if the court rules that the homeowners have the right to an injunction ordering the factory to stop operating, the factory will not necessarily shut down. Rather, the factory may offer the homeowners a money payment to induce them to sell their property right to enjoin the nuisance. If the factory values the right to pollute more than the homeowners value the right to be free from pollution, the factory owner will be able to offer the homeowners enough to persuade them to forgo their right to be free from pollution. Similarly, if the court rules that the factory operation is not a nuisance, the homeowners may attempt to pay the factory owner to induce it not to exercise its right to operate the factory. They will succeed if they value the right to be free from pollution more highly than the factory owner values the right to pollute.</p>
<p id="c573494a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the costs of transacting are zero, then the choice of legal rules or the allocation of the entitlement in question will arguably have no effect on allocative efficiency. Whoever values the entitlement more will either keep it — if they already own it — or will buy it from the other party. This is part I of the Coase Theorem: <i>If there are no transaction costs, it does not matter which legal rule is chosen because any legal rule will produce an efficient result</i>.</p>
<p id="c573705b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Take the case of <i>Fontainebleau Hotel Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc</i>. The legal issue is whether the Fontainebleau Hotel has a legal liberty to build an addition onto its hotel that would cast a shadow over the swimming pool of the Eden Roc. Either the Fontainebleau has an entitlement to build freely, without liability to its neighbor, or the Eden Roc has an entitlement to be free from wrongful interference with its light and air. Assume the Fontainebleau Hotel anticipates that its profits will rise if it builds the addition both because it can accommodate more people and because it will increase the demand for rooms at the Fontainebleau by decreasing the number of people willing to take rooms at the Eden Roc. This anticipated rise in profits translates into a $10 million increase in the market value of the Fontainebleau’s property. At the same time, if the addition is built, the Eden Roc will suffer a decrease of $6 million in the market value of its property. Assuming that no third parties are affected by this decision (an unrealistic but simplifying <span title="382" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-382">p. 382</span>assumption), social wealth will be increased by allowing the addition to be built. It will cause $10 million of benefit and only $6 million of harm, making society better off overall by $4 million.</p>
<p id="c573705c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the transaction costs are zero, the Fontainebleau will go ahead and build the addition. If the court holds that the addition is a nuisance and that the Eden Roc has the right to an injunction stopping the addition, the parties will bargain around this result, since the Fontainebleau stands to gain $10 million if the addition is built while the Eden Roc will lose only $6 million. If the Fontainebleau offers the Eden Roc any amount over $6 million, the Eden Roc will be better off accepting the money and selling to the Fontainebleau the right to build without liability than it would be by blocking the addition. A payment of more than $6 million will fully compensate the Eden Roc for the losses associated with the addition; in theory, there should be no difference between not having the addition built and having the addition built with a $6 million payment. Any money offered over $6 million will leave the Eden Roc better off than before.</p>
<p id="c573705d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, so long as the Fontainebleau makes a payment under $10 million, it will be better off building the addition while paying the Eden Roc to induce it to give up its nuisance claim than not going ahead with the project. The costs of paying off the Eden Roc will be less than the benefits of constructing the addition. Thus, in the absence of transaction costs, the parties will agree for some sum between $6 million and $10 million to allow the project to go forward.</p>
<p id="c573705e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the court holds that the addition is not a nuisance, the project will similarly go forward. In this case, the Eden Roc would be willing to offer the Fontainebleau up to $6 million to prevent the building of the addition. Any amount over $6 million would be irrational; the Eden Roc would be worse off than if it paid nothing. It would make no sense to pay $7 million to avoid a $6 million harm. At the same time, the Fontainebleau would not accept any payment under $10 million to give up its right to build. Any payment under $10 million would leave it worse off than if it built the project. Thus, in the absence of transaction costs, the efficient allocation of entitlements is achieved no matter how the court rules.</p>
<p id="c573705f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Distributive issues.</b> Even if the choice of legal rule has no effect on efficiency in the absence of transaction costs, it has an enormous effect on the distribution of wealth between the parties. Efficiency analysis may tell us whether an activity should go forward, but it is not decisive as to who should pay for this outcome. In our example, we have assumed that the project is wealth maximizing because it creates benefits of $10 million and costs of only $6 million; we therefore conclude that the project is efficient and should go forward despite the losses it will inflict on the Eden Roc.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A22_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A22_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span> But efficiency analysis does not tell us who should bear the $6 million cost of obtaining this $10 million benefit. The court could choose to impose the cost either on the plaintiff Eden Roc, by denying the plaintiff any remedy, or on the Fontainebleau, by requiring it to pay damages of $6 million to <span title="383" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-383">p. 383</span>the Eden Roc. As long as damages are calculated correctly,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A2A_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A2A_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span> allowing the plaintiff to receive damages, but not an injunction, will achieve the efficient result because the project will go forward (the cost of the damages are less than the expected profits); at the same time, such a result will achieve the distributive goal of placing the burden on the party that profits from the activity.</p>
<p id="c5737062-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, if the numbers were reversed and the project was inefficient, the court could choose who should bear the economic costs of forgoing the project. Assume the benefits to the Fontainebleau are $6 million and the costs to the Eden Roc are $10 million. In this case, the losses outweigh the benefits and the project will decrease, rather than increase, social wealth; it should therefore be enjoined. Granting the plaintiff an injunction stopping the project will achieve the efficient result. Again, efficiency analysis cannot give us a conclusive answer as to who should pay the costs associated with the injunction. The court could choose to impose the burden on the Fontainebleau by granting the plaintiffs a simple injunction, thereby denying the Fontainebleau the opportunity to make $6 million. Or, the court could impose the cost on the plaintiff by granting the Eden Roc a purchased injunction, conditioning the injunction on the Eden Roc’s compensating the Fontainebleau for the $6 million loss the injunction imposes on it. Only an analysis of distributive justice can tell us who should bear the cost.</p>
<p id="c5737063-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>d. Transaction costs.</b> The observation that the choice of legal rules has no effect on allocative efficiency depends on the assumption that there are no <b>transaction costs</b>, or costs to the parties in reaching an agreement. But there are always transaction costs, as Coase well understood. The legal rule chosen by the court may therefore affect the outcome. If the court chooses the wealth-maximizing entitlement, all well and good from an efficiency standpoint; but if the court chooses the inefficient entitlement, transaction costs may be so high as to prevent the parties from correcting the mistake by a subsequent bargain.</p>
<p id="c5737064-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose an agreement between the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc costs $5 million to reach. This sum includes the cost of conducting the negotiations, hiring attorneys, getting financing to buy off the other party, and bringing into the talks third parties who might be benefited or harmed by construction of the project. If the court grants the Fontainebleau the right to build by holding that the project is not a nuisance, the Fontainebleau will go ahead and build, thereby achieving the efficient result. If, however, the court rules the project a nuisance, thereby assigning the entitlement to the Eden Roc, the project will not go forward: the Eden Roc will not accept less than $6 million to give up its rights to stop the project, and the cost of arranging such a deal is $5 million. The total cost of buying the right to build is therefore $6 million plus $5 million, or $11 million. But the Fontainebleau stands to gain only $10 million by building the addition. It will not pay $11 million to get a $10 million gain; it would be better off not building. This result is inefficient <span title="384" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-384">p. 384</span>since the benefits to society of the project are greater than the costs. This, then, is part II of the Coase Theorem: <i>In the presence of transaction costs, the choice of entitlements by the courts may have an effect on efficiency. The courts may increase efficiency by assigning entitlements to the parties who would purchase them in the absence of transaction costs</i>.</p>
<p id="c5739775-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are several kinds of transaction costs.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A50_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A50_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span> One of the most basic is <b>bargaining costs</b>, costs incurred in finding and negotiating with others. These include the time spent in negotiating and reaching agreement, the cost of getting advice necessary to complete the agreement (such as legal and financial advice), and the costs of generating information necessary to determine whether to go ahead with the deal. They may also include the cost of litigation; as part of the bargaining process, one party may file suit as a way to pressure the other party into reaching an agreement.</p>
<p id="c5739777-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Strategic bargaining costs</b>, including holdout and free rider problems, may also increase the costs of agreement. Strategic bargaining arises when each party attempts to get as much as possible out of the other party by stalling or waiting or otherwise trying to capture the most gains from the deal. <b>Holdout</b> problems arise when one party holds out for more money on the wrongful assumption that the other party is willing to pay more; imperfect information about the other party’s desires may squelch a deal that would be to both parties’ advantage. <b>Free rider</b> problems arise when one party waits for others to take care of the problem; a party may not bring a nuisance suit because it wrongly assumes or hopes that others will bring the suit and pay the costs. Free rider problems are common in fund-raising drives by public television and radio stations; many listeners fail to make a donation because they assume others will do so, thereby enabling the free riders to get something for nothing. Other commonly discussed transaction costs include <b>administrative costs</b> (the costs of litigation or enforcement or even of maintaining a system of property) and <b>agency costs</b> (the costs associated with hiring other people to carry out a task, including the possibility that they may not carry out the employer’s purposes accurately and diligently).</p>
<p id="c5739778-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Transaction costs are likely to be high if the transaction involves a large number of parties. So far, we have assumed that the Eden Roc and the Fontainebleau are the only legal actors affected by the decision to build the addition to the Fontainebleau. This is clearly a false assumption. Whichever way the decision goes, there are many people who will be affected by it, both positively and negatively. Those who will benefit by construction of the addition may include present and future employees and shareholders of the Fontainebleau, the city government (if the project has the effect of increasing tourism and therefore increasing the tax base of the city), other businesses in the city that will provide services to the <span title="385" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-385">p. 385</span>Fontainebleau and its customers, and the families of all the persons benefited by the Fontainebleau’s operations. Those who may be harmed by the project include the shareholders and employees of the Eden Roc (assuming none benefits from the Fontainebleau’s renewed prosperity) and their families, the city government (if the net effect of the project is negatively affecting tax revenues), and citizens who may lose access to part of the beach. The cost of finding all the individuals affected by this dispute, getting them involved in negotiations on one side or the other, and reaching agreement are enormous.</p>
<p id="c5739779-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Transaction costs can also be high when numbers are small. Focus again on just Fontainebleau and Eden Roc. If either party wants to reverse an entitlement awarded by the court, they each have only one party with whom to bargain. If the court awards the entitlement to Eden Roc, the only way for Fontainebleau to get the right to build is to buy it from Eden Roc (and no one else). And, conversely, the only party to whom Eden Roc can sell that entitlement (if it is so inclined) is Fontainebleau, and no one else. Parties in this situation are said to be locked into a <b>bilateral monopoly</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A7E_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10A7E_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span> Although the number of people involved in these negotiations may be small (only two), the bilateral monopoly may generate high transaction costs that make it hard for parties to bargain toward an efficient solution. Each party has an incentive to try to leverage its monopoly position to extract as hard a bargain as it can from the other. In the absence of market competition to discipline these ambitions, the result can be paralysis.</p>
<p id="c573977b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Transaction costs may therefore prevent parties from making mutually beneficial exchanges. Because of the prevalence of these costs, the courts may be able to improve efficiency by paying attention to these and other impediments to bargaining. If the court can both identify relevant transaction costs and make fairly accurate judgments about which party would purchase the entitlement in the absence of these impediments to agreement, it can increase social wealth by assigning the entitlement to the party that would purchase it in the absence of these transaction costs.</p>
<p id="c573977c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>e. Lowest cost avoider.</b> Often the court itself lacks perfect information concerning the wants of the parties. This is because parties have strong incentives to misstate their true valuation of a particular entitlement. Courts attempting to choose legal rules in a way that promotes efficiency therefore may resort to second-best solutions. One is to look to objective measures of value, such as the value of an entitlement on the open market. But claimants may value the entitlement in question more highly than the fair market value. In light of the difficulties of answering the valuation question, a common solution proposed by law and economics scholars is to place the burden either on the party that has access to the best information and the greatest incentives to make a general social cost-benefit analysis or on the party that can avoid the harm at the lowest cost (the so-called <span title="386" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-386">p. 386</span>lowest cost avoider). This is an imperfect solution because the cost of avoiding a harm can be difficult to ascertain in advance.</p>
<p id="c573977d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall Calabresi and Melamed’s distinction between property rules and liability rules, discussed above in §2.2. The concept of transaction costs is relevant to their distinction. If a court can measure damages caused by a behavior more accurately than it can obtain information about who values an entitlement more highly, it can encourage the efficient result by resorting to a liability rule (damage) remedy over a property rule (injunction) remedy. <i>See</i> 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1107-1109. On this assumption, even if the court assigns the entitlement incorrectly, a party who values the entitlement more highly will simply pay the damages remedy and proceed. <i>See id.</i> at 1120. As we have already observed, the liability rule remedy may also have desirable distributive consequences by forcing the party who ultimately gets the entitlement to share the benefits with those who are harmed as a result. Of course, courts cannot be sure that they are measuring harms accurately, and so the possibility of inefficiency still looms large.</p>

<p id="c573be8e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Critiques of (some kinds of) efficiency analysis.</b> Certain common forms of economic analysis of law have been subject to a number of challenges. Below we will examine some of the most important objections.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c573be8f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>a. Efficiency is a function of the initial distribution of wealth.</b> Much economic analysis defines value by reference to willingness and ability to pay. This means, of course, that the preference of those who have more wealth count more in the analysis since their ability to pay is greater than those with less wealth. Determinations of efficiency therefore become a function of the distribution of wealth.</p>
<p id="c573be90-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals is one of the inventors and most influential proponents of the economic analysis of law. Although he justifies the use of wealth maximization as a measure of both social welfare and justice, he notes that reliance on “willingness to pay” as a criterion of value may sometimes conflict with achieving a result that maximizes social utility. He gives an example of a poor person selling a wood carving in order to get money to buy food. The presence of economic inequality, Posner concedes, undermines the “moral foundations” of a social system oriented narrowly toward “efficiency” when that concept is measured by reference to willingness to pay because “the pattern of consumption and production is determined by the distribution of wealth.” Richard Posner, <i>Economic Analysis of Law</i> §1.2, at 15 (9th ed. 2014). Judge Posner notes that “[i]f that distribution is unjust, the pattern of economic activities derived from it will not have a strong claim to be regarded as just either.” <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p id="c573be91-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since efficiency when measured in terms of willingness to pay is a function of the distribution of wealth, it is incomplete as a criterion of justice without a defense of the existing distribution of wealth. Yet economic analysis cannot itself provide such a justification since it determines value by willingness and ability to pay, which in turn is determined by an initial distribution of wealth. <i>Id.</i> For this reason, the initial distribution of wealth or property rights must be justified on other grounds, such as a political theory of justice.</p>
<p id="c573be92-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="387" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-387">p. 387</span>One response to the impact of the existing distribution on willingness to pay is to structure our cost-benefit analysis to weigh costs or benefits felt by the worst-off more heavily than those felt by the best-off. Known as “prioritarianism,” <i>see, e.g.</i>, Matthew D. Adler, <i>Well Being and Fair Distribution</i> 360-367 (2012), this tipping of the scales in favor of the worst-off could generate efficiency judgments that diverge dramatically based on who is affected by a particular activity. If the owners of a factory tend to be well off, and those who live near a factory (and suffer most from its activities) tend to be worse off, a prioritarian standard of efficiency might suggest awarding the entitlement to be free from pollution to the neighbors, even when we are confident that the owners of the factory are willing to pay more for the right to pollute.</p>
<p id="c573be93-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Offer-asking problem.</b> Transaction cost analysis depends on the assumption that it is possible, in most cases, to generate a single answer to the question who values the entitlement more by asking who is likely to end up with it after a bargaining process in the absence of transaction costs. This analysis assumes that, in the absence of transaction costs, the same party will end up with the entitlement no matter who owned the entitlement at the start of the bargaining. Whoever values the entitlement more will either keep it (if she is the initial owner) or buy it (if she is initially the non-owner). This prediction depends on the assumption that offer and asking prices are unlikely to differ very much.</p>
<p id="c573be94-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many scholars argue that this assumption is unwarranted. They suggest that, in many cases, how much a person values an entitlement will depend on which party is given the entitlement initially. <i>See</i> Duncan Kennedy, <i>Cost-Benefit Analysis of Entitlement Problems: A Critique</i>, 33 Stan. L. Rev. 387 (1981). This is true because, for a variety of reasons, offer prices will often be lower, and in some situations much lower, than asking prices. In some cases, this objection reinforces the concern about the distribution of wealth, which we have already discussed. For example, in <i>Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.</i>, suppose the factory is given the right to pollute. To apply transaction cost analysis, we compare the factory’s asking price (to give up its freedom of action) with the homeowners’ offer price (to obtain security from infliction of the harm). The homeowners’ offer price is limited by their wealth, including the amount of money and other assets they currently own and the amount they would be willing and able to borrow. This amount is likely to be low and may very well be less than the amount of lost profits the factory owner would demand to shut down the factory or install pollution control devices. Assume that 50 homeowners could offer the company $50,000 ($1,000 each), but the lowest cost method of avoiding the harm by installing pollution control devices would cost the factory $500,000. The cost of avoiding the harm ($500,000) is 10 times greater than the value of avoiding it ($50,000). If this is the case, the efficient solution is to let the factory operate freely.</p>
<p id="c573e5a5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, suppose we initially grant the homeowners an entitlement to be free from pollution. We then compare the homeowners’ asking price and the factory owner’s offer price. For purposes of simplicity, assume the cost of avoiding the harm is still $500,000 and that the factory owner is willing and able to pay any <span title="388" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-388">p. 388</span>amount less than this to avoid the $500,000 expense. Assume also that each of the homeowners equally opposes operation of the factory. The most the factory owner would offer each homeowner to avoid installing the pollution control devices is $500,000 divided by 50, or $10,000. Although each of the homeowners would not be able to offer the company more than $1,000 to induce it to stop polluting, $10,000 may not be acceptable as a payment for either relocating or living with the grime, dirt, and health problems produced by the pollution. Each homeowner’s asking price, in other words, may be higher than $10,000.</p>
<p id="c5740cb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mark Kelman gives several examples of asking-offer divergence:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5740cb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A fully rational individual, a professor at a business school, buys a bottle of imported wine for $5. After its value increases, a wine dealer with whom he regularly deals offers him $100 for the bottle of wine. Although he has never purchased a bottle of wine for $100, in fact, he has never paid more than $35 for one and would not do so now, the professor drinks the wine rather than sell it. . . . A consumer buys a new color television and decides to keep his old black and white set for which he could <i>realize</i> $50 [if he sold it]. If that second television were destroyed, he would not pay $50 for a second television. [In a business school class, students] were asked what they would pay to be able to see a mountain view that had been blocked off for some time by factory smoke, and what one would have to pay them to block off the view if it were not currently blocked. Again, answers invariably followed the same pattern: People would pay out a lower order magnitude of money to clear an obstructed view than they would demand to allow the factory smoke to block it.</p>

<p id="c5740cb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mark Kelman, <i>Consumption Theory, Production Theory, and Ideology in the Coase Theorem</i>, 52 S. Cal. L. Rev. 669, 678-679, 681-682 (1979). In the wine example, the professor’s offer price would be $35 or less, but his asking price is over $100; in the television example, the consumer’s offer price would be nothing (he would not pay for a second television), but his asking price is more than $50, while in the pollution example, the offer price would be many times lower than the asking price.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5740cb9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why might we see a divergence between offer and asking prices? One reason may be practical. The homeowners in our example may, as a subjective matter, be willing to pay a lot more than $1,000 to stop the pollution, but their wealth or access to credit places an upper limit on the offer they can realistically make. These same practical limitations do not impose the same constraints on what they can demand in order to give up the entitlement.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5740cba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another possible reason for offer-asking differences is the impact of the initial allocation of the entitlement on the distribution of wealth. With asking prices, the homeowners already <i>own</i> the entitlement to prevent the pollution. They are therefore richer than they were when the entitlements are reversed. If wealth has a declining marginal utility, then making people wealthier (by granting them an entitlement) should increase what they demand to part with it.</p>
<p id="c5740cbb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, in the context of many common land use disputes involving large numbers of people affected by industrial activities, transaction costs can work to drive down offer prices because of free-rider problems, and drive up asking prices, <span title="389" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-389">p. 389</span>because of hold-outs. Suppose, for example, the Eden Roc Hotel was not a private concern but a municipally owned beach open to the public. The harm caused by the building of the addition to the Fontainebleau would be borne by all the residents who used the public beach or otherwise benefited from its availability. Transaction costs would certainly prevent all parties affected by the dispute from participating in a massive negotiation. Moreover, in estimating the value of keeping the public beach sunny to the third parties affected by the project, the decision maker could use either their offer prices or their asking prices. Their offer prices are likely to be much lower than their asking prices. Because of free riders, they are likely to offer very little money to keep the Fontainebleau project from being built. If, however, we consider how much the Fontainebleau would have to pay them to give up their right to have a sunny public beach, the number is likely to be considerably higher, not least because of the potential for individuals to hold out to try to capture as high a payment as possible.</p>
<p id="c5740cbc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another possible explanation for observed gaps between asking prices and offers is a psychological one. We may value what we have more than what we could have. <i>See</i> Richard Thaler, <i>Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice</i>, 1 J. Econ. Behav. &amp; Org. 39, 44 (1980). This phenomenon has become known as the <b>endowment effect</b>. One explanation for the phenomenon is provided by <b>prospect theory</b>, which asserts that people measure their well-being by reference to their current entitlements or endowments, and are <i>risk averse</i> in that they seek to avoid loss more than they seek to acquire gains of the same magnitude. <i>See</i> Amos Tversky &amp; Daniel Kahneman, <i>Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk</i>, 47 Econometrica 263 (1979).</p>
<p id="c57433cd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scores of experiments by economists and psychologists have found evidence of the endowment effect. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Colin Camerer, <i>Individual Decision Making</i>, in<i> The Handbook of Experimental Economics</i> 587, 665-670 (John H. Kagel &amp; Alvin E. Roth eds. 1995); Daniel Kahneman et al., <i>Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem</i>, 98 J. Pol. Econ. 1325 (1990). One classic experiment involved students in an advanced undergraduate Law and Economics course at Cornell. Half of the class was given Cornell mugs (easily available at the campus bookstore) and the other group was given an opportunity to buy them.</p>

<p id="c57433ce-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The students who were assigned mugs had a strong tendency to keep them. Whereas the Coase Theorem would have predicted that about half the mugs would trade (since transaction costs had been shown to be essentially zero in the token experiments, and mugs were randomly distributed), instead only fifteen percent of the mugs traded. And those who were endowed with mugs asked more than twice as much to give up a mug as those who didn’t get a mug were willing to pay.</p>

Some scholars have called the endowment effect “the most significant single finding from behavioral economics for legal analysis to date.” Russell Korobkin, <i>The Endowment Effect and Legal Analysis</i>, 97 Nw.

Nevertheless, the notion (central to most discussions of the endowment effect) that, apart from wealth effects or other transaction costs, mere ownership of an object changes people’s valuation of it remains controversial. A number of studies have failed to identify a pure endowment effect, leading some scholars to argue that its observation is an artifact of flawed experimental design. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Charles R. Plott &amp; Kathryn Zeiler, <i>Exchange Asymmetries Incorrectly Interpreted as Evidence of Endowment Theory and Prospect Theory?</i>, 97 Am. Econ. Rev. 1449 (2007).</p>
<p id="c57433d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether caused by practical constraints, wealth effects, transaction costs, or an endowment effect, gaps between asking and offer prices remain an important consideration for efficiency analysis of the law based on willingness to pay. If asking prices are likely to be higher than offer prices, we may arrive at conflicting definitions of which allocation of entitlements is efficient or wealth maximizing. In cases like this, efficiency analysis becomes indeterminate. We need some other criterion to tell us which starting place is appropriate.</p>
<p id="c57433d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. The difficulty of defining a “voluntary” exchange.</b> Voluntary exchanges increase social wealth by making both parties better off in their own terms. In contrast, involuntary or coerced exchanges do not make both parties better off; someone who is coerced may agree to an arrangement that leaves her worse off. To apply transaction cost analysis, it is necessary to define clearly what is and is not a voluntary exchange. But this is not easy to do; people with differing political views and theories of justice will disagree substantially on this question, particularly in their attitudes toward the problem of unequal bargaining power.</p>
<p id="c57433d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We could define coercion narrowly to include only physical duress (arm twisting) or physical threats (pressing a gun to the head); or we could define it more broadly to include economic duress caused by unequal bargaining power. There is no purely logical answer to this question.</p>
<p id="c57433d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose you have fallen into a deep pit filled with poisonous snakes. I come along and observe you in the pit. I am not responsible for your predicament and have no legal duty to help you. I offer to sell you a ladder in exchange for half your future earnings. You agree to buy; I agree to sell. It is a Pareto superior exchange; you are happier with your life and half your future earnings than the alternative; I am happier as well with this outcome. Is the contract voluntary? There is no simple answer to this question. You obviously felt forced to agree; you paid an awful lot for the ladder. But you also benefited substantially by the deal. Is the contract fair? The terms are onerous for you, but so was the alternative. We could, consistent with a regime of freedom of contract, enforce this contract (because it was the result of voluntary choice and was mutually beneficial) or not enforce it (because it was the result of coerced choice and its terms are unconscionable).</p>

Efficiency has a conservative bias.</b> Many critics of economic analysis have suggested that it has a conservative bias, partly because it gives greater weight to the interests of the wealthy and the large corporations that currently wield substantial economic power. Because value is defined by reference to willingness and ability to pay, and because of the offer-asking problem, the analysis tends to privilege the interests of property owners over the interests of non-owners. To the extent that property owners are content with the fact that they own property, the analysis is likely to lead unavoidably to outcomes that differ only in marginal ways from current arrangements.</p>
<p id="c57433d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second indication of a conservative bias in the analysis is its requirement that the analyst hold everything constant but the particular entitlement in question. The <i>Fontainebleau</i> analysis, for example, assumed that both the existing distribution of wealth and <i>all other legal rules</i> remained the same. This assumption is necessary to simplify the analysis and produce an answer. If, instead of holding everything else constant, we were to put more than one rule up for grabs at a time — for example, by suggesting changes to the tax system, the antitrust laws, the bankruptcy laws, or the rules about what constitutes unfair competition — the analysis becomes much more difficult. This is because every choice depends on the background set of legal entitlements that define the market context in which the parties bargain. It is only when we pay attention to the market and institutional structures within which bargains take place that we can imagine alternative ways of operating a decentralized market system. In contrast, the method of holding everything constant but the one entitlement in question makes consideration of alternative market structures impossible. <i>See</i> Arthur Leff, <i>Economic Analysis of Law: Some Realism About Nominalism,</i> 60 Va. L. Rev. 451 (1974); Lee Anne Fennell, <i>The Problem of Resource Access</i>, 126 Harv. L. Rev. 1471 (2013); Kennedy, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<p id="c5745ae7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>e. Commodification.</b> A final critique comes from Professor Margaret Jane Radin. Radin has argued that certain kinds of valued resources should not be traded in the market or otherwise treated as if they were commodities for sale; these interests are taken out of the market system (partly or totally) and effectively made inalienable. For example, we regulate safety conditions in the workplace to protect individual workers from being killed or maimed on the job, and we will not let people bargain away their right to a safe workplace. Protecting workers from unreasonably dangerous conditions may benefit the public by lowering costs, but it is also fundamentally designed to protect individual dignity. Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Market-Inalienability,</i> 100 Harv. L. Rev. 1849 (1987). Some issues are simply discussed more appropriately in nonmarket language, that is, in terms of justice and rights rather than wealth and efficiency. For example, Calabresi and Melamed argue that slavery may be inefficient because observing the plight of slaves makes “sensitive” people “unhappy.” Guido Calabresi &amp; A. Douglas Melamed, <i>Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral</i>, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089, 1111-1112 (1972). This is a pretty feeble way to condemn the institution of slavery. Do we really want to say that the reason slavery is bad is because it is inefficient, or would it be better to be able to say that it is evil and an affront to the values <span title="392" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-392">p. 392</span>of liberty and equality? The language of efficiency simply cannot capture much of what we mean when we talk about justice and fairness in social relationships. <i>See also</i> Margaret Jane Radin, <i>Residential Rent Control</i>, 15 Phil. &amp; Pub.

<p id="c5745ae8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Jane Cohen has criticized a proposal by Judge Posner to introduce more free market elements into the adoption process, effectively allowing people greater freedom to buy and sell children. Cohen imagines and describes the social context within which such market transactions would take place. Her description leaves substantial doubt about whether Posner’s proposal would make our society better off than before. Jane Maslow Cohen, <i>Posnerism, Pluralism, Pessimism</i>, 67 B.U. L. Rev. 105 (1987). Professors Frances Miller and Tamar Frankel have similarly argued that market theory constitutes a wholly inappropriate model for public policy decisions about adoption.

The stream flowed in a northerly direction 1200 feet across the Francis lands through a seven-foot box culvert under Lake Avenue and emptied into Milton Lake, 900 feet north of the avenue. It was the natural drainway for the larger 85-acre area south of Lake Avenue which includes the Francis tract.</p>
<p id="c5748207-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Francis stripped its tract and erected 186 small homes thereon in a development known as Duke Estates, Section 2. It also built some 14 houses on an adjacent small tract known as Duke Estates, Section 1, lying in another drainage area. It constructed a drainage system of streets, pavements, gutters, ditches, culverts and catch basins to serve both developments. The system emptied into a corrugated iron pipe laid by Francis below the level of the natural stream bed on its lands. The pipe followed the course of the stream bed to the box culvert under Lake Avenue, although deviating <span title="393" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-393">p. 393</span>from the course at some places. The pipe was covered with fill on Francis’ tract and all evidence of the natural stream there has disappeared.</p>
<p id="c5748208-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The drainage of the original 85 acres was thus augmented not only by the drainage of some 2 acres of the Duke Estates, Section 1, but also by waters percolating into the joints of the pipe where it lay below the level of the water table of the Francis tract. The pipe joints were expressly designed to receive such percolating waters, and, to the extent that the percolation lowered the level of the water table, the result was to provide a drier terrain more suitable to housing development.</p>

The Klemps were made parties defendant by Francis’ cross-claim but prevailed thereon and were allowed the same relief as the Armstrongs. The stream passes through a 36-inch culvert under the Klemp driveway and thence, across lands of the Union County Park Commission, to the Lake. The Francis improvement resulted in consequences for the Armstrongs and the Klemps fully described by Judge Sullivan in his oral opinion as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c574820a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now the stream as it emerges from the underground pipe goes under Lake Avenue and then flows past and through the Armstrong and Klemp properties is no longer the “babbling brook” that Mr. Klemp described. Now there is a constant and materially increased flow in it. The stream is never dry. The water is now discolored and evil smelling and no longer has any fish in it. A heavy deposit of silt or muck up to eighteen inches in depth now covers the bottom of the stream. After a heavy rainstorm the stream undergoes a remarkable change for several hours. All of the upstream rain water that used to be absorbed or held back is now channeled in undiminished volume and at great speed into this stream. This causes a flash rise or crest in the stream, with a tremendous volume of water rushing through at an accelerated speed. As a result, the stream has flooded on several occasions within the last year, although this was unheard of previously. More distressing, however, is the fact that during these flash situations the body of water moving at the speed it does tears into the banks of the brook particularly where the bed may turn or twist. At a point even with the plaintiff’s [Armstrong’s] house the stream makes a sharp bend. Here the effect of the increased flow of water is most apparent since the bank on plaintiff’s side of the stream has been eaten away to the extent of about ten feet. This erosion is now within fifteen feet of the Armstrong septic tank system. It is difficult to say where it will stop, where the erosion will stop. The silting has, of course, raised the bed of the stream up to eighteen inches in places and the raising of the stream results in water action against different areas of the bank so that the erosion problem while unpredictable is ominous. The eating away of the banks in several places has loosened rocks or boulders which have been rolled downstream by the force of the water. Those stones, however, as they rolled through the Klemp culvert cracked and broke the sides and bottom of the culvert and the water is now threatening to undermine the entire masonry. There is no doubt but that the defendant’s activities have caused all of the condition just related.</p>
<p id="c574820b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A matter of some concern is that defendant’s housing development occupies only about one-half of the area which drains into this brook.

Defendant’s underground trunk sewer was built to accommodate any possible runoff from this tract.

<p id="c574a921-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The casting of surface waters from one’s own land upon the land of another, in circumstances where the resultant material harm to the other was foreseen or foreseeable, would appear on the face of it to be tortious conduct, as actionable where the consequences of an unreasonable use of the possessor’s land, as in the case of the abstraction or diversion of water from a stream which unreasonably interferes with the use of the stream below, and as in the case of the unreasonable use of percolating or subterranean waters, and as in the case of artificial construction on one’s land which unreasonably speeds the waters of a stream past one’s property onto that of an owner below, causing harm. Yet only the courts of the states of New Hampshire and Minnesota have expressly classified the possessor’s liability, where imposed, for harm by the expulsion of surface waters to be a tort liability. Those courts have evolved the “reasonable use” rule laying down the test that each possessor is legally privileged to make a reasonable use of his land, even though the flow of surface waters is altered thereby and causes some harm to others, but incurs liability when his harmful interference with the flow of surface waters is unreasonable. <i>Franklin v. Durgee</i>, 51 A. 911 (N.H. 1901); <i>Sheehan v. Flynn</i>, 61 N.W. 462 (Minn. 1894).</p>
<p id="c574a922-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All other states have treated the legal relations of the parties as a branch of property law — that is, have done so, if we emphasize only the language of the decisions and ignore the actual results reached. Two rules have been evolved which, in their statement, are directly opposed, for under one the possessor would not be liable in any case and under the other he would be liable in every case. But an analysis of the results reached under both rules shows that neither is anywhere strictly applied. The first rule, purportedly applicable in our own State, stems from the view that surface waters are the common enemy. The “common enemy” rule emphasizes the possessor’s privilege to rid his lands of surface waters as he will. That rule “is, in substance, that <span title="395" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-395">p. 395</span>a possessor of land has an unlimited and unrestricted legal privilege to deal with the surface water on his land as he pleases, regardless of the harm which he may thereby cause others.” The other rule, borrowed from the civil law of foreign nations and called the “civil law” rule, emphasizes not the privileges of the possessor but the duties of the possessor to other landowners who are affected by his expulsion of surface waters from his lands. That rule is to the effect that “a person who interferes with the natural flow of surface waters so as to cause an invasion of another’s interests in the use and enjoyment of his land is subject to liability to the other.”</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c574a924-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the rationale of the common enemy rule, it would seem that a possessor of land has an unlimited privilege to rid his land of the surface water upon it or to alter its course by whatever means he wishes, irrespective of the manner of doing it or the harm thereby caused to others. However, in substantially all of the jurisdictions purportedly committed to that rule, the courts have refused to go that far. Most of these courts have developed a qualifying rule which is, in substance, that a possessor of land is not privileged to discharge upon adjoining land, by artificial means, large quantities of surface water in a concentrated flow otherwise than through natural drainways, regardless of the means by which the surface water is collected and discharged. The scope of this qualifying rule varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but it has been adopted in one form or another. . . . </p>
<p id="c574a925-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In jurisdictions purportedly committed to the civil law rule, one would expect from the rationale of that rule to find that a possessor has no privilege, under any circumstances, to interfere with the surface water on his land so as to cause it to flow upon adjoining land in a manner or quantity substantially different from its natural flow. An examination of the cases in these jurisdictions, however, reveals that the courts have refused to follow the rationale of the rule to that extent. In most of these jurisdictions the courts have recognized that a possessor must have a privilege, under certain circumstances, to make minor alterations in the natural flow of surface water where necessary to the normal use and improvement of his land, even though such alterations cause the surface water to flow upon adjoining land in a somewhat unnatural manner. This is especially true where the possessor disposes of the surface water by depositing it in existing natural drainways. Consequently, the courts . . . , with variations from state to state, have held that a possessor has a limited privilege to discharge surface water on other lands, by artificial means in a non-natural manner. . . .

<p id="c574a929-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule of reasonableness has the particular virtue of flexibility. The issue of reasonableness or unreasonableness becomes a question of fact to be determined in each case upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, including such factors as the amount of harm caused, the foreseeability of the harm which results, the purpose or motive with which the possessor acted, and all other relevant matter. It is, of course, true that society has a great interest that land shall be developed for the greater good. It is therefore properly a consideration in these cases whether the utility of the possessor’s use of his land outweighs the gravity of the harm which results from his alteration of the flow of surface waters. But while today’s mass home building projects, of which the Francis development is typical, are assuredly in the social good, no reason suggests itself why, in justice, the economic costs incident to the expulsion of surface waters in the transformation of the rural or semi-rural areas of our State into urban or suburban communities should be borne in every case by adjoining landowners rather than by those who engage in such projects for profit. Social progress and the common well-being are in actuality better served by a just and right balancing of the competing interests according to the general principles of fairness and common sense which attend the application of the rule of reason.</p></div></div>

<p id="c574d03c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Diffuse surface water.</b> Diffuse surface water is “drainage water from rain, melting snow, and springs that runs over the surface of the earth . . . but does not amount to a stream.” William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §7.6, at 430 (3d ed. 2000). Such water may coalesce into a pool or marsh but is not stable enough to constitute a lake or stream. Surface water is generally considered a nuisance, and most property owners are anxious to get rid of it.</p>
<p id="c574d03d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The power to withdraw surface water is subject to substantial regulation, even if no other owners are harmed through flooding or discharge of water onto their lands. Federal and state environmental laws regulate drainage of “wetlands” and the ability of owners to fill in such lands for development purposes. The federal <i>Clean Water Act</i>, 33 U.S.C. §1344, for example, has been interpreted to place limits on the ability of owners to drain and fill in wetlands for development purposes, and many states regulate such development to protect the environment. <i>See, e.g., Massachusetts Water Management Act,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21G, §§1-19.</p>
<p id="c574d03e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Disputes arise when property owners attempt to drain surface water off their property through pipes and drainage systems that may cause flooding or other water damage to neighboring property. Damage may also occur because development of property naturally changes drainage patterns and may cause increased runoff of surface water, even if no drainage system is installed. Property owners on lower land object to the intentional or unintentional flooding of their property by development elsewhere. As Justice Brennan explains, state courts have followed three different rules.</p>

<p id="c574d03f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="397" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-397">p. 397</span><b>a. Common enemy rule.</b> The <i>common enemy</i> doctrine allows property owners the absolute freedom to develop their property without liability for any resulting damage to neighbors caused by increased runoff of surface water. This doctrine adopts the <i>damnum absque injuria</i> solution to land use conflicts: The defendant is privileged to develop its property and to expel unwanted surface water without liability for any resultant damage to the neighbors’ property. This rule may be the law in about 17 states. Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra</i>, at 431. Most courts adopting this rule have substantially modified it. Some impose liability for negligence, allowing damages for harm caused by conduct that foreseeably causes unreasonable harm to neighbors. Many impose liability on the developing property owner if she installs pipes or drainage devices designed to collect and expel water in greater quantity or with greater force than would naturally occur or in a different direction than the natural drainage patterns of the land. <i>See Haith v. Atchison County</i>, 793 S.W.2d 151 (Mo. Ct. App. 1990); <i>Halverson v. Skagit County</i>, 983 P.2d 643 (Wash. 1999). <i>Cf. Lucas v. Rawl Family Limited Partnership,</i> 598 S.E.2d 712 (S.C. 2004) (common enemy rule unless defendant’s actions constitute a nuisance <i>per se</i>).</p>
<p id="c574d040-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>b. Natural flow rule.</b> At the other extreme is the <i>natural flow</i> or <i>civil law</i> doctrine, which grants the injured property owner absolute security against injury from flooding caused by a neighboring property owner’s development of her property. Owners are entitled to discharge water through natural drainage pathways, but any development that alters the amount, force of flow, or direction of the natural drainage will result in liability for any resulting harm to neighboring land. This doctrine adopts the <i>strict liability</i> or <i>veto rights</i> solution to land use conflicts; the injured plaintiff has the legal right to stop the defendant’s activity and to recover damages for harm already inflicted. <i>See</i> S.D. Codified Laws §46A-10A-70; <i>Powers v. Judd</i>, 553 A.2d 139 (Vt. 1988).</p>
<p id="c574d041-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until recently, the natural flow rule was the law in roughly half the states. Today it persists in only a few states. The natural flow doctrine might inhibit land development because most development will change drainage patterns. To encourage development, most states following this rule have adopted exceptions to allow minor increases in the natural flow of surface water. Other states limit application of the natural flow doctrine to rural land and apply the reasonable use test to urban land. <i>See First Lady, LLC v. JMF Properties, LLC</i>, 681 N.W.2d 94 (S.D. 2004) (natural flow applicable except in urban settings, where reasonable use test applies); Stoebuck &amp; Whitman, <i>supra</i>, at 432. Of course, development is possible even with strict liability on developers for harm caused by their development; they simply must compensate those property owners harmed by their development. If the development is profitable enough, the project may well go forward despite liability for resulting damage or for investment to prevent flooding.</p>
<p id="c574d042-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>c. Reasonable use test.</b> The New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Armstrong</i> adopted a middle position, the <i>reasonable use</i> test. This rule requires the decision maker to determine in specific cases whether the defendant’s conduct caused unreasonable interference with the neighbors’ use of their land. This determination involves balancing the social benefit derived from development of defendant’s property, the availability of cost-effective means to avoid or mitigate the harm, <span title="398" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-398">p. 398</span>and the gravity of the harm to plaintiff’s property. Substantial harm to neighboring property is likely to be found to be unreasonable, even if the value of defendant’s conduct far outweighs the value of the plaintiff’s property. It is a separate question whether the plaintiff will be limited to damages for the harm or may get an injunction stopping the harmful development from occurring. This test has rapidly gained adherents and is now the majority rule. <i>See, e.g., Locklin v. City of Lafayette</i>, 867 P.2d 724 (Cal. 1994); <i>Westland Skating Center v. Gus Machado Buick, Inc.</i>, 542 So. 2d 959 (Fla. 1989); <i>Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway &amp; Transportation Commission</i>, 859 S.W.2d 681 (Mo. 1993).</p>

Policy considerations.</b> What reasons did the court give in <i>Armstrong</i> for adopting the reasonable use test? Are you persuaded? What are the disadvantages of the reasonable use test? What arguments could you make that the common enemy rule is preferable? What arguments could you make that the natural flow rule is better than both of the other rules?</p>

<p id="c574f755-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Brennan appealed to a number of policy considerations in his opinion in <i>Armstrong.</i> Lawyers appeal to policy arguments to persuade the court to adopt a rule of law that favors their client’s interests. It is essential for you to understand and master these arguments so that you can become an effective advocate for a client on either side of a dispute. Policy arguments appeal to values that are widely shared. However, they also demonstrate that many values we hold may conflict. The fact that it is almost always possible to generate plausible, conventional legal arguments on both sides of a case in which both parties have intuitively attractive claims does not mean that it is impossible to resolve legal disputes. It simply means that decision makers must accommodate these conflicting moral impulses to make considered judgments about the relative strength of competing claims in particular social contexts.</p>
<p id="c574f756-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This compilation of arguments is not meant to be exclusive. You will see these arguments and others in legal analysis in both judicial opinions and legal scholarship. You will invent or construct new arguments yourself.</p>
<p id="c574f757-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><i>Rights: Freedom of Action versus Security</i></b></p>
<p id="c574f758-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Justice in social relationships.</b> Rights arguments appeal to fairness or justice in social relationships. Those relationships sometimes involve conflicting interests, and it is the job of both courts and legislatures to take those interests into account, accommodating them when possible and choosing between them when necessary. Justice Shirley Abrahamson of the Wisconsin Supreme Court explains that the “rights of neighboring landowners are relative; the uses of one must not unreasonably impair the uses or enjoyment of the other.” <i>Prah v. Maretti</i>, 321 N.W.2d 182, 187 (Wis. 1982). Although landowners are free to use their property as they wish, they do “not have an absolute or unlimited right to use the land in a way that injures the rights of others.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c574f759-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Rights as freedom of action.</b> On one hand, landowners may claim the “right . . . to use their property as they wish[],” or the “right to develop [their] property . . . without <span title="399" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-399">p. 399</span>regard to the effect of such development upon [others].” <i>Id.</i> at 189, 188. As Justice William Callow, also a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, stated, “I firmly believe that a landowner’s right to use his property within the limits of ordinances, statutes, and restrictions of record where such use is necessary to serve his legitimate needs is a fundamental precept of a free society. . . .” <i>Id.</i> at 194 (Callow, J., dissenting). We can refer to the right to control the use of one’s property as a right of freedom of action. For example, the defendant in <i>Armstrong</i> claimed a right to develop its property without having to take into account the possibility of increased surface flooding on neighboring property. To require the developer to foresee and prevent all damage from surface water drainage to other property or to compensate for any losses caused by development would arguably interfere too much with the developer’s freedom to develop its own property.</p>
<p id="c574f75a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Rights as security.</b> The converse of the right to use one’s property is the right to have one’s property protected from harm. Justice Abrahamson explains that property holders have a right to be protected from land use by a neighbor who “unreasonably interferes with another’s enjoyment of his or her property. . . .” <i>Id.</i> at 187. The freedom to use property is limited to the extent necessary to protect other property holders’ rights of security. Similarly, Justice Brennan argues in <i>Armstrong</i> that while development is “in the social good, no reason suggests itself why, in justice, the economic costs incident [to development] should be borne in every case by adjoining landowners rather than by those who engage in such projects for profit.” 120 A.2d at 10.</p>
<p id="c574f75b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Value judgments.</b> Each case in this chapter raises the question where to draw the line between one possessor’s right to use her property freely and another possessor’s right to security. The best solution may be one that protects the legitimate interests of both parties to some extent. The issue requires careful reflection on the social context in which the dispute arises and value judgments about the merits of the competing claims. These judgments include determining whether the interests asserted are legitimate, just claims and deciding which should prevail when conflict between legitimate claims cannot be avoided.</p>
<p id="c574f75c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><b><i>Social Utility: Competition versus Secure Investment</i></b></p>
<p id="c574f75d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Promoting the general welfare by enacting appropriate incentives.</b> Social utility arguments appeal to the goal of generating rules of law that promote socially desirable conduct and deter socially harmful conduct. Most conduct has both beneficial and harmful effects. When two legitimate activities conflict, it becomes necessary to choose which activity should prevail. Legal rules may authorize or even encourage particular kinds of land use by declaring that use privileged, freeing the possessor to engage in the activity without fear of liability to others. The rules in force also may discourage or prohibit other kinds of land use by granting those injured by the activity the right to obtain damages or an injunction to limit or even terminate the activity.</p>
<p id="c574f75e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Social utility arguments have two components. First, they assert that particular legal rules create specified incentives that encourage or discourage certain kinds of behavior. Second, they evaluate that behavior by asserting that a particular rule is better than the alternatives either because it promotes socially desirable conduct — behavior <span title="400" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-400">p. 400</span>that has greater social benefits than social costs — or because it discourages socially harmful conduct — an activity whose costs outweigh its benefits.</p>
<p id="c5751e6f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Promoting competition.</b> Lawyers often argue that social welfare is maximized when the government deregulates economic activity by freeing property holders to develop their property as they see fit. Justice William Callow argued that “society has a significant interest in not restricting land development.” 321 N.W.2d at 194 (Callow, J., dissenting). Rules governing land use should be chosen in a way that promotes “land improvement and development” by protecting landowners from ruinous liability. <i>Id.</i> at 195. Shielding property holders from liability encourages investment in socially beneficial economic activities. Every use of land has potential effects on neighbors and the community as a whole, some positive and some negative. For example, building a house or factory may increase traffic and congestion in an area or block a beautiful view; requiring the developer to compensate those who suffer these negative effects may stifle desirable economic development.</p>
<p id="c5751e70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Protecting the security of investment.</b> The converse argument is that no one will invest to develop property if the investment is not secure. The basis of the institution of property is to provide security for justified expectations. Why take the risk of building a house if your neighbor is free to flood your property and destroy the value of your investment? Providing this kind of security requires legal rules that give developers incentives to use their property in ways that minimize the harm to other property owners. Development generally should be encouraged, but not to the extent that its harmful effects outweigh its benefits. As Justice Abrahamson noted in <i>Prah</i>, “unrestricted development of land” may cause more harm than good. 321 N.W.2d at 190. The goal should be to promote only “reasonable” development (whose social benefits outweigh its social costs) and to discourage “unreasonable” development. <i>Id.</i> at 191.</p>
<p id="c5751e71-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land development benefits society, but it also may negatively affect neighboring property. If the developer does not have to pay for these negative effects, a divergence arises between the private costs of the project (the costs of building the homes) and the total social costs of the project (the costs to the developer of building the homes plus the external harmful effects on neighbors). Here the private benefits of the project will outweigh its private costs, even though the total social costs of the project may be higher than its total social benefits. Requiring the developer to compensate those burdened by the development induces the developer to take the external costs into account or to internalize them. By bringing private costs in line with social costs, the rules in force can encourage activity whose social benefits outweigh its social costs and discourage activity whose total social costs outweigh its social benefits.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D68_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10D68_ceea1c55-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">13</a></span></p>

<p id="c5751e76-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Rules.</b> Legal rules are sometimes defined in a way that allows mechanical application. For example, the rigid rule allowing 18-year olds to vote cleanly answers the question whether a 17-year old may vote — the answer is no. No need for interpretation or judgment arises. Duncan Kennedy notes that “the two great social virtues of formally realizable rules, as opposed to standards or principles, are the restraint of official arbitrariness and certainty.” Duncan Kennedy, <i>Form and Substance in Private Law Adjudication</i>, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1687, 1688 (1976). Rules offer certainty or predictability because each citizen knows her rights and obligations. The rules also control arbitrary judicial discretion, with the propitious result that like cases are treated alike and judges are prevented from deciding cases by reference to impermissible and perhaps unconscious biases. “[I]f private actors can know in advance the incidence of official intervention, they will adjust their activities in advance to take account of them. From the point of view of the state, this increases the likelihood that private activity will follow a desired pattern. From the point of view of the citizenry, it removes the inhibiting effect on action that occurs when one’s gains are subject to sporadic legal catastrophe.” <i>Id</i>. at 1688-1689.</p>
<p id="c5751e77-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rigid rules, do, however, have distinct disadvantages. By definition, they require particular results, even if those results seem unfair under the circumstances. An 18-year-old-voter rule is both over- and underinclusive. Some persons younger than 18 are mature enough to vote but are not allowed to do so; some persons older than 18 are not mature enough to vote but are allowed to do so. “From the point of view of the purpose of the rules, this combined over- and underinclusiveness amounts not just to licensing but to requiring official arbitrariness. If we adopt the rule, it is because of a judgment that this kind of arbitrariness is less serious than the arbitrariness and uncertainty that would result from empowering the official to apply [a standard] directly to the facts of each case.” <i>Id</i>. at 1689.</p>
<p id="c5751e78-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Standards.</b> In contrast to rigid rules, legal doctrines are sometimes flexible. Such doctrines take the form of standards or principles. Sometimes standards “refer directly to one of the substantive objectives of the legal order, such as good faith, due care, fairness, unconscionability, unjust enrichment, and reasonableness.” <i>Id</i>. at 1688. Other times, standards take the form of lists of “factors” that are to be considered in adjudicating a case. Flexible standards have the benefit of obtaining justice in the individual case by allowing the decision maker to take account of all relevant circumstances. Because they cannot be mechanically applied, however, they may offer less predictability to citizens or guidance to judges and juries in adjudicating cases.</p>

Formal realizability and social utility.</b> Kennedy notes that the choice between rules and standards is affected by the substantive goal of developing rules that have desirable social effects. If rules are more predictable than standards, they may promote social welfare because they enable people to plan and because they induce actors to look out for their own interests knowing when the law will, and will not, protect them. However, because of their rigidity, rules are almost certain to be either over- or underinclusive, or both. Using rules means that “sometimes perfectly innocent behavior will be punished, and that sometimes plainly guilty behavior will escape sanction. These costs of mechanical over- and underinclusion are the price of avoiding the potential arbitrariness and uncertainty of a standard.” <i>Id.</i> at 1695.</p>
<p id="c5751e7a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Standards may therefore sometimes promote social welfare better than rules because the very uncertainty of how the law will apply to one’s actions will discourage socially undesirable conduct. Actors will imagine whether they can justify their actions to a jury, and this worry may deter them from engaging in socially harmful conduct. Rules, in contrast, “allow the proverbial bad man’ to walk the line,’ that is, to take conscious advantage of underinclusion to perpetuate [wrongs] with impunity.” <i>Id.</i> at 1696. Conversely, confidence that a jury of one’s peers would find one’s conduct reasonable would induce the actor to go forward, when a rigid rule might deter such socially valuable conduct.</p>
<p id="c5751e7b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A standard counterargument in favor of rules is that rules are indeed more predictable than standards, and the benefits achieved by predictability far outweigh any loss to social welfare due to the imprecision of rules. A standard response to that argument is that it is not at all clear that rules are more predictable than standards. After all, standards become more predictable over time as their application is elaborated through case law. And rules cannot be mechanically applied because they do not determine the scope of their own application. The common law system works by <i>distinguishing</i> cases. A rule that grants husbands the right to inherit the family home upon death of their wives is not likely to be applied if the husband murders his wife. Owners have the right to exclude non-owners from their property, but restaurants cannot exclude people based on their race. Because we must determine the fact situations to which rules apply, it cannot be the case that their application is purely mechanical. Thus, the advantages of rules over standards in terms of predictability may well be overstated.</p>

<p id="c575458d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judicial role and institutional competence arguments are concerned with the proper spheres of authority of legal institutions and the proper relations among separate branches of government in the legal system. Arguments about the spheres of authority of different governmental actors revolve around the question of which government officials may appropriately modernize or change existing rules of law or patterns of social practice.</p>
<p id="c575458e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judicial role arguments address the following questions: What is the proper role of the courts as lawmakers? What is the proper division of lawmaking authority between the courts and the legislature? What is the proper way for courts to interpret and implement legislative enactments? These “judicial role” arguments typically focus on the democratic legitimacy of legislatures and the relative illegitimacy of courts, <span title="403" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-403">p. 403</span>particularly unelected federal courts. Arguments about the proper method of statutory interpretation, judicial activism, and judicial restraint are usually rooted in assumptions or arguments about the proper judicial role.</p>
<p id="c575458f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Institutional competence arguments rely on stylized descriptions of how courts (or legislatures or administrative agencies) go about making decisions, and how those processes might offer particular advantages or disadvantages when resolving specific sorts of questions. For example, lawyers will often observe that courts are more passive decision makers than legislatures. They must wait for cases to come to them and they must accept the information that litigants (with varying resources and different quality of representation) bring to them. These limitations appear to restrict the competence of judges to craft broad rules or administer remedies that will require long-term supervision. On the other hand, legislatures and administrative agencies may be subject to lobbying and capture by interest groups with the resources to involve themselves in the lawmaking or rulemaking process. Somewhat differently, they may be particularly vulnerable to political pressure to reach decisions that are likely to appeal to majorities at the expense of minorities. The structured formality of litigation, someone might argue, makes courts more resistant to each of these sorts of pressures. Our point here is not to endorse the accuracy of any of these empirical claims, but just to introduce you to this style of argument.</p></div>

Noone, bought a house located on the side of a mountain in Glen Ferris, West Virginia. This house had been constructed in 1928 or 1929 by Union Carbide, and in 1964, four years after plaintiffs purchased the house, plaintiffs became aware that the wall under their front porch was giving way and that the living room plaster had cracked.</p>
<p id="c5756cb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant below, appellee in this Court, Mrs. Marion T. Price, lived directly below the plaintiffs at the foot of the hill in a house that was built in 1912. Sometime between 1912 and 1919 a wall of stone and concrete was constructed along the side of the hill, ten to twelve feet behind the defendant’s house. This wall was a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five feet long, approximately four feet high, and of varying degrees of thickness. The wall lay entirely on the defendant’s property, and was approximately ten to twelve feet from the property line that divided the defendant’s property from the plaintiffs’ property. The defendant purchased her house in 1955 and lived there until 1972, when she sold the property. Before the defendant’s purchase, the wall had fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p id="c5756cb8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the plaintiffs discovered that their house was slipping down the hill, they complained to the defendant that their problem was the result of deterioration in the defendant’s retaining wall.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c57593d1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An excavation, made by an adjacent owner, so as to take away the lateral support, afforded to his neighbor’s ground, by the earth so removed, and cause it, of its own weight, to fall, slide or break away, makes the former liable for the injury, no matter how carefully he may have excavated. Such right of support is a property right and absolute.</p>
</div>
<p id="c57593d2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An adjacent landowner is strictly liable for acts of commission and omission on his part that result in the withdrawal of lateral support to his neighbor’s property. This strict liability, however, is limited to land in its natural state; there is no obligation to support the added weight of buildings or other structures that land cannot naturally support. However, the majority of American jurisdictions hold that if land in its natural state would be capable of supporting the weight of a building or other structure, and such building or other structure is damaged because of the subsidence of the land itself, then the owner of the land on which the building or structure is constructed can recover damages for both the injury to his land and the injury to his building or structure. The West Virginia cases are largely consistent with this position, although none has expressly so held.</p>
<p id="c57593d3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The converse of the preceding rule is also the law: where an adjacent landowner provides sufficient support to sustain the weight of land in its natural state, but the <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>land slips as a direct result of the additional weight of a building or other structure, then in the absence of negligence on the part of the adjoining landowner, there is no cause of action against such adjoining landowner for damage either to the land, the building, or other structure.</p>
<p id="c57593d4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue in the case before us concerns the proper application of the strict liability rule. The circuit court improperly awarded summary judgment because the plaintiffs should have been allowed to prove that their land was sufficiently strong in its natural state to support the weight of their house, and that their house was damaged as a result of a chain reaction that began when the land in its natural state, toward the bottom of the hill, slipped as a result of the withdrawal of lateral support occasioned by the deterioration of the retaining wall, causing, in turn, successive parts of the hillside to subside until the ripple effect reached the foundation of the plaintiffs’ house.</p>
<p id="c57593d5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases recognize that lateral support sufficient to hold land in its natural state may be insufficient to support the additional weight of a building or other structure. If, therefore, as a result of the additional weight of a building or other structure, so much strain is placed upon existing natural or artificial lateral support that the support will no longer hold, then in the absence of negligence, there is no liability whatsoever on the part of an adjoining landowner. In the case before us, this means that if the weight of the plaintiffs’ house placed so much pressure on the soil that the house itself caused the subsidence, and the land would not have subsided without the weight of the house, then the plaintiffs cannot recover.</p>
<p id="c57593d6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II</i></p>
<p id="c57593d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A theoretical problem that presents itself in all of these cases is the extent to which the obligation of support runs with the land. The weight of authority appears to be that where an actor, whether he be an owner, possessor, lessee, or third-party stranger, removes necessary support he is liable, and an owner cannot avoid this liability by transferring the land to another. Nevertheless, when an actor who removes natural lateral support substitutes artificial support to replace it, such as a retaining wall, the wall then becomes an incident to and a burden on the land upon which it is constructed, and subsequent owners and possessors have an obligation to maintain it.</p>
<p id="c57593d8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case <i>sub judice</i>, the plaintiffs’ land had no buildings erected on it at the time the defendant’s predecessor in title built the retaining wall on his property; therefore, he needed only to erect a retaining wall sufficient to provide support for their soil. He was not required to furnish a wall sufficient to support any structure which they might erect upon their property. The defendant, as his successor, merely had the obligation to maintain the wall to support the plaintiffs’ land in its natural condition. Defendant was not required to strengthen the wall to the extent that it would provide support for the weight of plaintiffs’ buildings.</p>
<p id="c575bae9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III</i></p>
<p id="c575baea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the pleadings in the case before us make reference to negligence, it is appropriate here to address the scope of a negligence theory. In general, it has been held that while an adjoining landowner has no obligation to support the buildings and <span title="407" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-407">p. 407</span>other structures on his neighbor’s land, nonetheless, if those structures are actually being supported, a neighbor who withdraws such support must do it in a non-negligent way. In an action predicated on strict liability for removing support for the land in its natural state, the kind of lateral support withdrawn is material, but the quality of the actor’s conduct is immaterial; however, in a proceeding based upon negligence, the kind of lateral support withdrawn is immaterial, and the quality of the actor’s conduct is material. Comment e, <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §819 succinctly explains the nature of liability for negligence.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c575baeb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The owner of land may be unreasonable in withdrawing lateral support needed by his neighbor for artificial conditions on the neighbor’s land in either of two respects. First, he may make an unnecessary excavation, believing correctly that it will cause his neighbor’s land to subside because of the pressure of artificial structures on the neighbor’s land. If his conduct is unreasonable either in the digging or in the intentional failure to warn his neighbor of it, he is subject to liability to the neighbor for the harm caused by it. The high regard that the law has by long tradition shown for the interest of the owner in the improvement and utilization of his land weighs heavily in his favor in determining what constitutes unreasonable conduct on his part in such a case. Normally the owner of the supporting land may withdraw lateral support that is not naturally necessary, for any purpose that he regards as useful provided that the manner in which it is done is reasonable. But all the factors that enter into the determination of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the actor’s conduct must be considered, and in a particular case the withdrawal itself may be unreasonable. Thus, if the actor’s sole purpose in excavating his land is to harm his neighbor’s structures, the excavation itself is unreasonable. Furthermore, although for the purpose of permanently leveling the land it may be reasonable to withdraw support that is not naturally necessary, it may be unreasonable to make an excavation for a building that will itself require a foundation, without providing for the safeguarding of the neighbor’s structures during the progress of the work. Likewise it is normally unreasonable not to notify an adjacent landowner of excavations that certainly will harm his structures, unless the neighbor otherwise has notice.</p>
<p id="c575baec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Secondly, the owner of land may be negligent in failing to provide against the risk of harm to his neighbor’s structures. This negligence may occur either when the actor does not realize that any harm will occur to his neighbor’s structures or when the actor realizes that there is a substantial risk to his neighbor’s land and fails to take adequate provisions to prevent subsidence, either by himself taking precautions or by giving his neighbor an opportunity to take precautions. Although the law accords the owner of the supporting land great freedom in withdrawing from another’s land support that is not naturally necessary in respect to the withdrawal itself, it does not excuse withdrawal in a manner that involves an unreasonable risk of harm to the land of another. The owner in making the excavation is therefore required to take reasonable precautions to minimize the risk of causing subsidence of his neighbor’s land. In determining whether a particular precaution is reasonably required, the extent of the burden that the taking of it will impose upon the actor is a factor of great importance.</p>

He would be under no duty to vary the mode or manner of his work in the slightest degree, in respect to the time thereof or otherwise, in the interests of the safety of the building. Having thus made the excavation, he could build his wall at his leisure and would be under no duty to prosecute the work diligently even though it should be apparent that delay in this part of the work would endanger the building. Such conduct would be reckless, careless and wanton, in view of the ease with which the mode of work could be varied, in respect to time and manner, and previous notice given of the intention to alter the condition of the property, the extent of the alteration, the manner in which it is to be done and the time, so as to afford the owner of the building an opportunity to take such measures for its protection, as he might see fit to adopt. . . . 67 S.E. at 1090.</p>

<p id="c575baf0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It would appear that the case before us either stands or falls on a question of strict liability. It is admitted that the retaining wall on the defendant’s property was constructed at least sixty years ago, before the construction of the plaintiffs’ house, and that all parties to this action were aware of the condition of the wall. Furthermore, there is no allegation that the defendant did anything to cause the collapse of the wall, but rather only failed to keep it in repair. Therefore, if the plaintiffs can recover, they must do so by proving that the disrepair of the retaining wall would have led ineluctably to the subsidence of their land in its natural condition. If, on the other hand, the land would not have subsided but for the weight of the plaintiffs’ house, then they can recover nothing.</p></div></div>

Easements and servitudes.</b> An <b>easement</b> is a limited right to do something on, or to control the use of, someone else’s property. An <b>affirmative easement</b> is a right to do something on <i>someone else’s</i> property. The right to cross someone else’s property, for example, is called a <b>right of way</b>. A <b>negative easement</b> is a right to prevent someone else from using her <i>own</i> property in a certain way. Modern terminology confines the term easement to affirmative easements and uses the word <i>servitude</i> to describe restrictions on land use, including negative easements. <i>See</i> Chapter 8, §1<i>.</i> Most easements and servitudes are created by agreement among neighbors. Some, like the <b>servitude for lateral support of land</b>, are created by the common law. Each owner has an obligation to maintain lateral support for neighboring land; conversely, each owner has a right to prevent her neighbors from excavating on their property to remove lateral support for her land.</p>
<p id="c575e104-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="409" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-409">p. 409</span><b>2. Land versus structures.</b> Courts have often distinguished lateral support of land from lateral support of buildings or other structures built on the land. The common law grants each landowner a servitude for lateral support of land in its natural condition. Owners who withdraw lateral support for neighboring land are strictly liable for any resulting damage to the land. On the other hand, owners have no duty to support structures on their neighbors’ land. They do have a duty not to excavate in a negligent manner; they have a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would — they cannot use unreasonably dangerous engineering methods or create unnecessary risks to adjoining property. They are also obligated to provide temporary support for neighboring land during excavation and to notify the neighbors if their excavation poses a risk to neighboring structures. <i>Spall v. Janota</i>, 406 N.E.2d 378 (Ind. Ct. App. 1980); <i>Klebs v. Yim</i>, 772 P.2d 523 (Wash. Ct. App. 1989) (both holding that there is an absolute right of lateral support for land but only a duty to refrain from negligent injury to adjoining structures). However, the obligation to avoid negligence does not mean that owners have a duty to avoid foreseeable harm to neighboring structures if the land in its natural condition, in combination with the underlying foundation of the structures, would not have been sufficient to support those structures.</p>
<p id="c575e105-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What happens if the land in its natural condition is sufficient to support a structure on neighboring land and the removal of support for the land causes a chain reaction resulting in damage to the building? Older law, retained in some states, denied a remedy to the owner of the building. <i>Thurston v. Hancock</i>, 12 Mass. 220 (1815). However, the modern approach adopted in <i>Noone</i> imposes damages for harm both to the land and to the building if the harm to the building was caused by removal of lateral support for the land. The damages to the building are <b>consequential damages</b> resulting from breach of a legal duty to support the land. If, on the other hand, the neighboring building was built negligently with inadequate support so that it would have been damaged eventually even if the defendant did not withdraw lateral support for the land, then plaintiff can recover no damages for harm to the building resulting from the withdrawal of lateral support, under either the older or the modern approach.</p>
<p id="c575e106-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why is the standard of care different for land and structures? This distinction can be traced in U.S. law to an early Massachusetts case, <i>Thurston v. Hancock</i>, <i>supra.</i> In <i>Thurston</i>, the plaintiff had built a brick house with its rear wall within two feet of the boundary of his land. In 1811, the defendants began digging a foundation on their own land within six feet of the rear of the plaintiff’s house, causing part of the earth on the surface of the plaintiff’s land to slide onto the defendant’s land, and rendering the foundations of the plaintiff’s house insecure so that he had to abandon it. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the plaintiff could recover only for the damage to the soil, not to the house. Chief Justice Parker, in delivering judgment said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c575e107-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a common principle of the civil and of the common law, that the proprietor of land, unless restrained by covenant or custom, has the entire dominion, not only of the soil, but of the space above and below the surface, to any extent he may choose to occupy it. The law, founded upon principles of reason and common utility, has admitted a qualification to this dominion, restricting the proprietor so to use his own, as not to injure the property or impair any actual existing rights of another. <i>Sic utere tuo ut alienum <span title="410" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-410">p. 410</span>non laedas</i>. But this subjection of the use of a man’s own property to the convenience of his neighbor is founded upon a supposed preexisting right in his neighbor to have and enjoy the privilege which by such act is impaired. A man, in digging upon his own land, is to have regard to the position of his neighbor’s land, and the probable consequences to his neighbor, if he digs too near his line; and if he disturbs the natural state of the soil, he shall answer in damages; but he is answerable only for the natural and necessary consequences of his act, and not for the value of a house put upon or near the line by his neighbor. The plaintiff built his house within two feet of the western line of the lot, knowing that the town, or those who should hold under it, had a right to build equally near to the line, or to dig down into the soil for any other lawful purpose. He knew also the shape and nature of the ground, and that it was impossible to dig there without causing excavations. He built at his peril; for it was not possible for him, merely by building upon his own ground, to deprive the other party of such use of his as he should deem most advantageous. . . . It is, in fact, <i>damnum absque injuria</i>.</p>

<p id="c575e109-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Retaining walls.</b> If a retaining wall was built on defendant’s land for the purpose of maintaining lateral support for plaintiff’s land, defendant has a strict obligation to keep the wall in good repair to avoid loss of lateral support for the plaintiff’s land. This obligation <b>runs with the land</b> and is binding on subsequent owners of the property. <i>Salmon v. Peterson</i>, 311 N.W.2d 205, 206-207 (S.D. 1981). However, the obligation extends only to such support as is needed to support the neighbor’s land in its natural condition. In the absence of statute, an owner of a retaining wall has no obligation to keep it strong enough also to support the added weight of the neighbor’s building. In practice, how do you think courts are likely to go about assessing whether a defendant’s behavior satisfies the obligation to support the land in its natural condition? <i>See Klebs v. Yim</i>, 772 P.2d 523 (Wash. Ct. App. 1989) (defendant had “a duty to maintain an existing retaining wall on [defendant’s] property” and was liable for failure to maintain the wall but was not liable for damage to plaintiff’s property attributable to the additional weight imposed by plaintiff’s swimming pool). If a retaining wall on defendant’s land is actually supporting the buildings on plaintiff’s land, defendant does have a duty to act non-negligently in withdrawing that support, by notifying the plaintiff of any changes so that plaintiff can take steps to support her own structure.</p>
<p id="c576081a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Natural conditions.</b> Do owners have obligations to take reasonable steps to prevent natural conditions on their land from harming neighboring owners? Some courts have held that an owner who reasonably should know that her property is subject to landslides should take reasonable steps to protect property downhill from her. <i>Sprecher v. Adamson</i>, 636 P.2d 1121 (Cal. 1981). However, other courts have taken the position that owners are not liable for harms caused by the natural condition of their land, although they may be liable for conditions caused by their development of their own land. <i>Price ex rel. Estate of Price v. City of Seattle</i>, 24 P.3d 1098 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001).</p>
<p id="c576081b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5.

<p id="c5762f3b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three questions must be considered.

It is express if the text of the laws clearly creates a right to sue and implied if the court infers such a right from the text by reference to the purposes the regulations were intended to achieve or the policies underlying the regulations. Second, if no such right was created, are the remedies included in the statute (criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment and civil claims by the local inspector) intended to be exclusive or nonexclusive? If those remedies are exclusive, a private owner cannot seek a remedy under the common law. If they are nonexclusive, we reach the third question. Should the common law be changed to promote the policies underlying the statute and regulations, or should the legislature’s failure to alter the common law rule induce the court to retain it until changed by the legislature?</p></div>

Plaintiffs alleged that the wells were negligently spaced too close together, too near the common boundary of lands owned by plaintiffs and defendants, and that excessive quantities were produced with knowledge that this would cause subsidence and flooding of plaintiffs’ lands. Plaintiffs alleged that this extensive withdrawal of ground water proximately caused the sinking and loss of elevation above mean sea level of their property and the property of others similarly situated along the shores of Galveston Bay and Clear Lake, resulting in the erosion and flooding of their lands and damage to their residences, businesses and improvements. Plaintiffs further allege that the manner in which Friendswood Development Company continues to use its property for the withdrawal and sale of large amounts of fresh water to commercial users on other lands constitutes a continuing nuisance and permanent loss and damage to their property.</p>

<p id="c5767d6d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reports in the record and publications of official agencies reflect that land subsidence in Harris County is not peculiar to or confined within the Galveston Bay and Clear Creek areas described in plaintiffs’ petition. Rather it is a problem which has existed for many years in Harris and Galveston Counties. Harris County alone had 2,635 ground water wells in the inventory compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Texas Water Development Board in 1972. The Chicot and Evangeline aquifers underlie the Houston-Galveston region, which includes all of Harris and Galveston Counties and parts of adjacent counties. These two aquifers furnish all of the ground water pumped in the Houston-Galveston region, according to the U.S. Geological Report prepared by R.K. Gabrysch and C.W. Bonnet in 1974. This report states that water level declines of as much as 200 feet have resulted in wells completed in the Chicot aquifer and as much as 325 feet in the Evangeline aquifer during 1943-73, and “the declines in artesian pressures have resulted in a pronounced regional subsidence of the land surface.” It states that the area in which there has been subsidence of one foot or more has increased from 350 square miles in 1954 to about 2,500 square miles in 1973. The contour lines of this area encompass practically all of Harris and Galveston Counties and include all of the principal areas of ground water withdrawals. Maps in the report indicate that the land and wells involved in this suit are in or near the “Johnson Space Center Area,” where the land surface subsided about 2.12 feet between 1964 and 1973.</p>

<p id="c5767d70-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs have alleged an action in tort based upon the general rule that a landowner has a duty not to use his property so as to injure others. <i>Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i>. [However, this court has held that this general rule does not apply to withdrawals of underground water. Rather, this court has] adopted the common law rule that such rights are not correlative, but are absolute, and thus are not subject to the conflicting “reasonable use” rule. <i>Houston &amp; T.C. Ry. Co. v. East</i>, 81 S.W. 279 (Tex. 1904).</p>
<p id="c5767d71-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiffs [contend] that the “reasonable use” doctrine should apply to ground water the same as it does to other real property.</p>
<p id="c5767d72-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In [<i>East</i>,] the railroad company, with full knowledge of the long existence of Mr. East’s small shallow well on his homestead, dug a well twenty feet in diameter and 66 feet deep on its own adjacent property, from which it pumped 25,000 gallons of water per day. This resulted in lowering the water level on plaintiff’s land and drying up his well. [The plaintiff argued for the “reasonable use” or “American rule,” which held that the right of a landowner to draw underground water from his land was not absolute, but limited to the amount necessary for the reasonable use of his land, and that the rights of adjoining landowners are correlative and limited to reasonable use. The defendant argued for the contrary English doctrine laid down in <i>Acton v. Blundell</i>, 152 Eng. Rep. 1223 (Ex. 1843), that, “if a man digs a well on his own field and thereby drains his neighbor’s, he may do so unless he does it maliciously.”]</p>

Absent these, the Court clearly embraced the doctrine stated in <i>Acton v. Blundell, supra</i>, that this type of damage “falls within the description <i>damnum absque injuria</i>, which cannot become the ground of action.” This legal maxim denotes a loss without injury in the legal sense, that is, without the invasion of a legal right or the violation of a legal duty.</p>

<p id="c576a490-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree that some aspects of the English or common law rule as to underground waters are harsh and outmoded, and the rule has been severely criticized since its reaffirmation by this Court in 1955. Most of the critics, however, recognize that it has become an established rule of property law in this State, under which many citizens own land and water rights. The rule has been relied upon by thousands of farmers, industries, and municipalities in purchasing and developing vast tracts of land overlying aquifers of underground water. Approximately 50,000 wells are used to irrigate 2,800,000 acres in the thirteen county High Plains area of West Texas. As shown in the <span title="416" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-416">p. 416</span>official reports cited earlier in this opinion, over 2,600 water wells have been drilled in Harris County alone while this rule of immunity from liability was in effect.

<p id="c576cba1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On this subject, we are not writing on a clean slate. Even though good reasons may exist for lifting the immunity from tort actions in cases of this nature, it would be unjust to do so retroactively. The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> has been and should be strictly followed by this Court in cases involving established rules of property rights. It is for this reason that, as to past actions complained of in this case, we follow the English rule and <i>Restatement of Torts</i> §818 (1939) in holding that defendants are not liable on plaintiff’s allegations of nuisance and negligence.</p>

This occurred after geologists, hydrologists, and engineers had developed more accurate knowledge concerning the location, source, and measurement of percolating underground waters, and after legislators became aware of the potential conflicts inherent in the unregulated use of ground water under the English rule of ownership. With a rule that recognizes ownership of underground water by each individual under his own land, but with no limitation on the manner and amount which another individual landowner might produce (absent willful waste and malicious malice [<i>sic</i>]), legislative action was essential in order to provide for conservation and protection of public interests.</p>

The need for additional legislation for creation of districts to cover unregulated ground water reservoirs and to solve other conflicts which may arise in this area of water law and subsidence seems to be inevitable. Providing policy and regulatory procedures in this field is a legislative function. It is well that the Legislature has assumed its proper role, because our courts are not equipped to regulate ground water uses and subsidence on a suit-by-suit basis.</p>
<p id="c576cba9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case, however, gives the Court its first opportunity to recognize, and to encourage compliance with, the policy set forth by the Legislature and its regulatory <span title="417" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-417">p. 417</span>agencies in an effort to curb excessive under groundwater withdrawals and resulting land subsidence. It also affords us the opportunity to discard an objectionable aspect of the court-made English rule as it relates to subsidence by stating a rule for the future which is more in harmony with expressed legislative policy. We refer to the past immunity from negligence which heretofore has been afforded ground water producers solely because of their “absolute” ownership of the water.</p>
<p id="c576cbaa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As far as we can determine, there is no other use of private real property which enjoys such an immunity from liability under the law of negligence. This ownership of underground water comes with ownership of the surface; it is part of the soil. Yet, the use of one’s ground-level surface and other elements of the soil is without such insulation from tort liability. Our consideration of this case convinces us that there is no valid reason to continue this special immunity insofar as it relates to future subsidence proximately caused by negligence in the manner which wells are drilled or produced in the future. It appears that the ownership and rights of all landowners will be better protected against subsidence if each has the duty to produce water from his land in a manner that will not negligently damage or destroy the lands of others.</p>
<p id="c576f2bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, if the landowner’s manner of withdrawing ground water from his land is negligent, willfully wasteful, or for the purpose of malicious injury, and such conduct is a proximate cause of the subsidence of the land of others, he will be liable for the consequences of his conduct. The addition of negligence as a ground of recovery shall apply only to future subsidence proximately caused by future withdrawals of ground water from wells which are either produced or drilled in a negligent manner after the date this opinion becomes final.</p>
<p id="c576f2bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While this addition of negligence as a ground of recovery in subsidence cases applies to future negligence in producing water from existing wells and those drilled or produced in a negligent manner in the future, it has been suggested that this new ground of recovery should be applied in the present cause of action. This is often done when a court writes or adds a new rule applicable to personal injury cases, but seldom when rules of property law are involved. This is because precedent is necessarily a highly important factor when problems regarding land or contracts are concerned. In deeds, property transactions, and land developments, the parties should be able to rely on the law which existed at the time of their actions.</p>

<p id="c576f2be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I respectfully dissent. The court has decided this cause upon the mistaken belief that the case is governed by the ownership of ground water. Plaintiffs assert no ownerships to the percolating waters pumped and extracted from the ground by defendants. They make no complaint that their own wells have been or will be pumped dry. They seek no damages for the defendants’ sale of the water. Plaintiffs’ action calls for no change in nor even a review of the English rule of “absolute ownership” of ground water, the American rule of “reasonable use” of ground water, nor the Texas rule of “nonwasteful” use of ground water. They claim no correlative rights in the water. The Texas law of percolating waters is not put in issue by this suit, and there is no occasion to overrule that law either now or prospectively.</p>
<p id="c576f2bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="418" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-418">p. 418</span>Plaintiffs’ complaint is that defendants are causing subsidence of their land. They assert an absolute right to keep the surface of their land at its natural horizon. The landowners’ right to the subjacent support for their land is the only right in suit, and this is a case of original impression. . . . It is no more logical to say that this is a case concerning the right to ground water than it would be correct in a case in which an adjoining landowner removed lateral support by a caterpillar to say that the case would be governed by the law of caterpillars. In making this decision about one’s right to subjacent support, I would use as analogies other kinds of cases concerning support, such as the right to lateral support.</p>
<p id="c576f2c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A landowner’s right to lateral support for his land is an absolute right. The instrument employed in causing land to slough off, cave in or wash away is not the real subject of inquiry. The inquiry is whether the adjoining owner actually causes the loss of support. Whether the support is destroyed by excavation, ditching, the flowing of water, the pumping of water, unnatural pressure, unnatural suction, or explosives, the right to support is the same, and it is an absolute right.</p>
<p id="c576f2c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second analogous rule which protects one’s subsurface from damage by an operator on other lands is found in <i>Gregg v. Delhi-Taylor Oil Corp.</i>, 344 S.W.2d 411, 416 (Tex. 1961). Mr. Gregg, in the development of his mineral lease, was preparing to use a sand fracturing technique to open cracks and veins extending some distance from his lease and to alter the substructure of neighboring land. By use of hydraulic pressure the ruptures of the subsurface formations would free greater quantities of gas. The rupture beneath the Delhi-Taylor’s lands would create only small veins about one-tenth of an inch in diameter. This court regarded the creation of fissures on another’s land as an invasion of property rights. . . . This court denied one landowner the right to interfere with the subsurface of lands beyond his own lease boundaries. The same principle was applied in <i>Gregg v. Delhi-Taylor Oil Corp.</i>, 344 S.W.2d 411 (Tex. 1961), and in <i>Delhi-Taylor Oil Corp. v. Holmes</i>, 344 S.W.2d 420 (Tex. 1961). In my judgment, the examples are indistinguishable from the present case.</p>
<p id="c576f2c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Elliff v. Texon Drilling Co.</i>, 210 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. 1948), was another example in which this court looked at the damage done [to] a neighbor’s subsurface estate by an oil driller who had the right to capture oil through the wellbore on his own lease. This court expressly rejected holdings by the Louisiana Supreme Court which held that an adjoining owner has no action against one who negligently destroys a reservoir. This court also rejected the defense that one’s right to capture the oil rendered him immune from damages for his negligence in wasting it.</p>
<p id="c576f2c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We thus reach the end result. Under our prior holdings compared with today’s, one who mines for oil may not destroy his neighbor’s subjacent geology; but the right to pump water, we inconsistently say, is the right to destroy the subsurface geology, the subjacent support and even the surface of the land. Defendants may pump the plaintiffs’ land to the bottom of Galveston Bay.</p>
<p id="c576f2c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The error of the majority is its narrow focus upon the right of the defendants to pump ground water. We should enlarge our vision so we can see what this lawsuit is about. I do not believe it is sound law that the right to pump water is the power to destroy the surface of surrounding landowners. If defendants argue that they have an <span title="419" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-419">p. 419</span>absolute right to pump groundwater, plaintiffs reply that they too have an absolute right to the support of their natural surface.</p>
<p id="c576f2c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is yet another legal principle that we should observe. Many things, though lawful, when done to excess, become remediable. Church bells may toll the knell of parting day or announce the time for solemn services, but when bells continuously clang without interruption for many days, the rights of others spring into being. What we do cannot be understood except in relation to those we touch. We have in this case the pleadings and showing that the defendants have abused their right to pump water to the point that property and the rights of others are ignored and destroyed.</p>
<p id="c576f2c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, and importantly, I dissent from the majority’s holding that landowners in the future may prosecute a suit for damages for the destruction of their property if, and only if the action is one for negligence, willful waste, or malicious injury. I rather assume that pumpers of ground water will carefully do so, will not waste their water, and will bear no ill will toward those whose property they are destroying. I would hold that an owner of land may assert an action against one who destroys the lateral or subjacent support to his land in its natural state when: (1) he engages in conduct knowing that it will cause damages to another’s land by loss or destruction of the subjacent support, or (2) the plaintiff proves negligence, or (3) the plaintiff proves a nuisance, and here a balancing will be a factor.</p>
<p id="c57719d7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I also dissent from the court’s denial of rights to the plaintiffs, while acknowledging that future landowners may have an action at least in negligence. This court, in recent years, has recognized a number of new actions, and each time, the successful party was allowed the victory. . . . In my opinion, it is basically unfair to treat the plaintiffs in this case unequally by recognizing that they possess an action, but by denying them the remedy.</p></div></div>

Rule of capture or right to support.</b> The majority, in effect, reads its past cases as holding that the absolute nature of the rule of capture for groundwater protects those who remove groundwater from liability for the subsidence caused by their actions. The dissent accuses the majority of making a category mistake — applying a rule of acquisition (the rule of capture) to resolve a dispute about the duties that owners owe to one another (the duty not to cause subsidence). Who has the better of the argument?</p>
<p id="c57719db-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Current law.</b> Some courts agree with the majority in <i>Friendswood</i>, imposing liability for undermining subjacent support only when negligence can be shown. Other courts extend the absolute duty to provide lateral support for land to the context of subjacent support, imposing strict liability for removal of subjacent support. <i>See Los Osos Valley Associates v. City of San Luis Obispo</i>, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 758, 763 (Ct. App. 1994); <i>Muskatell v. City of Seattle</i>, 116 P.2d 363 (Wash. 1941); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> §818 illus. 1 &amp; 2 (1977) (adopting this approach).</p>

Separation of the surface from the mineral estate.</b> One exception to the rule that there is no duty to provide subjacent support in the absence of negligence occurs <span title="420" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-420">p. 420</span>when ownership of the minerals beneath the surface is separated from ownership of the surface. In the absence of agreement to the contrary, the owner of the surface has an absolute right not to have its subjacent support undermined by the owner of the mineral estate. In <i>Large v. Clinchfield Coal Co.</i>, 387 S.E.2d 783 (Va. 1990), the plaintiffs, George and Betty Large, sought to prevent the defendant, Clinchfield Coal Company, from engaging in “longwall mining,” a practice that involves removing coal without leaving any supporting pillars of coal, resulting in subsidence of the land surface. The court held that any appreciable damage to the surface or a diminution in its usability by the owner of the mineral estate will be sufficient to sustain a finding of liability without a need for a showing of negligence or unreasonableness. <i>Accord, Platts v. Sacramento Northern Railway</i>, 253 Cal. Rptr. 269 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding that a surface estate owner has an absolute right to subjacent support from the owner of a subsurface estate but that the obligation did not run with the land; the mineral estate owner who took possession of the property after the act causing the removal of the surface support was not responsible for the damage).</p>
<p id="c57719dd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Retroactivity.</b> The majority opinion in <i>Friendswood</i> argues that it is wrong to apply a new rule of law retroactively. What exactly does this mean? Does retroactivity constitute a particularly salient concern for property law? Although the opinion is confusingly worded, the majority sought to apply the new negligence rule both to new wells drilled after the date the opinion in <i>Friendswood</i> was issued and to withdrawals of water from existing wells that were drilled before the opinion was issued. Doesn’t application of the new rule to withdrawal of water from existing wells constitute a retroactive application of the new rule? After all, investments were arguably made in digging existing wells based on an expectation that the developer would be free from liability for any resulting harm.</p>
<p id="c57719de-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What arguments does the court give to justify refusing to apply the new rule retroactively to withdrawals of water that occurred in the past? What arguments could you make on behalf of the plaintiffs for retroactive application of the new rule? How could you argue that even if the new rule is applied prospectively as to all other landowners, it should be applied retroactively to benefit the plaintiffs who brought this particular lawsuit? Was the court correct to apply its new rule to future withdrawals of water from existing wells?</p>
<p id="c57719df-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Precedent.</b> The judges in <i>Friendswood</i> addressed a variety of policy arguments concerning the wisdom and justice of the competing rules advocated by the parties. They also interpreted earlier decisions to determine whether prior law answered the question, directly or indirectly. The majority opinion concluded that the case was governed by the previously established rule that owners have the absolute right to withdraw groundwater from their property, even if this has the effect of withdrawing groundwater from beneath other land. The court then chose to overrule the cases that established the existing rule and to apply the new rule prospectively. In contrast, the dissenting judge argued that the issue in <i>Friendswood</i> was not governed by the rule about withdrawal of groundwater at all; instead, the dissenting opinion distinguished the prior cases establishing that rule and argued that the case was one <span title="421" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-421">p. 421</span>of first impression, meaning that the specific issue before the court had never been precisely addressed by a prior case. In addition, each of the opinions referred to prior cases that established a variety of rules of law by arguing that those cases are analogous to the case at hand and that, therefore, the principles established in those prior cases should extend to the situation before the court.</p>
<p id="c57719e0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In applying precedent, the lawyers for each side look for precedents that help them. The plaintiff’s attorney, for example, may argue that a prior case stands for a broad rule of law that applies to the current case as well. To do this, the attorney must describe the holding of the earlier case — the rule of law for which it stands — in a way that encompasses both cases. The defendant’s attorney must attempt to distinguish the earlier case by arguing that the factual context in the earlier case is different in significant ways from the case at hand and that there are good reasons of policy or justice to adjudicate this case differently from the earlier case. Note that two steps are necessary in distinguishing a precedent: (a) identifying significant factual differences between the prior case and the case at hand, and (b) explaining why, as a matter of social policy, the cases should be handled differently. The plaintiff’s attorney must counter this argument by explaining why the case at hand is indistinguishable from the earlier case. This requires arguing that (a) the factual differences between the two cases are not important, and (b) the policies justifying the result in the earlier case apply to the current case as well.</p>

At least two prior cases, however, are relevant. Your jurisdiction has adopted the reasonable use test to govern conflicts over flooding caused by diffuse surface water, as established in <i>Armstrong v. Francis</i>: owners have a duty to act reasonably in developing their property to avoid causing unreasonable harm to neighboring owners that results from the runoff of diffuse surface water. Your jurisdiction has also adopted the free use or absolute ownership test to govern disputes over groundwater, as established in <i>Acton v. Blundell</i>, 152 Eng. Rep. 1223 (Exch. 1843), and <i>Houston &amp; T.C. Railway Co. v. East</i>, 81 S.W. 279 (Tex. 1904). Landowners may withdraw as much groundwater as they wish, unless they waste the water, even if the effect is to withdraw groundwater from beneath the plaintiff’s land. In addition, your jurisdiction has adopted the common law rule concerning lateral support of land: an absolute duty to support neighboring land in its natural condition but only a duty not to act negligently in withdrawing support from neighboring structures.</p>
