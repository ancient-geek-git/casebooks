<div id="c5272547-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" level="A" class="epub-section epub-ahead cc-section"><div class="epub-heading cc-section-title cc-font-xlarge left"><h2><p class="cc-wrapper" id="c5274c58-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a">Acknowledgments from Joseph William Singer</p></h2></div>

<p id="c5274c59-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book would not have been possible without the substantial help, suggestions, encouragement, and support of many people. I would like especially to thank Duncan Kennedy, whose imprint is evident throughout the book. He is responsible for some of the large structural components of the book, including the idea of organizing materials around the concept of consumer protection in the market for shelter, and many details, such as the inclusion of building code materials in the land use regulation section. He also developed the idea of systematizing legal arguments as a device for legal education. His personal, moral, and intellectual support over the years has been invaluable to me.</p>
<p id="c5274c5a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jeremy Paul contributed in fundamental ways to the ideas about property and law school teaching represented in this book. The takings materials especially are shaped by his perspective. I want to thank Jack Beermann for getting me to write this book. His encouragement and intellectual support over the years buoyed me tremendously. Elizabeth V. Spelman has been essential in teaching me to “think about thinking” and to explore gender, race, and class issues in social relations. I would like also to thank Williamson Chang and Robert A. Williams, Jr., for prompting my interest in the legal relations between the United States and American Indian nations and between the United States and Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians. Their personal insights and scholarly contributions on the property rights of Native American peoples contributed significantly to my own intellectual development and to various aspects of this book.</p>
<p id="c5274c5b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Various colleagues and friends who have provided detailed suggestions include Kathy Abrams, Greg Alexander, Keith Aoki, David Barron, Jack Beermann, Bethany Berger, Robert Brauneis, Betsy Clark, Alan Feld, Tamar Frankel, Louise Halper (ז״ל), James Holmes, Ian Haney López, Allan Macurdy, Martha Mahoney, Robert Merges, Ron Meyer, Frank Michelman, Nell Jessup Newton, Eduardo Peñalver, John Powell, John Rattigan, Aviam Soifer, Debra Pogrund Stark, Nomi Stoltzenberg, Gerald Torres, Robert Tuttle, Laura Underkuffler, André van der Walt, Johan van der Walt, and Kelly Weisberg.</p>

<p id="c5274c5d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The library reference staffs at Boston University School of Law and Harvard Law School made my life wonderfully easy and contributed enormously to the research necessary to this project. Special thanks go to Daniel Freehling, Marlene Alderman, Kim Dulin, Cynthia Murphy, Kristin Cheney, Jon Fernald, Naomi Ronen, and Janet Katz. William Kaleva, Carol Igoe, Holly Escott, and Patricia Fazzone provided cheerful and dedicated administrative assistance, at various times performing feats I would have thought impossible for human beings.</p>
<p id="c5274c5e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would like to thank Deans Martha Minow, Elena Kagan, and Robert Clark of Harvard Law School and Dean Ronald Cass of the Boston University School of Law for financial support for research. Many aspects of the book would have been less developed were it not for a slew of research assistants who labored over the years, including Vanessa Antoinette, Mekonnen Ayano, Benjamin Beasley, Alanna Buchanan, Ariane Buglione, David Bunis, Andrew Crespo, Jeffrey Engelsman, Joel Freedman, Melissa Friedman, Jonathan Gingerich, Rachel Gonzalez, Steven Gould, Margaret Guzman, Ulcca Hannsen, Joseph Harrington, Rebecca Haw, Philander Huynh, Gregory Ikonen, Laura Kershner, Vikas Khanna, Kylie Chiseul Kim, Brian Korchin, Lerae Kroon, Sara Madge, Stacey Moore, Garrett Moritz, Pablo Ormachea, Amanda Phillips, Michael Qin, Luke Riley, Isaac Saidel-Goley, Nathan Sandals, Neil Shah, Edward Tumavicus, Loren Washburn, David Wiseman, Ben Wizner, and Alithea Zymaris.</p>
<p id="c5274c5f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would like to thank the staff at Aspen for their invaluable help in preparing and editing this book. I am also grateful to the anonymous reviewers whose suggestions have been incorporated into the final product. I continue to be amazed by the wonders of WESTLAW and LEXIS. The availability of computer research techniques and the ability to download cases and statutes shortened by years the time needed to write this book.</p>
<p id="c5277370-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lila Singer has taught me about teaching and social action. Max Singer (ז״ל) has inspired me with his work on low-income housing and hunger. I want to thank them for my education and for their example of how to live—my greatest inheritance. Robert Singer and Anne Rayman have both taught me about caretaking, and Adam and Rachel have shown me how to take care of those who take care of you. Gale Singer Adland and Peter Adland have taught me about making a home, and Ari, Jesse, and Naomi have shown me how to grow up.</p>
<p id="c5277371-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Newton Minow has taught me to look at the real world and to figure out what works so that valuable resources are not wasted. Josephine Minow has taught me about attentiveness to others, involvement in causes, and how to get things done. Nell Minow <span title="lix" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-lix">p. lix</span>and David Apatoff have taught me about the government of business and the business of government, and Benjamin and Rachel have shown me how to get totally and fanatically engrossed in something. Mary Minow and James Robenolt have taught me about getting information and how to use it once I have gotten it.</p>
<p id="c5277372-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would like also to thank the late Justice Morris Pashman (ז״ל) of the Supreme Court of New Jersey for teaching me about the art of judging. It is impossible to define exactly what good judgment entails, but it can be understood, at least partly, through example. Justice Pashman’s sensitivity to the perspectives of each litigant epitomizes, for me, the preconditions for justice. When I try to imagine how a good judge would react to a particular problem, I turn to his example.</p>
<p id="c5277373-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I wish I could show this book to Marcel Pallais Checa (ז״ל). Marcel taught me what it meant to be a committed intellectual and how to tie one’s spiritual life to one’s political commitments. He taught me that a philosopher could also be an economist. His assassination reminds me of both the value and the limits of the rule of law.</p>
<p id="c5277374-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On May 31, 1992, Mira Judith Minow Singer made her astonishing entry into this world, voicing strong opinions, questioning authority, and generally sticking up for herself. She has increased my respect and admiration for parents generally and made me wonder how single parents manage. Her presence has reminded me that one out of every five children in the United States lives below the poverty line, and that almost half of all African American children do so. I wonder how we could take good care of her if we did not have a home. Mira has caused me to ponder anew the fact that we reward only some kinds of work with property while other kinds are not so rewarded, despite their social value, and the resultant inequalities that go along with such distinctions.</p>
<p id="c5277375-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book is doubly (in both senses of the word) dedicated to Martha Minow and Mary Joe Frug (ז״ל).</p>
<p id="c5277376-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mary Joe Frug’s scholarship on gender issues in contracts casebooks heavily influenced both the content and the structure of this book. From her I learned about hidden messages—often unintended—and how to ask who was left out of a seemingly comprehensive treatment of a subject. Her work encouraged me to ask whether there were entitlements important to women that are not traditionally included in introductory property courses. Addressing this question prompted me to include materials in this casebook on public accommodations statutes applicable to “private” clubs that discriminate against women, child support, AFDC, domestic violence restraining-order statutes, unemployment benefits for women who leave work to take care of children or to be with a loved one, enforceability of restraints on marriage, statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status, statutes prohibiting discrimination against families with children, the relationship between sex and race discrimination, statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, equitable distribution, community property, property rights of unmarried couples, and nontraditional family relationships. Her work also encouraged me to look for cases that included women as central actors, including opinions written by female judges and cases involving women in a variety of roles, as both landlords and tenants, business executives and housekeepers, victims and villains.</p>
<p id="c5279a87-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="lx" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-lx">p. lx</span>Like dozens of other people, I had set up a date to talk with Mary Joe. I hoped to get further advice from her about this casebook. Our conversation setting up our date took place several days before her death. I have been playing out the conversation we might have had ever since. I hope that some of her appears in this book.</p>
<p id="c5279a88-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This book is dedicated also to Martha Minow. Martha has taught me about multiplicity—the properties of family and the families of property—and the way it all looks from the differing perspectives of different people in their different situations. She has taught me to ask what difference an argument or practice makes to real people in real relationships in the real world. In her hands, abstract concepts become relations among people; real estate is not a lifeless thing, but a <i>setting</i> in which people have families, engage in work and commerce, make a home. It is those relationships that matter.</p>
<p id="c5279a89-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Imagine a walled city bursting at its seams; with too many people, the constraints of the wall cause division among the inhabitants and the possibility of oppression—the powerful are inclined to exclude the weak. Where others see constraints, scarcity, and frustration, Martha thinks about how to break the wall down or how to create openings in it; if these things cannot be done—for now—she imagines how relationships among people in the city might be restructured so that this artificial constraint becomes understood as everyone’s problem and not just the problem of minority groups. She embodies possibility; when everything seems hopeless, she opens doors to the land of change. In ways too many to count, to me and to many other people, she has made all the difference.</p>
