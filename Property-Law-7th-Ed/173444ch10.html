<p id="c5b31178-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One way owners may share ownership is by dividing ownership rights <i>over time</i>, separating the present right to possess the property from the <b>future interest</b>, the right to take possession in the future under specified circumstances.</p>
<p id="c5b31179-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The grantor specifies the circumstances under which the property will shift in the future from the present interest holder to the future interest holder. For example, the grantor may convey property to <i>A</i> so long as she is alive and then provide that at <i>A</i>’s death, the property will transfer to <i>B</i>. The grantor in this case is not attempting to control directly what <i>A</i> does with the property; however, by deciding who will own the property at <i>A</i>’s death, the grantor often hopes to indirectly control what is done with the property — perhaps by keeping the property in the family and making sure it is available for the grandchildren to inherit. Other times, the grantor seeks to directly control use of the property; for example, the grantor may convey property to <i>A</i> so long as the property is used for residential purposes, but if it is ever used for nonresidential purposes, ownership will revert to the grantor. In this case, the potential loss of title deters and sanctions the present owner for violating the conditions of the grant.</p>

<p id="c5b3388c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Technically, <b>heirs</b> are those entitled by law to inherit the property if the owner dies <b>intestate</b> (without a will), while <b>devisees</b> are those entitled to real property under a will. Intestate heirs are typically one’s spouse (and any children not from that marriage); if there is no spouse, then one’s children; if no spouse or children, then one’s parents; if no parents, then one’s siblings; if no siblings, then certain other relatives. If no relatives qualify as heirs, the property will <b>escheat</b> (es-CHEET) to the state.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b3388d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Present and future interests may be created by sale, lease, will, or trust. A seller may create a future interest in a deed. A landlord necessarily creates a future interest either orally or in a written lease because the property will revert to the landlord when the lease term expires. A <b>testator</b> or <b>testatrix</b> (one who dies leaving a valid will) can create a future interest by devising or bequeathing property in a will. A grantor may also create a future interest when establishing a <b>trust</b> (a legal arrangement in which one person or entity holds title to property for the benefit of another).</p>
<p id="c5b3388e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>Future interests may be certain to come into possession or may be <b>contingent</b> on events that may or may not happen. If <i>O</i> leases property to <i>A</i> for one year, for example, the property will automatically revert after one year (which is to say, the lease will end). If, however, <i>O</i> conveys property to <i>A</i> so long as it is used for residential purposes, the property will revert only if the property is used for nonresidential purposes, which may never happen.</p>
<p id="c5b3388f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Future interests exist the moment they are created even though the holder of the interest has no right to possess the property until the triggering event occurs. Suppose <i>O</i> conveys property to <i>A</i> so long as it is used for residential purposes; if the property is ever used for nonresidential purposes, the property goes automatically to <i>B</i>. The future interest in <i>B</i> comes into existence at the moment of the original conveyance to <i>A</i>; we say that <i>B</i> owns a future interest in the property, although <i>B</i> has no present right to occupy or use the property. <i>B</i> will have a right to possess, use, and control the property only if and when the condition is violated; the future interest will not become<b> possessory</b> unless and until the condition occurs.</p>
<p id="c5b33890-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By delegating to property owners the power to create future interests, the legal system enables people to exercise some degree of control over who owns the property in the future and what the future owner is entitled to do with it. This is an awesome power. The law of future interests raises a host of complicated policy questions. The two most pressing are the problem of dead hand control and the problem of social hierarchy.</p>
<p id="c5b33891-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The dead hand.</b> Owners may seek to control who owns property long after they die, giving rise to a problem often described as “dead hand control.” Allowing grantors or testators to do this may promote their interests and even enhance alienability; owners may be more willing to part with their property if they can control who owns it or how it is used in the future. However, conditions limit what owners may do with their property, thus interfering with freedom of future owners to control the property. This may undermine the autonomy of future owners and the efficient use and transfer of property. Affected persons may be able to remove archaic restrictions by contracting with the beneficiaries of the restraints to give up their rights. However, transaction costs may block such deals, especially if the persons with the right to enforce the restraint are not yet born or ascertained. Rigid enforcement of restrictions imposed long ago by grantors who could not anticipate current conditions can prevent property from being devoted to its best uses as social circumstances and needs change. The struggle for control between prior owners and current owners or between current owners and future owners requires a legal structure that balances their relative interests.</p>
<p id="c5b33892-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Hierarchy.</b> A second problem associated with future interests is the possibility that imposing restraints on alienation and use will have the effect of concentrating ownership in the hands of certain groups and excluding others. Restricting ownership to one’s descendants, for example, may be a useful way of securing expectations. If common, however, it would also concentrate ownership in the families of those who already own property. Such restrictions may also be even more pernicious; if property ownership could be lawfully conditioned on the property’s not being occupied by a <span title="741" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-741">p. 741</span>person of a particular race, for example, future interests could be used to perpetuate racial hierarchies.</p>
<p id="c5b33893-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To some extent, the marketplace is designed to decentralize power over social resources, dispersing them among citizens rather than concentrating them in the hands of government officials or an aristocracy. To maintain this decentralization of power, however, rules of law are necessary to prevent private owners from re-concentrating ownership by creating new monopolies or centers of power. For example, in <i>People ex rel. Moloney v. Pullman’s Palace Car Co.</i>, 51 N.E. 664 (Ill. 1898), the Illinois Supreme Court required the corporate owner of a company town inhabited by 12,000 people to sell off most of the property, <i>id.</i> at 674:</p>

It is clearly the theory of our law, streets, alleys and public ways, and public school buildings, should be committed to the control of the proper public authorities, and that real estate should be kept as fully as possible in the channels of trade and commerce, and good public policy demands that the number of persons who should engage in the business of selling such articles as are necessary to the support, maintenance and comfort of the people of any community should not be restricted by the will of any person, natural or artificial, but should be left to be determined by the healthy, wholesome and natural operations of the rules of trade and business, free from all that which tends to stifle competition and foster monopolies.</p>

<p id="c5b33898-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Future interest law emerged from centuries of attempts to avoid the only two things said to be certain, death and taxes. Since the Middle Ages, owners have sought to control ownership and use of their property after death and, even more important, avoid estate taxes and other payments to third parties. The law governing future interests was shaped as each generation thwarted past efforts to control property after death and governments thwarted efforts to avoid estate taxes and controls over landownership. After the historical purposes of the rules ended, the rules themselves often continued, in part because of inertia, in part because they served other policy goals, and in part because of the interests of lawyers and other estate professionals in maintaining the value of their expertise. Today the law of future interests is being revised yet again, as states <span title="742" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-742">p. 742</span>change their laws to attract tax-evading dynasty trusts. The resulting rules are both a revealing historical artifact and a potentially maddening trap for the unwary.</p>

<p id="c5b3389b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Norman Conquest left deep marks on legal language. Property, contract, tort, assault, battery, mortgage, covenant, court, justice, and indeed most legal terms owe their origins to French, which was for centuries the language of statutes and pleadings in England. 1 Frederick Pollock &amp; Frederic Maitland,<i> History of the English Law</i> 80-81 (1898).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b3389c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The estates system originated with the 1066 Norman Conquest of England led by William the Conqueror. To maintain military control of the conquered country, William divided its land in fee or feudum among his supporters. In return, they pledged him loyalty and certain duties, generally the provision of a number of knights for a portion of the year. One way tenants obtained knights was by allocating land to subtenants, who pledged the tenant-in-chief loyalty and knight service in return. This process of <b>subinfeudation</b> continued down the ladder to the tenant in demesne, the one who actually occupied and worked the land. Although each tenant owed loyalty and service to the superior landowner, these tenements were considered <b>freehold</b> estates. Even below these tenants were villeins, peasants who occupied and worked the land, but had unfree tenure. The distinction between free and unfree tenure was central since those possessed of free tenements had the right to bring lawsuits, called real actions, in the central royal courts where the common law developed. Until the sixteenth century, however, the villeins holding unfree tenure were relegated to manorial courts governed by local custom and the lord’s whim.</p>
<p id="c5b35fad-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Land possession in this system embedded one in a set of relationships and obligations. “Estate,” the word still used today to describe one’s interest in land, can be traced to the Latin root meaning “status.” Tenants owed their lords two different kinds of obligations: <b>services</b> (the periodic obligations promised by the tenant-grantee to the lord-grantor) and <b>incidents</b> (infrequent liabilities, including escheat and inheritance taxes).</p>

<p id="c5b35fb1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the feudal system began, most services were either knight service or other military service to the crown. Land was also granted to religious persons or institutions in return for religious services, or purely economic, such as the exchange of goods or labor. But services were often more idiosyncratic, designed to symbolize the relationship between the lord and his vassal. For example, one estate was held upon the service of holding the towel for the king when he washed his hands on the day of his coronation; another estate, notoriously, was held on the service of performing each Christmas day for the King’s amusement, “altogether and at <span title="743" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-743">p. 743</span>once, a leap, a puff, and a fart.” Thomas Blount,<i> Fragmentata Antiquitatis: Ancient Tenures of Land</i> 79 (Josiah Beckwith &amp; H.M. Beckwith eds. 1815). Within a few centuries, however, most services were commuted to monetary payments. Obligations to provide knight service became obligations to provide scutage, essentially a form of taxation controlled by the Parliament, and obligations to provide most other services were relieved by the payment of quit-rents, moneys enabling the tenant to “quit” other service. Although feudal services were commuted to money payments, the payments did not keep pace with inflation and their importance quickly declined.</p>
<p id="c5b35fb2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Feudal incidents, in contrast, involved possession of the land and its profits — benefits that did keep pace with inflation. Incidents initially included the obligation to pay a portion of the profits from the land in unspecified times of need; the right of the lord to appoint a new tenant at the death of the first; to act as guardian of the land (and reap its profits) if the tenant’s heir was a minor when the tenant died; and to arrange the marriages of his minor children and perhaps even his widow. Efforts by noble landholders to limit incidents generated the foundational documents of English constitutional law. In 1100, the <i>Charter of Liberties</i> provided that a tenant’s heir could automatically inherit his land upon the payment of relief — essentially estate taxes — and that the tenant’s widow could not be forced to remarry. The <i>Magna Charta</i> of 1215, the Great Charter of Liberties, emerged from a rebellion by the barons largely in protest against feudal incidents. Two-thirds of its provisions dealt with them, limiting when tenants could be obliged to pay incidents<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10124_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10124_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">1</a></span> fixing the amount of relief required before land could be inherited, and regulating the behavior of guardians appointed as wards of the estates of underage heirs. Important continuing incidents also included <b>escheat</b>, the right of the lord to regain the land if his tenant died without an heir or committed a felony, and <b>forfeiture</b>, the right of the king to retake the land if the tenant committed treason.</p>
<p id="c5b35fb4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Royal reaction to attempts to avoid incidents ultimately led to the creation of the <b>fee simple</b>, land held without homage to any lord. The initial tenurial relationship was personal; because service from that particular landholder was key to the relationship between a vassal and his lord, it was not possible to simply buy and sell land. One could only subinfeudate, remaining a vassal to the lords above in the feudal ladder, and becoming a lord to one’s own tenants in turn.</p>
<p id="c5b35fb5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because incidents reflected the value of the land to the person owing the incidents, however, a tenant could reduce the incidents owed to his lord by subinfeudating for a profit of little value. If <i>O</i> had a tenant <i>A</i>, and <i>A</i> subinfeudated to his son <i>B</i> in return for a pound of pepper a year, then <i>A</i>’s incidents to <i>O</i> reflected the value of that pepper. To avoid such evasion, Parliament enacted the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i> in 1290, prohibiting further subinfeudation and requiring all future transfers of interests in land to take place by substitution of one owner for another — in effect a sale of all one’s interests and obligations. <i>Quia Emptores</i> created a deep paradox. Although intended to protect <span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-744">p. 744</span>feudalism, it did so by enshrining at the core of the common law of property the key principle of promoting the alienability of property.</p>
<p id="c5b35fb6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Efforts to avoid incidents and determine how property would descend on death created a further dance between landowners and government. Until 1540, land could not be devised by will, but only inherited by one’s legal heirs. Heirs are those who inherit by operation by law; today this generally means division among one’s closest relatives. For much of English history, however, this generally meant inheritance only by one’s eldest living son, called <b>primogeniture</b>. Daughters would receive land only if no sons survived the landowner, and younger sons and widows could never inherit. <i>Quia Emptores</i>, however, meant that the heir could alienate the land, ending the family’s connection to the land and the status it conferred. In addition, the doctrine of coverture meant that a woman’s property legally became her husband’s; unless specially conditioned, that could mean it would descend to her husband’s heirs rather than her own or those of her family. To evade these results and payment of relief on death, landholders sought to transfer their land during their lifetimes and place conditions on who would have it after their deaths. These efforts, and the responses by heirs and Parliament, created a number of estates and rules with some relevance today. Four of these, <b>the Rule in Shelley’s Case</b>, <b>the doctrine of worthier title</b>, <b>the trust</b>, and <b>the fee tail</b>, are discussed here.</p>
<p id="c5b35fb7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The Rule in Shelley’s Case.</b> One attempt to avoid payment of relief was to create a life estate — a property interest that lasts only for the life of the grantee — in one individual with a future interest in the grantee’s heirs. Because <i>A</i>’s heirs acquired the interest during <i>O</i>’s lifetime by conveyance, rather than by inheritance on <i>A</i>’s death, they did not have to pay relief. If the owner of the life estate was a woman, moreover, the conveyance could help ensure that the land went to her children, rather than what would otherwise have been a required transfer to her husband and his children by any later wife. The courts responded with what became known as the <b>Rule in Shelley’s Case</b>, which treated the interest in <i>A</i>’s heir as an interest in <i>A</i>. In other words,</p>

The Rule has now been abolished in almost all states, but may still exist in Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, and in some form in Indiana. T.P. Gallanis, <i>The Future of Future Interests</i>, 60 Wash. &amp; Lee L.

<p id="c5b386cc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The doctrine of worthier title.</b> The <b>doctrine of worthier title</b> is similar to the Rule in Shelley’s case, but applies to grants in which a life estate is followed by an interest in the <i>grantor’s</i>, rather than the grantee’s, heirs. The interest in the grantor’s <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>heirs would be read as an interest in the grantor, so that his heirs would have to inherit rather than take without paying relief, like this:</p>

<p id="c5b3ade0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the Rule in Shelley’s Case, most states have abolished the doctrine of worthier title, but it may remain viable in Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia, and perhaps a few other states. Gallanis, <i>supra</i>, at 546-548; <i>Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills &amp; Other Donative Transfers</i> §16.3 (2011). Even in states that recognize the rule, it has become simply a rule of construction that can be defeated by clear intent of the grantor.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although largely abolished, the rules do have some current policy justification. No one has heirs until they die. It is therefore impossible to contract regarding future ownership of the property until the death of the life estate holder, because the owners of that interest won’t be identified until then. This inability to contract may interfere with the alienability of the property.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The trust.</b> Landowners also sought to evade descent rules by granting property to one individual for the “use” of another. For example, <i>O</i> might grant property to <i>A</i> for the use of <i>B</i>. <i>A</i> would have the legal estate, but <i>B</i> would have the right to use and profit from the land. <i>O</i> might even grant land to <i>A</i> for the use of <i>O</i>. Although estates in land could not be left by will, uses could, so a use might be willed to one’s younger sons, widow, or daughters. Uses could also be used to evade feudal incidents. Felony or treason by the user would not result in escheat or forfeiture. If the legal estate was vested in several people and one died, moreover, the estate would be consolidated in the survivors without inheritance, thus avoiding both relief and the possibility of escheat because of failure of heirs. Finally, because transferring uses did not require the same public formalities as transferring estates, the use could be employed to hide one’s conveyances from the public. In a development reminiscent of modern trust law, the legal estates were often vested in attorneys, who received suitable compensation, creating a professional class devoted to continuing the use.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1536, Parliament sought to end exploitation of the use with the <i>Statute of Uses</i>, which provided that the legal estate would vest entirely in the user. Grants of uses, therefore, would have the same effect as grants of land and be subject to the same inheritance laws. Reaction against the statute was so negative that Parliament enacted the <i>Statute of Wills</i> in 1540, which for the first time allowed landowners to devise their property by will. Thereafter, owners had an easier way to avoid both primogeniture and escheat in the absence of heirs.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hasty drafting of the Statute of Uses also created a number of loopholes, which courts were often willing to exploit. In particular, a grant of a use “in trust” for a third party, or to accomplish a particular purpose, was not affected by the statute. By 1700, the trust had filled the place the use had occupied. Today modern trusts involve a grantor, called the <b>settlor</b> or <b>trustor</b>, conveying property to some person or entity (the <b>trustee</b>) <span title="746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-746">p. 746</span>for the benefit of another person or purpose or entity, called the <b>beneficiary</b>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10227_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10227_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">2</a></span> A trust may be in favor of one’s family and friends, commercial, or for charitable purposes. For example:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5b3ade6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>O</i> to <i>A</i>, in trust for <i>B</i> until she reaches the age of majority, then to <i>B</i>.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>O</i> in trust to <i>A Foundation</i>, to provide health care to the poor.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b3ade8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In both cases, <i>A</i> has <i>legal title</i>, but is bound by equitable rules to use the estate for the trust beneficiary or the purposes of the trust. As in early English practice, the trust plays an important role in tax and estate planning, in charitable giving, and in the business of lawyers and other professionals.</p>
<p id="c5b3ade9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>The fee tail.</b> The fee tail should be familiar to anyone who has read the books of Jane Austen or watched <i>Downton Abbey</i>. The traditional words to create a fee tail are “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> and the heirs of his body.” This conveyance created ownership in <i>A</i> for life, then ownership in <i>A</i>’s lineal descendant entitled to inherit under English law for life, and so on through a series of life estates in <i>A</i>’s lineal descendants until the blood line ran out. A fee tail might be more specific, only in favor of heirs of the bodies of a married couple, in favor of female heirs, or in favor of male heirs. We see an example of the fee tail in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, in which Mr. Bennett’s estate “was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation,” the dreadful Mr. Collins. The book revolves around the efforts of his daughter and wife to avoid the resulting loss of income and social position after his death.</p>
<p id="c5b3d4fa-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fee tail was initially intended to preserve the integrity of the family estate. Because one could not contract with unborn heirs to obtain their future interests, the land could not be sold away from the family or levied to pay the life tenant’s debts. By the fifteenth century, however, life tenants were able to bar, or eliminate, the entail through a procedure known as the <b>common recovery</b>, a collusive lawsuit that resulted in a default judgment awarding the land to a cooperative litigant, who would then convey the estate back to the tenant free of the entail.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10274_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10274_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">3</a></span> <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> may refer to the common recovery in explaining that Mr. Bennett had expected to have a son, and “[t]his son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.”</p>
<p id="c5b3d4fc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, most states abolished the fee tail soon after the Revolution. The abolition is often described as a triumph of civic republicanism. Thomas Jefferson, for example, credited himself with the abolition of the fee tail in Virginia, declaring that the change undermined an “aristocracy of wealth,” making an “opening for the aristocracy of virtue and talent.” Recent scholarship by Claire Priest challenges this characterization. <span title="747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-747">p. 747</span>As in England, the life tenant could bar the entail and alienate the estate. Yet entailed property was fairly common in the colonies, and included humble estates as well as large ones. Why, if it was not effective in preventing alienation, was the entail so popular? Professor Priest argues that because only the landowners themselves could bar the entail, it was an effective means of protecting the homestead from creditors, who might otherwise seize the property for payment of debts. She argues that the end of the entail owes more to opposition by creditors and desire of large slaveholders to maintain a liquid market for land for plantations. <i>See</i> Claire Priest, <i>Creating an American Property Law: Alienability and Its Limits in American History</i>, 120 Harv.

Some states have applied these laws to find that such children can inherit, <i>Woodward v.

<p id="c5b3d504-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The modern estates are largely those created during this medieval English history. For several reasons, it remains important to learn them today. First, ambiguous grants and conveyances will be interpreted as fitting into one of these existing categories. For lawyers who draft wills, trusts, leases, and conveyances, therefore, understanding the language that creates the estates and their properties is necessary to accomplish the intent of your clients. For lawyers representing clients in challenging or defending existing conveyances, understanding the traditional forms is equally important. Second, even when modern law has modified the traditional forms, wills and conveyances will usually be interpreted under the rules governing when they were created. Third, understanding how these estates work is a necessary step in tackling the rule against perpetuities, which, when it applies, may entirely defeat future interests. Finally, studying <span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span>these estates has been a rite of passage for aspiring lawyers since before there were law schools.

<p id="c5b3fc15-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These materials are divided according to the potential length in time of the present estate: first, the <b>fee simple estates</b>, which could potentially last forever; and second, the <b>life estates</b>, which last only for the life of a particular person. There is a third present estate, the<b> term of years</b>, which is any estate limited not by a natural life or event but by a specific period of time, whether 6 months or 100 years. Terms of years were considered non-freehold estates under medieval law, and therefore often not subject to the same rules as other estates. They will therefore not be discussed here, but rather in Chapter 11, <i>Leaseholds</i>.</p>
<p id="c5b3fc16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three interpretive rules that may be helpful in interpreting language creating future interests. First, one cannot grant more than one has. For example, if one grants a present estate limited by a future interest to another, the grantee generally receives the property limited by the future interest as well. Second, unless the grant contains limiting language, the grantor will be presumed to have given away all of the transferred interest. So, for example, a grant of a fee simple interest from grantor to grantee without specifying a future interest will be interpreted as granting the property forever. Third, whatever is not granted remains with the grantor. For example, if the grant transfers the interest only for a certain period of time, but does not specify what happens to the property after that period, the future interest is presumed to remain with the grantor.</p>

In effect, it is the right to determine who owns it in the future, whether by sale, gift, inheritance, or devise. There are four fee simple estates: the fee simple absolute; the fee simple determinable; the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent; and the fee simple subject to executory limitation.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102EE_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N102EE_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">4</a></span></p>

<p id="c5b44a4e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is created using <i>words of condition</i> (<i>e.g</i>., on condition that, but if, provided that). It generally must explicitly state the right of entry, but some courts will interpret grants made “on express condition” as implying the right of entry:</p>

<p id="c5b44a53-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Possibilities of reverter and rights of entry were traditionally not transferable, both because they were deemed too insubstantial to transfer, and because permitting transfer would facilitate enforcement of the restriction. In many jurisdictions, even when possibilities of reverter were alienable, rights of entry were not. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills &amp; Other Donative Transfers</i> §25.2 (2011). Some states retain the traditional rule. <i>See</i> 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 330 (possibilities of reverter and rights of entry not alienable); Neb. Rev. Stat. §76-299 (possibilities of reverter and rights of entry neither alienable nor devisable); N.D. Cent. Code §47-09-02 (rights of entry not transferrable except to possessory owner of property affected). Most states now hold that future interests are alienable as well as devisable and inheritable. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts §6-5.1. Even in states that now permit alienation of possibilities of reverter and rights of entry, however, transfers made before the law changed to permit alienability will be invalid. <i>See Cathedral of the Incarnation in the Diocese of Long Island, Inc. v. Garden City Co.</i>, 697 N.Y.S.2d 56 (App. Div. 1999) (attempted transfer in 1893 destroyed right of entry).</p>
<p id="c5b44a54-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="751" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-751">p. 751</span>Traditionally, a major difference between possibilities of reverter and rights of entry involved the statute of limitations for adverse possession. When a condition in a fee simple determinable is violated or occurs, the possibility of reverter kicks in automatically, giving the holder an immediate right of possession. The statute of limitations starts running immediately, and if the holder of the possibility of reverter does nothing for the statutory period, title will shift back to the current possessor. However, a right of entry does not become possessory until the holder asserts a right of possession; if the holder of the right of entry never asserts the right, the title will remain with the present estate owner. This would mean that violation of the condition in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not trigger the statute of limitations unless and until the holder of the right of entry demands a right of possession; before that point, no trespass has occurred. <i>See Swaby v. Northern Hills Regional Railroad Authority</i>, 769 N.W.2d 798 (S.D. 2009) (although railroad had breached a condition subsequent by abandoning an easement in 1970, because future interest holders had not exercised their power of termination, statute of limitation had not begun to run). Under this understanding, there is a huge difference between rights of entry and possibilities of reverter.</p>
<p id="c5b44a55-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, the two types of future interests may now be treated similarly under one of three theories. First, <b>laches</b> may prevent the holder of a right of entry from waiting too long to assert her right of entry; laches prevents recovery when an unreasonable delay in asserting legal rights unfairly prejudices another. Relatedly, some courts require that a right of entry be exercised within a reasonable time after violation of the condition. <i>Sligh v. Plair</i>, 263 Ark. 936 (1978); <i>Martin v. City of Seattle,</i> 765 P.2d 257 (Wash. 1988). In both cases, the statute of limitations for trespass provides one measure of unreasonable delay. <i>Ator v. Ator</i>, 146 P.3d 821 (Okla. App. 2006) (8-year delay in exercising right of entry not unreasonable in light of 15-year statute of limitations for trespass). Finally, some states provide a statute of limitations for rights of entry by statute. Cal. Civ. Code §885.070 (five-year statute of limitations).</p>

A conveyance from <i>O to A for life</i> creates a <b>life estate</b> in <i>A</i>. This means that <i>A</i> owns the property during his lifetime. The future interest following a life estate can be either in the grantor or in a third party.

<p id="c5b47170-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between a life estate and a fee simple is that the owner of a fee simple can choose who will own the property after her death by either writing a will or availing herself of the state intestacy statute. In contrast, a life estate owner has no right to determine who owns the property on her death since ownership automatically shifts to the reversioner or remainder holder. If a life estate owner, <i>A</i>, sells her property to a buyer, <i>B</i>, the buyer gets exactly what the seller had: an estate for the life of <i>A</i>. Thus, when <i>A</i> dies, the property will shift to the reversioner or remainder holder. <i>B</i>’s interest is called a <b>life estate for the life of another</b> or a <b>life estate <i>per autre vie</i></b>.</p>

<p id="c5b47177-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One final set of distinctions is important. We have seen that future interests following defeasible fees vest either in the grantor (<i>possibility of reverter</i> or <i>right of <span title="753" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-753">p. 753</span>entry</i>) or in a third party (<i>executory interest</i>). Future interests following life estates also may vest either in the grantor (<i>reversion</i>) or in a third party (<i>remainder</i>). Remainders are further divided into two kinds: <b>contingent remainders</b> and <b>vested remainders</b>.</p>
<p id="c5b47178-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Contingent remainders.</b> Remainders are contingent if one or both of two conditions are met: (1) if the remainder will take effect only upon the happening of an event that is not certain to happen, or (2) if the remainder will go to a person who cannot be ascertained at the time of the initial conveyance.</p>
<p id="c5b47179-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, a conveyance from “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to <i>B</i> if <i>B</i> has graduated from law school,” creates a contingent remainder because at the time of the original conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> it is not certain that <i>B</i> will graduate from law school. (If <i>B</i> does not graduate from law school, the property will revert to <i>O</i> on <i>A</i>’s death; if <i>B</i> later graduates from law school, the property will then spring to <i>B</i>.)</p>
<p id="c5b4988a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contingent remainders often arise in the context of <b>class gifts</b>, grants to a group that is merely described but not named. For example, a class gift from “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to the children of <i>B</i>,” creates a contingent remainder in the children of <i>B</i> if <i>B</i> has no children upon the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>, because the children cannot be individually identified at the time of the conveyance. Another example of a class gift creating a contingent remainder is “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to the heirs of <i>B</i>.” If <i>B</i> is alive at the time of the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>, it is impossible to tell who <i>B</i>’s heirs will be until <i>B</i> dies; only persons alive at the time of <i>B</i>’s death can inherit as “heirs” under the intestacy statute.</p>
<p id="c5b4988b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Vested remainders.</b> Vested remainders, conversely, are remainders to persons who are identifiable at the time of the initial conveyance and for whom no conditions must occur before the future interest becomes possessory other than the death of the life estate tenant. Vested remainders are of three kinds.</p>
<p id="c5b4988c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Absolutely vested remainders.</b> This is a remainder that is not subject to change. “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, and then to <i>B</i>” for example, creates an absolutely vested remainder.</p>
<p id="c5b4988d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Vested remainders subject to open.</b> Typically arising in class gifts, this is a remainder that is vested in some individuals but may be divided with others who join the class in the future. For example, a class gift from “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to the children of <i>B</i>,” is a vested remainder if <i>B</i> has any living children at the time of the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>; it is <b>subject to open</b>, however, because any children of <i>B</i> born <i>after</i> the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> may share the property rights with the children who were alive at the time of the conveyance. Under the <b>rule of convenience</b>, most courts will, absent contrary evidence of grantor intent, close the class when <i>A</i> dies so that <i>B</i>’s children can take possession at <i>A</i>’s death and will not have to share the property with any after-born children.</p>
<p id="c5b4988e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3.

<p id="c5b49891-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law formerly provided that contingent remainders were “destroyed” in two circumstances. First, contingent remainders were destroyed if they did not vest before the preceding life estate ended. For example, in the conveyance “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to <i>B</i> if she has been elected president of the United States,” the contingent remainder in <i>B</i> would be destroyed if <i>B</i> had not been elected president before the death of <i>A</i>. The justification for the rule was purely formal: the property would revert to <i>O</i> if the condition had not occurred by the end of the life estate, and it was believed inconsistent with the nature of the estate to have a remainder “spring” from the life estate over an interest in <i>O</i> once the condition occurred.</p>
<p id="c5b4bfa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, contingent remainders were destroyed by “merger” of the present and future estates. For example, suppose <i>O</i> conveyed her property to <i>A</i> for life, and then to <i>A</i>’s children. If <i>A</i> does not have children at the time of the conveyance, then the children have a contingent remainder, and the property will revert to <i>O</i> if <i>A</i> dies without children. If <i>O</i> then conveyed her reversion to <i>A</i>, the traditional doctrine would say that the contingent remainder was destroyed, leaving <i>A</i> with a fee simple and any future children with nothing. <i>See Abo Petroleum Corp. v. Amstutz</i>, 600 P.2d 278 (N.M. 1979) (rejecting the doctrine of merger).</p>
<p id="c5b4bfa3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Almost all states have abolished the destructibility of contingent remainders by common law or statute, and the last case to apply the rule was decided in 1963. <i>Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills &amp; Other Donative Transfers</i> §25.5 (2011). While it is theoretically possible that one of the few states that have not officially abolished the rule might apply it, it is extremely unlikely. It is fair to conclude with the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> that “[t]he Rule of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders is not recognized as part of American law.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5b4bfa4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional rule effectively destroyed many future interests that could have vested after the death of the current life estate holder. Applying the rule therefore resulted in freeing land from archaic restrictions. Today contingent remainders likely to vest too far into the future are regulated by the rule against perpetuities or by statutory limits on their continuation, discussed at §5.3.C, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p id="c5b53407-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants Cecil and Edna Wood, husband and wife, appeal summary judgment favoring appellee, the Board of County Commissioners for Fremont County, Wyoming. By a 1948 warranty deed appellants conveyed land in Riverton, Wyoming, to Fremont County for the construction of a county hospital. They now contend that language in the deed created either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent with a right of reversion in them if the land ceased to be used for the hospital. [This case presents the question whether] cessation of appellee’s hospital operation by sale of public hospital facilities to a private company constituted the occurrence of an event which divested appellee of its estate in property conditionally conveyed by appellants. The trial court found that appellants retained no interest in the land surrounding and under the old county hospital as a matter of law. We affirm.</p>

<p id="c5b5340a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This deed was recorded in the Fremont County Clerk’s Office on December 14, 1948. Appellee constructed a hospital on the land and operated it there until November 18, 1983. At that time appellee sold the land and the original hospital facility to a private company. The buyer operated a hospital on the premises until September, 1984, at which time it moved the operation to a newly constructed facility. The private company then put the premises up for sale.</p>
<p id="c5b55b1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ argument boils down to whether or not the language “. . . for the purpose of constructing and maintaining thereon a County Hospital in memorial to the gallant men of the Armed Forces of the United States of America from Fremont County, Wyoming . . .” in the 1948 warranty deed is sufficient limiting language to create either 1) a fee simple determinable, or 2) a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent giving appellants title to the land. We review disputed language in a deed to determine the intent of the parties to it from the plain language in the deed considered as a <span title="757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-757">p. 757</span>whole. Also, Wyo. Stat. §34-2-101 (1977) provides, in pertinent part: “[E]very conveyance of real estate shall pass all the estate of the grantor . . . unless the intent to pass a less estate shall expressly appear or be necessarily implied in the terms of the grant.”</p>
<p id="c5b55b1c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A fee simple estate in land that automatically expires upon the happening of a stated event, not certain to occur, is a fee simple determinable. <i>Restatement of Property</i> §44, at 121 (1936). In <i>Williams v. Watt</i>, 668 P.2d 620, 627 (Wyo. 1983), we said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5b55b1d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of an estate in fee simple determinable requires the presence of special limitations. An estate in fee simple determinable may be created so as to be defeasible upon the occurrence of an event which is not certain ever to occur. Words such as “so long as,” “until,” or “during” are commonly used in a conveyance to denote the presence of this type of special limitation. The critical requirement is that the language of special limitation must clearly state the particular circumstances under which the fee simple estate conveyed might expire. Language of conveyance that grants a fee simple estate in land for a special purpose, without stating the special circumstances that could trigger expiration of the estate, is not sufficient to create a fee simple determinable.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b55b1e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plain language in the 1948 deed, stating that appellants conveyed the land to Fremont County for the purpose of constructing a county hospital, does not clearly state that the estate conveyed will expire automatically if the land is not used for the stated purpose. As such, it does not evidence an intent of the grantors to convey a fee simple determinable, and we hold that no fee simple determinable was created when the land was conveyed.</p>
<p id="c5b55b1f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Use of the language conveying the land in “memorial” similarly fails to create a fee simple determinable. “Memorial” is defined in <i>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary</i> 1409 (1971) as “[s]omething that serves to preserve memory or knowledge of an individual or event.” The time for which the hospital should serve to “preserve” the memory or knowledge is not stated in the deed, just as the time for maintaining the hospital is not there stated. The language of conveyance fails to designate the time at which the hospital must be constructed as well as the time during which it must be maintained or during which the indicated memory must be preserved. The omission of such limiting language evidences an intent not to convey a fee simple determinable.</p>
<p id="c5b55b20-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar reasoning applies to appellants’ assertion that the language of conveyance created a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is a fee simple estate in land that gives the grantor a discretionary power to terminate the grantee’s estate after the happening of a stated event, not certain to occur. This type of interest is similar to the fee simple determinable in that the language of conveyance must clearly state the grantor’s intent to create a discretionary power to terminate the estate he conveys. Words commonly used in a conveyance to denote the presence of a fee simple estate subject to a condition subsequent include “upon express condition that,” “upon condition that,” “provided that,” or “if.” In <i>J.M. Carey &amp; Brother v. City of Casper</i>, 213 P.2d 263, 268 (Wyo. 1950), we quoted 19 <i>Am. Jur. Estates</i> §65 at 527 (1939), which said:</p>

<p id="c5b55b21-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a well-settled rule that conditions tending to destroy estates, such as conditions subsequent, are not favored in law. They are strictly construed. Accordingly, no <span title="758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-758">p. 758</span>provision will be interpreted to create such a condition if the language will bear any other reasonable interpretation, or unless the language, used unequivocally, indicates an intention upon the part of the grantor or devisor to that effect and plainly admits of such construction.</p>

</div>
<p id="c5b55b25-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That rule has not lost its potency. Applying it to this case, we hold that the plain language of the 1948 warranty deed, while articulating that the land conveyed was to be used for a county hospital, does not clearly state an intent of the grantors to retain a discretionary power to reenter the land if the land ceased to be used for the stated purpose. Appellants did not convey a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and we will not create one by construction some forty years after the conveyance took place.</p>

<p id="c5b5823f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Item Twelve: I give and devise my farm situated on the Seaside from Locustville, in the County of Accomack, State of Virginia . . . to my daughter, Margaret Lilliston Edwards, upon the conditions, set out in Item Fourteen. . . . </p>
<p id="c5b58240-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Item Fourteen: all gifts made to my daughter, Margaret L. Edwards, individually and personally, under Items Eleven and Twelve of this Will, whether personal estate or real estate, are conditioned upon the said Margaret L. Edwards keeping the gift or devise herein free from encumbrances of every description, and in the event the said Margaret L. Edwards shall attempt to encumber same or sell her interest, or in the event any creditor or creditors of said Margaret L. Edwards shall attempt to subject her interest in the gift or devise herein made to the payment of the debts of the said Margaret L. Edwards, then and in that event the interest of said Margaret L.

Edwards, Jill A. Edwards and Jackie L. Edwards, in equal shares in fee simple. . . .</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b58241-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Margaret L. Jones, formerly Margaret L. Edwards, qualified as executrix under her mother’s will. In 1979, Jones sought to have her children and their spouses execute an agreement to consent to her selling the farm devised to her. Only a daughter, Beverly Bradley, and the latter’s husband declined to execute the agreement. In 1980, Jones died testate; in her will, executed in 1979, she left Bradley $1.00, and directed that the farm be sold and the proceeds distributed equally among her other children. The <span title="759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-759">p. 759</span>executors named in the will duly qualified. Bradley filed a bill of complaint in the trial court against these personal representatives and her five brothers and sisters, alleging that under the Lilliston will a life estate was devised to Jones with remainder to Jones’s children. Bradley sought to enjoin the sale or encumbrance of the farm without her consent and asked that her interest therein be determined.</p>
<p id="c5b58242-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After hearing evidence presented by Bradley, the trial court determined that Jones had not violated any of the conditions specified in the Lilliston will. Edwards presented no evidence. The trial judge issued a letter opinion in which he stated his conclusion that under the Lilliston will a life estate in the farm was devised to Jones with remainder to her six named children in fee simple. A final decree, incorporating the opinion by reference, was entered March 25, 1981. On appeal, Edwards argued before us that Jones had fee simple title subject to valid conditional limitations and, having not violated the conditions, could freely dispose of the farm by will as she chose. Edwards argued in the alternative on brief that if the conditions were invalid Jones was vested with fee simple title without restrictions or conditions even though such unconditional vesting would have been contrary to her mother’s intent to protect the farm from Jones’s creditors.</p>
<p id="c5b58243-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no conflict in the evidence. Jones was in financial difficulties when the Lilliston will was executed. The will was prepared by an experienced attorney. One provision, referring specifically to the enabling statute, established a spendthrift trust for the benefit of another child of the testatrix.</p>
<p id="c5b58244-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge, in his opinion, noted that the “able and experienced” draftsman had used the words “fee simple” at least seven times in the will and codicil. Apparently, the judge reasoned that if a fee simple estate had been intended for Jones, the draftsman would have used that terminology in Item Twelve. Moreover, the judge stated that under Edwards’s theory that Jones died vested with fee simple title, a creditor could then bring a creditor’s suit to subject the land to the satisfaction of the debt contrary to the testamentary conditions and the intent of Lilliston. The judge further stated that the conditions set forth in Item Fourteen were repugnant to a fee simple estate but not to an estate for life. For these reasons, he ruled that a life estate was created under the Lilliston will.</p>
<p id="c5b58245-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a general rule, a condition totally prohibiting the alienation of a vested fee simple estate or requiring a forfeiture upon alienation is void. As an exception to the rule, conditions prohibiting alienation of land granted to corporate entities for their special purposes are valid. A conditional limitation imposed upon a life estate, however, is valid. <i>See also Restatement of Property</i> §409 (1944), where such limitations, therein classified as forfeiture restraints, are said to be valid as to life estates.</p>
<p id="c5b58246-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is apparent, therefore, that if Lilliston’s will vested fee simple title to the farm in Jones, the unqualified restraint on alienation would be invalid and the property from the time of vesting would be subject to sale, encumbrance, or devise by her and subject to the claims of her creditors, results contrary to the express intent of the testatrix. On the other hand, if Lilliston’s will vested a life estate in Jones, the unqualified restraint on alienation imposed by the testatrix would be valid. Jones could not acquire, as Edwards suggested, a life estate which, upon compliance with the testamentary <span title="760" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-760">p. 760</span>conditions, became a fee simple estate at the time of her death. Jones acquired under the Lilliston will either a fee simple estate free of conditions and thus inconsistent with the testatrix’s intent or a life estate subject to conditions and thus consistent with such intent.</p>
<p id="c5b58247-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The draftsman of the Lilliston will carefully avoided using in either Item Twelve or Item Fourteen the words “fee simple” which he had used elsewhere in the instrument. It is true, as Edwards observed, that he also did not use the words “life estate” in those clauses of the will. Under Va. Code §55-11 it is not necessary to use the words “in fee simple” to create a fee simple estate where real estate is devised without words of limitation unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will. In the present case, however, the real estate was devised with words of limitation and a contrary intention appears in the will. Moreover, unless there is a power of disposal in the first taker, Va. Code §55-7, a life estate may be created by implication as well as by explicit language, provided the will shows the requisite intent.</p>
<p id="c5b58248-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the testatrix established a spendthrift trust in another provision of her will, she was aware of the availability of that device but did not choose to use it for the benefit of Jones. Moreover, under Va. Code §55-7, the testatrix could have devised the land to Jones for life with a power of appointment under which Jones could have disposed of the property by will. She did not do so.</p>
<p id="c5b58249-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intention of the testatrix is to be upheld if the will can be reasonably construed to effectuate such intent and if it is not inconsistent with an established rule of law. In addition, the language of the will is “to be understood in the sense in which the circumstances of the case show” that the testatrix intended. <i>Gray v. Francis</i>, 124 S.E. 446, 450 (Va. 1924). Here, the testatrix intended that Jones have the use and benefit of the real estate free of the claims of her creditors. The ultimate beneficiaries were Jones’s children. Although the will did not expressly designate the children as remaindermen, the conditional limitation to them indicated that they were intended to take the farm when their mother’s interest terminated, whether by violation of the conditions or otherwise. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly ruled that Jones acquired a life estate in the property with remainder at her death in fee simple to her six children.</p>

<p id="c5b5824c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Estates.</b> We could allow owners complete freedom to create future interests as they please. This approach would protect freedom of contract or free disposition of property. This is not the way the property law system developed. A variety of rules limits the ability of owners to create future interests, both to protect the interests of current owners in using their property and having the power to transfer it and to protect social interests in efficient land use. These rules compromise between the interests of grantors and grantees. One regulatory rule is the <b>rule against creation of new estates</b>, discussed below at §5.1. This rule prohibits owners from creating ownership packages that do not fit within one of the established estates; it helps ensure that sufficient rights are consolidated in owners so that they can act like owners. <span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-761">p. 761</span>This means that the courts must interpret conveyances or wills to determine which estate the grantor intended to create. The court cannot simply ask what future interest the grantor intended to create; instead, the court must fit the future interest into an established category.</p>
<p id="c5b5824d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Interpretation and the presumption against forfeitures.</b> Sometimes grantors do not use traditional language to create one of the estates. Other times, grantors use conflicting language, seeming to create one estate in one phrase and another estate in another phrase. In either case, courts must interpret the conveyance to determine what types of current and future interests were created and who owns the property. Two conflicting rules of interpretation dominate court discussions of this issue. On one hand, courts often proclaim their fealty to the goal of effectuating the <i>grantor’s intent</i> to the extent it can be discerned from language in the deed or will or, possibly, from the surrounding circumstances. On the other hand, when the language is ambiguous, most courts also voice a preference for a construction of the language that will avoid recognition of a future interest. This is especially so if recognition of the future interest would mean that the present possessor lost her title to the future interest holder. It is a common maxim that “the law abhors a forfeiture.” <i>Harrison v. Morrow</i>, 977 So. 2d 457 (Ala. 2007). There is therefore a <b>presumption against forfeitures</b>. If it is possible to interpret the language to avoid loss of the property by the current owner, the courts will generally adopt this interpretation.</p>
<p id="c5b5824e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the choice is between a future interest and mere precatory language (a statement of purpose not intended to be legally binding), the presumption is to recognize a fee simple absolute with no future interest. <i>Roberts v. Rhodes,</i> 643 P.2d 116, 118 (Kan. 1982) (“The general rule is well settled that the mere expression that property is to be used for a particular purpose will not in and of itself suffice to turn a fee simple into a determinable fee.”). If the choice is either a covenant or a future interest, the presumption is against the future interest and in favor of the enforceable covenant because this will keep title with the current owner. If the choice is either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent is preferred because the current interest is not automatically forfeited when the condition is violated, thereby keeping ownership (at least for the time being) with the current owner. If the choice is between a life estate and a fee simple (defeasible or absolute), a fee simple interest is preferred. <i>Accord, Howson v. Crombie Street Congregational Church</i>, 590 N.E.2d 687 (Mass. 1992). <i>But see Edwards v. Bradley, supra</i> (finding a life estate rather than a fee simple when this will promote the grantor’s intent to effectuate an enforceable restraint on alienation); <i>Cain v. Finnie</i>, 785 N.E.2d 1039 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003) (similarly interpreting a will leaving land to “Blanche Spurlock so long as she remains my widow” as a conditional life estate rather than as a fee simple determinable).</p>
<p id="c5b5824f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Policies behind the presumption against forfeitures.</b> The choice of preferring either the interests of the current owner or the interests of the future interest holder involves a policy decision about the proper distribution of power over property between grantors and grantees. Enforcing the condition in the original conveyance <span title="762" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-762">p. 762</span>by requiring a forfeiture promotes the interests of the grantor in controlling the future use and disposition of property; it also creates security for neighboring property owners who may benefit by the condition. In contrast, the presumption against forfeitures promotes the interests of current owners in controlling property in their possession, giving them greater freedom to change land uses as economic conditions and social values change; it also promotes social interests in deregulating economic activity to allow property owners the freedom to shift property to more valuable or desired uses. At the same time, the presumption against forfeitures may further the grantor’s intent, on the theory that the grantor presumably intends to give away any interests she has and would be likely to make it very clear if she intended to retain a future interest.</p>
<p id="c5b58250-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Purpose language.</b> When conveyances include language explaining the purpose of the transfer, such as in <i>Wood</i>, the vast majority of courts agree with <i>Wood</i> and will hold the language to be <b>precatory</b> — not intended to have any legal significance — and will interpret the conveyance to have transferred all the interests the grantor owned. If the grantors owned a fee simple, the courts presume that is what they intended to convey. This result follows from the presumption against forfeitures and protects the interests of the grantee, placing the burden on the grantors to be clear if they intend to retain a future interest in the property. <i>Accord, St. Mary’s Medical Center v. McCarthy</i>, 829 N.E.2d 1068 (Ind. App. 2005).</p>
<p id="c5b58251-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts are not unanimous on this score and sometimes find a future interest in the absence of language clearly creating one. For example, in <i>Cathedral of the Incarnation in the Diocese of Long Island, Inc. v. Garden City Co.</i>, 697 N.Y.S.2d 56 (App. Div. 1999), the court found that a conveyance to the Cathedral of the Incarnation for purposes of the local Episcopal diocese “without any power, right, or authority to grant, convey, or mortgage the same or any part thereof in any way or manner whatsoever,” created a right of entry despite the lack of any language specifying this future interest. The court found, however, that the grantors’ attempt in 1893 to transfer their right of entry had destroyed it, because rights of entry were not transferable at common law at the time. Therefore the Cathedral, which was in financial distress and had filed for bankruptcy, had a fee simple free from any restrictions on sale of the land.</p>
<p id="c5b5a962-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although most courts are reluctant to find a future interest in the absence of clear language creating one, some courts are eager to find a future interest when the property is donated for charitable purposes. In the absence of a future interest, the owner is entitled to shift the property to a noncharitable use, thereby possibly violating the intent of the grantor and harming the public interest by ending the charitable use. Property is often more valuable if sold on the open market than when reserved for charitable purposes. There are pressures therefore to sell such property. In order to help preserve charitable uses, courts sometimes do not apply the presumption against forfeitures or future interests to charitable property.</p>
<p id="c5b5a963-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognition of a future interest will not always promote charitable uses. After all, if the grantors had prevailed in <i>Wood</i> and reclaimed the property, they could have used the property for any purpose, including a noncharitable one. Finding no restriction, moreover, may permit the use of property in the way most beneficial to the charity. In <i><span title="763" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-763">p. 763</span>St. Mary’s Medical Center v. McCarthy</i>, <i>supra</i>, for example, the court determined that a grant to a hospital for the purposes of building a chapel did not create a trust, permitting the chapel to be destroyed so that the hospital could expand its facilities.</p>
<p id="c5b5a964-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a deed states a charitable purpose for property or restricts its use to charitable purpose, courts have attempted to achieve the charitable purpose by adopting a number of different interpretations. Most hold the language to be precatory, applying the presumption against forfeitures. However, from time to time, courts have rejected this approach, granting substantial legal effect to language of purpose. William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §2.5, at 41 (3d ed. 2000). Some have found a future interest, as did the court in <i>Cathedral of the Incarnation</i> (either a possibility of reverter or a right of entry). Other courts have interpreted the purpose language or use restriction as an enforceable covenant, allowing the covenant to be enforced in gross at least in the context of charitable property. <i>Davis v. St. Joe School District</i>, 284 S.W.2d 635 (Ark. 1955). Still other courts have imposed a constructive trust on the property, obligating the current owner to use it for charitable purposes or transfer it to someone who will so use it. <i>United States v. Certain Land in Cape Girardeau</i>, 79 F. Supp. 558 (D. Mo. 1947).</p>
<p id="c5b5a965-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Restraints on alienation.</b> The Virginia Supreme Court in <i>Edwards v. Bradley</i> resolved what it saw as an ambiguity in the conveyance partly by reference to the fact that the property was subject to a restraint on alienation — a restraint that would be valid if attached to a life estate but void if attached to a fee simple. The presumption against forfeitures would suggest that the fee simple be chosen over the life estate, the restraint held void, and the property left with a fee simple absolute. The court refused to adopt this approach, instead focusing on the fact that the grantor intended to create a valid restraint on alienation and the only way to achieve that result was to interpret the conveyance as creating a life estate. Which of these interpretations is preferable and why?</p>
<p id="c5b5a966-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>6. Changed conditions.</b> The changed conditions doctrine denying enforcement of covenants when circumstances are so drastically changed that they are no longer of benefit to the dominant estate has traditionally not applied to future interests. <i>Prieskorn v. Maloof</i>, 991 P.2d 511 (N.M. Ct. App. 1999). Some states, moreover, have statutes that remove future interests from charitable properties where the restrictions substantially impede the charitable organization in achieving its purposes or become “unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful.” <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Wash. Rev. Code §11.96A.127; N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law §1955; Mich. Comp. Laws §451.926. Should a court grant relief from such restrictions in the absence of a statute?</p>

<p id="c5b5a969-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Life tenants and owners of remainders or reversions have conflicting interests. It is in the interest of life tenants to maximize the profits and minimize the costs from the property while they have it. It is in the interest of the future interest holders to preserve the property and its value until they come into possession. The doctrine <span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-764">p. 764</span>of <b>waste</b> seeks to mediate these conflicts by preventing present possessory owners from unreasonably damaging the estate. Prohibitions against waste also apply to relationships between tenants and landlords and between mortgagors and mortgagees, although the default rules vary with the different ownership interests. Applying the doctrine involves questions of efficient use of resources, the intent of the drafters, the justified expectations and rights of the future and present interest holders, and the role of property in society. For discussions of the various theories behind the doctrine of waste, see John Lovett, <i>Doctrines of Waste in Landscape of Waste</i>, 72 Mo. L. Rev. 1209 (2007), and Jedediah Purdy, <i>The American Transformation of Waste Doctrine: A Pluralist Interpretation</i>, 91 Cornell L. Rev. 653 (2006).</p>

<p id="c5b5a96f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In October 1988, plaintiffs Russell and Sally Scarbrough purchased from defendant Dillie McIntyre a 16.59 acre tract of land by warranty deed, with reservation of a life estate in Ms. McIntyre in 1.2 acres which included a mobile home, porch, and shed. The reservation provided: “[L]ife estate is for [McIntyre’s] natural life and during her occupancy of this tract as a personal residence. As to this tract, [McIntyre] shall be responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the property and all improvements thereon and for payment of ad valorem taxes.”</p>
<p id="c5b5a970-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1994, the plaintiffs brought a petition to establish title and to terminate the life estate, and subsequently moved for summary judgment, asserting that: (1) the defendant ceased occupying the tract as a personal residence in violation of the warranty deed, and (2) committed waste by failing to maintain the property and improvements thereon. Because the evidence conclusively established that the life tenant failed to exercise ordinary care for the preservation of the property, we agree with the trial court that she forfeited her interest to the remaindermen and that they are entitled to immediate possession.</p>
<p id="c5b5a971-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence on summary judgment showed the following: The Scarbroughs both averred by affidavit that they had not seen Ms. McIntyre on the property since 1990; that there was no water or gas service to the mobile home, nor a mailbox on the property; and that the structure is in a state of dilapidation. Ms. Scarbrough further averred that ad valorem property taxes had accrued on the McIntyre property since 1990, and that she (Ms. Scarbrough) was forced to pay the arrearage to avoid injury to her remainder interest. The Scarbroughs also offered the affidavit of a fire marshall who opined that the mobile home appeared to have been vacant for some time; that it was in a general state of decay and disrepair; and that it posed fire and health hazards and was unfit for habitation.</p>
<p id="c5b5a972-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, Ms. McIntyre offered her own affidavit in which she stated that she is now 90 years of age, that she had been recently unable to occupy her residence due to health problems, and that she was in the process of renovating her home to make it fit for habitation. A July 29, 1994 sheriff’s entry of service form shows that Ms. McIntyre <span title="765" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-765">p. 765</span>could not be located and served because she was residing in a convalescent home outside the court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="c5b5a973-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ms. McIntyre also offered the affidavit of her grandson who averred that she had been confined away from home for medical reasons, that she had always expressed her intention of returning to the home and occupying it for the remainder of her life, that she had never removed any of her personal belongings during the time she was away, and that he completed certain repairs to the mobile home making it fit for habitation.</p>
<p id="c5b5a974-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. The trial court found that the warranty deed required Ms. McIntyre to occupy the tract as a personal residence as a condition of her life estate, concluding that “occupy” meant to “to dwell in” according to Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary. Relying on the affidavits of record, the court found as a matter of law that Ms. McIntyre failed to occupy the property. However, the court’s definition of occupancy was too narrow.</p>
<p id="c5b5a975-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Occupy” is more expansively defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as “to hold possession of; to hold or keep for use; to possess.” Because one may occupy a residence by holding it or keeping it for use, the court erred in imposing a requirement that permanent physical presence was necessary to fulfill the occupancy requirement of the warranty deed. Evidence that Ms. McIntyre had never removed any of her personal belongings during the time she had been away for medical reasons, as well as her stated ongoing intent to occupy the residence until her death, raises a question of fact as to whether she continued to occupy the residence while residing elsewhere for medical recuperation.</p>
<p id="c5b5a976-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">2. The trial court, however, correctly determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law under plaintiffs’ alternative theory of recovery, that the life estate was extinguished under the doctrine of waste.</p>
<p id="c5b5a977-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A life tenant is entitled to the full use and enjoyment of the property if in such use he or she exercises the ordinary care of a prudent person for its preservation and protection and commits no acts which would permanently injure the remainder interest. Ga. Code §44-6-83; <i>Graham v. Bryant</i>, 89 S.E.2d 640 (Ga. 1955). The unrebutted evidence shows that Ms. McIntyre had failed to pay ad valorem property taxes on the 1.2 acre tract for the years 1991 through 1993, or on the improvements for the years 1992 through 1994. In <i>Austell v. Swann</i>, 74 Ga. 278, 281 (1885), this Court stated that “a neglect to pay the burdens imposed by law upon the property during the term would be a want of such ordinary care as a prudent person should exercise for its protection and preservation, and would tend to divest the title to the fee by exposing it, or a portion of it, to sale, to raise the taxes levied on it.” In the present case, not only was the defendant obligated by law to maintain taxes on her portion of the property, but she also specifically agreed to pay ad valorem taxes as a condition of the warranty deed. Although the question of waste is generally one for a jury, the undisputed facts show that the defendant failed to exercise ordinary care for the preservation of the property, and to comply with a condition of the warranty deed, resulting in forfeiture of the life estate as a matter of law.</p>
<p id="c5b5a978-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">R<span class="epub-small-caps">OBERT</span> B<span class="epub-small-caps">ENHAM</span>, Chief Justice, joined by H<span class="epub-small-caps">UNSTEIN</span> and C<span class="epub-small-caps">ARLEY</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5b5a979-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree fully with the first division of the majority opinion, and I believe the evidence submitted on motion for summary judgment would, in a trial, support a verdict <span title="766" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-766">p. 766</span>for the Scarbroughs. I do not believe, however, that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, so I must dissent from the majority opinion’s affirmance of the trial court grant of summary judgment on the issue of waste.</p>
<p id="c5b5a97a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the majority opinion correctly notes, the question of waste is generally one for a jury. That is especially so in a case such as the present one where there is evidence presented in defense of the life estate to the effect that any damage to the estate has been unintentional and due to the circumstances of the holder of the life estate rather than from disregard of the estate. [In] <i>Roby v. Newton</i>, 49 S.E. 694 (Ga. 1905), this court noted that, as forfeitures are not favored, the statute must be strictly construed, as a criminal statute must be. The court went on to construe the statute as requiring a concurrence of permissive (lack of due care) and voluntary (active) waste, and held that the waste which would authorize forfeiture must be committed “in such a manner as to indicate an utter disregard of the rights of those who are thereafter to take.”</p>
<p id="c5b5d08b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, there is evidence that Ms. McIntyre has made some efforts, through the agency of her son, to reverse the deterioration of the property and that she has been ill and unable to care for the property adequately, although she has always intended to return to it. That evidence, if believed, does not show the wilful behavior required to warrant a forfeiture. The evidence offered in favor of forfeiture does not demand, as a matter of law, a finding of wilfulness. As this court noted in <i>Grimm v. Grimm</i>, 113 S.E. 91 (Ga. 1922), “if the life tenant from poverty or inability to keep the premises from falling into decay, allowed them to get in such condition, such conduct would be merely permissive, and would not be voluntary. . . .”</p>
<p id="c5b5d08c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The question of intent . . . fits the pattern of those issues of material fact which are not appropriate issues for summary judgment but are decided by the trier of fact.” <i>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Morgan</i>, 368 S.E.2d 509 (Ga. 1988). The question of whether Ms. McIntyre’s conduct with regard to the life estate she holds has been so egregiously wasteful as to warrant forfeiture of her interest in the property should be submitted to a jury. I must, therefore, dissent to the affirmance of the trial court’s grant of summary judgment on that issue.</p>

<p id="c5b5d08f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Voluntary and permissive waste.</b> The dissent in <i>McIntyre v. Scarbrough</i> distinguishes between voluntary and permissive waste. <b>Voluntary</b> or <b>affirmative waste</b> is the result of deliberate acts by the possessory tenant, such as destruction or removal of structures or resources on the property. An important category of voluntary waste is the removal of natural resources, such as timber, minerals, or oil and gas. Removal of minerals or oil and gas is generally prohibited voluntary waste unless, under the “open mines” doctrine, the resource was already being mined when the life tenant came into possession. <i>See Galkin v. Town of Chester</i>, 716 A.2d 25 (Vt. 1998). Similarly, removing timber is permitted if the land was already used for timber harvesting or the removal is consistent with good husbandry of the land, but voluntary waste otherwise. <b>Permissive waste</b>, in contrast, is a matter of omission rather than commission. As in <i>McIntyre</i>, permissive waste includes failure to make ordinary repairs preventing <span title="767" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-767">p. 767</span>deterioration as well as failure to pay real property taxes and other carrying charges necessary to prevent loss of the property.

<p id="c5b5d091-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>Natural disaster and waste.</b> Although life tenants must make ordinary repairs to prevent deterioration, they generally have no obligation to repair damage caused by natural disasters like hurricanes. But the remainder holder has no obligation to pay for such repairs either. This leaves the life tenant whose home is catastrophically damaged with two bad choices: either pay for repairs herself, although the value will ultimately go to the remainder holder, or vacate the damaged property.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b5d092-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Remedies.</b> A future interest holder may sue the life tenant to enjoin waste or seek damages for losses to the property or moneys spent to protect it. Suit for damages may also be brought against the life tenant’s estate after death, although the suit may be barred by laches or statutes of limitations. <i>See Moore v. Phillips</i>, 627 P.2d 831 (Kan. Ct. App. 1981) (no laches where life tenant if alive could not have disputed waste); <i>McCarver v. Blythe</i>, 555 S.E.2d 680 (N.C. App. 2001) (statute of limitations barred action, which began running as soon as remainder holder noticed some deterioration). Many states by statute permit the more radical remedy of termination of the life estate. Some of these require that the waste be either voluntary or willful to result in termination, while others allow termination without a showing of intent. <i>See Matteson v. Walsh</i>, 947 N.E.2d 44 (Mass. App. 2011) (finding forfeiture for failing to pay taxes and make repairs necessary to prevent leaks and structural rot). States may also permit double or treble damages against tenants committing waste, at least where the damage is intentional. <i>See</i> N.J. Stat. §2A:65-3 (tenants committing waste will pay treble damages and lose the place wasted); <i>Thomas v. Thomas</i>, 661 N.W.2d 1, 9 (S.D. 2003) (treble damages only permitted where the waste is willful, wanton, or malicious). </p>

Ameliorating waste.</b> What happens if the life tenant’s actions change the character of the property but <i>increase</i>, rather than decrease, the value or utility of the property? This is called variously <b>ameliorating</b>,<b> ameliorative</b>, or <b>meliorative waste</b>. Although the original rule was that any fundamental alteration of the property was waste, today ameliorating waste is sometimes condoned. An important case in this shift is <i>Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co.</i>, 79 N.W. 738 (Wis. 1899), which involved a claim for damages for destruction of a large house by the Pabst Brewing Co. after it was determined that Pabst had only a life estate <i>per autre vie</i> on the land. Changes to the surrounding area in the city of Milwaukee had left the house isolated and surrounded by factories and railroad tracks and undesirable as a residence, but valuable if cleared for industrial development. The court held that ordinarily a life tenant was prohibited from making any changes, even if beneficial, to the “identity of the property,” but could make fundamental changes where “a complete and permanent change of surrounding conditions . . . has deprived the property of its value and usefulness as previously used.” <i>Id</i>. at 741.</p>
<p id="c5b5d094-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While some jurisdictions maintain the rule prohibiting ameliorating waste, most will approve substantial alteration that increases value if it is justified in light of changed circumstances, consistency with what a fee simple owner would do, and the intent of the parties. <i>See</i> Thomas Merrill, Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co.<i> and the Doctrine of Waste in American Property Law</i>, 94 Marq. L. Rev. 1055, 1083 (2011).

Would preserving a family home be a reasonable ground for objection? What about preserving a wooded area in a relatively undeveloped state?

Sale by the life tenant.</b> If property is no longer economically viable or personally useful in its prior form, can the life tenant sell it rather than develop it? There is no legal obstacle to selling the life estate, but who wants to buy a life estate? Property held under a life estate is likely to be marketable only if the present and future holders can agree to a sale of a fee simple interest. Proceeds from the sale would be divided between the parties according to the value of their respective interests. Can a life tenant force the remainder holders to agree? <i>Baker v. Weedon</i>, 262 So. 2d 641 (Miss. 1972), considered a petition by an elderly life tenant who was impoverished and unable to support herself upon the meager income of $1,300 from her agricultural land. A planned highway bypass had increased the value of the land to $168,500 if it could be sold for development, but the value would double to $336,000 when the bypass was completed in the next few years. The court held that equity included the power to order a sale of the land when it was “in the best interest of all parties,” but found that the facts did not meet this test, ordering sale of only a small portion of part of the property. <i>Id.</i> at 645.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ABD_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10ABD_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">8</a></span></p>
<p id="c5b5d098-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose on remand the trial court had found that the remainder holders are wealthy and do not need income from either sale or lease of the land; they prefer to keep the land for a summer retreat, while the life estate owner is barely getting by because the farming income from the land is almost nil. Should the court order the sale on grounds of relative hardship? Whose rights should prevail?</p>
<p id="c5b5d099-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. Contracting to avoid conflicts.</b> Grantors may avoid the default rules limiting alteration, sale, or exploitation of the property by contracting around them. For example, a will creating a life estate in oil-producing property might permit the life tenant to create leases extending beyond her life or to receive royalties from newly drilled wells. <i><span title="769" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-769">p. 769</span>See Steger v.

Trust versus life estate.</b> More flexibility may also be created by using a trust for life rather than a legal life estate. For example, a property could be placed in trust for the benefit of the grantor’s widow or widower for life, and then to the grantor’s children. The trustee could be empowered to sell the property (the “trust corpus”) so long as sale met the trustee’s fiduciary obligations to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. <i>See</i> Jesse Dukeminier, James E. Krier, Gregory Alexander, Michael Schill &amp; Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, <i>Property</i> 241 (8th ed. 2014) (arguing that “[a] legal life estate is unsuited to a modern economy that regards land as just another form of income-producing wealth, which can swiftly appreciate in value under pressure for development and which must be managed effectively”). Trusts do not, however, resolve all disputes between present and future interest holders. <i>See Bailey v. Delta Trust &amp; Bank</i>, 198 S.W.3d 506 (Ark. 2004) (ruling on challenge to trustee’s payment of expenses of life beneficiary).</p>

Duties to the community not to commit waste?</b> There is generally no duty for the living not to waste fee simple property. Absent nuisance, historic preservation, or other prohibitions, fee simple holders may alter and destroy their property, even if it reduces its value. But a number of courts have prohibited execution of wills that ordered destruction of valuable homes after the death of the testator, particularly when it would impact the value of surrounding properties. <i>See Estate of Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co.</i>, 524 S.W.2d 210 (Mo. Ct. App. 1975); <i>In re Estate of Jones</i>, 389 A.2d 436, 437 (N.H. 1978);<i> In re Will of Pace</i>, 400 N.Y.S.2d 488, 491 (Surr. Ct. 1977).

Although a person may wish to deal capriciously with his property, while he is alive, his self-interest will usually prevent him from doing so.

<p id="c5b5f7b2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reflecting the medieval English origins of property law, <b><i>cy pres</i></b> comes from the old Norman French phrase, “<i>cy pres comme possible</i>,” as close as possible, and may be pronounced consistently with the French as “see pray,” but is more often pronounced half in English and half in French as “sigh pray.”</p>

<p id="c5b5f7b3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a settlor establishes a charitable trust and the charitable purpose identified by the settlor becomes impracticable or impossible to achieve, courts may apply the doctrine of <b><i>cy pres</i></b>, or equitable reformation, to modify the purpose of the trust. For example, imagine that in 1940 a donor created a trust for the treatment of polio in Maryland. Once polio was eradicated in the United States, should the trust fail and be returned to the settlor’s heirs or devisees? Or should it be used for another charitable purpose, and if so, which one? To fighting polio overseas, for example, or to another similarly devastating childhood illness in Maryland? Although many nineteenth-century American courts rejected <i>cy pres</i> as impermissible governmental control of donor property, after 1900 it quickly spread with the explosion of charitable trusts in the wake of the Gilded Age. Application of <i>cy pres</i> involves difficult questions of the determination of donor intent in light of changed circumstances and the role of societal interests in modifying charitable trusts.</p>

<p id="c5b61ec9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once again this Court must consider the constitutional implications of the 1911 will of United States Senator A.O. Bacon of Georgia which conveyed property in trust to Senator Bacon’s home city of Macon for the creation of a public park for the exclusive use of the white people of that city. As a result of our earlier decision in this case which held that the park, Baconsfield, could not continue to be operated on a racially discriminatory basis, <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, 382 U.S. 296 (1966), the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that Senator Bacon’s intention to provide a park for whites only had become impossible to fulfill and that accordingly the trust had failed and the parkland and other trust property had reverted by operation of Georgia law to the heirs of the Senator. Petitioners, the same Negro citizens of Macon who have sought in the courts to integrate the park, contend that this termination of the trust violates their rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions involved. For the reasons to be stated, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia should be, and it is, affirmed.</p>
<p id="c5b61eca-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1911 United States Senator Augustus O. Bacon executed a will that devised to the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon, Georgia, a tract of land which, after the death of the Senator’s wife and daughters, was to be used as “a park and pleasure ground” for white people only, the Senator stating in the will that while he had only the kindest feeling for the Negroes he was of the opinion that “in their social relations the two races (white and negro) should be forever separate.” The will provided that the park should be under the control of a Board of Managers of seven persons, all of <span title="771" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-771">p. 771</span>whom were to be white. The city kept the park segregated for some years but in time let Negroes use it, taking the position that the park was a public facility which it could not constitutionally manage and maintain on a segregated basis.</p>
<p id="c5b61ecb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thereupon, individual members of the Board of Managers of the park brought this suit in a state court against the City of Macon and the trustees of certain residuary beneficiaries of Senator Bacon’s estate, asking that the city be removed as trustee and that the court appoint new trustees, to whom title to the park would be transferred. The city answered, alleging it could not legally enforce racial segregation in the park. The other defendants admitted the allegation and requested that the city be removed as trustee.</p>
<p id="c5b61ecc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several Negro citizens of Macon intervened, alleging that the racial limitation was contrary to the laws and public policy of the United States, and asking that the court refuse to appoint private trustees. Thereafter the city resigned as trustee and amended its answer accordingly. Moreover, other heirs of Senator Bacon intervened and they and the defendants other than the city asked for reversion of the trust property to the Bacon estate in the event that the prayer of the petition were denied.</p>
<p id="c5b61ecd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Georgia court accepted the resignation of the city as trustee and appointed three individuals as new trustees, finding it unnecessary to pass on the other claims of the heirs. On appeal by the Negro intervenors, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, holding that Senator Bacon had the right to give and bequeath his property to a limited class, that charitable trusts are subject to supervision of a court of equity, and that the power to appoint new trustees so that the purpose of the trust would not fail was clear.</p>
<p id="c5b61ece-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, supra, went on to reverse the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court and to hold that the public character of Baconsfield “requires that it be treated as a public institution subject to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of who now has title under state law.” 382 U.S., at 302. [On remand, petitioners and the Georgia Attorney General] argued that the trust should be saved by applying the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine to amend the terms of the will by striking the racial restrictions and opening Baconsfield to all the citizens of Macon without regard to race or color. The trial court, however, refused to apply <i>cy pres</i>. It held that the doctrine was inapplicable because the park’s segregated, whites-only character was an essential and inseparable part of the testator’s plan. Since the “sole purpose” of the trust was thus in irreconcilable conflict with the constitutional mandate expressed in our opinion in <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, the trial court ruled that the Baconsfield trust had failed and that the trust property had by operation of law reverted to the heirs of Senator Bacon. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed.</p>
<p id="c5b61ecf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are of the opinion that in ruling as they did the Georgia courts did no more than apply well-settled general principles of Georgia law to determine the meaning and effect of a Georgia will. At the time Senator Bacon made his will Georgia cities and towns were, and they still are, authorized to accept devises of property for the establishment and preservation of “parks and pleasure grounds” and to hold the property thus received in charitable trust for the exclusive benefit of the class of persons named by the testator. Ga. Code, ch. 69-5 (1967); Ga. Code §§108-203, 108-207 <span title="772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-772">p. 772</span>(1959). These provisions of the Georgia Code explicitly authorized the testator to include, if he should choose, racial restrictions such as those found in Senator Bacon’s will. The city accepted the trust with these restrictions in it. When this Court in <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, <i>supra</i>, held that the continued operation of Baconsfield as a segregated park was unconstitutional, the particular purpose of the Baconsfield trust as stated in the will failed under Georgia law. The question then properly before the Georgia Supreme Court was whether as a matter of state law the doctrine of <i>cy pres</i> should be applied to prevent the trust itself from failing. Petitioners urged that the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine allowed the Georgia courts to strike the racially restrictive clauses in Bacon’s will so that the terms of the trust could be fulfilled without violating the Constitution.</p>
<p id="c5b61ed0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Georgia <i>cy pres</i> statutes upon which petitioners relied provide:</p>

<p id="c5b61ed1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a valid charitable bequest is incapable for some reason of execution in the exact manner provided by the testator, donor, or founder, a court of equity will carry it into effect in such a way as will as nearly as possible effectuate his intention. Ga. Code §108-202 (1959).</p>
<p id="c5b61ed2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A devise or bequest to a charitable use will be sustained and carried out in this State; and in all cases where there is a general intention manifested by the testator to effect a certain purpose, and the particular mode in which he directs it to be done shall fail from any cause, a court of chancery may, by approximation, effectuate the purpose in a manner most similar to that indicated by the testator. Ga. Code §113-815 (1959).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b61ed3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Georgia courts have held that the fundamental purpose of these <i>cy pres</i> provisions is to allow the court to carry out the general charitable intent of the testator where this intent might otherwise be thwarted by the impossibility of the particular plan or scheme provided by the testator. But this underlying logic of the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine implies that there is a certain class of cases in which the doctrine cannot be applied. Professor Scott in his treatise on trusts states this limitation on the doctrine of <i>cy pres</i> which is common to many States as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5b61ed4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not true that a charitable trust never fails where it is impossible to carry out the particular purpose of the testator. In some cases . . . it appears that the accomplishment of the particular purpose and only that purpose was desired by the testator and that he had no more general charitable intent and that he would presumably have preferred to have the whole trust fail if the particular purpose is impossible of accomplishment. In such a case the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine is not applicable. 4 A. Scott, The Law of Trusts §399, at 3085 (3d ed. 1967).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b61ed5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, Senator Bacon provided an unusual amount of information in his will from which the Georgia courts could determine the limits of his charitable purpose. Immediately after specifying that the park should be for “the sole, perpetual and unending, use, benefit and enjoyment of the white women, white girls, white boys and white children of the City of Macon,” the Senator stated that “the said property under no circumstances . . . [is] to be . . . at any time for any reason devoted to any other purpose or use excepting so far as herein specifically authorized.” And the Senator continued:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

On the contrary I have for them the kindest feeling, and for many of them esteem and regard, while for some of them I have sincere personal affection.</p>
<p id="c5b645e7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am, however, without hesitation in the opinion that in their social relations the two races . . . should be forever separate and that they should not have pleasure or recreation grounds to be used or enjoyed, together and in common.</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b645e8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Georgia courts, construing Senator Bacon’s will as a whole, concluded from this and other language in the will that the Senator’s charitable intent was not “general” but extended only to the establishment of a segregated park for the benefit of white people. The Georgia trial court found that “Senator Bacon could not have used language more clearly indicating his intent that the benefits of Baconsfield should be extended to white persons only, or more clearly indicating that this limitation was an essential and indispensable part of his plan for Baconsfield.” Since racial separation was found to be an inseparable part of the testator’s intent, the Georgia courts held that the State’s <i>cy pres</i> doctrine could not be used to alter the will to permit racial integration. The Baconsfield trust was therefore held to have failed, and, under Georgia law, “[w]here a trust is expressly created, but uses . . . fail from any cause, a resulting trust is implied for the benefit of the grantor, or testator, or his heirs.” Ga. Code §108-106(4) (1959). The Georgia courts concluded, in effect, that Senator Bacon would have rather had the whole trust fail than have Baconsfield integrated.</p>
<p id="c5b645e9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a city park is destroyed because the Constitution requires it to be integrated, there is reason for everyone to be disheartened. We agree with petitioners that in such a case it is not enough to find that the state court’s result was reached through the application of established principles of state law. No state law or act can prevail in the face of contrary federal law, and the federal courts must search out the fact and truth of any proceeding or transaction to determine if the Constitution has been violated. Here, however, the action of the Georgia Supreme Court declaring the Baconsfield trust terminated presents no violation of constitutionally protected rights, and any harshness that may have resulted from the state court’s decision can be attributed solely to its intention to effectuate as nearly as possible the explicit terms of Senator Bacon’s will.</p>
<p id="c5b645ea-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The construction of wills is essentially a state-law question, and in this case the Georgia Supreme Court, as we read its opinion, interpreted Senator Bacon’s will as embodying a preference for termination of the park rather than its integration. Given this, the Georgia court had no alternative under its relevant trust laws, which are long standing and neutral with regard to race, but to end the Baconsfield trust and return the property to the Senator’s heirs.</p>
<p id="c5b645eb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second argument for petitioners stresses the similarities between this case and the case in which a city holds an absolute fee simple title to a public park and then closes that park of its own accord solely to avoid the effect of a prior court order directing that the park be integrated as the Fourteenth Amendment commands. Yet, assuming arguendo that the closing of the park would in those circumstances violate <span title="774" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-774">p. 774</span>the Equal Protection Clause, that case would be clearly distinguishable from the case at bar because there it is the State and not a private party which is injecting the racially discriminatory motivation. In the case at bar there is not the slightest indication that any of the Georgia judges involved were motivated by racial animus or discriminatory intent of any sort in construing and enforcing Senator Bacon’s will. Nor is there any indication that Senator Bacon in drawing up his will was persuaded or induced to include racial restrictions by the fact that such restrictions were permitted by the Georgia trust statutes. On the contrary, the language of the Senator’s will shows that the racial restrictions were solely the product of the testator’s own full-blown social philosophy. Similarly, the situation presented in this case is also easily distinguishable from that presented in <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), where we held unconstitutional state judicial action which had affirmatively enforced a private scheme of discrimination against Negroes. Here the effect of the Georgia decision eliminated all discrimination against Negroes in the park by eliminating the park itself, and the termination of the park was a loss shared equally by the white and Negro citizens of Macon since both races would have enjoyed a constitutional right of equal access to the park’s facilities had it continued.</p>
<p id="c5b645ec-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Justice W<span class="epub-small-caps">ILLIAM</span> J. B<span class="epub-small-caps">RENNAN,</span> J<span class="epub-small-caps">R</span>., dissenting.</p>
<p id="c5b645ed-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For almost half a century Baconsfield has been a public park. Senator Bacon’s will provided that upon the death of the last survivor among his widow and two daughters title to Baconsfield would vest in the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon and their successors forever. The city acquired title to Baconsfield in 1920 by purchasing the interests of Senator Bacon’s surviving daughter and another person who resided on the land. Some $46,000 of public money was spent over a number of years to pay the purchase price. From the outset and throughout the years the Mayor and City Council acted as trustees, Baconsfield was administered as a public park. T. Cleveland James, superintendent of city parks during this period, testified that when he first worked at Baconsfield it was a “wilderness . . . nothing there but just undergrowth everywhere, one road through there and that’s all, one paved road.” He said there were no park facilities at that time. In the 1930’s Baconsfield was transformed into a modern recreational facility by employees of the Works Progress Administration, an agency of the Federal Government. Other capital improvements were made in later years with both federal and city money.</p>
<p id="c5b645ee-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have no doubt that a public park may constitutionally be closed down because it is too expensive to run or has become superfluous, or for some other reason, strong or weak, or for no reason at all. But under the Equal Protection Clause a State may not close down a public facility solely to avoid its duty to desegregate that facility.</p>
<p id="c5b645ef-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court, however, affirms the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court on the ground that the closing of Baconsfield did not involve state action. This discriminatory closing is permeated with state action: at the time Senator Bacon wrote his will Georgia statutes expressly authorized and supported the precise kind of discrimination provided for by him; in accepting title to the park, public officials of the City of Macon entered into an arrangement vesting in private persons the power to enforce <span title="775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-775">p. 775</span>a reversion if the city should ever incur a constitutional obligation to desegregate the park; it is a public park that is being closed for a discriminatory reason after having been operated for nearly half a century as a segregated public facility; and it is a state court that is enforcing the racial restriction that keeps apparently willing parties of different races from coming together in the park. That is state action in overwhelming abundance. I need emphasize only three elements of the state action present here.</p>
<p id="c5b645f0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, there is state action whenever a State enters into an arrangement that creates a private right to compel or enforce the reversion of a public facility. Whether the right is a possibility of reverter, a right of entry, an executory interest, or a contractual right, it can be created only with the consent of a public body or official, for example the official action involved in Macon’s acceptance of the gift of Baconsfield. The State’s involvement in the creation of such a right is also involvement in its enforcement; the State’s assent to the creation of the right necessarily contemplates that the State will enforce the right if called upon to do so. Where, as in this case, the State’s enforcement role conflicts with its obligation to comply with the constitutional command against racial segregation the attempted enforcement must be declared repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="c5b645f1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A finding of discriminatory state action is required here on a second ground. <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), stands at least for the proposition that where parties of different races are willing to deal with one another a state court cannot keep them from doing so by enforcing a privately devised racial restriction. Nothing in the record suggests that after our decision in <i>Evans v. Newton</i>, <i>supra</i>, the City of Macon retracted its previous willingness to manage Baconsfield on a nonsegregated basis, or that the white beneficiaries of Senator Bacon’s generosity were unwilling to share it with Negroes, rather than have the park revert to his heirs. [In addition,] the Attorney General of Georgia was made a party after remand from this Court, and, acting “as parens patriae in all legal matters pertaining to the administration and disposition of charitable trusts in the State of Georgia in which the rights of beneficiaries are involved,” he opposed a reversion to the heirs and argued that Baconsfield should be maintained “as a park for all the citizens of the State of Georgia.” [S]o far as the record shows, this is a case of a state court’s enforcement of a racial restriction to prevent willing parties from dealing with one another. The decision of the Georgia courts thus, under <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, constitutes state action denying equal protection.</p>
<p id="c5b645f2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, a finding of discriminatory state action is required on a third ground. In <i>Reitman v. Mulkey</i>, 387 U.S. 369 (1967), this Court announced the basic principle that a State acts in violation of the Equal Protection Clause when it singles out racial discrimination for particular encouragement, and thereby gives it a special preferred status in the law, even though the State does not itself impose or compel segregation. [In 1905] prior to the enactment of §§69-504 and 69-505 of the Georgia Code “it would have been extremely doubtful” whether Georgia law authorized “a trust for park purposes when a portion of the public was to be excluded from the park.” Sections 69-504 and 69-505 removed this doubt by expressly permitting dedication of land to the public for use as a park open to one race only.</p>
<p id="c5b66d03-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>In 1911, only six years after the enactment of §§69-504 and 69-505, Senator Bacon, a lawyer, wrote his will. When he wrote the provision creating Baconsfield as a public park open only to the white race, he was not merely expressing his own testamentary intent, but was taking advantage of the special power Georgia had conferred by §§69-504 and 69-505 on testators seeking to establish racially segregated public parks. This state-encouraged testamentary provision is the sole basis for the Georgia courts’ holding that Baconsfield must revert to Senator Bacon’s heirs. The Court’s finding that it is not the State of Georgia but “a private party which is injecting the racially discriminatory motivation” inexcusably disregards the State’s role in enacting the statute without which Senator Bacon could not have written the discriminatory provision.</p>

<p id="c5b66d06-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Donor intent.</b> In applying <i>cy pres</i> to charitable trusts, the hypothetical inquiry is whether the donor, knowing of the changed circumstances, would prefer to have the charitable donation fail altogether or modified to serve a related purpose. In <i>Evans v. Abney</i>, how should we construct this hypothesized testator? Are we asking what Senator Bacon would have wanted in 1911 had the city refused to segregate the park (unimaginable in 1911), or what he would have wanted had he lived through the changes leading to the decisions that public segregation was unconstitutional and private segregation violated federal civil rights statutes (also unimaginable in 1911)? Which inquiry better respects the donor’s wishes? Which better respects the donor himself?</p>
<p id="c5b66d07-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>cy pres</i> doctrine traditionally places the burden on the party seeking reformation to prove that the donor had a “general charitable intent” beyond the specific purposes named in the bequest. <i>Kolb v. City of Storm Lake</i>, 736 N.W.2d 546, 559 (Iowa 2007). This has been the most litigated element of the <i>cy pres</i> determination. Often the trust document itself states only specific purposes and there is no other evidence of intent. Nevertheless, courts often find a general intent in such circumstances. <i>See id.</i> at 559 (finding that despite several mentions of specific location of a memorial garden, the donors had a general charitable intent permitting the city to move the garden when its location became impracticable).</p>
<p id="c5b66d08-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The modern trend is to do away with this requirement and presume general charitable intent. The <i>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</i> (2003) provides that if the purposes of a charitable trust become impossible, impracticable, or wasteful to achieve, the trust shall be redirected to a purpose that “reasonably approximates” the stated purpose “[u]nless the terms of the trust provide otherwise.” <i>Id.</i> §67; <i>see In re Elizabeth J.K.L. Lucas Charitable Gift</i>, 261 P.3d 800, 808-809 (Haw. App. 2011) (noting trend). The <i>Uniform Trust Code</i>, a model law promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, provides that a charitable trust whose purposes become impossible or impracticable to accomplish “shall not fail” and “shall not revert to the settlor” and the court may modify it in a manner consistent with the settlor’s charitable purposes. <i>Uniform Trust Code</i> §413 (2000). Even specific provisions for reversion to the grantor on failure of the trust shall not be enforced unless the settlor is <span title="777" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-777">p. 777</span>still living or the trust has been in existence for less than 21 years. <i>Id.</i> About half the states have already adopted the provision. While other states may continue to espouse a need to find a general charitable purpose, many will likely apply it by assuming that the testator had such a purpose absent clear evidence otherwise.</p>
<p id="c5b66d09-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the new test sacrifice donor intent in order to achieve public interests in charitable trusts? Or does is it appropriately attribute to the donor the motives of a reasonable generous person, who would prefer to see her bequest used effectively than fail or be devoted to an impracticable purpose? <i>Compare</i> Vanessa Laird, <i>Phantom Selves: The Search for General Intent in the Application of the</i> Cy Pres<i> Doctrine</i>, 40 Stan. L. Rev. 973 (1988) (arguing that presuming that donors would want their gifts used charitably and usefully honors donor intent), <i>and Restatement (Third) of Trusts</i> §67 cmt. b (“ ‘[T]he dilemma of whether to enforce the testator’s intent or to modify the terms of the will in accordance with changed conditions since his death is often a false one.’ ”) (quoting Richard A. Posner, <i>Economic Analysis of Law</i> 556-557 (5th ed. 1998)), <i>with</i> Alberto V. Lopez, <i>An Evaluation of</i> Cy Pres<i> Redux</i>, 78 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1307 (2010) (arguing that the new rules improperly elevate societal interests over donor intent). Note that (as seen in the dissent in <i>Evans v. Abney</i>) the state attorney general is often a party or even the petitioner in a <i>cy pres</i> action, with the sometimes conflicting roles of safeguarding the donor’s intent and society’s interests as <i>parens patriae</i> for charities.</p>
<p id="c5b66d0a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Impossible or just contrary to the public interest?</b> The traditional inquiry, maintained in many states, is whether fulfilling the purpose of the trust is actually or practicably impossible to achieve. <i>See Estate of Estes v. Central United Methodist Church</i>, 523 N.W.2d 863 (Mich. App. 1994) (trust corpus could only be used for building a new church, although existing church was in landmarked well-constructed building, congregation was shrinking, and no plans had been made to build new church in the 21 years since the gift). The modern trend, however, is to permit reformation if the purpose is broadly impracticable, “wasteful,” or unreasonable. <i>See Restatement (Third) of Trusts</i> §67 (adding “wasteful” element); <i>Uniform Trust Code</i> §413 (2000) (same); N.H. Rev. Stat. §498:4-a (<i>cy pres</i> permitted if, among other things, the trust is “prejudicial to the public interest”).</p>

Cy pres and the reform of discriminatory trusts.</b> Many courts have applied <i>cy pres</i> to reform trusts that illegally restricted their benefits on the basis of race or sex. <i>Home for Incurables of Baltimore City v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp.</i>, 769 A.2d 746 (Md. 2002) (reforming trust for construction of rehabilitation center for white patients); <i>In re Crichfield Trust</i>, 426 A.2d 88 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1980) (reforming trust that established a college scholarship for male graduates of a public high school); <i>Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University</i>, 408 S.W.2d 269, 271 (Tex. Ct. App. 1966) (using <i>cy pres</i> to excise racial restriction in endowment fund). <i>Cf. United States v. Hughes Memorial Home</i>, 396 F. Supp. 544 (D. W. Va. 1975) (<i>cy pres</i> doctrine applied to excise racial restriction on trust benefiting orphanage because racial exclusion from the orphanage would violate the federal <i>Fair Housing Act</i>). In <i>In re Certain Scholarship Funds,</i> 575 A.2d 1325 (N.H. 1990), for example, a testator established a charitable <span title="778" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-778">p. 778</span>scholarship trust to provide a college education “for some Poor and worthy Keene boy who is a scholar in the Keene High School.” A second settlor established a similar trust providing that the income be used “to provide tuition for one year for some worthy protestant boy” at Keene High School. The New Hampshire Supreme Court agreed to remove the race and gender restrictions, affirming the trial court’s finding that “there was no indication that Mr. Wright or Mr. Alger would not have responded to the changes in attitudes experienced by society since the creation of these trusts.” <i>Id</i>. at 1328.

In a similar case, however, the New York Court of Appeals substituted private trustees for Board of Education officials in two trusts, one for scholarships for “five (5) young men who shall have graduated from the Canastota High School, three (3) of whom shall have attained the highest grades in the study of science and two (2) of whom shall have attained the highest grades in the study of chemistry” and the other for scholarships for “bright and deserving young men who have graduated from the High School of [the Croton-Harmon Union Free] School District.” <i>Matter of Estate of Wilson</i>, 452 N.E.2d 1228, 1228 (N.Y. 1983).

<p id="c5b6941e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. State action.</b> In <i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, 334 U.S. 1 (1948), the Supreme Court held that judicial enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant to prevent a sale to an African American family constituted state action and so was prohibited by the fourteenth amendment. <i>See</i> Chapter 8, §5.2. <i>Evans v. Abney</i>, however, holds that the reversion required by state statute after a trust fails because of violation of the fourteenth amendment is not state action. What justifies the difference? In 1955, the North Carolina Supreme Court reached the same result, affirming the constitutionality of a possibility of reverter of land conveyed to the city of Charlotte as a public park “for use by the white race only.” <i>Charlotte Park &amp; Recreation Commission v. Barringer</i>, 88 S.E.2d 114 (N.C. 1955). The court found no state action:</p>

The gifts were made with numerous specific restrictions including that the works could not be sold, that the photographs could not be loaned for display elsewhere, and that the works had to be displayed as an entire collection, in a room painted in a white or off-white color selected by O’Keefe. In 2005, in dire financial straits and unable to afford to show the collection, Fisk sought permission to sell some of the paintings. What should the court do? <i>See In re Fisk University</i>, 392 S.W.3d 582 (Tenn. App. 2011).</p>
<p id="c5b69426-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> In <i>Hermitage Methodist Homes of Virginia, Inc. v. Dominion Trust Co.</i>, 387 S.E.2d 740 (Va. 1990), a testator named Jack Adams died, leaving a charitable trust providing income to the Prince Edward School, “so long as Prince Edward School Foundation admits to any school, operated or supported by it, only members of the White Race.” His will further provided that if the school should ever “matriculate . . . any person who is not a member of the White Race, no further payment of income shall be made” to the school, but all income should go to the Miller School. Further gifts were provided to the Seven Hills School and then to Hampden-Sydney College if the prior recipient violated the “whites-only” provision of the trust. The final beneficiary of the successive gifts over was Hermitage Methodist Homes of Virginia; this final gift had no racial restriction built in. At the time Adams wrote his will, Virginia Code §55-26 made it lawful to create a charitable trust for the education of white or “colored” persons but not of both. The statute was later repealed.</p>
<p id="c5b69427-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1987, the trustee sued the first beneficiary, Prince Edward School, because it had admitted African American students. The trial court held that all “racially discriminatory conditions of the Trust are unconstitutional and void” and determined that Prince Edward School should continue receiving the income from the trust. The Virginia Supreme Court reversed, holding that even if it were unconstitutional to enforce a restrictive condition, depriving Prince Edward of the income from the trust <span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-780">p. 780</span>effected no such enforcement. The condition in the trust did not take the form of a condition subsequent but was, rather, a “special limitation” that ended Prince Edward’s beneficial ownership interest automatically as soon as the condition was violated. Thus, no court action was needed to alter ownership of the income from Prince Edward. Because all of the educational institutions had admitted black students, the interests in the trust proceeds went to Heritage Methodist Homes, which alone had no restrictions in its gift.</p>

At the same time, the Foundation opened a private school known as Prince Edward Academy that enrolled almost every white student in the county.

<p id="c5b6bb43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rules underlying the creation of future interests are intended to discourage the social hierarchy characteristic of feudalism and to promote a market system involving wide dispersal of property rights to prevent local monopolies. The commitment to these goals requires courts to decide which forms of property shall be recognized. We could just allow owners to create whatever future interests they want, but this is not how the law developed. Instead, courts follow a general <b>rule against the creation of new estates</b><i>.</i> A conveyance that does not fit within any of the established categories (including fee simple absolute subject to covenants, defeasible fees, life estates, leaseholds, and in some states, fees tail) must be interpreted to fit an established estate.</p>
<p id="c5b6bb44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rule has both formal and substantive dimensions. Formally, it means that grantors must put their conveyances in a recognizable form if they want courts to recognize the package of rights they intended to create. Substantively, it means that certain packages of rights will not be recognized. This both limits transaction costs by making it easier to determine what one is buying and owns, and serves other policy goals by ensuring that packages of rights are those approved by law. <i>See</i> Nestor M.

The land in question passed under the seventh clause of the will of Royal Whiton to his five grandchildren, and a deed executed by them was tendered to the plaintiff, but was refused, on the ground that one of the grandchildren, Sarah A. Whiton, could not convey a fee-simple absolute, and this action is brought to try the question. The clause of the will referred to is as follows: “After the decease of all my children, I give, devise, and bequeath to my granddaughter Sarah A. Whiton and her heirs on her father’s side one-third part of all my estate, both real and personal, and to my other grandchildren and their heirs, respectively, the remainder, to be divided in equal parts between them.”</p>
<p id="c5b6e25b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no room for doubt that the legal title passed by the foregoing clause. We think it equally plain that the words “and her heirs on her father’s side” are words of limitation, and not words of purchase. The only serious question is whether the effect of them was to give Sarah A. Whiton only a qualified fee, and whether, by reason of the qualification, she is unable to convey a fee simple. By the old law, to take land by descent a man must be of the blood of the first purchaser, and descent is traced from the purchaser. For instance, if the land had been acquired in fee simple by Sarah A. <span title="782" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-782">p. 782</span>Whiton’s father, it could only have descended from her to her heirs on her father’s side. It was no great stretch to allow a limitation in the first instance to Sarah of a fee with the same descendible quality that it would have had in the case supposed. Especially is this true if, as Mr. Challis argues, the grantee under such a limitation could convey a fee simple, just as he or she could have done if the estate actually had descended from the father. But our statute of descent looks no further than the person himself who died seised of or entitled to the estate. The analogy which lies at the foundation of the argument for the possibility of such limitations is wanting. A man cannot create a new kind of inheritance. These and other authorities show, too, that, except in the case of a grant by the king, if the words “on her father’s side” do not effect the purpose intended, they are to be rejected, leaving the estate a fee simple. Certainly, it would seem that in this commonwealth an estate descending only to heirs on the father’s side was a new kind of inheritance.</p>
<p id="c5b6e25c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What we have to consider, however, is not the question of descent, but that of alienability; and that question brings a further consideration into view. It would be most unfortunate and unexpected if it should be discovered at this late day that it was possible to impose such a qualification upon a fee, and to put it out of the power of the owners to give a clear title for generations. In the more familiar case of an estate tail, the legislature has acted, and the statute has been carried to the furthest verge by construction. It is not too much to say that it would be plainly contrary to the policy of the law of Massachusetts to deny the power of Sarah A. Whiton to convey an unqualified fee.</p>

Whiton and her heirs,” which would convey a fee simple absolute, to “Sarah A. Whiton for life, and then her heirs on her fathers’ side,” which would convey a life estate, or “Sarah A. Whiton and the heirs of her father’s body,” which would convey a fee tail, her grandfather’s will appears to convey a fee that can only go in the future to any heirs on her father’s side. Because it does not fit precisely into any category, Justice Holmes rules that she has a fee simple absolute, even though finding the estate to be a fee tail or life estate appears more consistent with her grandfather’s likely intent. What explains his ruling?</p>
<p id="c5b6e260-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2.</b> Unlike civil law courts, United States courts rarely expressly state the <i>numerus clausus</i> principle. <i>But see Zanes v. Lehigh Transit Co.</i>, 41 F.2d 552 (E.D. Pa. 1930) (“[I]n furtherance of [the] policy to unfetter estates and to promote freedom of alienation . . . [s]uch estates and such only as the law permits may be created in land. The power of an owner to carve out new estates or give to them novel incidents is very much restricted.”).  Nevertheless, courts regularly squeeze unfamiliar grants into one of the established forms. When faced, for example, with leases “for life” and other leases ending at the occurrence of some event rather than a fixed period of time, courts have historically found that the lease was a “tenancy at will,” which either lessee or lessor could end at any time. <i>See, e.g., Nitschke v. Doggett</i>, 489 S.W.2d 335 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972). </p>

Most jurisdictions, for example, have abolished the fee tail as a permissible form. Similarly, faced with the unfairness of permitting a landlord to terminate a lease that appeared to be for life, some jurisdictions have recognized a “tenancy for life.” <i>Garner v.

<p id="c5b6e269-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <b>rule against perpetuities</b> invalidates future interests that may vest too far into the future. It does so in order to protect against dead hand control, limiting the time within which the identity of who will own the property in the future may become certain. By doing so, the rule arguably promotes alienability and productive use of land by requiring that the identity of those who own the property be fixed within a certain period of time.</p>
<p id="c5b6e26a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the rule, future interests are invalid unless they are certain to “vest” or fail to vest within the lifetime of someone who is alive (“in being”) at the creation of the interest or no later than 21 years after her death.

It has also been substantially modified by statute in more than half the states. At the same time, the policies underlying the rule still have substantial support among many judges, legislators, and scholars.

However, the rule is not difficult in the vast majority of cases. These materials explain the rule in detail and show how to apply it to a series of representative problems.</p>
<p id="c5b70984-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule requires four steps. First, identify the future interests created by the grant. If the interest is in the grantor, it is not subject to the rule (except for certain commercial interests discussed below). Second, identify what has to happen for the interest to fully vest, meaning that any conditions will have occurred, and no more people can be added to the class of recipients. Third, identify all the “lives in being,” the people alive at the creation of the interest who can have something to do with it vesting. Fourth, see if you can imagine any way — however unlikely or in defiance of normal rules of reproductive biology — in which the future interest will vest more than 21 years after the death of all of the people identified in step three. If you can, the future interest is invalid. Let us consider these steps in more depth.</p>
<p id="c5b70985-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Identify the future interests created by the grant.</b> <i>All future interests in the grantor are exempt</i> from the rule against perpetuities; these include reversions (following life estates and leaseholds) and possibilities of reverter and rights of entry (following defeasible fees). Interests in the grantor were conceptualized as “vested” the moment they were created. This is because an owner of a fee simple absolute who conveys a fee simple determinable is carving out a present estate from a fee simple absolute that is already vested; the possibility of reverter is part of that vested interest that was not given away. These future interests are “good” and will be enforced by the courts unless they are regulated by special statutory limitations other than the rule against perpetuities. The only interests in third parties that are similarly exempt from the rule against perpetuities are <i>vested remainders</i> that are either absolutely vested or vested subject to divestment.</p>
<p id="c5b70986-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Future interests that are subject to the rule against perpetuities are executory interests, contingent remainders, and vested remainders subject to open. These interests must be tested to see whether they comply with the rule. Vested remainders subject to open are subject to the rule because some of the interests to the class members are vested and some are contingent (those belonging to persons who are not born at the creation of the interest). All future interests in third parties following defeasible fees (executory interests) are subject to the rule against perpetuities. Future interests in third parties following life estates (remainders) are subject to the rule only if they <span title="785" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-785">p. 785</span>are contingent, that is, if there is a condition precedent to their vesting or if they are allocated to persons unascertained at the time of the original conveyance creating them. Vested remainders subject to open are partially contingent and therefore have traditionally been held subject to the rule.</p>
<p id="c5b70987-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A common example of a future interest traded in the marketplace is an <b>option to purchase</b>, which is the right to buy property for a stated price at some point in the future. Because options are rights to terminate an estate, they are akin to executory interests and therefore are ordinarily subject to the rule against perpetuities. This is true whether the option is held by the original grantor of the property or by a third party. <b>Preemptive rights</b>, also called <b>rights of first refusal</b>, allow the holder to purchase property whenever the current owner decides to sell. Some courts hold that preemptive rights are not subject to the rule against perpetuities because they allow the current owner either to obtain the fair market value or to have an offer by a third party matched by the owner of the preemptive right. Either way, the property is alienable. Other courts hold that preemptive rights, like options to purchase, are subject to the rule against perpetuities. <i>See</i> <span class="epub-small-caps">§5.3.D,</span> <i>infra.</i></p>
<p id="c5b70988-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that the type of interest is fixed when it is created. Thus when an owner of a right of entry transfers the interest to another person, it remains a right of entry and does not change into an executory interest, even though it is held by someone other than the grantor or her heirs.</p>

Identify what has to happen for the interest to fully vest.</b> This step requires you to understand the concept of vesting. <b>Fully vest</b> means that all future interest holders are ascertained and any contingencies for their ownership are removed. In other words, we know exactly who is going to get the interest, that they are going to get it, and what fraction of the interest they are going to get.</p>
<p id="c5b7098a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Importantly, the question is not when the future interest becomes <i>possessory</i>, but rather when we know exactly who will own the property in the future. For example, imagine a will providing,</p>

The question is whether the interest might only fully vest (or become certain not to vest) outside the “perpetuities period,” the lifetime of all lives in being plus 21 years. (Actually, the period is the life in being plus 21 years and around 9 months, because periods of gestation are not counted within the 21 years.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F1E_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N10F1E_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">9</a></span>)</p>

<p id="c5b730af-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some class gifts are partially valid and partially invalid. For example, a conveyance from “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to the grandchildren of <i>A</i>” creates a vested remainder subject to open in the grandchildren if one grandchild is alive at the time of the conveyance to <i>A</i>. The interest in the living grandchild is vested while the interest in unborn grandchildren is contingent. If the jurisdiction applies the rule of convenience and the class closes at the death of <i>A</i>, the grandchildren’s interest will be valid because their interests will vest at the death of a life in being. However, if the class does not close at the death of <i>A</i>, then the interest in unborn grandchildren may violate the rule because <i>A</i> could have another child after the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i> and that child could have a child more than 21 years after the death of <i>O</i>, <i>A</i>, and any children or grandchildren of <i>A</i> alive at the creation of the interest. Some states invalidate the entire class gift to the grandchildren of <i>A</i> because some of the interests may violate the rule. Other states split the difference by validating the vested interests in the grandchildren who are alive at the creation of the interest while striking down the contingent remainders. <i>See In re Estate of Weaver</i>, 572 A.2d 1249, 1253 (Pa.

<ol class="epub-list-reset5 epub-decimal">

The difference is a formal one and does not have any real policy justification because the two conveyances are otherwise functionally identical.

Contingent remainders and vested remainders subject to open will generally be good if the contingency depends solely on the actions of someone named in the document creating the interest — that person is a life in being, and the contingency must occur during the person’s lifetime, if at all.

<p id="c5b77ee3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Unborn widow.</i> The first is the “unborn widow.” A conveyance from “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, remainder to <i>A</i>’s widow for life, remainder to <i>A</i>’s surviving children” creates a contingent remainder in <i>A</i>’s surviving children that violates the traditional rule against perpetuities. What has to happen for the interest to vest in <i>A</i>’s children? They have to survive <i>A</i>’s widow. Even if <i>A</i> is married at the time of the conveyance, that person will not necessarily be his widow — his wife could die, and <i>A</i> could marry someone who was born after the conveyance, and so would not be a life in being. <i>A</i>’s children as well could be born after the conveyance, so they are not necessarily lives in being either. <i>A</i>’s widow could outlive <i>A</i> for more than 21 years. So we will not necessarily know if <i>A</i>’s children survive her within the perpetuities period. Note that if the conveyance did not require them to survive <i>A</i>’s widow, their interests would vest when <i>A</i> died (even though they would not become possessory until the death of <i>A</i>’s widow). It is the requirement that they survive <i>A</i>’s widow that makes their interest invalid.</p>
<p id="c5b7a4f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><i>Fertile octogenarian.</i> If <i>O</i> grants property to “<i>A</i> for life, remainder to <i>A</i>’s grandchildren,” the assumption has always been that <i>A</i> could have more children until she dies, even if she is 80 years old. This assumption used to be humorous but new reproductive technologies make it perfectly plausible today; imagine a frozen embryo of hers implanted in another woman who bears her child. The contingent remainder in the grandchildren (or vested remainder subject to open if there are grandchildren at the conveyance from <i>O</i> to <i>A</i>) violates the rule because <i>A</i> could have a child after the creation of the interest and that child could have a child more than 21 years after the death of <i>A</i> (and everyone else alive at the creation of the interest). <i>A</i>’s children alive at the time of the creation of the interest could all predecease <i>A</i>, with the property going back to <i>O</i> as a reversion. If the after-born child has a child more than 21 years later, the interest will have vested too remotely. Thus the remainder violates the rule and is invalid.</p>

Barton Leach &amp; James K. Logan, <i>Perpetuities: A Standard Savings Clause to Avoid Violations of the Rule</i>, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1141 (1961). Others may provide that should the interest violate the rule, it should be construed to vest only in those persons who may legally take it under the rule. <i>Smith v. Smith ex rel. Clarke</i>, 747 A.2d 85 (Del. Ch. 1999) (finding such a clause saved an option to purchase from invalidity).</p>
<p id="c5b7f328-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet other clauses provide that in case of invalidity, the future interest shall vest within 21 years after the death of a particular class of people alive at the creation of the interest. The members of this class need not be beneficiaries of the interest — today, for example, it is common to have the class include the living descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, father of John F., Robert, and Teddy. Drafters using such clauses must take care, however, to select a class whose members are reasonably ascertainable. If the class chosen is so large that determining its members would effectively be a perpetual task, then the class violates the rule. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property <span title="792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-792">p. 792</span>(Donative Transfers)</i> §1.3; <i>see</i> N.Y.

<p id="c5b7f32b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rule against perpetuities facilitated productive use of land and distribution of wealth by limiting the power of the dead hand to keep property within families and control its use. But the difficulty of applying it and the invalidation of interests that would not in practice vest outside the perpetuities period led some jurisdictions to adopt modifications to avoid its harsh results. The most popular are wait and see and <i>cy pres</i>. The <i>Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities</i> (USRAP), adopted in about half the states since 1986, uses and expands both modifications.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN112F0_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N112F0_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">10</a></span> Even more significant has been the trend for states to effectively abolish the rule in an effort to compete for the profitable business of dynasty trusts. These trusts represent the antithesis of the rule: means to ensure that successive generations benefit from the trust fund, and are shielded from federal estate taxes and creditors, potentially forever.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN112F6_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N112F6_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">11</a></span></p>
<p id="c5b7f32e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite these changes, the rule remains important to understand. First, even in the many states that have adopted wait and see reforms, the validity of a future interest that violates the traditional rule cannot be ascertained for many years after its creation, but interests that are good under the traditional rule can be validated immediately. Second, because the law applicable to a particular grant may change depending on <span title="793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-793">p. 793</span>the domicile of the deceased, the location of the property granted, or other factors, it makes sense to ensure validity under the laws of most states. <i>See CS-Lakeview at Gwinnett, Inc. v. Simon Property Group, Inc.</i>, 659 S.E.2d 359 (Ga. 2008) (although option to purchase would be valid under Georgia law, it was invalid under Delaware law, which was chosen by the parties in their contract). Finally, the law in this area is rapidly changing, with proposals coming from all directions. Lawyers should be able to understand its current variations, and to weigh in on the changes.</p>
<p id="c5b7f32f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Traditional wait and see.</b> Some states modify the rule by using a <b>wait and see</b> or <b>second look</b> test. Under the traditional rule, a future interest is void if a <i>possibility</i> exists that it will vest outside the perpetuities period; this can be determined on the date of the conveyance. Under the wait and see test, the courts will not hold that a future interest violates the rule until the perpetuities period has passed and they are certain that the future interest has not vested within that period. For example, in the conveyance “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> so long as the property is used for residential purposes, then to <i>B</i>,” the executory interest in <i>B</i> is void under the traditional rule because it is possible that the property will be used for residential purposes long after the deaths of <i>O, A,</i> and <i>B</i> plus 21 years.</p>
<p id="c5b81a40-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, under the traditional wait and see test, the courts will wait until the condition occurs or the perpetuities period ends, whichever comes first. In this case, the perpetuities period ends 21 years after the death of the last of <i>O, A,</i> and <i>B</i>. (Do you see why?) If the property is used for nonresidential purposes before that period has lapsed, the executory interest is good and will be recognized; the property shifts to <i>B</i>. If, however, <i>O, A,</i> and <i>B</i> die and 21 years pass, and the property is still used for residential purposes, at that moment the future interest in <i>B</i> (actually <i>B</i>’s heirs or devisees since <i>B</i> is dead) is destroyed.</p>
<p id="c5b81a41-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The advantage of the wait and see test is clear — rather than invalidating interests because of a mere possibility of remote vesting, it validates them so long as they do in fact vest within the perpetuities period. The disadvantages are more subtle. Under the old rule, the validity of the future interest could be determined immediately. Under wait and see, it remains in limbo during the perpetuities period. Traditional wait and see also requires determining exactly who were the relevant lives in being and when they died. Although a number of states adopted some form of wait and see before 1986, most of these have now adopted the USRAP, which modifies the wait and see doctrine as discussed below.</p>
<p id="c5b81a42-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. <i>Cy pres</i>.</b> Some jurisdictions permit the use of <i>cy pres</i> to modify a grant to validate it if it appears consistent with the intent of the grantor. The most common application of <i>cy pres</i> is to reduce age contingencies that invalidate the future interest. For example, “<i>O</i> to <i>A</i> for life, then to the first child of <i>B</i> to attain 25 years of age,” creates a contingent remainder in the first child of <i>B</i> to reach 25 (assuming <i>B</i> has no children at the time of the initial conveyance), which violates the rule since a child could be born after the conveyance and reach 25 more than 21 years after the deaths of <i>O, A,</i> and <i>B</i>. A court may invoke the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine to reduce the age contingency of 25 to 21. <i>See In re Estate of Chun Quan Yee Hop</i>, 469 P.2d 183 (Haw. 1970) (reducing 30-year contingency)<i>.</i> Some jurisdictions also apply <i>cy pres</i> to provide that a reference to an individual’s <span title="794" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-794">p. 794</span>“widow” is intended to refer to his current wife, thus eliminating the unborn widow problem, or cure other interpretive stumbling blocks under the common law rule.</p>
<p id="c5b81a43-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. <i>Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.</i></b> The USRAP validates future interests in donative transfers (those created in gifts or trusts or wills) that otherwise violate the traditional rule against perpetuities if the interest vests at any time within 90 years of the date of its creation. This test applies the wait and see doctrine for interests that violate the traditional rule but limits the perpetuities period to 90 years rather than to “lives in being at the creation of the interest plus 21 years.” The 90-year wait and see provision applies only to interests that would have been invalid under the traditional rule. If an interest violates the 90-year wait and see period, the statute authorizes the courts to reform the deed, will, or trust in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor’s manifested plan of distribution and is within the allowable 90-year period. Although the law only applies to interests created after the passage of the statute, it also provides for <i>cy pres</i> to reform interests created earlier.</p>
<p id="c5b81a44-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Abolition of the rule for family trusts.</b> Many states have now abolished or substantially altered the rule against perpetuities, at least with respect to trusts. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Jesse Dukeminier &amp; James T. Krier, <i>The Rise of the Perpetual Trust</i>, 50 UCLA L. Rev. 1303, 1313-1314 (2003) (listing 20 states that had abolished the rule for trusts, and anticipating that the list would grow). Some states have done so by providing that the rule only applies to suspension of the power of alienation; so long as the trustee has the ability to sell the trust assets as a fee simple absolute, the rule does not apply. <i>See</i>,<i> e.g.</i>, S.D. Codified Laws §43-5-1; Wis. Stat. §700.16; N.J. Stat. §46:2F-10. Other states have abolished the rule for all trusts, but left non-trust transfers untouched. <i>See</i> Del. Code tit. 25, §503 (providing that trusts are not subject to the rule, but that their assets must be distributed within 110 years after settlement). Yet other states have effectively abolished the rule by adopting very long perpetuities periods. <i>See</i> Utah Code §752-1203 (1,000 years); Wyo. Stat. §34-1-139 (1,000 years); Fla. Stat. §689.225(2)(f) (360 years).</p>
<p id="c5b81a45-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These changes are driven by a race by banks and trust companies to act as trustees for family trusts. Tax avoidance is a big part of the story. Before 1976, no federal estate tax was levied at the end of a life estate, so testators could avoid taxation of their estates by leaving a series of life estates to their descendants. The only limitation was the rule against perpetuities, which generally meant that the trust would be distributed to the grandchildren of the testator in fee simple, and taxed then. In 1976, Congress amended the tax code to provide that a generation skipping transfer (GST) tax is due at the end of a life estate when it passes to the remainder holder. In 1986, Congress simplified the GST and added an important exclusion: $1 million of the initial settlement was exempt from the GST. This exemption is now over $5 million. What is more, the entire exempt trust corpus remains immune from estate taxation, even if compounding interest and investments multiply its value.</p>
<p id="c5b81a46-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The competition for trustee fees from family dynasties seeking to avoid these and other taxes has created a race to the bottom in state laws. One of the more blatant stories of legislative change comes from the Alaska Trust Company, which boasts on its website of its founding by two brothers, one an estate planning attorney from New York, who were on a fishing trip in Alaska and decided that it would be a great place to <span title="795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-795">p. 795</span>live and set up a trust company if only they could change some of the laws. They then successfully lobbied to change state laws to “make Alaska the premier location for trust services,” resulting in the abolition of the rule against perpetuities for alienable personal property and several other “unique pieces of legislation.” Other states that were traditional homes to the trust business, like Delaware and Florida, amended their laws to keep up. <i>See</i> Ray Madoff, <i>Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead</i> 80-81 (2010). A 2005 empirical study found that these legislative changes pay off. States that both abolished the rule against perpetuities and eliminated state income taxes on trusts saw the value of trust funds in their states increase by 20 percent, an average of $6 billion. Robert Sitkoff &amp; Max Schwartzenbach, <i>Jurisdictional Competition for Trust Funds: An Empirical Study of Perpetuities and Taxes</i>, 115 Yale L.J. 356 (2005).</p>
<p id="c5b81a47-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>5. The return of the rule?</b> Many commentators have criticized the rise of perpetual trusts and the decline of the rule against perpetuities. One potentially influential critique comes from the American Law Institute’s <i>Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills &amp; Other Donative Transfers</i> (2011). In the <i>Restatement</i>, the drafters point out that as each generation passes, the settlor of a family trust has less connection to the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries grows. This makes the trust both more expensive and less practicable to administer and takes it further from the legitimate scope of the settlor’s interests. <i>Id.</i> at ch. 27 (Introductory Note). They propose reforming the rule against perpetuities to restore its bite and better serve its goals. They would have all interests — both vested and contingent, in the grantor and in third parties — terminate and return to fee simple absolute after the death of the beneficiaries two generations after the grantor. The generations would not need to be born at the time of the creation of the interest to count as measuring lives under the rule. <i>Id.</i> §27.1; <i>see</i> Scott Andrew Shepard, <i>Which the Deader Hand: A Counter to the American Law Institute’s Proposed Revival of a Dying Perpetuities Rule</i>, 86 Tul. L. Rev. 559 (2012). The proposal would simplify and rationalize the application of the rule, but it is not clear that there is an incentive to adopt it with states seeking to attract dynasty trusts and lawyers glad not to have to worry about the rule at all. No states appear to have adopted the proposal thus far.</p>

<p id="c5b8415a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states have passed statutes that codify the rule against perpetuities. Some states have passed other statutes that also affect future interests.</p>
<p id="c5b8415b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Statutory cut-offs.</b> The rule against perpetuities does not apply to rights of entry or possibilities of reverter. The common law courts in England treated these interests as vested from the very beginning since they defined interests in the grantor that were reserved when the present estate was created. Yet, as a matter of public policy, it makes no sense to worry about executory interests because of the problem of dead hand control while deferring to future interests in the heirs of the grantor that could similarly vest 300 years in the future.</p>
<p id="c5b8415c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is especially true in light of the ability to evade the rule against perpetuities by careful drafting. For example, a grantor who wanted to convey property to <i>A</i> so long <span title="796" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-796">p. 796</span>as used for residential purposes, then to <i>B</i>, could easily do so in a two-step transaction. The grantor could convey a fee simple determinable to <i>A</i>, retaining a possibility of reverter. The grantor would then convey her possibility of reverter to <i>B</i>. The transfer of the future interest to <i>B</i> does not convert it to an executory interest. Since it was a possibility of reverter, the rule against perpetuities does not apply and the policy of restricting dead hand control has been evaded. A second way to do this is for <i>O</i> to transfer a fee simple absolute to <i>B</i>, and then for <i>B</i> to convey a fee simple determinable to <i>A</i>; since <i>B</i>’s interest is a possibility of reverter rather than an executory interest, it is immune from the rule against perpetuities.</p>
<p id="c5b8415d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons, some states have passed statutes that cut off interests in the grantor following defeasible fees if the condition does not occur within a stated time period, often 30 years after the initial conveyance. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Cal. Civ. Code §885.030; Ky. Rev. Stat. §381.221; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184A, §7; Mich. Comp. Laws §554.62; <i>Black Mountain Energy Corp. v. Bell County Board of Education</i>, 467 F. Supp. 2d 715 (E.D. Ky. 2006) (holding statute voiding possibilities of reverter after 30 years did not violate the takings clause). The odd result is that while an executory interest or contingent fee may continue for 90 years under the <i>Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities</i>, a right of entry or possibility of reverter, although traditionally not subject to the rule, will terminate in only 30 years.</p>
<p id="c5b8415e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Marketable title acts.</b> Many states have marketable title statutes requiring that future interests be re-recorded periodically in the local registry of deeds (typically every 30 or 40 years) to remain valid and enforceable. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Cal. Civ. Code §§880.020-887.090; Iowa Code §614.24. Statutes that effectively nullify future interests have often been challenged on the grounds that they violate due process or unconstitutionally take property or impair contracts. <i>Compare Severns v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.</i>, 125 Cal. Rptr. 2d 100 (Ct. App. 2002) (finding California statute valid) <i>with Board of Education v. Miles</i>, 207 N.E.2d 181 (N.Y. 1965) (holding New York statute invalid). These laws are generally upheld today if they apply prospectively and give owners enough notice of the obligation to re-record their interests.</p>

How do these interests apply to so-called commercial options created in the context of market transactions? The two most important kinds of commercial options are <b>options to purchase</b>, a right to acquire the property at some time in the future for a fixed price, and <b>preemptive rights</b>, or <b>rights of first refusal</b>, rights to acquire the property at the market price should it be sold in the future.

<p id="c5b8687d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject of this proceeding is a two-story building situated on the Broadway block between 94th and 95th Streets on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. In 1978, Broadwest Realty Corporation owned this building, which housed a theater and commercial space. Broadwest had been unable to secure a permanent tenant for the theater — approximately 58% of the total square footage of the building’s floor space. Broadwest also owned two adjacent properties, Pomander Walk (a residential complex) and the Healy Building (a commercial building). Broadwest had been operating its properties at a net loss.</p>
<p id="c5b8687e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plaintiff Symphony Space, Inc., a not-for-profit entity devoted to the arts, had previously rented the theater for several one-night engagements. In 1978, Symphony and Broadwest engaged in a transaction whereby Broadwest sold the entire building to Symphony for the below-market price of $10,010 and leased back the income-producing commercial property, excluding the theater, for $1 per year. Broadwest maintained liability for the existing $243,000 mortgage on the property as well as certain maintenance obligations. As a condition of the sale, Symphony, for consideration of $10, also granted Broadwest an option to repurchase the entire building. Notably, the transaction did not involve Pomander Walk or the Healy Building.</p>
<p id="c5b8687f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of this arrangement was to enable Symphony, as a not-for-profit corporation, to seek a property tax exemption for the entire building — which constituted a single tax parcel — predicated on its use of the theater. The sale-and-leaseback would thereby reduce Broadwest’s real estate taxes by $30,000 per year, while permitting Broadwest to retain the rental income from the leased commercial space in the building, which the trial court found produced $140,000 annually. The arrangement also furthered Broadwest’s goal of selling all the properties, by allowing Broadwest to postpone any sale until property values in the area increased and until the commercial <span title="798" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-798">p. 798</span>leases expired. Symphony, in turn, would have use of the theater at minimal cost, once it received a tax exemption.</p>
<p id="c5b86880-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, on December 1, 1978, Symphony and Broadwest — both sides represented by counsel — executed a contract for sale of the property from Broadwest to Symphony for the purchase price of $10,010. The contract specified that $10 was to be paid at the closing and $10,000 was to be paid by means of a purchase-money mortgage.</p>
<p id="c5b88f91-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The parties also signed several separate documents, each dated December 31, 1978: (1) a deed for the property from Broadwest to Symphony; (2) a lease from Symphony to Broadwest of the entire building except the theater for rent of $1 per year and for the term January 1, 1979 to May 31, 2003, unless terminated earlier; (3) a 25-year, $10,000 mortgage and mortgage note from Symphony as mortgagor to Broadwest as mortgagee, with full payment due on December 31, 2003; and (4) an option agreement by which Broadwest obtained from Symphony the exclusive right to repurchase all of the property, including the theater.</p>

<p id="c5b88f9a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Symphony ultimately obtained a tax exemption for the theater. In the summer of 1981, Broadwest sold and assigned its interest under the lease, option agreement, mortgage and mortgage note, as well as its ownership interest in the contiguous Pomander Walk and Healy Building, to defendants’ nominee for $4.8 million.

<p id="c5b88f9b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequently, defendants initiated a cooperative conversion of Pomander Walk, which was designated a landmark in 1982, and the value of the properties increased substantially. An August 1988 appraisal of the entire blockfront, including the Healy Building and the unused air and other development rights available from Pomander Walk, valued the property at $27 million assuming the enforceability of the option. By contrast, the value of the leasehold interest plus the Healy Building without the option were appraised at $5.5 million.</p>
<p id="c5b88f9c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In 1985, Swett and Pergola sought to terminate the lease and exercise the option to purchase. After much litigation, both the trial court and the Appellate Division held that the option was void under the rule against perpetuities.]</p>
<p id="c5b88f9d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>II. Statutory Background</i></p>
<p id="c5b88f9e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rule against Perpetuities evolved from judicial efforts during the 17th century to limit control of title to real property by the dead hand of landowners reaching into future generations. Underlying both early and modern rules restricting future dispositions of property is the principle that it is socially undesirable for property to be inalienable for an unreasonable period of time. These rules thus seek “to ensure the productive use and development of property by its current beneficial owners by simplifying ownership, facilitating exchange and freeing property from unknown or embarrassing impediments to alienability” (<i>Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken Realty Corp.</i>, 492 N.E.2d 379, 381 (N.Y. 1986)).</p>
<p id="c5b88f9f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In New York, the rules regarding suspension of the power of alienation and remoteness in vesting — the Rule against Perpetuities — have been statutory since 1830. Prior to 1958, the perpetuities period was two lives in being plus actual periods of minority. Widely criticized as unduly complex and restrictive, the statutory period was revised in 1958 and 1960, restoring the common-law period of lives in being plus 21 years.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Formerly, the rule against remote vesting in New York was narrower than the common-law rule, encompassing only particular interests. A further 1965 amendment enacted a broad prohibition against remote vesting. This amendment was intended to make clear that the American common-law rule of perpetuities was now fully in force in New York.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York’s current statutory Rule against Perpetuities is found in N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts §9-1.1. Subdivision (a) sets forth the suspension of alienation rule and deems void any estate in which the conveying instrument suspends the absolute power of alienation for longer than lives in being at the creation of the estate plus 21 years. The prohibition against remote vesting is contained in subdivision (b), which states that “[n]o estate in property shall be valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after one or more lives in being at the creation of the estate and any period of gestation involved.” This Court has described subdivision (b) as “a rigid formula that invalidates any interest that may not vest within the prescribed time period” and has “capricious consequences” (<i>Wildenstein &amp; Co. v. Wallis</i>, 595 N.E.2d 828, 831-32 <span title="800" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-800">p. 800</span>(N.Y. 1992)). Indeed, these rules are predicated upon the public policy of the State and constitute non-waivable, legal prohibitions.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these statutory formulas, New York also retains the more flexible common-law rule against unreasonable restraints on alienation. Unlike the statutory Rule against Perpetuities, which is measured exclusively by the passage of time, the common-law rule evaluates the reasonableness of the restraint based on its duration, purpose and designated method for fixing the purchase price.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>III. Validity of the Option Agreement</i></p>
<p id="c5b88fa4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants proffer three grounds for upholding the option: that the statutory prohibition against remote vesting does not apply to commercial options; that the option here cannot be exercised beyond the statutory period; and that this Court should adopt the “wait and see” approach to the Rule against Perpetuities. We consider each in turn.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>A. Applicability of the Rule to Commercial Options</i></p>
<p id="c5b88fa6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the common law, options to purchase land are subject to the rule against remote vesting. Such options are specifically enforceable and give the option holder a contingent, equitable interest in the land. This creates a disincentive for the landowner to develop the property and hinders its alienability, thereby defeating the policy objectives underlying the Rule against Perpetuities.</p>
<p id="c5b88fa7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Typically, however, options to purchase are part of a commercial transaction. For this reason, subjecting them to the Rule against Perpetuities has been deemed “a step of doubtful wisdom” (Leach, <i>Perpetuities in Perspective: Ending the Rule’s Reign of Terror</i>, 65 Harv. L. Rev. 737). As one vocal critic, Professor W. Barton Leach, has explained,</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="c5b88fa8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“[t]he Rule grew up as a limitation on family dispositions; and the period of lives in being plus twenty-one years is adapted to these gift transactions. The pressures which created the Rule do not exist with reference to arms-length contractual transactions, and neither lives in being nor twenty-one years are periods which are relevant to business men and their affairs” (Leach, <i>Perpetuities: New Absurdity, Judicial and Statutory Correctives</i>, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 1318, 1321-1322).</p>
</div>
<p id="c5b8b6b9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Leach, however, went on to acknowledge that, under common law, “due to an overemphasis on concepts derived from the nineteenth century, we are stuck with the application of the Rule to options to purchase,” urging that “this should not be extended to other commercial transactions” (<i>id.</i>, at 1322).</p>
<p id="c5b8b6ba-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is now settled in New York that, generally, N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts §9-1.1(b) applies to options. While defendants offer compelling policy reasons — echoing those voiced by Professor Leach — for refusing to apply the traditional rule against remote vesting to these commercial option contracts, such statutory reformation would require legislative action similar to that undertaken by numerous other State lawmakers.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6bb-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision in <i>Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v. Bruken Realty Corp.</i>, 492 N.E.2d 379, <i>supra,</i> is not to the contrary. In <i>Bruken</i>, we held that §9-1.1(b) did not apply to <span title="801" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-801">p. 801</span>a preemptive right in a “commercial and governmental transaction” that lasted beyond the statutory perpetuities period. In doing so, we explained that, unlike options, preemptive rights (or rights of first refusal) only marginally affect transferability. Enforcement of the preemptive right in the context of the governmental and commercial transaction, moreover, actually encouraged the use and development of the land, outweighing any minor impediment to alienability. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p id="c5b8b6bc-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, the option agreement creates precisely the sort of control over future disposition of the property that we have previously associated with purchase options and that the common-law rule against remote vesting — and thus §9-1.1(b) — seeks to prevent. As the Appellate Division explained, the option grants its holder absolute power to purchase the property at the holder’s whim and at a token price set far below market value. This Sword of Damocles necessarily discourages the property owner from investing in improvements to the property. Furthermore, the option’s existence significantly impedes the owner’s ability to sell the property to a third party, as a practical matter rendering it inalienable.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6bd-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That defendants, the holder of this option, are also the lessees of a portion of the premises does not lead to a different conclusion here.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6be-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Generally, an option to purchase land that originates in one of the lease provisions, is not exercisable after lease expiration, and is incapable of separation from the lease is valid even though the holder’s interest may vest beyond the perpetuities period. Such options — known as options “appendant” or “appurtenant” to leases — encourage the possessory holder to invest in maintaining and developing the property by guaranteeing the option holder the ultimate benefit of any such investment. Options appurtenant thus further the policy objectives underlying the rule against remote vesting and are not contemplated by §9-1.1(b).</p>
<p id="c5b8b6bf-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, the option here arose within a larger transaction that included a lease. Nevertheless, not all of the property subject to the purchase option here is even occupied by defendants. The option encompasses the entire building — both the commercial space and the theater — yet defendants are leasing only the commercial space. With regard to the theater space, a disincentive exists for Symphony to improve the property, since it will eventually be claimed by the option holder at the predetermined purchase price.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c0-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where, as here, the parties to a transaction are corporations and no measuring lives are stated in the instruments, the perpetuities period is simply 21 years. Section 1 of the parties’ agreement allows the option holder to exercise the option “at any time during any Exercise Period” set forth in section three. Section 3(a), moreover, expressly provides that the option may be exercised “at any time after July 1, 1979,” so long as the closing date is scheduled during 1987, 1993, 1998 or 2003.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even factoring in the requisite notice, then, the option could potentially be exercised as late as July 2003 — more than 24 years after its creation in December 1978. Defendants’ contention that section 3(a) does not permit exercise of the option beyond the 21-year period is thus contradicted by the plain language of the instrument. [Each of the other time periods provided for exercising the option could also be exercised until 2003.]</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><span title="802" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-802">p. 802</span><i>C. “Wait and See” Approach</i></p>
<p id="c5b8b6c3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants next urge that we adopt the “wait and see” approach to the Rule against Perpetuities: an interest is valid if it actually vests during the perpetuities period, irrespective of what might have happened. The option here would survive under the “wait and see” approach since it was exercised by 1987, well within the 21-year limitation.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This Court, however, has long refused to “wait and see” whether a perpetuities violation in fact occurs. As explained in <i>Matter of Fischer</i>, 307 N.Y. 149, 157, 120 N.E.2d 688, “[i]t is settled beyond dispute that in determining whether a will has illegally suspended the power of alienation, the courts will look to what might have happened under the terms of the will rather than to what has actually happened since the death of the testator.”</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para center "><i>IV. Remedy</i></p>
<p id="c5b8b6c6-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a final matter, defendants argue that, if the option fails, the contract of sale conveying the property from Broadwest to Symphony should be rescinded due to the mutual mistake of the parties. We conclude that rescission is inappropriate and therefore do not pass upon whether Broadwest’s claim for rescission was properly assigned to defendant Pergola.</p>
<p id="c5b8b6c7-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A contract entered into under mutual mistake of fact is generally subject to rescission. CPLR 3005 provides that when relief against mistake is sought, it shall not be denied merely because the mistake is one of law rather than fact. Relying on this provision, defendants maintain that neither Symphony nor Broadwest realized that the option violated the Rule against Perpetuities at the time they entered into the agreement and that both parties intended the option to be enforceable.</p>
<p id="c5b8ddd8-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remedy of rescission, moreover, lies in equity and is a matter of discretion. Defendants’ plea that the unenforceability of the option is contrary to the intent of the original parties ignores that the effect of the Rule against Perpetuities — which is a statutory prohibition, not a rule of construction — is always to defeat the intent of parties who create a remotely vesting interest.</p>
<p id="c5b8ddd9-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rule against Perpetuities reflects the public policy of the State. Granting the relief requested by defendants would thus be contrary to public policy, since it would lead to the same result as enforcing the option and tend to compel performance of contracts violative of the Rule.</p>
<p id="c5b8ddda-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>

Options to purchase.</b> Options to purchase have traditionally been considered to be executory interests and subject to the rule against perpetuities. <i>Arundel Corp. v. Marie</i>, 860 A.2d 886 (Md. 2004); <i>Bortolotti v. Hayden</i>, 866 N.E.2d 882 (Mass. 2007). As in <i>Symphony Space</i>, this is true even if the right is in the original grantor of the property, because the need to <i>purchase</i> the property to reacquire indicates that <span title="803" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-803">p. 803</span>the option is not simply the reversion of an already vested right in the property, but a new interest cutting off an existing estate. It is easy to see how an option to purchase for a fixed price at a period far in the future might hinder productive use of land. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Central Delaware County Authority v. Greyhound Corp.</i>, 588 A.2d 485 (Pa. 1991) (plaintiff sued to invalidate option to purchase created in 1941, which would permit the land to be purchased for the original sales price, $5,500, if it ever ceased to be used for public purposes). Is it true that allowing the option in <i>Symphony Space</i> would have hindered the productive use of the property?</p>

<p id="c5b8dde1-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Options to purchase and renew in leases.</b> Despite the general rule, most courts hold that options to purchase in commercial leases are exempt from the rule against perpetuities. William B. Stoebuck &amp; Dale A. Whitman, <i>The Law of Property</i> §3.18, at 123 (3d ed. 2000). As Chief Justice Ellen Peters explained in <i>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing, Inc. v. Samowitz</i>, 570 A.2d 170 (Conn. 1990), “[a]n option coupled with a long-term commercial lease . . . stimulates improvement of the property and thus renders it more rather than less marketable.” <i>Id.</i> at 174. Similarly, many courts hold that options to renew leases during the lease term are not subject to the rule against perpetuities. <i>See Bleecker Street Tenants Corp. v. Bleeker Jones</i>, <i>LLC</i>, 945 N.E.2d 484 (N.Y. 2011). What if an option in a lease is exercised by a tenant who has become a month-to-month tenant after her initial term of years expires? In <i>Bleecker Street Tenants Corp.</i>, the New York Court of Appeals considered this to be still within the lease term and therefore not violative of the rule. Was this the right resolution?</p>
<p id="c5b8dde2-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and commercial options.</b> The drafters of the USRAP intended it to supersede the common law rule against perpetuities entirely and so provided in §9 of the act. Because the USRAP applies only to donative transfers, the USRAP’s drafters suggested that states pass separate laws limiting executory interests such as options to purchase to a 30-year period, and some states have done so. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184A, §5; N.C. Gen. Stat. §41-29. <i>Cf.</i> 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/4(a)(7) (40-year limit). Some states adopted the USRAP without imposing any limit on commercial options. <i>See, e.g.</i>,<i> Larson Operating Co. v. Petroleum, Inc.</i>, 84 P.3d 626 (Kan. Ct. App. 2004) (interpreting Kan. Stat. §59-340)<i>.</i> Some states that adopted the USRAP refused to enact §9 but did not pass any supplementary legislation concerning nondonative interests. In those states, such interests are probably still governed by the traditional rule against perpetuities. <i>See Buck v. Banks</i>, 668 N.E.2d 1259 (Ind. Ct. App. 1996). Some states adopted statutes that explicitly apply the rule against perpetuities as modified by the wait and see test to nondonative transfers. <i>See</i> Va. Code §55-13.3. Even in states that have adopted both the USRAP and a limit on commercial options, moreover, the common law rule against perpetuities may bar options created before their enactment. <i>Compare Bauermeister v. Waste Management <span title="804" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-804">p. 804</span>Co. of Nebraska</i>, 783 N.W.2d 594 (Neb. 2010) (statutory abolition reflected policy regarding nondonative transfers created before enactment), <i>with New Bar Partnership v. Martin</i>, 729 S.E.2d 625 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012) (right of first refusal barred by common law rule against perpetuities).</p>
<p id="c5b904f3-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In states that have abolished the rule against perpetuities with respect to nondonative transfers, options to purchase are still regulated by the common law rule against <b>unreasonable restraints on alienation</b><i>. See</i> Chapter 8, §5.4. Courts may refuse to enforce an option, especially if it is for a fixed price, if the option has no time limit and the option was not exercised within a reasonable period after its creation (unless the option is included in a lease). <i>Mr. Sign Sign Studios, Inc. v. Miguel</i>, 877 So. 2d 47 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004).</p>
<p id="c5b904f4-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Preemptive rights or rights of first refusal.</b> Some jurisdictions retain the traditional rule that preemptive rights, also called rights of first refusal, are subject to the rule against perpetuities. <i>See Selig v. State Highway Administration</i>, 861 A.2d 710 (Md. 2004) (noting that rule still generally applied to preemptive rights, although transportation statute exempted preemptive rights against state); <i>Hensley-O’Neal v. Metropolitan National Bank</i>, 297 S.W.3d 610 (Mo. Ct. App. 2009); <i>New Bar Partnership v. Martin</i>, 729 S.E.2d 625 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012). Preemptive rights give the holder the right to purchase the property if the owner chooses to sell, either by offering the market price for the property, or by matching the offer made by any bona fide purchaser. Some courts reason that preemptive rights may restrict alienability by deterring other bidders for the land, or leading sellers to accept below-market prices rather than litigate over fair market value. <i>Selig</i>, 861 A.2d at 718-719.</p>
<p id="c5b904f5-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Symphony Space</i> discusses, an increasing number of courts hold that preemptive rights are wholly exempt from the rule against perpetuities. <i>See Bortolotti v. Hayden</i>, 866 N.E.2d 882 (Mass. 2007); <i>Old Port Cove Holdings v. Old Port Cove Condominium Association</i>, 986 So. 2d 1279 (Fla. 2008); <i>Hartnett v. Jones</i>, 629 P.2d 1357 (Wyo. 1981). As the Massachusetts Supreme Court argued in <i>Bortolli</i>, “[b]ecause the holder of a right of first refusal may only choose to purchase property on the same terms as a bona fide offer, if and when the owner decides to sell, there is no power either to compel an owner to sell the property at an unfavorable price, or to encumber an owner’s ability to sell the property for a lengthy period of time. There is no casting of a cloud of uncertainty on the title to the property, and no potential to forestall a sale.” 866 N.E.2d at 889. When preemptive rights are held by owners associations to purchase units in common interest developments, moreover, they may increase the market value of the properties held by association members. <i>Cambridge Co. v. East Slope Investment Corp.</i>, 700 P.2d 537 (Colo. 1985). Courts adopting this approach may hold that preemptive rights must be exercised within a reasonable time in order to avoid invalidation as unreasonable restraints on alienation, see<i> Shiver v. Benton</i>, 304 S.E.2d 903 (Ga. 1983), or interpret them to be exercisable only during a particular person’s lifetime, thereby validating them under the rule. <i>See Firebaugh v. Whitehead</i>, 559 S.E.2d 611 (Va. 2002).</p>

For example, an option in gross should rarely, if ever be permitted to last as long as the rule would permit. As another example, the power of a property owners association to grant easements in common areas should be limited by the duration of the association, rather than by the lives of the developer’s family and friends plus 21 years, or by a fixed period of 21 or 90 years.</p>

Possibilities of reverter are, of course, viewed as “vested” and thus exempt from the rule against perpetuities. <i>Alby v. Banc One Financial</i>, 82 P.3d 675 (Wash. Ct. App. 2003) (a possibility of reverter is “immediately vested in the grantor”). <i>A</i> responds that the policies underlying the common law rule against perpetuities apply to possibilities of reverter as well as to executory interests, and that it is nonsensical to continue to exempt possibilities of reverter from the rule on the grounds that they are “vested.” <i>A</i> further argues that this proposed change in the law (applying the rule against perpetuities to possibilities of reverter) should be applied retroactively, on the ground that when the rule was first developed in the <i>Duke of Norfolk’s Case</i>, 22 Eng. Rep. 931 (1681), it was applied retroactively to the conveyance in that case. What arguments could you make for the plaintiff? For the defendant? What should the court do?</p>

However, this left language creating a possibility of reverter (“the land . . . reverts back . . . in the event it is no longer used for Grange purposes”). Since possibilities of reverter are not subject to the rule, the court deemed that interest valid. Does this make sense?</p>

Here we conclude that the clause is void as a restraint on marriage. (Cal. Civ. Code §710.)</p>
<p id="c5b92c16-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner Darlene Guidotti appeals an order by the probate court denying a petition to reform the will of her deceased husband, Earl Guidotti, to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code concerning the marital deduction and the charitable deduction.

<p id="c5b92c17-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 13, 1999, Earl Guidotti died. His last will and testament dated November 19, 1993, created a testamentary trust for the benefit of his wife, Darlene. The trust generally provided for Darlene during her lifetime and upon her death, provided for distribution to “charitable 501(c)(3) organizations” within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. The trust granted Darlene the power to appoint the charitable beneficiaries.</p>
<p id="c5b92c18-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trust gave Darlene the right to live in the family residence during her lifetime, rent-free. In the event she moved from the residence or was absent for more than 60 continuous days, without an intent to return, Darlene forfeited the right to live in the residence.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN116B6_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8" href="https://www.casebookconnect.com/#note-N116B6_ceea918a-13ca-11e7-9c4f-4bfca9ff4ea8">12</a></span></p>
<p id="c5b92c1a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trust also provided that Darlene would receive the net income for her lifetime. However, “[i]n the event [she] should remarry, or, live with a man as though they were husband and wife, even though not married, all income payments to her shall immediately stop. . . .” The trust also permitted an invasion of the trust principal as necessary for Darlene’s proper health, maintenance, and support. The power to invade principal, however, ceased in the event of Darlene’s remarriage or cohabitation “with a man as though they were husband and wife, even though not married.” During the probate proceedings, Darlene expressly disclaimed any interest in the trust principal by filing a written disclaimer pursuant to Probate Code section 275.</p>
<p id="c5b92c1b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On March 13, 2000, Darlene filed a petition to reform the will in order to meet the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the marital and <span title="807" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-807">p. 807</span>charitable deductions. Darlene asserted that the clause that terminated her income interest upon remarriage or cohabitation precluded the federal estate tax marital deduction and also prevented the charitable tax deduction because the remainder interest passing to charity would be uncertain. (26 U.S.C. §§2055, 2056.) She argued that the clause regarding her remarriage or cohabitation with a man was void as a restraint on marriage. (Cal. Civ. Code §710.)</p>
<p id="c5b9532c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In support of the reformation petition, Darlene offered a declaration by the attorney who drafted Earl’s will and testamentary trust. The attorney declared that Earl was “extremely jealous” of Darlene and “did not want Darlene to remarry nor live with another man as if married” after Earl’s death. Earl instructed him to draft the will “in such a manner that Darlene would be severely penalized in the event she remarried or lived with another man as if married.” The attorney stated: “[Earl] intended and specifically directed me to draft provisions which would prevent, in so far as he could control, the remarriage of Darlene or her living with another man as if married.”</p>
<p id="c5b9532d-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the attorney’s declaration, Earl also hoped to obtain a marital deduction and a charitable deduction for federal estate tax purposes. The attorney stated: “[Earl] wished to [accomplish the estate plan] without payment of state or federal death taxes. He wanted there to be no federal or state estate taxes at his death.” Indeed, the trust empowered the personal representative “to elect qualified terminable interest treatment [regarding the marital deduction] for all or for any portion” of the trust.</p>
<p id="c5b9532e-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The probate court considered the petition for reformation and determined that the clause regarding remarriage or cohabitation was not a restraint on marriage because it fell under the exception of Civil Code section 710, “where the intent was not to forbid marriage, but only to give the use until marriage.” The trial court reasoned that the clause was “harsh, unwise and somewhat punitive” but “also” reflected an intent that any new partner provide for Darlene’s support. The court therefore refused to declare the clause void and reform the will to comply with federal estate tax requirements for favorable tax treatment.</p>
<p id="c5b9532f-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Darlene appeals and contends that the clause restraining marriage is against public policy and void. Her appeal is unopposed by the Attorney General, who represents the yet unnamed charitable beneficiaries.</p>
<p id="c5b95330-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The interpretation of a written instrument, including a will, is a judicial function. A reviewing court may exercise its independent judgment in interpreting an instrument provided that extrinsic evidence regarding interpretation is not conflicting. (<i>Estate of Edwards</i>, 250 Cal. Rptr. 779, 781-82 (Cal. App. 1988).) Probate Code section 21102, subdivision (a), provides: “The intention of the transferor as expressed in the instrument controls the legal effect of the dispositions made in the instrument.” Thus, the paramount rule in the construction of a will is the determination of the testator’s intent.</p>
<p id="c5b95331-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Civil Code section 710 provides: “Conditions imposing restraints upon marriage . . . are void; but this does not affect limitations where the intent was not to forbid marriage, but only to give the use until marriage.” Our Supreme Court has invalidated clauses in wills that either restrain marriage generally or marriage to a particular person. (<i>Estate of Duffill</i>, 183 P. 337 (Cal. 1919) (testatrix’s will reduced gift to son if he <span title="808" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-808">p. 808</span>married “Mrs. Alice McNamara”); <i>Estate of Scott</i>, 148 P. 221 (Cal. 1915) (testator’s will limited wife’s bequest if she “[s]hould . . . wish to marrie agane”).)</p>
<p id="c5b95332-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here Earl’s will terminates payment of all trust income to Darlene “[i]n the event [she] should remarry, or, live with a man as though they were husband and wife.” The declaration of the attorney who drafted the will states that Earl was jealous of Darlene and wanted to preclude her remarrying or living with another man. Indeed, the attorney states that he counseled Earl that a clause restraining her remarriage “might be unenforceable as against public policy.” Our review of the wording of the will and more importantly, the evidence surrounding its execution shows that Earl intended to restrain Darlene’s relationships or remarriage in violation of Civil Code section 710. His intent was not to provide for her until such time as she formed another relationship. (<i>Estate of Fitzgerald</i>, 119 P. 96 (Cal. 1919) (testator left estate to wife, but “in the event” she remarried, her gift was divided with testator’s son unless he died without issue).) Unlike the circumstances in <i>Estate of Fitzgerald</i>,<i> supra</i>, we cannot say there is “not the slightest indication that there was any design or [the testator’s] part to deter his wife from contracting another marriage, or that he had any objection whatever to her so doing.” We draw the reasonable inference from the declaration of the drafting attorney that Earl intended to restrict Darlene from remarrying or living with a man.</p>
<p id="c5b95333-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The order is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings concerning reformation of the will and the charitable bequests.</p>

<p id="c5b95336-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>1. Restraints on remarriage of testator’s spouse.</b> The traditional and still majority rule is that bequests to a surviving spouse conditioned on the beneficiary remaining unmarried are valid and will be enforced. In the words of the Missouri Supreme Court, “[i]t seems settled law that men have a sort of mournful property right, so to speak, in the viduity [widowhood] of their wives.” <i>Knost v. Knost</i>, 129 S.W. 665, 667 (Mo. 1910). What justifies the rule? An early court stated dramatically, “[i]t would be extremely difficult to say, why a husband should not be at liberty to leave a homestead to his wife, without being compelled to let her share it with a successor to his bed, and to use it as a nest to hatch a brood of strangers to his blood.” <i>Commonwealth v. Stauffer</i>, 10 Pa. 350, 355 (1849). But a testator may have other reasons for divestment on remarriage, such as preserving the estate for the testator’s children by another marriage. As seen in <i>Guidotti</i>, however, these restrictions may have a drastic monetary impact. Although the federal marital deduction immunizes inheritance from a spouse from estate taxation, bequests terminable before the end of a life estate are not eligible. <i>See Roels v. United States</i>, 928 F. Supp. 812 (D. Wis. 1996) (construing I.R.C. §2056(b)(1))<i>.</i></p>
<p id="c5b95337-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Guidotti</i>, the court followed a state statute in determining whether the restriction was mere possessiveness or was to support the widow. Other states have similar statutes. Ga. Code §44-6-68; Ind. Code §29-1-6-3; <i>In re Estate of Robertson</i>, 859 N.E.2d 772 (Ind. App. 2007) (invalidating life estate for widower “until he remarries or allows any female companion to live with him who is not a blood relative”). Should other <span title="809" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-809">p. 809</span>states, by common law or statute, require review of remarriage restrictions and strike them down if they are simply demands for faithfulness from beyond the grave? The <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)</i> §6.3 (1983), while it otherwise requires review for reasonableness for restrictions on remarriage, would simply uphold without review restraints on remarriage by the testator’s spouse.</p>
<p id="c5b95338-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>2. Restraints on marriage generally.</b> In contrast with restrictions on remarriage of a surviving spouse, restrictions on a first marriage are invalid if they unreasonably limit the opportunity to marry. <i>Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)</i> §6.2. Thus restraints on marriage until the individual turns 21, or prohibiting marrying one particular individual, will be upheld. <i>See Taylor v. Rapp</i>, 124 S.E.2d 271 (Ga. 1962) (upholding will prohibiting daughter from sharing in the estate should she “marry JODY TAYLOR, a boy I do not like and care for in any respects”). Bequests conditioned on the beneficiary remaining unmarried will only be upheld if the intent is to provide support to the individual when unmarried. <i>See Restatement (Second)</i> §6.1; <i>Lewis v. Searles</i>, 452 S.W.2d 153 (Mo. 1970).</p>
<p id="c5b95339-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>3. Religious restrictions.</b> Courts generally uphold conditions that the beneficiary must marry an individual of a particular ethnicity or religion. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gordon v. Gordon</i>, 124 N.E.2d 228, 230 (Mass. 1955) (upholding a condition that beneficiaries must marry persons “born in the Hebrew faith”; court revoked gift to son when he married a Jew by choice (convert)); <i>Shapira v. Union National Bank</i>, 315 N.E.2d 825 (Ohio Ct. Comm. Pleas 1974) (upholding a condition that testators’ son “should receive his share of the bequest only if he is married at the time of my death to a Jewish girl whose both parents were Jewish” or so married within seven years of his death); <i>In re Estate of Keffalas</i>, 233 A.2d 248 (Pa. 1967) (upholding gift to sons conditional on their marrying women of “true Greek blood and descent and of Orthodox religion”).</p>
<p id="c5b97a4a-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</i> §29(c) cmt. j, illus. 3 (2003), in contrast, provides that conditions limiting gifts if the recipient does not marry a person of a particular religion are void as against public policy because they interfere with the fundamental right to marry. The Illinois Supreme Court considered both the <i>Restatement (Third)</i> and constitutional arguments in <i>In re Estate of Feinberg</i>, 919 N.E.2d 888 (Ill. 2009), but upheld a provision that an estate be divided only among those grandchildren who, if married, were married to Jews or whose non-Jewish spouses had converted within one year of marriage. The court rejected the challenger’s constitutional arguments, finding no state action in enforcement of the condition. Emphasizing the states’ strong policy of respecting testator intent, the court found that public policy did not prohibit benefitting only the “grandchildren whose lives most closely embraced the values [the testators] cherished.” <i>Id.</i> at 903.</p>
<p id="c5b97a4b-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A restriction will be held invalid when it effectively prohibits the beneficiary from marrying at all. Thus in <i>Madox v. Madox</i>, 52 Va. 804 (1854), the court invalidated a condition that the testator’s daughter remain a member in good standing of the Society of Friends, because members were prohibited from marrying nonmembers and <span title="810" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-810">p. 810</span>there were not “more than five or six marriageable male members of the society” in the county, so “the restriction imposed by the condition would have operated a virtual prohibition of her marrying.” While there might have been other members outside the county, she “could not be expected, if she had the means, which it seems she had not, to go abroad in search of a helpmate; and to subject her to the doubtful chance of being sought in marriage by a stranger.” Should the advent of Internet dating change the result in a similar case today?</p>
<p id="c5b97a4c-3c95-11e7-a914-95930bd2689a" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  "><b>4. Gender roles.</b> Professor Mary Joe Frug argues that cases involving women as parties often implicate tacit assumptions about gender roles. Mary Joe Frug, <i>Re-Reading Contracts: A Feminist Analysis of a Contracts Casebook,</i> 34 Am. U. L. Rev. 1065 (1985). A donor may make a transfer of property conditional on the transferee remaining single for various reasons. The donor could hope to induce the donee not to marry, or the donor could imagine that the donee will no longer need the property once she marries. Such donors may or may not distinguish among donees based on their sex. One goal of property law is to confer freedom on donors to determine how and on which conditions to part with their property, but another is to construct rules governing property ownership in a manner that does not treat women as less worthy of owning or controlling property than men. <i>See Married Women’s Property Acts</i>, Chapter 9, §3.1.B, above (giving married women right to own property); <i>Kirchberg v. Feenstra</i>, 450 U.S. 455 (1981) (finding that giving husbands the sole power to manage and control jointly owned property violated the equal protection clause). How should courts think about restraints on marriage if one goal is to promote gender equality?</p>

Encouragement of divorce.</b> Provisions in gifts of property encouraging separation or divorce are widely viewed with disfavor and generally held to violate public policy. They may be upheld if the “dominant motive of the transferor is to provide support in the event of separation or divorce, in which case the restraint is valid.” <i>Restatement (Second)</i> <i>of Property (Donative Transfers)</i> §7.1. Thus, in a case devising $2,000 to the testator’s daughter, who was married at the time of execution, if she remarried a man of “true Greek blood and descent and of Orthodox religion” was invalid as encouraging divorce, although similar conditions on his unmarried sons’ receipt of their devises were valid. <i>In re Estate of Keffalas</i>, 233 A.2d 248 (Pa. 1967); <i>see also In re Estate of Owen</i>, 855 N.E.2d 603 (Ind. 2006) (voiding prohibition on daughter renting residence while married to her husband).</p>

New York, where the will is construed, enacted the <i>Marriage Equality Act</i> in 2011, providing in part that “marriage is a fundamental right.
