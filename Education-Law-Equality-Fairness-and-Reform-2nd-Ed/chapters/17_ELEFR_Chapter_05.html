<p class="h3" id="ch125">A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">Our laws and the institutions they govern frequently reflect social norms relating to sex and gender, which in turn produce gender inequities. Education law and policy is no different. States historically promoted and reinforced gender inequality by excluding women from certain educational programs altogether and treating them unequally in others. Over the past few decades, judicial and administrative decisions have caused many gender disparities to wane. But many disparities persist and, as schools change, gender inequalities arise in new, different, and more complex forms.</p>
<p class="indent">Many schools continue to provide unequal athletic opportunities to women. Some inequalities are so common that society often fails to recognize them as problematic. For example, many high school girls’ soccer teams cannot practice or schedule matches on their school’s “football” field. This exact type of dispute was at the heart of a Supreme Court decision in 2005 involving a girls’ high school basketball coach who alleged he was removed from his position due to his complaints of gender discrimination. At the higher education level, issues of gender inequality garner more attention. But some supporters of men’s athletics retort that the law has overreacted and constricted men’s opportunities for no reason other than to achieve numerical equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Important problems of gender inequity reach far beyond sporting venues. Many educational programs disregard the disproportionately low number of women in advanced math and science courses. And, as a case in this chapter reveals, gender stereotypes continue to play a role in how educational institutions perceive and steer students. They may subtly or explicitly convey the notion, for instance, that men should be doctors and women nurses, or men are best suited to be veterinarians while women are more suited to ancillary positions such as technicians, pet groomers, or dog walkers.</p>
<p class="indent">One response to the continuing prevalence of gender bias and inequality is to operate single-sex programs. But these programs themselves may be premised on gender stereotypes and thus legally suspect. In fact, several long-standing single-sex institutions have a history of explicitly excluding women under the</p>
<p><a id="page_344" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>344</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">premise that they are not fit for the particular educational opportunities the institution offers. This chapter develops the law and theory surrounding all of these practices, as well as other less obvious forms of gender discrimination, such as differential treatment based on pregnancy, parental status, sexual activity, and sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="indent">As a preliminary matter to any of their categories of inequality, one should first distinguish between the foundational concepts of gender and sex. The terms are often used interchangeably, but the concepts are distinct. “Sex” refers to a person’s physical attributes and biological or anatomical identity. “Gender,” on the other hand, refers to the characteristics and roles culturally defined and associated with “maleness” or “femaleness.” What is considered “masculine” or “feminine” is dictated by cultural norms, and thus, varies between and within different ethnic and racial groups, classes, and geographical regions. In other words, gender is a fluid concept that has little fixed meaning and necessarily depends on the characteristics that are socially attributed as being male, female, or neither. The distinction between sex and gender generally marks the line between policies that impermissibly discriminate and those that take legitimate differences between men and women into account.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, sex has been understood as a proxy for one’s gender, with the assumption being that biology defines one’s characteristics, roles within society, and sexual orientation. <i>See</i> Katherine Franke, <i>The Central Mistake of Sex Discrimination Law: The Disaggregation of Sex from Gender</i>, 144 <span class="smallcap">U. Pa. L. Rev.</span> 1, 40 (1995). Under the Western construction of this frame, men are supposed to be “aggressive” and women “passive”; men are the primary breadwinners, while women are primarily responsible for domestic activities; and men are sexually and emotionally attracted to women, and women to men. Although these roles and understandings of sex and gender vary depending on culture, stereotypes of what makes someone a man or woman have been largely defined in relation to one’s biological anatomy. The cases and laws in this chapter reflect a continual tension in distinguishing gender role stereotypes from scientific fact or biological attributes of sex. For instance, commentators and scientists continue to debate whether boys and girls learn differently and whether any such difference is biological or socially constructed.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, society and the law have also struggled with how to address sexual orientation. Individuals whose sexual orientation and/or gender identity differs from cultural expectations have tended to experience unfavorable treatment in schools. An individual whose biological sex is male but who exhibits behavior that culture labels as female might be bullied in school. The question in these instances is whether the student is receiving unequal treatment based on sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or behavior. If the unequal treatment is based on biological sex, few would question that it is prohibited discrimination, but the issue becomes more complex and contested as to the other bases.</p>
<p class="indent">As you read the cases in this chapter, resist the urge to filter the cases through your instincts of whether differential treatment of individuals makes sense as a practical matter and, instead, continually ask whether the differential treatment is justified by some immutable difference between men and women.</p>
<p><a id="page_345" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>345</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Consider whether the differences that we might perceive between men and women—even if real—are a result of individuals conforming to societal, familial, religious, and educational expectations or are a result of biological differences beyond the control of individuals. Also, consider whether the differences between men and women, regardless of the cause of those differences, are significant enough to justify differential treatment or whether differential treatment is justified primarily by ease and habit. Finally, scrutinize the courts’ analysis around these issues and whether the courts’ analyses treat some differences as immutable when in fact the differences are a product of society.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch126">B. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch127">1. <i>The Constitutional Standard: Evolution Toward Intermediate Scrutiny</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Gender classifications and discrimination have a long history in this country. The Supreme Court first considered gender discrimination in <i>Bradwell v. Illinois</i>, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 130 (1872). In <i>Bradwell</i>, the Court examined the state’s exclusion of women from the practice of law. The Court rejected the argument that practicing law was a “privilege” and suggested “that the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment opens to every citizen of the United States, male or female, black or white, married or single, the honorable professions as well as the servile employments of life; and that no citizen can be excluded from any one of them.” <i>Id.</i> at 137. The concurring opinion, however, argued that the state was justified in its prohibition, since “[t]he paramount destiny and mission of woman [<i>sic</i>] are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator. And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things, and cannot be based on exceptional cases [of a woman being qualified to practice law].” <i>Id.</i> at 141-142.</p>
<p class="indent">During the early twentieth century, legislatures began to adopt labor laws that restricted working hours for women, premised on the notion that women needed to be shielded from certain rigors in the workplace. In <i>Muller v. Oregon</i>, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), the state presented sociological evidence that sought to demonstrate the negative effects of long work hours and harsh working conditions on women. The Court was impressed by this evidence and rationale, writing:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">That woman’s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p><a id="page_346" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>346</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 421. Subsequent courts, likewise, embraced stereotypical gender roles under the guise of meaningful biological differences as a basis for upholding legislation that purported to protect women. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U.S. 59 (1912) (denying equal protection challenge to a law exempting laundries operated by two women or less from licensing fees, suggesting that the occupation was commonly recognized as “women’s work” and arguing that “the Fourteenth Amendment does not interfere by creating a fictitious equality where there is a real difference”).</p>
<p class="indent">These gender stereotypes were so prevalent and accepted that the Court did not even acknowledge the equal protection implications. Rather, the Court initially addressed them as commerce and police power issues. It was not until 1948 that the Supreme Court first evaluated the equal protection implications of gender classifications. Yet, the Court was still unwilling to break free of gender stereotypes and distinguish them from sex or biological differences. In <i>Goesart v. Clearly</i>, 355 U.S. 464 (1948), the Court upheld a statute that prohibited a woman from obtaining a bartender license unless she was the “wife or daughter of the male owner of a licensed liquor establishment.” The Court reasoned that</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[t]he Fourteenth Amendment did not tear history up by the roots, and the regulation of the liquor traffic is one of the oldest and most untrammeled of legislative powers. Michigan could, beyond question, forbid all women from working behind a bar. This is so despite the vast changes in the social and legal position of women. The fact that women may now have achieved the virtues that men have long claimed as their prerogatives and now indulge in vices that men have long practiced, does not preclude the States from drawing a sharp line between the sexes, certainly in such matters as the regulation of the liquor traffic. The Constitution does not require legislatures to reflect sociological insight, or shifting social standards, any more than it requires them to keep abreast of the latest scientific standards.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 465-466. The Court recognized that gender classifications are controlled by the Equal Protection Clause, but, in accordance with the jurisprudence at the time, only subjected the statute to rational basis review. One of the appellant’s arguments was that the distinction between women who were related to the bar owner and those who were not lacked a rational basis since the legislative concerns supporting the statute were equally applicable to women who were related to bar owners. The Court responded with great deference to the legislature, echoing the notion that women are inherently different and should be treated as such:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[T]he Constitution does not require situations “which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.” Since bartending by women may, in the allowable legislative judgment, give rise to moral and social problems against which it may devise preventive measures, the legislature need not go to the full length of prohibition if it believes that as to a defined group of females other factors are operating which either eliminate or reduce the moral and social problems otherwise calling for prohibition. Michigan evidently believes that the oversight assured through ownership of a bar by a barmaid’s husband or father minimizes hazards that may confront a barmaid without such protecting oversight. This Court is certainly not in a position to gainsay such belief by the Michigan legislature.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p><a id="page_347" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>347</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Tigner v. Texas</i>, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940)). Thus, the Court refused to scrutinize the judgment of the legislature, embracing the gender stereotypes prevalent at the time and disregarding the scientific and socioscientific research indicating the lack of support for such a distinction between men and women. <i>See also</i> Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57 (1961) (upholding a statute excluding women from jury service unless they have voluntarily registered because women are “the center of home and family life”).</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, in 1971, the Supreme Court began to scrutinize gender-based legislation in a more searching way in <i>Reed v. Reed</i>, 404 U.S. 71 (1971). There the Court evaluated a state intestate succession probate provision that gave preference to men as administrators of the estate (preferring sons over daughters, brothers over sisters, male kin over female kin, etc.). While the <i>Reed</i> Court continued to apply the rational basis level of scrutiny for gender classifications, the Court engaged in a far more searching inquiry and rejected the state’s argument that “men as a rule [are] more conversant with business affairs than…women.” <i>Id.</i> at 76. This was the first time that the Supreme Court invalidated a gender classification.</p>
<p class="indent">Two years later, a plurality of the Court supported an even more searching inquiry of gender classifications. In <i>Fronteiro v. Richardson</i>, 411 U.S. 677, 678 (1973), the plurality held that “classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin, are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny.” There, the plurality detailed the history of sex discrimination and gender stereotypes, and analogized gender discrimination to racial discrimination:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Traditionally, such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of “romantic paternalism” which, in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage.…As a result of notions such as these, our statute books gradually became laden with gross, stereotyped distinctions between the sexes and, indeed, throughout much of the 19th century the position of women in our society was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes. Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married women traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians of their own children.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 684-685. The <i>Fronteiro</i> plurality emphasized the immutability of sex, indicating that gender should be viewed as a “suspect class” since “what differentiates sex from such non-suspect statuses as intelligence…, and aligns it with the recognized suspect criteria, is that the sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.” <i>Id.</i> at 687. The concurring Justices, however, argued that the legislation at issue was unconstitutional under <i>Reed</i> and expressed reluctance to categorize gender as invoking the “strictest test of judicial scrutiny,” particularly given that Congress was in the midst of enacting a constitutional amendment that would have definitely resolved this issue. <i>Id.</i> at 691-692.</p>
<p class="indent">The constitutional amendment, although approved by Congress, failed in the states. The Court also subsequently retreated from the strict scrutiny standard asserted by the <i>Fronteiro</i> plurality. But the Court was unwilling to leave gender classifications to the deferential rational basis scrutiny standard. </p>
<p><a id="page_348" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>348</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Cf.</i> Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 506-507 (1975); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 14 (1975).</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Craig v. Boren</i>, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), the Court finally articulated the intermediate scrutiny standard that continues to apply today. The facts in <i>Craig</i> involved a statute that prohibited the sale of 3.2 percent alcohol beer to males between the ages of 18 and 21, but allowed the sale of the same beer to women of the same age. Reasoning that <i>Reed</i> and its progeny had applied a more rigorous scrutiny than rational basis and had found that certain governmental objectives were insufficient to justify gender-based classifications, the Court formalized a higher level of review for gender classifications. It held that “[c]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” <i>Id.</i> at 197.</p>
<p class="indent">Six years later in <i>Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan</i>, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), the Supreme Court addressed gender classifications in education under this new intermediate scrutiny standard. Mississippi operated an all-women’s college that denied males admission to its nursing program. The Court applied intermediate scrutiny, requiring that the classification serve important governmental objectives and that the means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives. The Court also scrutinized whether the objectives and justifications for the program reflected “archaic and stereotypical notions.” <i>Id.</i> at 725. The Court found that, in fact, the state lacked an “important objective” to justify its policy and its means were not “substantially related” to its ends in any event.</p>
<p class="indent">More recently, in <i>United States v. Virginia</i>, the Supreme Court reiterated that intermediate scrutiny as the constitutional standard for evaluating gender classifications, although some suggest its articulation of the standard was stronger than in <i>Hogan</i>. The Court summarized the relevant precedent and its application this way:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[T]he reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is “exceedingly persuasive.” The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State. The State must show “at least that the [challenged] classification serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.’” The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533-534 (1996).</p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What justifies applying intermediate scrutiny to gender classification while racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny? What justifies applying intermediate rather than rational basis scrutiny to gender classifications?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Intermediate scrutiny potentially presents problems with affirmative action based on gender. Why should gender-based affirmative action be subject to lower scrutiny than racial affirmative action?</p>
<p><a id="page_349" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>349</b></a></p>
<p class="h4" id="ch128">2. <i>Legislative Framework—Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972</i></p>
<p class="noindent">While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on gender in the area of employment, its education provisions apply only to race, religion, and national origin discrimination. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2 (2006). Women’s rights activists later pressured lawmakers to address gender discrimination in education, and, in 1967, President Johnson issued an executive order to include discrimination based on sex as one of the prohibited bases of discrimination by federal contractors. Exec. Order No. 11,246, 41 C.F.R. 60 (1965), as amended in 32 C.F.R. 14303 (1967). Women professors then used this provision to challenge discrimination at public universities (all of whom receive federal grants and contracts). Due to the high costs of these new class action suits against public universities and the federal government, Congress began to focus in the early 1970s on the issue of sex bias and discrimination in education. Congress held several hearings and, in 1971, introduced legislation.</p>
<p class="indent">While Congress generally agreed that sex discrimination in education should end, many members feared that attempts to address discrimination might go too far. In particular, members feared that a prohibition on gender discrimination would require specific quotas. This fear resulted in the attachment of a floor amendment to the legislation that specifically indicated that the legislation would not require quotas. 20 U.S.C. §1681(b) (2006). The bill finally passed the House and Senate and was signed by President Nixon as Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§1681 et seq., commonly referred to as Title IX.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What is exempted from coverage under Title IX? What is included? Do the exemptions indicate approval or disapproval for particular policies? Do such exemptions reflect notions of what is equality? Has Congress and the Department of Education avoided the most important and controversial issues?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Congress deliberately modeled Title IX on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal funds. The statutes both condition federal funding on a recipient’s promise not to discriminate. Because of this close connection between the statutes, courts use Title VI standards to interpret Title IX. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 694-698 (1979). Title IX’s various exemptions, however, are distinct and no analogous exemptions are found in Title VI.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Note that Title IX and its implementing regulations represent a floor for protections against discrimination rather than a ceiling. The Constitution may prohibit activities that Title IX would permit. For instance, VMI’s single-sex program would have been permissible under Title IX, but the Court struck it down under equal protection.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Pay close attention to §1681(b) (concerning quotas), 34 C.F.R. §106.21(b)(i)-(iii) (concerning preferences, ranking, and quotas), and 34 C.F.R. §106.21(2) (prohibition of criteria with disparate impacts). Do these provisions reflect the same concerns expressed in the section on race-based affirmative action? Are these concerns equally relevant to gender?</p>
<p class="indent">5. How does 34 C.F.R. §106.34 reflect notions of gender difference? Are such differences justified? Many argue that 34 C.F.R. §106.34(b) and 34 C.F.R. §106.34(c) permit a “separate but equal” system. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Gary J. Simson, <i>Separate but Equal and Single-Sex Schools</i>, 90 <span class="smallcap">Cornell L. Rev.</span> 443, 453 (2005). Do you agree? How do the regulations place limits and standards to determine whether separate is really equal?</p>
<p><a id="page_357" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>357</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">6. Title IX applies only to recipients of federal funds. In <i>Grove City College v. Bell</i>, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), the Supreme Court examined the language and legislative history of Title IX and held that any funds the government furnishes, either directly or indirectly, constitute government federal financial assistance. <i>Id.</i> at 568 n.18. Thus, the Court held that private institutions whose students receive federal financial aid (which eventually reaches the operating budget of the school) can be subject to the requirements of Title IX. <i>Id.</i> at 563-570. The Court, however, limited the application of Title IX to the particular program or department within the educational institution that receives the federal funds. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">In response to the <i>Grove City</i> holding, Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 to “restor[e] the prior, consistent and long-standing executive branch interpretation of broad, institution-wide application” of Title IX. Pub. L. No. 100-259, 1988 S. 557. Now, an entire educational institution is deemed a recipient of federal funds and thus subject to Title IX, even if only a subdivision of the school receives federal funds. As a practical matter, operating an institution of higher education without participating in a federal program is impossible because most students cannot afford to attend without the benefit of federal financial aid.</p>
<p class="indent">7. Federal administrative enforcement mechanisms, created by 20 U.S.C. §1682, ensure compliance with Title IX. The text of Title IX is silent as to whether a private cause of action exists to enforce the statute in court. The Supreme Court in <i>Cannon v. University of Chicago</i>, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), however, found that Congress intended to imply a private cause of action. <i>Id.</i> at 694-696. The Court subsequently held that Title IX also entitles a plaintiff to pursue a claim for monetary damages. Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992).</p>
<p class="indent">8. Title IX regulations exempt textbooks and curricular materials from the purview of Title IX. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. §106.42. The exemption was adopted as a result of First Amendment concerns and concerns about the scope of federal power to make curricular decisions. <i>See</i> Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs and Activities Receiving or Benefiting from Federal Financial Assistance, 40 Fed. Reg. 24135 (June 4, 1975). Are such concerns justified? Does the exemption leave significant gender discrimination untouched?</p>
<p class="indent">Various scholars have found that gender-based stereotypes and bias are prevalent in public school curriculum, textbooks, and practices. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class="smallcap">Equity in the Classroom: Toward Effective Pedagogy for Girls and Boys</span> (P.F. Murphy &amp; C.V. Gipps eds., 1996); Carol Amyx, <i>Sex Discrimination: The Textbook Case</i>, <span class="smallcap">62 Cal. L. Rev.</span> 1312, 1312-1314 (1974) (discussing extent of sex stereotyping in textbooks); Roger Clark et al., <i>Women of the World, Re-Write!

<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The following sections address the application of the constitutional and statutory standards to those specific contexts where gender-based disputes tend to arise in education law. But as a preface, it is important to recognize the general historical backdrop in which these disputes arise. Public institutions denied women access to school throughout the colonial era and during the nation’s early years. In the nineteenth century, women began to have access to coeducational primary schooling, but their education was largely limited to and focused on preparing to become wives and mothers. Secondary education was not an option. Not until the mid-nineteenth century did public entities establish high schools for women. Starting in the post-Reconstruction era and continuing into the beginning of the twentieth century, more and more secondary schools were established for women or became coeducational. But both the single-sex and coeducational schools were racially segregated. Thus, the experience of white and African American women differed significantly. Throughout the postwar period and continuing until <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), segregated schools for African American students were often coeducational due to limited resources and a lesser concern for the protection of black women’s sexuality.</p>
<p class="indent">The first major turning point for women came with the First and Second World Wars, which created a demand for skilled women in the workforce. This reality, combined with the growing recognition of the value of secondary education, led many states to include women in compulsory education statutes, provide single-sex institutions for women, and establish coeducational environments. These efforts expanded various educational opportunities for women, but not until the adoption of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 did the law prohibit discrimination in education admissions on the basis of gender.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch131">C. ADMISSIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">Admissions decisions necessarily entail the examination of several quantitative factors, including grade point averages (GPAs) and standardized test scores, but admissions decisions also often involve myriad subjective judgments based on essays, extracurricular work, academic writing, and students’ overall ability to be a “good fit” in the program. The prevalence of these subjective judgments, along with low admission rates in general, makes proving that an admissions denial was based on gender (and not some other factor) challenging. As the following case demonstrates, the determination of whether an applicant has</p>
<p><a id="page_359" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>359</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">been discriminated against in admissions on the basis of gender is a highly fact-specific inquiry requiring plaintiffs not only to prove prima facie gender discrimination, but also to refute defendant claims that the denial was for a permissible reason.</p>
<p class="indent">The idea of gender discrimination in admissions may seem curious to many because, unlike race where animus has been a serious historical problem, gender discrimination is not generally understood or perceived in terms of animus. Nonetheless, females have suffered from educational exclusion. Their exclusion arises from both explicit and implicit notions that women are not as well suited to certain careers or subjects as men. The following case reveals that ideas of this sort persist and affect the evaluation of women for admission to educational programs. As you read the following case, consider how prevalent gender bias might be in admissions programs and whether we have any reliable means to discover and remedy it.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch132">Tingley-Kelley v. Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>677 F. Supp. 2d 764 (E.D. Pa. 2010)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Admission to the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (“Penn Vet”) is extremely competitive. In 2007, Penn Vet’s acceptance rate of approximately 11% was equivalent to that of Penn’s Law School. In such a competitive process, it would seem that an applicant alleging that she was denied admission because of her gender would face a daunting task inasmuch as there are almost always applicants arguably more qualified and there are almost always legitimate reasons for favoring one well-qualified applicant over another. But when a plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination, the case must be left to a jury to decide. This is such a case.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff Kimberley Tingley-Kelley applied to Penn Vet six times from 2002 until 2007 and was rejected each time. Ms. Tingley-Kelley alleges that she was denied admission to Penn Vet because of her gender, in violation of Title IX.</p>
<p class="indent">Currently before the Court is Penn Vet’s Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I. Factual and Procedural History</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Penn Vet’s Admissions Process</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[D]uring the years in question, the Penn Vet admissions process is as follows. First, the Associate Dean for Admissions and the Associate Director for Admissions review all applications and, based on their experience and awareness of the objective characteristics of the previous year’s class, they eliminate what they consider the approximate bottom one-third from consideration.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the Admissions Committee [reviews] the remaining two-thirds of the applications to decide which applicants should be interviewed for possible admission. The Committee members review the objective factors in the applications, including college and, if applicable, graduate school attended, grade point</p>
<p><a id="page_360" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>360</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">average (GPA) and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, as well as the applicants’ veterinary and other animal-related experience, work history, personal statements, recommendations, and other miscellaneous factors. The Quantitative score on the GRE is generally more important than the Verbal score because it is considered an indicator of how an applicant will handle science courses. To make it easier for members of the Admissions Committee to compare applicants, Penn Vet adds the GRE percentiles together. With respect to GPA, the last 45 credit hours GPA, especially in science courses, is separately considered and can be a positive factor if applicants demonstrate improvement over their overall GPA.</p>
<p class="indent">As they review an application, Committee members make notes on an Applicant Review form, and recommend whether a candidate should be interviewed or not. Committee members look not only for high achievement, but also for distinguishing characteristics and experiences. Through this process approximately one-half of the remaining applications are rejected, and the other half, or approximately one-third of the original number, are selected for interviews.</p>
<p class="indent">On interview days, the applicants selected for interviews mingle with student members of the Admissions Committee, and interview with two faculty/alumni members of the Admissions Committee, one of whom has read the candidate’s application, and the other of whom has not seen the application itself. The interview is a critical factor in the admission decision. Following the day’s interviews, the Committee members meet to review the interviewees, discuss their recommendations, and vote on the candidates. Some are denied admission, some are accepted, and some are placed in a hold status for an “alternate” list.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s Background and Applications to Veterinary School</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Boston in 1989. Her overall GPA was 2.67. [She later took numerous classes at other schools, completed a Master’s degree at Temple University, and] her overall GPA had risen to 2.98.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley took the GRE examination in 2001 and again in 2005. In 2001, she scored 470 on the Verbal (the 51st percentile) and 600 on the Quantitative (the 46th percentile). In 2005, she scored 600 on the Verbal (84th percentile), and 570 on the Quantitative (39th percentile).</p>
<p class="indent">In total, Ms. Tingley-Kelley applied to Penn Vet six times, from 2002 to 2007. Penn Vet denied Ms. Tingley-Kelley admission without an interview four times (2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007), and twice denied her admission following an interview (2004 and 2006).</p>
<p class="indent">After being rejected [the first time], Ms. Tingley-Kelley elected to meet with Malcolm Keiter, Associate Dean of Admissions, for post-denial counseling. At this counseling session, Dean Keiter told her that it was possible that she would be admitted to Penn Vet, and that she should continue to strengthen her application by working towards completing a Master’s degree in biology at Temple University. Dean Keiter also told Ms. Tingley-Kelley that the Admissions Committee would not be as concerned about her GRE scores, given that the purpose</p>
<p><a id="page_361" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>361</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of the GRE is to predict graduate school success and she was already doing well in her graduate program. Dean Keiter also pointed out that her GRE scores were within the range that was acceptable for admission. Finally, Dean Keiter assured Ms. Tingley-Kelley that the Admissions Committee was not particularly interested in the coursework she completed more than a decade before applying to Penn Vet, but that the Committee would focus instead on her accomplishments since that time.</p>
<p class="indent">Following her 2002 application to Penn Vet, Ms. Tingley-Kelley continued her graduate work at Temple. After her application was rejected [the second time], Ms. Tingley-Kelley again met with Dean Keiter for post-denial counseling. During this counseling, Dean Keiter told Ms. Tingley-Kelley that she was “doing all the right things” and that in her next application, she should discuss her husband’s active duty status in the United States Air Force in order to explain why she had moved around so much.</p>
<p class="indent">By the time of her third application, for admission in the Fall of 2004, Ms. Tingley-Kelley had finished her M.S. in Biology at Temple with highest honors, had completed a successful oral defense of her thesis, and she had given birth to her daughter. Her graduate work at Temple consisted exclusively of science courses and her last 45 credit hours GPA was 3.73. Her graduate GPA was 3.705, raising her overall GPA to 3.05. When she applied, she heeded Dean Keiter’s advice and included information in her personal statement regarding her husband’s active duty status in the military.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley passed the first “cut” and two members of the Admissions Committee, Dr. Ben Martin and Dr. Adrian Morrison, reviewed her application. The reviewers recommended that she be interviewed.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley was subsequently interviewed by Dr. Lori Mann and Dr. Ben Martin. In answer to Dr. Martin’s questions regarding Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s experience in different states, she noted that her husband was on active duty in the United States Air Force. Dr. Martin commented that Ms. Tingley-Kelley had “a lot on her plate” and asked what she would do if her husband were suddenly deployed, and also asked how she would deal with the care of her daughter without her husband around. Dr. Mann questioned whether Ms. Tingley-Kelley could handle the rigors of the program given Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s personal situation with a child and a husband on active duty in the military. Dr. Mann and Dr. Martin made notations on their Applicant Review forms regarding Tingley-Kelley’s family situation as a mother with young children and a husband on active duty in the Air Force. They each recommended that Ms. Tingley-Kelley be denied admission, and the Admissions Committee agreed.</p>
<p class="indent">After her interview ended, on the advice of Dr. Mann and Dr. Martin, Ms. Tingley-Kelley spoke with some of the student representatives on the Admissions Committee regarding the program. One student told Ms. Tingley-Kelley that Penn Vet “probably would not waste a spot on a woman who has a baby and a husband on active duty.”</p>
<p class="indent">After Ms. Tingley-Kelley was rejected in 2004, she attended post-denial counseling with Dean Keiter, who encouraged her to reapply the following year, and suggested that she get more small animal experience to “show continued interest.”</p>
<p><a id="page_362" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>362</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley applied for a fourth time for the Fall 2005 academic year. When it became apparent that she had not been selected for an interview, Ms. Tingley-Kelley emailed Dean Keiter to inquire about the status of her application. He responded that the Admissions Committee wanted to know what she had done to improve her previous application. She informed Dean Keiter that her research was recently published in a major scientific journal, that she had been teaching basic science courses, had taken a class, had given birth to a son, and had been on maternity leave. Two weeks later, she received a rejection letter from Penn Vet.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley again attended post-denial counseling with Dean Keiter. Frustrated, Ms. Tingley-Kelley asked Dean Keiter whether she was wasting her time in applying to Penn Vet. Dean Keiter told her that she was “absolutely not wasting time” in continuing to apply to Penn Vet, that she was more than competitive, and that having been granted an interview previously, she would be in the “very competitive” category. Dean Keiter explained that she had been rejected because the Admissions Committee was unclear as to what she had done to improve her previous application. Dean Keiter suggested that Ms. Tingley-Kelley write “stay at home” mother in the occupation section of the application in order to explain why she had been unable to gain more veterinary experience. He also suggested that she explain her marital and parental status in her personal statement so that the Admissions Committee would know “what she has been up to.”</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley re-applied in 2006. In her application, she included “stay at home mother” on her application, and discussed her martial and parental status in her personal statement. This time, she was granted an interview.</p>
<p class="indent">While she was waiting for her interview, she spoke with another nontraditional student, a lawyer, who was changing careers. This applicant had applied and been rejected the previous year, but was encouraged by Dean Keiter, in a personal note and by telephone, to reapply. She asked this applicant what Dean Keiter had suggested he do to “show continued interest” in the field of veterinary medicine, to which he replied, “Nothing. I went back and practiced law and paid some bills.” She then asked him how much animal experience he had to obtain, and he replied that he worked for a “couple of buddies who were vets, but mostly ended up giving them legal advice.”</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s application was reviewed by Dr. Jill Beech and Dr. Ben Martin. On her Applicant Review form, Dr. Beech noted Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s age, 38, that “she would be at school w/2 young children,” and that she had “concerns about how she’ll do in school esp. w/family, etc.” Dr. Martin wrote that it “will be a tough row to hoe,” and that it was “time to fish or cut bait.” Nevertheless, they both recommended that Ms. Tingley-Kelley be interviewed.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley was interviewed by Dr. Gary Althouse and Dr. Colin Harvey. During this interview, questions regarding Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s background and her husband’s military career were discussed. Dr. Harvey asked why Ms. Tingley-Kelley did not move back to Boston, where she would have more family support. Ms. Tingley-Kelley responded that she did not believe her personal situation should be a factor considered in the admissions decision. Dr. Althouse asked what Ms. Tingley-Kelley had done in the past</p>
<p><a id="page_363" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>363</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">year to improve her application, to which she replied that she had taken Calculus and received an “A,” had volunteered at a small animal veterinary hospital, and continued to teach basic science labs at Temple University.</p>
<p class="indent">Her application was rejected a week after this interview. Following this denial of her application, she wrote a letter requesting reconsideration because of the alleged discriminatory treatment she received during her interview. Her request for reconsideration was denied.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley applied for the sixth and final time for admission in the Fall of 2007. Her application was rejected without an interview and she did not attend post-denial counseling. The only change in her 2007 application from 2006 was some additional teaching experience.</p>
<p class="indent">In June 2006, Dean Keiter was quoted in an article published in <i>The Hartford Courant</i> entitled, “At Vet Schools, Women Dominate.” Dean Keiter stated that if he were given equal male and female applicants, Penn Vet “would probably take the man because they are so hard to get.” In the same interview, Dean Keiter stated that “men have a lot of options instead of college. Women don’t. They have to go to college to get anywhere.” He also stated that “by the time [women] graduate and get through an internship, it’s time to have children.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III. Discussion</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Title IX Gender Discrimination</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley proceeds under two theories of gender discrimination. First, she claims that she was discriminated against simply because of her gender. Second, she claims that she was discriminated against as a woman who has young children and a husband in the military. Her second theory of discrimination has been labeled “sex-plus” discrimination, which is discrimination based on sex plus another characteristic.</p>
<p class="indent">“Sex-plus” discrimination cases were first identified by the Supreme Court in <i>Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp.,</i> 400 U.S. 542, 544 (1971), where the Court held that Title VII does not permit an employer to have “one hiring policy for women and another for men—each having pre-school-age children.” At root, however, “sex-plus” discrimination is simply a form of gender discrimination. The relevant inquiry under either theory is whether the plaintiff presents evidence of sex discrimination sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>i. Applicable Legal Framework</i></p>
<p class="indent">Title IX prohibits educational institutions from engaging in sex discrimination in admissions. To establish a claim under Title IX, a plaintiff must show that (1) she was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in an educational program; (2) that the program receives federal financial assistance; and (3) that her exclusion was on the basis of her gender.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, it is undisputed that Penn Vet denied admission to Ms. Tingley-Kelley and that Penn Vet receives federal financial assistance. The disputed issue is whether Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s exclusion from Penn Vet was because of her gender.</p>
<p><a id="page_364" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>364</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Title IX does not provide an analytical framework for the evaluation of gender discrimination claims. As a result, in analyzing whether a plaintiff has presented evidence under Title IX sufficient to survive summary judgment, courts understandably often look to employment discrimination jurisprudence under Title VII. Indeed, the Court finds Title VII jurisprudence to be particularly instructive in this case because Title IX law regarding discrimination in admissions is not well-developed.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note15" id="Rnote15" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the Title VII context, disparate treatment claims fall into two categories, depending on whether there is direct evidence of discrimination, or whether the evidence of discrimination is circumstantial. Where there is direct evidence of discrimination, courts apply the “mixed motives” test set forth in <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</i>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989). Where there is circumstantial evidence of discrimination, courts apply the burden shifting framework developed in <i>McDonnell Douglas v. Green</i>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley purports to have both direct and circumstantial evidence of gender discrimination.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>ii. Direct Evidence of Discrimination</i></p>
<p class="indent">As noted, when a plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination, the case is appropriately analyzed under the “mixed motives” analysis established by the Supreme Court in <i>Price Waterhouse</i>. Under the modified <i>Price Waterhouse</i> standard, a defendant is liable for discrimination upon proof that a forbidden criterion “was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.” 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(m). Once a plaintiff shows that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether discrimination was a motivating factor for an employment practice, the burden of production and persuasion shift to the defendant, and summary judgment should ordinarily be denied.</p>
<p class="indent">A plaintiff attempting to prove discrimination with direct evidence faces a “high hurdle.” The direct evidence must demonstrate that the “decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.” Derogatory comments or stray remarks in the workplace that are unrelated to employment decisions, even when uttered by decision makers, do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley presents direct evidence that Admissions Committee members at Penn Vet considered her status as a mother with young children and a husband in the Air Force in their decision to reject her applications in 2004 and 2006. The notes on Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s Application Review forms reflect ostensible concerns Admissions Committee members had about whether she could handle the rigors of Penn Vet’s academic program, given her childcare responsibilities. For example, in 2006, Dr. Beech noted on her review form for Ms. Tingley-Kelley that Dr. Beech had “concerns about how she’ll do in school esp. w/family, etc.” and that Ms. Tingley-Kelley “would be at school w/2 young</p>
<p><a id="page_365" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>365</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">children.”<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note16" id="Rnote16" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></sup> That same year, Dr. Martin wrote that it “will be a tough row to hoe,” a comment that could be reasonably construed, in the context of the other evidence in this case, as referring to the difficulty Ms. Tingley-Kelley would have in juggling school and family.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Tingley-Kelley testified that her childcare responsibilities were discussed at length during each of her admission interviews. One interviewer allegedly asked why Ms. Tingley-Kelley did not move back to Boston, where she would have more family support. Another questioned whether she was prepared to handle the rigors of the program and care for her daughter if her husband were suddenly deployed.</p>
<p class="indent">In total, the notes on her Application Review forms and the comments and questions during her interviews, viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Tingley-Kelley, could demonstrate that Admissions Committee members discriminated against her on the basis of her gender by stereotyping her as a busy mother of young children who would have a difficult time handling both graduate school and her childcare responsibilities.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellate courts in other jurisdictions have found such stereotypical comments about women as caregivers to be sufficient to overcome summary judgment even without evidence that the plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated males. For example, in <i>Chadwick</i>, the plaintiff brought a “sex-plus” discrimination claim against her employer, alleging that she did not receive a promotion because of a sex-based stereotype that women who are mothers, particularly of young children, neglect their jobs in favor of their presumed childcare responsibilities. At the time she was denied the promotion, the plaintiff in <i>Chadwick</i> was a mother of an 11-year-old son and six-year-old triplets. In considering whether plaintiff had presented enough evidence to permit a finding of discrimination, the court adopted a “case by case” analysis, rather than the strict “mixed motive” or <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework, and held that, “[g]iven what we know about societal stereotypes regarding working women with children,” stereotypical comments directed toward plaintiff regarding working women with children could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that sex discrimination was behind her employer’s decision not to promote her. One comment the court found particularly revealing was plaintiff’s supervisor’s explanation as to why plaintiff did not get the promotion: “It was nothing you did or didn’t do. It was just that you’re going to school, you have the kids and you just have a lot on your plate right now.”</p>
<p class="indent">The comments in Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s case—i.e. “concerns about how she’ll do in school esp. w/family, etc.” and it “will be a tough row to hoe”—are strikingly similar to those found in <i>Chadwick</i> to be evidence of impermissible, sex-based stereotyping. In fact, Dr. Martin’s comment that Ms. Tingley-Kelley had “a lot on her plate” is the exact same comment the court in <i>Chadwick</i> found so troubling as perpetuating the stereotype that women with children may not</p>
<p><a id="page_366" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>366</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">be able to juggle their professional and childcare responsibilities. Finding <i>Chadwick</i> persuasive, this Court holds that such stereotyping, without evidence of how similarly situated male applicants were treated by Penn Vet, is sufficient evidence to support an inference of gender discrimination. After all, the ultimate issue in any discrimination case is whether the plaintiff, <i>as an individual</i>, was discriminated against. When there is direct evidence of discrimination, comparative evidence, while relevant, is not necessary.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note17" id="Rnote17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In addition, contrary to Penn Vet’s contention, the notes and comments in this case, arguably were more than general statements about family responsibilities or stray remarks unrelated to the decision to deny Ms. Tingley-Kelley admission. The notes on Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s Applicant Review forms were made by members of the Admissions Committee in the course of admissions interviews and these forms were presumably reviewed by the entire Committee before Ms. Tingley-Kelley was denied admission. The comments and questions during Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s interviews in 2004 and 2006 were made by members of the Admissions Committee on the <i>same day</i> as the respective decisions to deny Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s applications. Based on these comments and questions, and their timing, a jury could infer that the decision to deny her admission was motivated by impermissible, sex-based factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Penn Vet argues that it would have reached the same decision denying Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s applications absent any discrimination because she was not objectively qualified to gain admission. However, as Penn Vet has acknowledged, Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s GRE scores and GPA fell within the range of scores for applicants who were ultimately accepted in each of the years she applied. During the years in question, applicants accepted had [both Verbal GRE scores and Quantitative GRE score] lower than Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s scores. Therefore, it cannot be convincingly argued that Penn Vet did not discriminate against Ms. Tingley-Kelley because <i>no one</i> with objectively less compelling academic credentials was admitted.</p>
<p class="indent">Because this case involves direct evidence that may amount to discrimination, Penn Vet’s evidence that Ms. Tingley-Kelley was less qualified than other applicants does not shift the burden to Ms. Tingley-Kelley to present evidence of pretext under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. Here, involving direct evidence of discrimination, Penn Vet’s comparative evidence shows that there will be a jury issue as to whether, if a jury finds that gender discrimination was a factor in the denials of Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s applications, Penn Vet has met its burden of proving that it would have denied her applications under any extant circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, Ms. Tingley-Kelley has demonstrated that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her status as a mother of two young children and wife of an active Air Force serviceman was a motivating factor in the rejection of her applications for admission. Although Penn Vet offers evidence, including</p>
<p><a id="page_367" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>367</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">significant evidence that a jury could ultimately find quite convincing, that Ms. Tingley-Kelley would have been denied admission without regard to her parental or marital status, a reasonable jury may otherwise find that gender was a motivating factor in denying her admission. Accordingly, Penn Vet’s Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Are the questions asked of Tingley-Kelley legitimate questions related to her potential for success in the program?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Tingley-Kelley argued gender discrimination on the basis of two theories: that she was discriminated because of her gender and that she experienced “sex-plus” discrimination. Sex-plus discrimination means that a person is subjected to disparate treatment based not solely on one’s sex, but rather on one’s sex when “considered in conjunction with a second characteristic.” Fisher v. Vassar Coll., 70 F.3d 1420, 1433 (2d Cir. 1995). The most common examples of sex-plus discrimination are marital status, childbearing ability, or status as a mother. <i>See</i> Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971) (finding discrimination when business has different hiring policies for women and men with young children).</p>
<p class="indent">3. What is the difference between “direct evidence of discrimination” and “circumstantial evidence of discrimination”? In the absence of direct evidence, Tingley-Kelley may have had a difficult time making a circumstantial claim of discrimination given that her test scores were lower than most admitted students.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Penn Vet argued that Tingley-Kelley was rejected because she was not objectively qualified for the program, an argument the court rejected because others were admitted with lower test scores and the direct evidence of discrimination in the admissions committee’s comments and notes. Considering that admissions decisions often entail subjective and qualitative evaluations, what evidence would one need to refute the claim of a lack of objective qualifications when there are no discriminatory notes? What burden would Tingley-Kelley need to overcome if her test scores were on the lower range of the scores of the applicants admitted? Given the difficulty in obtaining this type of evidence, few cases like Tingley-Kelley’s are brought.</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch134">D. SINGLE-SEX EDUCATION</p>
<p class="noindent">Single-sex schools and programs by their very nature exclude individuals based on gender. Over the past few decades, the constitutional and statutory validity of single-sex programs have been subject to intense debate. Recognizing both the long history of single-sex education and gender stereotypes that deprive women of access to education, courts have struggled to determine whether single-sex programs are discriminatory or alleged gender differences in learning styles are “real.”</p>
<p class="indent">One of the early important cases evaluating the legality of single-sex education was <i>Vorchheimer v. School District of Philadelphia</i>, 532 F.2d 880 (3d Cir. 1976), <i>aff’d</i>, 430 U.S. 703 (1977) (per curiam), where the Philadelphia public school system operated, along with its various coeducational schools, a public high school for women and a public high school for men. The plaintiff argued that the all-women school was inferior to the all-men school and thus deprived females of equal access in violation of Title IX. The Third Circuit noted that, although in some instances Title IX would prohibit single-sex education, the Act explicitly exempted single-sex schools from the prohibitions set forth in 20 U.S.C. §1681(a)(1)-(5). The court then examined the constitutionality of single-sex education. It first reasoned that the school district’s single-sex schools did not result in differential treatment or unequal opportunity because enrollment in the single-sex schools was voluntary and coed schools were available. Thus, applying rational basis review based on <i>Reed v. Reed</i>, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), the court found that the record contained “sufficient evidence to establish that a legitimate educational policy may be served by utilizing single-sex high schools.” <i>Id.</i> at 888.</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent criticized the majority opinion as employing the same “separate but equal” analysis as <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, which <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> later rejected, and argued that the legislative history indicated that Congress intended to prohibit “dual educational systems.” <i>Id.</i> at 889-894 (Gibbons, J., dissenting). The dissent further emphasized that the evidence did not establish that separate</p>
<p><a id="page_369" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>369</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">but equal education was substantially related to producing educational benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 896 (Gibbons, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="indent">The perception that the all-boys and all-girls schools were “comparable in quality, academic standing, and prestige” was essential to the majority opinion in <i>Vorchheimer</i>. The court recognized that the science facilities at Central high school were “superior” compared to the facilities at the all-girls school, but the court nonetheless held that the schools were equal. <i>Id.</i> at 882. Two years later, however, a Pennsylvania state court found significant differences that made the all-male school superior to the all-female school and ordered the admission of women into Central High. Newberg v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., 26 Pa. D. &amp; C. 3d 682 (Ct. Comm. Pl. Phila. Cnty. 1983), <i>appeal quashed</i>, 478 A.2d 1352 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984).</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Vorchheimer</i> sparked significant debate as to whether separate can ever be equal in single-sex education. Many commentators argued that the <i>Vorchheimer</i> majority’s theory of equal benefits was a revival of the doctrine of “separate but equal” from the <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> decision. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Robert N. Davis, <i>Diversity: The Emerging Modern Separate but Equal Doctrine</i>, 1 <span class="smallcap">Wm. &amp; Mary J. Women &amp; L.</span> 11, 29-49 (1994); Nancy Levit, <i>Embracing Segregation: The Jurisprudence of Choice and Diversity in Race and Sex Separatism in Schools</i>, 2005 <span class="smallcap">U. Ill. L. Rev.</span> 455 (2005); Kathleen M. Sullivan, <i>Sins of Discrimination: Last Term’s Affirmative Action Cases,</i> 100 <span class="smallcap">Harv. L. Rev.</span> 78 (1986); Cass R. Sunstein, <i>Three Civil Rights Fallacies,</i> 79 <span class="smallcap">Cal. L. Rev.</span> 751 (1991). Others also emphasized that much of the initial growth in single-sex education came in response to call for the racial desegregation of schools and the fear that desegregation could lead to interracial marriage. <i>See generally</i> Serena Mayeri, <i>The Strange Career of Jane Crow: Sex Segregation and the Transformation of Anti-Discrimination Discourse</i>, 18 <span class="smallcap">Yale J.L. &amp; Human</span>. 187 (2006). In the years following <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, many states and school districts in the South, anticipating the end of Jim Crow, passed laws to authorize sex segregation in public schools, which courts upheld. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 196, 209.</p>
<p class="indent">It was not until 1982 in <i>Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan</i>, however, that the Supreme Court took up the issue of single-sex education. In the intervening years, the Court had decided <i>Fronteiro v. Richardson</i>, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), in which the plurality indicated that “classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national origin, are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny.” <i>Id.</i> at 688. While not bound by the plurality’s position, the Court in <i>Hogan</i> was poised to evaluate single-sex education with more skepticism than previous courts. Ironically, <i>Hogan</i> was also factually distinct from previous challenges in that this time the complaining party was a male seeking admission to an all-female nursing program. As you read the case, pay close attention to the competing equal protection arguments and the important governmental objectives alleged. Is the state actually acting for the benefit or detriment of women? Are men disadvantaged in any meaningful way? Is this program just an example of a historical artifact that society has been slow to remove, or does it serve important purposes that we should not quickly dismiss?</p>
<p><a id="page_370" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>370</b></a></p>
<p class="h5" id="ch135">Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>458 U.S. 718 (1982)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice O’Connor</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">In 1884, the Mississippi Legislature created the Mississippi Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Mississippi. The school, known today as Mississippi University for Women (MUW), has from its inception limited its enrollment to women. In 1971, MUW established a School of Nursing, initially offering a 2-year associate degree. Three years later, the school instituted a 4-year baccalaureate program in nursing, and today also offers a graduate program.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondent, Joe Hogan, applied for admission to the MUW School of Nursing’s baccalaureate program. Although he was otherwise qualified, he was denied admission because of his sex. School officials informed him that he could audit the courses in which he was interested, but could not enroll for credit.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">We begin our analysis aided by several firmly established principles. Our decisions establish that the party seeking to uphold a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their gender must carry the burden of showing an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” <i>Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney</i>, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979). The burden is met only by showing at least that the classification serves “important governmental objectives, and that the discriminatory means employed” are “substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” <i>Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980).</p>
<p class="indent">Although the test for determining the validity of a gender-based classification is straightforward, it must be applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females. Care must be taken in ascertaining whether the statutory objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions. Thus, if the statutory objective is to exclude or “protect” members of one gender because they are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.</p>
<p class="indent">If the State’s objective is legitimate and important, we next determine whether the requisite direct, substantial relationship between objective and means is present. The purpose of requiring that close relationship is to assure that the validity of a classification is determined through reasoned analysis, rather than through the mechanical application of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions about the proper roles of men and women.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The State’s primary justification for maintaining the single-sex admissions policy of MUW’s School of Nursing is that it compensates for discrimination</p>
<p><a id="page_371" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>371</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">against women, and therefore constitutes educational affirmative action. As applied to the School of Nursing, we find the State’s argument unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="indent">In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened. However, we consistently have emphasized that the mere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.</p>
<p class="indent">It is readily apparent that a State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification. Mississippi has made no showing that women lacked opportunities to obtain training in the field of nursing when the MUW School of Nursing opened its door, or that women currently are deprived of such opportunities. In fact, in 1970, the year before the School of Nursing’s first class enrolled, women earned 94 percent of the nursing baccalaureate degrees conferred in Mississippi and 98.6 percent of the degrees earned nationwide. When MUW’s School of Nursing began operation, nearly 98 percent of all employed registered nurses were female.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than compensate for discriminatory barriers faced by women, MUW’s policy of excluding males from admission to the School of Nursing tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman’s job. By assuring that Mississippi allots more openings in its state-supported nursing schools to women than it does to men, MUW’s admissions policy lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, we conclude that, although the State recited a “benign, compensatory purpose,” it failed to establish that the alleged objective is the actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification.</p>
<p class="indent">The policy is invalid also because the State has made no showing that the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to its proposed compensatory objective. To the contrary, MUW’s policy of permitting men to attend classes as auditors fatally undermines its claim that women, at least those in the School of Nursing, are adversely affected by the presence of men. The uncontroverted record reveals that admitting men to nursing classes does not affect teaching style, that the presence of men in the classroom would not affect the performance of the female nursing students, and that men in coeducational nursing schools do not dominate the classroom. In sum, the record in this case is flatly inconsistent with the claim that excluding men from the School of Nursing is necessary to reach any of MUW’s educational goals.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, considering both the asserted interest and the relationship between the interest and the methods used by the State, we conclude that the State has fallen far short of establishing the “exceedingly persuasive justification” needed to sustain the gender-based classification. Accordingly, we hold that MUW’s policy of denying males the right to enroll for credit in its School of Nursing violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Powell</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Rehnquist</span> joins, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">[R]espondent [is not] significantly disadvantaged by MUW’s all-female tradition. His constitutional complaint is based upon a single asserted harm: that he must travel to attend the state-supported nursing schools that concededly are available to him. [T]here is, of course, no constitutional right to attend a state-supported university in one’s home town. Thus the Court, to redress respondent’s injury of inconvenience, must rest its invalidation of MUW’s single-sex program on a mode of “sexual stereotype” reasoning that has no application whatever to the respondent or to the “wrong” of which he complains.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he Court errs seriously by assuming—without argument or discussion—that the equal protection standard generally applicable to sex discrimination is appropriate here. That standard was designed to free women from “archaic and overbroad generalizations.” In no previous case have we applied it to invalidate state efforts to expand women’s choices. [T]he contrary, the Court suggests that the MUW is so operated as to “perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively women’s job.” But as the Court itself acknowledges…, [the] School of Nursing makes up only one part—a relatively small part—of MUW’s diverse modern university campus and curriculum. The other departments on the MUW campus offer a typical range of degrees and a typical range of subjects. There is no indication that women suffer fewer opportunities at other Mississippi state campuses because of MUW’s admission policy.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the practice of voluntarily chosen single-sex education is an honored tradition in our country, even if it now rarely exists in state colleges and universities. Mississippi’s accommodation of such student choices is legitimate because it is completely consensual, and is important because it permits students to decide for themselves the type of college education they think will benefit them most.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What is the test to evaluate gender classifications announced in <i>Hogan</i>? What considerations does the Court emphasize must be used in application of this test?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What is the state’s stated purpose for limiting this nursing program to women? What is the Court’s appraisal of the state’s purpose? Without question, the program expands nursing opportunities for women. Is the Court’s rejection of the state’s purpose dependent on its factual assertion that the school stereotypes women as suited primarily for nursing? Do you agree?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What relevance, if any, should the personal preferences of women or men to attend single-sex schools have on the constitutionality of those schools? Does it matter whether their preferences are influenced by personal and/or social biases?</p>
<p class="indent">4. To what extent is discrimination against men in education an actual problem requiring redress? Should it matter who is being disadvantaged on the basis of sex? Do you find it curious that the Court chose this case to address the constitutional issues relating to single-sex education?</p>

<p class="indent">During the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a growing concern over how schools “shortchange boys.” <i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class="smallcap">William Pollack, Real Boys: Protecting Our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood</span> (1998); <span class="smallcap">Christina Hoff Sommers, The War Against Boys</span> (2000). As one researcher has noted:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">In fact, American boys are scoring higher and achieving more than they ever have before. But girls have just improved their performance on some measures even faster. As a result, girls have narrowed or even closed some academic gaps that previously favored boys, while other long-standing gaps that favored girls have widened, leading to the belief that boys are falling behind. There’s no doubt that some boys—particularly Hispanic and black boys and boys from low-income homes—are in real trouble. But the predominant issues for them are race and class, not gender. Closing racial and economic gaps would help poor and minority boys more than closing gender gaps, and focusing on gender gaps may distract attention from the bigger problems facing these youngsters.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sara Mead, <i>The Truth About Boys and Girls, in</i> <span class="smallcap">The Evidence Suggests Otherwise</span> 3 (2006). Under what, if any, circumstances might the state be justified in attempting to remedy boys’ lower academic achievement? What means and programs would be appropriate? In a competitive admissions context, would it be permissible to give males a “plus-factor” similar to the use of race as a plus-factor to ensure more equitable gender enrollment?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The Court in <i>Hogan</i> intimated that a single-sex education program with an “exceedingly persuasive” objective of remedying past inequality could be constitutionally permissible if the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to a compensatory objective, but stressed that (1) the nursing program at question had no compensatory objective since women were already overrepresented in nursing programs, (2) the exclusion of men was not substantially and directly related to the alleged objective, and (3) the program would not be materially changed if men were admitted. In this next case, the Supreme Court takes up the questions of what sorts of justifications are “exceedingly persuasive,” whether single-sex education is unconstitutional if the allowing admission of the excluded gender materially changes the educational program, and what sort of exclusions would be considered substantially and directly related to an asserted justification.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch136">United States v. Virginia (VMI)</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>518 U.S. 515 (1996)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Ginsburg</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">Virginia’s public institutions of higher learning include an incomparable military college, Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The United States maintains that the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee precludes Virginia from reserving exclusively to men the unique educational opportunities VMI affords. We agree.</p>
<p><a id="page_374" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>374</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Founded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex school among Virginia’s 15 public institutions of higher learning. VMI’s distinctive mission is to produce “citizen-soldiers,” men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in military service. VMI pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia. Assigning prime place to character development, VMI uses an “adversative method” modeled on English public schools and once characteristic of military instruction. VMI constantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. The school’s graduates leave VMI with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress, and a large sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p class="indent">VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, Members of Congress, and business executives. The school’s alumni overwhelmingly perceive that their VMI training helped them to realize their personal goals. VMI’s endowment reflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largest per-student endowment of all undergraduate institutions in the Nation.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers nor VMI’s implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. And the school’s impressive record in producing leaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nevertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively for men the advantages and opportunities a VMI education affords.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">[VMI’s historical mission is “‘to produce educated and honorable men, prepared for the varied work of civil life, imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready as citizen-soldiers to defend their country in time of national peril.’”]</p>
<p class="indent">VMI produces its “citizen-soldiers” through “an adversative, or doubting, model of education” which features “[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality of treatment, absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values.” As one Commandant of Cadets described it, the adversative method “‘dissects the young student,’” and makes him aware of his “‘limits and capabilities,’” so that he knows “‘how far he can go with his anger,…how much he can take under stress,…exactly what he can do when he is physically exhausted.’”</p>
<p class="indent">VMI cadets live in spartan barracks where surveillance is constant and privacy nonexistent; they wear uniforms, eat together in the mess hall, and regularly participate in drills. Entering students are incessantly exposed to the rat line, “an extreme form of the adversative model,” comparable in intensity to Marine Corps boot camp. Tormenting and punishing, the rat line bonds new cadets to their fellow sufferers and, when they have completed the 7-month experience, to their former tormentors.</p>
<p class="indent">VMI attracts some applicants because of its reputation as an extraordinarily challenging military school, and “because its alumni are exceptionally close to</p>
<p><a id="page_375" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>375</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the school.” “[W]omen have no opportunity anywhere to gain the benefits of [the system of education at VMI].”</p>
<p class="indent">In 1990, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and VMI, alleging that VMI’s exclusively male admission policy violated the Equal Protection Clause. In the two years preceding the lawsuit, VMI had received inquiries from 347 women, but had responded to none of them. “[S]ome women, at least,” the [district] court said, “would want to attend the school if they had the opportunity.” The court further recognized that, with recruitment, VMI could “achieve at least 10% female enrollment”—“a sufficient ‘critical mass’ to provide the female cadets with a positive educational experience.” And it was also established that “some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets.” In addition, experts agreed that if VMI admitted women, “the VMI ROTC experience would become a better training program from the perspective of the armed forces, because it would provide training in dealing with a mixed-gender army.”</p>
<p class="indent">The District Court ruled in favor of VMI, however, and rejected the equal protection challenge. [The] District Court reasoned that education in “a single-gender environment, be it male or female,” yields substantial benefits. [The court acknowledged that women are excluded from those benefits, but “‘some aspects of the [school’s] distinctive method would be altered’ if women were admitted.” The Fourth Circuit, however, held that the state must provide women a remedy, but could do so by admitting women to VMI, establishing a parallel institution or program for women, or converting the school to a private institution.]</p>
<p class="indent">In response to the Fourth Circuit’s ruling, Virginia proposed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women’s Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsored undergraduate program would be located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal arts school for women, and would be open, initially, to about 25 to 30 students. Although VWIL would share VMI’s mission—to produce “citizen-soldiers”—the VWIL program would differ from VMI in academic offerings, methods of education, and financial resources.</p>
<p class="indent">The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary Baldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMI freshmen. Mary Baldwin’s faculty holds “significantly fewer Ph.D.’s than the faculty at VMI,” and receives significantly lower salaries. While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, the sciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial, offered only bachelor of arts degrees. A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one, without public support, by attending Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two years, paying the required private tuition.</p>
<p class="indent">[A “Task Force” designed the VWIL program.] Training its attention on methods of instruction appropriate for “most women,” the Task Force determined that a military model would be “wholly inappropriate” for VWIL.</p>
<p class="indent">VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs and a newly established, “largely ceremonial” Virginia Corps of Cadets, but the VWIL House would not have a military format and VWIL would not require its students to eat meals together or to wear uniforms during the school day. In lieu of VMI’s adversative method, the VWIL Task Force favored “a cooperative method which</p>
<p><a id="page_376" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>376</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">reinforces self-esteem.” In addition to the standard bachelor of arts program offered at Mary Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete an off-campus leadership externship, participate in community service projects, and assist in arranging a speaker series.</p>
<p class="indent">Virginia returned to the District Court seeking approval of its proposed remedial plan, and the court decided the plan met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. [While “some women…may prefer the VMI methodology to the VWIL methodology,” the constitution does “not require the Commonwealth to provide a mirror image VMI for women.” A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court.]</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for that action. Today’s skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights or opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history. As a plurality of this Court acknowledged a generation ago, “our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.” Through a century plus three decades and more of that history, women did not count among voters composing “We the People”; not until 1920 did women gain a constitutional right to the franchise. And for a half century thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women opportunities accorded men so long as any “basis in reason” could be conceived for the discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1971, for the first time in our Nation’s history, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who complained that her State had denied her the equal protection of its laws. Since <i>Reed</i>, the Court has repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor state government acts compatibly with the equal protection principle when a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities. Without equating gender classifications, for all purposes, to classifications based on race or national origin, the Court, in post-<i>Reed</i> decisions, has carefully inspected official action that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to men).</p>
<p class="indent">To summarize the Court’s current directions for cases of official classification based on gender: Focusing on the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must determine whether the proffered justification is “exceedingly persuasive.” The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State. The State must show “at least that the [challenged] classification serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.’” The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented <i>post hoc</i> in response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.</p>
<p class="indent">The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed “inherent differences” are no longer</p>
<p><a id="page_377" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>377</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">accepted as a ground for race or national origin classifications. Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: “[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of both.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Inherent differences” between men and women, we have come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s opportunity. Sex classifications may be used to compensate women “for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered,” to “promot[e] equal employment opportunity,” and to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note18" id="Rnote18" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> But such classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.</p>
<p class="indent">Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shown no “exceedingly persuasive justification” for excluding all women from VMI. We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit’s initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Equal Protection Clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia—the Mary Baldwin VWIL program—does not cure the constitutional violation, <i>i.e.</i>, it does not provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit’s final judgment in this case.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">V</span></p>
<p class="indent">[Virginia asserts two justifications in defense of VMI’s exclusion of women.] First, the Commonwealth contends, “single-sex education provides important educational benefits,” and the option of single-sex education contributes to “diversity in educational approaches.” Second, the Commonwealth argues, “the unique VMI method of character development and leadership training,” the school’s adversative approach, would have to be modified were VMI to admit women. We consider these two justifications in turn.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is uncontested in this litigation. Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions can serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown that VMI was established, or has been maintained, with a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the State. In cases of this genre, our precedent instructs that “benign” justifications proffered in defense of categorical</p>
<p><a id="page_378" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>378</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">exclusions will not be accepted automatically; a tenable justification must describe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded. <i>Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan</i> is immediately [on] point. There the State asserted, in justification of its exclusion of men from a nursing school, that it was engaging in “educational affirmative action” by “compensat[ing] for discrimination against women.” Undertaking a “searching analysis,” the Court found no close resemblance between “the alleged objective” and “the actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification.” Pursuing a similar inquiry here, we reach the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia’s alleged pursuit of diversity through single-sex educational options. In 1839, when the State established VMI, a range of educational opportunities for men and women was scarcely contemplated. Higher education at the time was considered dangerous for women. VMI [admitted only men and] followed the lead of the State’s flagship school, the University of Virginia, founded in 1819.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1879, the State Senate resolved to look into the possibility of higher education for women, recognizing that Virginia “‘has never, at any period of her history,’” provided for the higher education of her daughters. Despite this recognition, no new opportunities were instantly open to women.</p>
<p class="indent">Virginia eventually [provided for women’s colleges in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but those were converted to coeducational schools by the mid-1970s. Not until 1972 did the University of Virginia agree to begin admitting “women on an equal basis with men.” The state now] describes the current absence of public single-sex higher education for women as “an historical anomaly.” But the historical record indicates action more deliberate than anomalous.</p>
<p class="indent">[W]e find no persuasive evidence in this record that VMI’s male-only admission policy “is in furtherance of a state policy of ‘diversity.’” No such policy can be discerned from the movement of all other public colleges and universities in Virginia away from single-sex education. [We also question] “how one institution with autonomy, but with no authority over any other state institution, can give effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions.” A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational options is not served by VMI’s historic and constant plan—a plan to “affor[d] a unique educational benefit only to males.” However “liberally” this plan serves the State’s sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not <i>equal</i> protection.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Virginia next argues that VMI’s adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cannot be made available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be “radical,” so “drastic,” Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed “destroy,” VMI’s program. Neither sex would be favored by the transformation, Virginia maintains: Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currently available to them; women would not gain that opportunity because their participation would “eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from…other institutions of higher education in Virginia.”</p>
<p><a id="page_379" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>379</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The [lower courts found] that coeducation would materially affect “at least these three aspects of VMI’s program—physical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative approach.” And it is uncontested that women’s admission would require accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments and physical training programs for female cadets. It is also undisputed, however, that “the VMI methodology could be used to educate women.” The District Court even allowed that some women may prefer it to the methodology a women’s college might pursue. “[S]ome women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,” the District Court recognized, and “some women,” the expert testimony established, “are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets.” The parties, furthermore, agree that “<i>some</i> women can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men.” In sum, as the Court of Appeals stated, “neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers,” VMI’s <i>raison d’être</i>, “nor VMI’s implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women.”</p>
<p class="indent">In support of its initial judgment for Virginia, the District Court made “findings” on “gender-based developmental differences.” These “findings” restate the opinions of Virginia’s expert witnesses, opinions about typically male or typically female “tendencies.” For example, “[m]ales tend to need an atmosphere of adversativeness,” while “[f]emales tend to thrive in a cooperative atmosphere.” “I’m not saying that some women don’t do well under [the] adversative model,” VMI’s expert on educational institutions testified, “undoubtedly there are some [women] who do”; but educational experiences must be designed “around the rule,” this expert maintained, and not “around the exception.”</p>
<p class="indent">The United States does not challenge any expert witness estimation on average capacities or preferences of men and women. Instead, the United States emphasizes that time and again since this Court’s turning point decision in <i>Reed v. Reed</i>, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), we have cautioned reviewing courts to take a “hard look” at generalizations or “tendencies” of the kind pressed by Virginia. State actors controlling gates to opportunity may not exclude qualified individuals based on “fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.” <i>Mississippi Univ. for Women</i>, 458 U.S. at 725.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most women would not choose VMI’s adversative method. [But] it is also probable that “many men would not want to be educated in such an environment.” Education, to be sure, is not a “one size fits all” business. The issue, however, is not whether “women—or men—should be forced to attend VMI”; rather, the question is whether the State can constitutionally deny to women who have the will and capacity, the training and attendant opportunities that VMI uniquely affords.</p>
<p class="indent">The notion that admission of women would downgrade VMI’s stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved, a prediction hardly different from other “self-fulfilling prophec[ies]” once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities. When women first sought admission to the bar and access to legal education, concerns of the same order were expressed.</p>
<p class="indent">[Likewise, when women entered the medical field and police departments, many expressed concerns about women’s ability to perform the job, the</p>
<p><a id="page_380" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>380</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">devaluation of the professions, the possibility of undermining male solidarity, depriving males of opportunity, and sexual misconduct.]</p>
<p class="indent">Women’s successful entry into the federal military academies, and their participation in the Nation’s military forces, indicate that Virginia’s fears for the future of VMI may not be solidly grounded. The State’s justification for excluding all women from “citizen-soldier” training for which some are qualified, in any event, cannot rank as “exceedingly persuasive,” as we have explained and applied that standard.</p>
<p class="indent">Virginia and VMI trained their argument on “means” rather than “end,” and thus misperceived our precedent. Single-sex education at VMI serves an “important governmental objective,” they maintained, and exclusion of women is not only “substantially related,” it is essential to that objective. By this notably circular argument, the “straightforward” test <i>Mississippi Univ. for Women</i> described was bent and bowed.</p>
<p class="indent">The State’s misunderstanding is apparent from VMI’s mission: to produce “citizen-soldiers,” individuals “imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system, and ready…to defend their country in time of national peril.” Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women, who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal in stature to men. Just as surely, the State’s great goal is not substantially advanced by women’s categorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual merit, from the State’s premier “citizen-soldier” corps. Virginia, in sum, “has fallen far short of establishing the ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’” that must be the solid base for any gender-defined classification.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VI</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons in “the position they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination].” The constitutional violation in this case is the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. Virginia chose not to eliminate VMI’s exclusionary policy. For women only, Virginia proposed a separate program, different in kind from VMI and unequal in tangible and intangible facilities. Having violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirement, Virginia was obliged to show that its remedial proposal “directly address[ed] and relate[d] to” the violation, the equal protection denied to women ready, willing, and able to benefit from educational opportunities of the kind VMI offers. Virginia described VWIL as a “parallel program,” and asserted that VWIL shares VMI’s mission of producing “citizen-soldiers” and VMI’s goals of providing “education, military training, mental and physical discipline, character…and leadership development.”</p>
<p class="indent">[This proposed remedy fails because] VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which VMI is famed. Instead, the</p>
<p><a id="page_381" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>381</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">VWIL program “deemphasize[s]” military education and uses a “cooperative method” of education “which reinforces self-esteem.” Virginia maintains that these methodological differences are “justified pedagogically,” based on “important differences between men and women in learning and developmental needs,” “psychological and sociological differences” Virginia describes as “real” and “not stereotypes.” The Task Force charged with developing the leadership program for women “determined that a military model and, especially VMI’s adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training <i>most women</i>.” The Commonwealth embraced the Task Force view, as did expert witnesses who testified for Virginia.</p>
<p class="indent">As earlier stated, generalizations about “the way women are,” estimates of what is appropriate for <i>most women</i>, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description. Notably, Virginia never asserted that VMI’s method of education suits <i>most men</i>. It is also revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make the VWIL experience “the entirely militaristic experience of VMI” on the ground that VWIL “is planned for women who do not necessarily expect to pursue military careers.” By that reasoning, VMI’s “entirely militaristic” program would be inappropriate for men in general or <i>as a group</i>, for “[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service.”</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast to the generalizations about women on which Virginia rests, we note again these dispositive realties: VMI’s “implementing methodology” is not “inherently unsuitable to women”; “some women…do well under [the] adversative model”; “some women, at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity”; “some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets,” and “can meet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men.” It is on behalf of these women that the United States has instituted this suit, and it is for them that a remedy must be crafted, a remedy that will end their exclusion from a state-supplied educational opportunity for which they are fit, a decree that will “bar like discrimination in the future.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL does not qualify as VMI’s equal. VWIL’s student body, faculty, course offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI’s. Nor can the VWIL graduate anticipate the benefits associated with VMI’s 157-year history, the school’s prestige, and its influential alumni network. Virginia, while maintaining VMI for men only, has failed to provide any “comparable single-gender women’s institution.” Instead, the Commonwealth has created a VWIL program fairly appraised as a “pale shadow” of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence.</p>
<p class="indent">Virginia’s VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedy Texas proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trial court’s 1946 ruling that African Americans could not be denied a legal education at a state facility. <i>See Sweatt</i> v. <i>Painter</i>, 339 U.S. 629 (1950). Reluctant to admit African Americans to its flagship University of Texas Law School, the State set up a separate school for black law students. As</p>
<p><a id="page_382" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>382</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">originally opened, the new school had no independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation. [The Supreme Court overlooked these tangible inequalities between the University of Texas Law School and its African American counterpart, but the Court also emphasized that the schools were unequal in terms of] “those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness” in a school, including “reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige.” Accordingly, the Court held, the Equal Protection Clause required Texas to admit African Americans to the University of Texas Law School. In line with <i>Sweatt</i>, we rule here that Virginia has not shown substantial equality in the separate educational opportunities the State supports at VWIL and VMI.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VII</span></p>
<p class="indent">VMI offers an educational opportunity no other Virginia institution provides, and the school’s “prestige”—associated with its success in developing “citizen-soldiers”—is unequaled. Virginia has closed this facility to its daughters and, instead, has devised for them a “parallel program,” with a faculty less impressively credentialed and less well paid, more limited course offerings, fewer opportunities for military training and for scientific specialization. VMI, beyond question, “possesses to a far greater degree” than the VWIL program “those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a…school,” including “position and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige.” Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less, under the State’s obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.</p>
<p class="indent">A prime part of the history of our Constitution is the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded. VMI’s story continued as our comprehension of “We the People” expanded. There is no reason to believe that the admission of women capable of all the activities required of VMI cadets would destroy the Institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the “more perfect Union.”</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Scalia</span>, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">[I]t is my view that “when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down.” The same applies, to a practice asserted to be in violation of the post–Civil War Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="indent">The all-male constitution of VMI comes squarely within such a governing tradition. For almost all of VMI’s more than a century and a half of existence, its single-sex status reflected the uniform practice for government-supported military colleges. [Federal military colleges’] admission of women in 1976 (upon which the Court today relies) came not by court decree, but because the people, through their elected representatives, decreed a change. In other words, the tradition of having government-funded military schools for men is as</p>
<p><a id="page_383" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>383</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">well rooted in the traditions of this country as the tradition of sending only men into military combat. The people may decide to change the one tradition, like the other, through democratic processes; but the assertion that either tradition has been unconstitutional through the centuries is not law, but politics-smuggled-into-law.</p>
<p class="indent">“[It is] [c]oeducation, historically, [that] is a novel educational theory. From grade school through high school, college, and graduate and professional training, much of the Nation’s population during much of our history has been educated in sexually segregated classrooms.” These traditions may of course be changed by the democratic decisions of the people, as they largely have been[, but it is inappropriate for this Court to force that change].</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">To reject the Court’s disposition today, however, it is not necessary to accept my view that the Court’s made-up tests cannot displace longstanding national traditions as the primary determinant of what the Constitution means. It is only necessary to apply honestly the test the Court has been applying to sex-based classifications for the past two decades [: intermediate scrutiny].</p>
<p class="indent">Although the Court in two places recites the test as stated in <i>Hogan</i>, which asks whether the State has demonstrated “that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,” the Court prefers the phrase “exceedingly persuasive justification” from <i>Hogan.</i> The Court’s nine invocations of that phrase would be unobjectionable if the Court acknowledged that <i>whether</i> a “justification” is “exceedingly persuasive” must be assessed by asking “[whether] the classification serves important governmental objectives and [whether] the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Instead, however, the Court proceeds to interpret “exceedingly persuasive justification” in a fashion that contradicts the reasoning of <i>Hogan</i> and our other precedents.</p>
<p class="indent">That is essential to the Court’s result, which can only be achieved by establishing that intermediate scrutiny is not survived if there are <i>some</i> women interested in attending VMI, capable of undertaking its activities, and able to meet its physical demands. Only the amorphous “exceedingly persuasive justification” phrase, and not the standard elaboration of intermediate scrutiny, can be made to yield this conclusion that VMI’s single-sex composition is unconstitutional because there exist several women willing and able to undertake VMI’s program. Intermediate scrutiny has never required a least-restrictive-means analysis, but only a “substantial relation” between the classification and the state interests that it serves. There is simply no support in our cases for the notion that a sex-based classification is invalid unless it relates to characteristics that hold true in every instance.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">It is beyond question that Virginia has an important state interest in providing effective college education for its citizens. [A]s the Court of Appeals</p>
<p><a id="page_384" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>384</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">here stated: “That single-gender education at the college level is beneficial to both sexes is a <i>fact established in this case.</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">[First,] Virginia demonstrated at trial that “[a] substantial body of contemporary scholarship and research supports the proposition that, although males and females have significant areas of developmental overlap, they also have differing developmental needs that are deep-seated.” [T]he District Court stated as follows: “One empirical study in evidence, not questioned by any expert, demonstrates that…[s]tudents of both sexes become more academically involved, interact with faculty frequently, show larger increases in intellectual self-esteem and are more satisfied with practically all aspects of college experience (the sole exception is social life) compared with their counterparts in coeducational institutions.…”</p>
<p class="indent">[Second,] VMI employs a “distinctive educational method,” sometimes referred to as the “adversative, or doubting, model of education.” No one contends that this method is appropriate for all individuals; education is not a “one size fits all” business. Just as a State may wish to support junior colleges, vocational institutes, or a law school that emphasizes case practice instead of classroom study, so too a State’s decision to maintain within its system one school that provides the adversative method is “substantially related” to its goal of good education. Moreover, it was uncontested that “if the state were to establish a women’s VMI-type [<i>i.e.,</i> adversative] program, the program would attract an insufficient number of participants to make the program work”; and it was found by the District Court that if Virginia were to include women in VMI, the school “would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether.” Thus, Virginia’s options were an adversative method that excludes women or no adversative method at all.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court argues that VMI would not have to change very much if it were to admit women. The principal response to that argument is that it is irrelevant: If VMI’s single-sex status is substantially related to the government’s important educational objectives, that concludes the inquiry. There should be no debate in the federal judiciary over “how much” VMI would be required to change if it admitted women and whether that would constitute “too much” change.</p>
<p class="indent">But if such a debate were relevant, the Court would certainly be on the losing side. The District Court found as follows: “[T]he evidence establishes that key elements of the adversative VMI educational system, with its focus on barracks life, would be fundamentally altered, and the distinctive ends of the system would be thwarted, if VMI were forced to admit females and to make changes necessary to accommodate their needs and interests.” Changes that the District Court’s detailed analysis found would be required include new allowances for personal privacy in the barracks, such as locked doors and coverings on windows, which would detract from VMI’s approach of regulating minute details of student behavior, “contradict the principle that everyone is constantly subject to scrutiny by everyone else,” and impair VMI’s “total egalitarian approach” under which every student must be “treated alike”; changes in the physical training program, which would reduce “[t]he intensity and aggressiveness of the current program”; and various modifications in other respects of the adversative training program that permeates student life.</p>
<p><a id="page_385" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>385</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">[The] District Court specifically concluded that while “[w]ithout a doubt” VMI could assimilate women, “it is equally without a doubt that VMI’s present methods of training and education would have to be changed” by a “move away from its adversative new cadet system.” VMI “would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether.”</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. In other cases, intermediate scrutiny is described as requiring an “important” governmental objective. In <i>VMI</i>, Justice Ginsburg’s majority opinion used the term “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Does this language elevate the standard or just restate and refocus it?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Justice Scalia emphasized that the Court has previously rejected strict scrutiny for gender classifications and charges that the majority’s application of intermediate scrutiny in <i>VMI</i> was more akin to strict scrutiny. He applies a less skeptical version of intermediate scrutiny and finds that VMI’s program passes it. To the extent he is correct, does his opinion ironically demonstrate that strict scrutiny might be the appropriate standard for gender classifications? Would Scalia’s version of intermediate scrutiny uphold some programs, even though they are partially based on gender stereotypes or perpetuate inequality?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What are the state’s justifications for operating a single-sex program at VMI? Why does the Court reject them?</p>
<p class="indent">4. What, if any, interests might suffice as exceedingly persuasive to justify differential treatment based on gender?</p>
<p class="indent">5. How does the Court address or respond to the existence of differences between women and men and their relevance?</p>
<p class="indent">6. How important is the “adversative model of education” to the operation of VMI? If it were true that admitting women to VMI would require significant changes and would diminish the educational opportunities available to men, is that a basis for excluding women? To the extent such harm to men would occur, is it a product of gender biases that instructors and male students themselves harbor? If so, insulating a single-sex institution from reform would amount to permitting private gender bias to drive public policy.</p>
<p class="indent">7. Even if admitting women would change VMI’s method, the practical result of excluding women is to deny women a unique experience that no other school in the state will be able to offer. Under any conception of the Constitution other than a historical one, can one constitutionally justify denying women educational opportunities that men have solely based on sex? Yet, if one assumed that the adversative model would not operate effectively in a coeducational environment at VMI, both men and women might lose the opportunity. Is that the price of equality that we must bear until we move to a society where gender is less relevant?</p>
<p class="indent">8. In a number of footnotes excluded here, the majority focuses on the claim that admitting women to VMI will require drastic changes to VMI’s educational environment. The majority emphasizes that similar arguments have been used in the past as a basis for impeding the full citizenship and inclusion</p>
<p><a id="page_386" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>386</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of women. The Court also analogizes to the experience of racial desegregation in the military and in schools, noting that:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The pluralistic argument for preserving all-male colleges is uncomfortably similar to the pluralistic argument for preserving all-white colleges.…The all-male college would be relatively easy to defend if it emerged from a world in which women were established as fully equal to men. But it does not. It is therefore likely to be a witting or unwitting device for preserving tacit assumptions of male superiority—assumptions for which women must eventually pay.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">518 U.S. at 535 n.8. Justice Scalia treats the exclusion of women as purely a factual question of educational benefits and environment. The majority appears to treat it as more of a legal and threatened principle question, focusing on the facial inequality in treatment. Which is it? Should the factual assertions of harms and educational upheaval have any more bearing here than they did in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>?</p>
<p class="indent">9. Does the Court set up an impossible situation for the state by demanding an exact analogue to VMI when there is insufficient female interest in such an institution to operate it?</p>
<p class="indent">10. The Commonwealth of Virginia argued that “diversity” of choice in programs was an important governmental interest furthered by the exclusion of women from VMI and the exclusion of men from VWIL. The Supreme Court rejected this argument as circular and designed to evade equal protection scrutiny all together. As a subsequent federal notice explained, “[s]ome commenters stated that there is not an important governmental interest in a sex-based educational option as a diverse option without a requirement that the recipient demonstrate that the single-sex option advances educational goals, because otherwise the single-sex nature of the class would always be justified as substantially related to achievement of the objective, which is circular.” Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education, 71 Fed. Reg. 62,530-01, at 62,534 (Oct. 25, 2006).</p>
<p class="indent">11. Justice Scalia argues that the majority’s standards are too onerous and the costs of litigating them too high. Thus, single-sex education is “functionally dead.” Is Justice Scalia correct? Another reading of the case would be that the Court’s opinion casts doubt only on elite single-sex institutions that cannot be replicated, but leaves other single-sex institutions viable.</p>
<p class="indent">Commentators and data suggest that Justice Scalia (and Justice Rehnquist in an opinion omitted above) overstated the impending demise of single-sex education. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Kimberly J. Jenkins, <i>Constitutional Lessons for the Next Generation of Public Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Schools</i>, 47 <span class="smallcap">Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev.</span> 1953 (2006) (detailing the expansion of single-sex education after <i>VMI</i>); Sara L. Mandelbaum, <i>“As VMI Goes…”: The Domino Effect and Other Stubborn Myths</i>, 6 <span class="smallcap">Seton Hall Const. L.J.</span> 979, 979-982 (1996).</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="noindent">In 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which included a provision to fund “innovative assistance programs,” including programs that</p>
<p><a id="page_387" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>387</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">would “provide same-gender schools and classrooms.” <i>See</i> No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-110, §5131, 115 Stat. 1425, 1781-1782 (2002) (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. §7215(a) (2006)). In response to school district concerns about the legal basis for sex-segregated education, the Department of Education amended its Title IX regulations. Interestingly, it distinguished between segregated classrooms and schools. In regard to classrooms, the regulations indicate that single-sex classes (or extracurricular activities) must serve one of two “important” objectives: [t]o improve educational achievement of its students, through [an] overall established policy to provide diverse educational opportunities” or “[t]o meet the particular, identified educational needs of its students.” 34 C.F.R. §106.34(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B) (2012). The regulations further require that single-sex classes be (1) implemented in an “evenhanded manner,” (2) “completely voluntary,” and (3) provide a “a substantially equal coeducational class…in the same subject.” <i>Id.</i> §§106.34(b)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv).</p>
<p class="indent">As to single-sex schools, the regulations provide that “a recipient that operates a public nonvocational elementary or secondary school that excludes from admission any students, on the basis of sex, must provide students of the excluded sex a substantially equal single-sex school or coeducational school.” <i>Id.</i> §106.34(c)(1). The Department of Education will assess equality by examining “[t]he policies and criteria of admission, the educational benefits provided, including the quality, range, and content of curriculum and other services and the quality and availability of books, instructional materials, and technology, the quality and range of extracurricular offerings, the qualifications of faculty and staff, geographic accessibility, the quality, accessibility, and availability of facilities and resources, and intangible features, such as reputation of faculty.” <i>Id.</i> §106.34(c)(3). The regulations, however, specifically exempted charter schools, indicating that a “nonvocational public charter school…may be operated as a single-sex charter school without regard to the requirements” of the foregoing provisions. <i>Id.</i> §106.34(c)(2).</p>
<p class="indent">Do these regulations comport with the constitutional standards established in <i>Hogan</i> and <i>VMI</i> or do they suggest more flexibility than exists under the Constitution? The regulations do not attempt to define what would amount to an “important objective,” but do specifically include diversity and meeting students’ needs as important. With that said, the regulations’ carefully worded language in regard to diversity suggests a relatively narrow understanding of the interest. Diversity in educational opportunity is an important objective, not as a general principle, but only in so far as it improves educational achievement. The concept of and rationale for diversity in the context of single-sex education is also distinct from the rationale for racial diversity. As one scholar points out:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[E]mploying a diverse array of educational approaches within a single school system…is a quantitative change which does not necessarily result in the same qualitative educational improvement produced by interaction among students from diverse backgrounds. Greater choice is only beneficial to the extent that the additional pedagogical choices are themselves desirable. Therefore, the diversity which single-sex schools add to public education systems is good for students only if the schools themselves are educationally beneficial.</p>

<p class="indent">In the context of the perceived “crisis” facing low-income males of color, some school districts, including districts in Miami, Milwaukee, Detroit, San Diego, and Baltimore, established single-sex schools and programs with a specific focus on educating black males using an afrocentric curriculum. The elementary school in Miami saw the attendance rates for African American males rise by 6 percent, as well as improved achievement in some areas. The district, however, closed the school after its first year of operation in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s position that operating the school violated civil rights provisions. Civil rights groups, likewise, opposed these schools as denying girls equal opportunity and potentially setting precedent for the operation of all-white schools that teach white supremacy.

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the setbacks experienced with these schools, single-sex schools and single-sex programs have been on the rise since the passage of NCLB and the adoption of these regulations. One single-sex education advocacy group notes that “[f]or the 2011-2012 school year, at least 506 public schools in the United States are offering single-sex educational opportunities.

<p class="indent">[“In light of the potential benefits of single-sex public schools, it is important that educators have clear guidance on their constitutional obligations.” But the Court’s precedent has alternated between very demanding and permissive versions of intermediate scrutiny. The former “could chill the development of single-sex schools” and the latter would “fail to identify the potential harms that could exist in a single-sex school.” The possibility of either can “discourage experimentation with single-sex schools.”</p>
<p><a id="page_389" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>389</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">To address the indeterminacy of intermediate scrutiny and its potential for inappropriate outcomes, t]wo factors should serve as guideposts that direct how the substantial relationship component of intermediate scrutiny should be applied to single-sex public schools: whether attendance is voluntary and whether substantially equal opportunities are given to both sexes. These two characteristics can be used to divide single-sex public schools into two categories that present distinct potential risks and benefits, and thus warrant different constitutional requirements. If both voluntary attendance and substantially equal opportunities for both sexes are present, schools should be placed into the dual, voluntary category. If either voluntary attendance or substantially equal opportunities is absent, single-sex schools should be placed into the solitary or involuntary category. The substantial relationship test should be calibrated to be more demanding when assessing solitary or involuntary schools and less demanding when assessing dual, voluntary schools.</p>
<p class="indent">The first factor is whether the school district provides substantially equal opportunities to both sexes. If the district provides such opportunities, the absence of a denial of an opportunity or benefit to one sex should serve as a guidepost that distinguishes some single-sex schools from others. In identifying this as an important factor that should drive the constitutional analysis of single-sex schools, remembering that intermediate scrutiny is designed to review state action that grants an opportunity or benefit to only one sex, or that imposes a burden on only one sex, is important. The Court has explained that it is “[l]egislative classifications which distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of gender [that] carry the inherent risk of reinforcing stereotypes about the ‘proper place’ of women and their need for special protection.”</p>
<p class="indent">Although all single-sex schools classify students on the basis of sex, some single-sex schools do not involve the denial of an opportunity or benefit to one sex. Instead, each sex may receive the same or substantially equal benefits. This occurs in dual academies that provide a single-sex school for each sex with similar curricula, teaching methods, materials, and sometimes even the same teachers and facilities, as well as in some pairs of single-sex schools that educators design to provide both sexes similar educational opportunities. In these circumstances, the state has adopted a sex classification by separating boys and girls on the basis of sex, but it has not denied either sex a benefit or an opportunity. Such a separation should remain subject to intermediate scrutiny, but the absence of a denial of a benefit or opportunity to one sex warrants modification of the intermediate scrutiny standard because this subset of single-sex schools generally places less of a burden on either sex than when one sex is excluded from certain benefits. Substantially equal opportunities for each sex reduce the likelihood that either sex is harmed because disparate treatment is minimized. Thus, the provision of substantially equal opportunities helps to ensure that educators are not shortchanging the needs of either girls or boys, and such single-sex schools should be subject to a less demanding interpretation of the substantial relationship test.</p>
<p class="indent">The second factor is whether attendance at a single-sex school is voluntary. Voluntary schools are less likely to inflict harm on students of either sex for two reasons. First, students who do not attend the school can obtain substantially</p>
<p><a id="page_390" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>390</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">equal benefits in a coeducational school. Second, students who attend the school are not being forced to attend and could entirely avoid the sex classification. The choice to attend the school reduces the likelihood that the students are harmed by the school because any perceived harm to, or inferior opportunities for, students in single-sex schools will cause parents and students to select a different school. Voluntary attendance should help to assure educators and courts that those students who choose to attend the single-sex school, rather than a substantially equal coeducational school, believe that the school’s single-sex composition will help them achieve their educational goals. Therefore, voluntary attendance at a single-sex school accomplishes some of the work that intermediate scrutiny was created to achieve.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Do you agree that the Court has been inconsistent in its application of intermediate scrutiny? One scholar reasons that if single-sex education results in disadvantage for girls, “it is dubious” that the program could survive, regardless of “the precise ingredients of middle-tier scrutiny.” Gary J. Simson, <i>Separate But Equal and Single-Sex Schools</i>, 90 <span class="smallcap">Cornell L. Rev.</span> 443, 451 (2005). Regardless, Jenkins indicates that inconsistency in the test creates its own set of problems. What are those problems?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What factors does Jenkins find are most important in assessing the legality of single-sex education? Does Jenkins’ approach offer more clarity than the Court? Would it better accomplish the goals of intermediate scrutiny?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Gary Simson summarizes the research on single-sex education this way:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The evidence that public single-sex education in this country produces, and can be expected to produce, substantial benefits for girls and boys not available in a coed environment appears to be inconclusive at best. Because there have been so few single-sex public schools in the United States in recent years, studies have largely focused on single-sex Catholic schools, other private schools, and colleges in this country or single-sex public schools in other countries where they are more prevalent. Drawing inferences for the U.S. public school context from data collected about non-public or non-U.S. schools or about colleges rather obviously lends itself to disagreement because of the need to control for significant variables and the difficulty of doing so. In general, however, while older studies tend to suggest substantial benefits to public single-sex education, recent studies have cast serious doubt on both the methodology of the older ones and the existence of any such benefits. Perhaps most fundamentally, to the extent that single-sex schools do seem to yield advantageous results, there typically appears to be good reason to believe that the advantages derive not from the single-sex nature of the school but rather from other distinctive features of the school such as small class size, favorable faculty-student ratio, or special mentoring programs—features that could be replicated in coed schools. Coed schools therefore appear to offer a means of producing these results that avoids the disadvantaging effects of a sex classification, and the justification for using single-sex schools is substantially diminished as a result.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Simson, <i>supra</i> at 452-453. If the evidence is as weak as Simson and some others suggest, why do a significant number of researchers and parents continue to</p>
<p><a id="page_391" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>391</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">support single-sex education? Diane Halpern argues that many continue to support single-sex education not because the data supports it, but because, as psychologists have shown, “people process information differently when it supports or fails to support what they believe to be true. The tendency to seek information that confirms what we believe to be true is called confirmation bias. Of course, most people believe that they fairly assess all of the available information, but even research with NASA scientists has shown that they prefer information that supports their beliefs.” Report of Diane Halpern for Plaintiffs, Doe v. Vermillion Parish, Civil Action No. 6:09-cv-01565, at 16, Nov. 11, 2009, <i>available at</i> <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Expert_Report_-_Diane_Halpern.pdf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Expert_Report_-_Diane_Halpern.pdf</a>. Thus, she argues that supporters of single-sex education latch onto unreliable studies and anecdotes. On a more global level, she is suggesting that prevalent gender bias and norms make many predisposed to find value in single-sex education that does not exist.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Should courts and educators proceed with an open mind toward single-sex programs, as Professor Jenkins suggests, or be inherently skeptical, as Halpern and Simson suggest, of any findings that these programs are beneficial? To the extent studies vary, a crucial issue is which party bears the burden for demonstrating the efficacy, or lack thereof, of single-sex education. With racial segregation, courts became extremely skeptical after <i>Brown</i> and placed the burden of proof on the school district. Should heightened skepticism similarly apply to single-sex education?</p>

<p class="indent">Clarendon High School recently established a parenting education program that is exclusively available to male students. Cathy is a female sophomore who wants to enroll in the parenting education program. Learning about the exclusion of females, Cathy met with the principal, who told her that “girls do not need such programs because they already possess maternal instinct.” Cathy subsequently filed suit in federal court to challenge the exclusion on equal protection grounds. In its responsive pleading, the school asserted that it is an important governmental objective to ensure that male students are prepared for the rigors of parenthood, and the exclusion of females allows the program to focus entirely on fatherhood concerns. The school also argued that males are less capable of developing parenting skills in coeducational environments since male students subconsciously feel inferior to female students in regards to parenting and, thus, are deterred from classroom participation. The school cites the fact that similar programs have existed for decades and references research studies indicating that these programs are more successful than coeducational parenting courses.</p>
<p class="indent">How should Cathy respond to the university’s claims? How would the <i>VMI</i> majority approach the case, and how would the Court rule?</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch139">E. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BASED ON GENDER</p>
<p class="noindent">Like race-based affirmative action policies, gender preferences in admissions have been subject to intense debate. Women were historically underrepresented in higher education, but as a result of Title IX, reduced stereotypes, and various other legal and policy changes, women now make up a majority of college students. “Since 1970, women’s undergraduate enrollment has increased more than twice as fast as men’s and surpassed men’s enrollment in 1978.” <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., The Condition of Education 2006</span>, at 36 (2006). As of 2010, females comprised 57 percent and males 43 percent of the full-time students enrolled in undergraduate institutions. <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., The Condition of Education 2012</span>, at 34 (2012). Yet, women are still underrepresented in critical programs such as engineering, math, and science. <span class="smallcap">Am. Ass’n of Univ. Women, Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</span> xiv (2010) (women earn only 20 percent of science, engineering, and math bachelor’s degrees and are even more underrepresented in graduate programs). College and university administrators have endeavored to determine what, if anything, they can do to address these gender disparities, with some programs and policies adopting preferences for women and others adopting preferences for men.</p>
<p class="indent">Affirmative action is commonly understood as an attempt to compensate a historically disadvantaged group for past inequities or help the group overcome current ones. Since women were historically excluded in most areas of education, Title IX itself is a form of affirmative action. The statute’s implementing regulations state that “in the absence of a finding of discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of the conditions which resulted in limited participation therein by persons of a particular sex,” 34 C.F.R. §106.3(b) (2012), but the regulations shall not “be interpreted to require any educational institution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one sex on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of that sex participating in or receiving the benefits of any federally supported program or activity, in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of that sex in any community, State, section, or other area.” 20 U.S.C. §1681(b) (2006).</p>
<p class="indent">While the Supreme Court has addressed race-conscious admission policies, it has not addressed gender-conscious affirmative action and whether such policies would survive constitutional scrutiny. As discussed in the second chapter, the Supreme Court’s race cases have held that diversity is a compelling interest and affirmative action policies considering race are sufficiently narrowly tailored, so long as the policy does not use racial quotas, considers individualized and demographic factors in addition to race, the policymakers give serious good faith consideration to race-neutral alternatives, no member of the nonprotected class is unduly harmed, and the policy has some end point.

<p><a id="page_393" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>393</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">analogous in some respects, tell us little about the legality of gender-conscious admissions.</p>
<p class="indent">One scholar reasons that “[t]he failure of the admissions programs in <i>Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan</i>, 458 U.S. 718 (1982) and <i>Reed v. Reed</i>, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), to hold up under intermediate scrutiny demonstrates the substantial hurdle that states will face if forced to defend a gender-based affirmative action program.” <i>See</i> Amy Hinkley, Comment, <i>Scrutinize This! The Questionable Constitutionality of Gender-Conscious Admissions Policies Utilized by Public Universities</i>, 37 <span class="smallcap">Pepp. L. Rev.</span> 339, 356 (2010). But “[t]he application of intermediate scrutiny to gender-based affirmative action programs means that race-based affirmative action is subject to a higher level of constitutional scrutiny. Thus, it is more likely that a race-based remedial program will be invalidated than an affirmative action program based on gender, even though racial minorities are meant to receive a higher level of protection from discrimination than women.” Jason M. Skaggs, Comment, <i>Justifying Gender-Based Affirmative Action Under</i> United States v. Virginia<i>’s “Exceedingly Persuasive Justification” Standard</i>, 86 <span class="smallcap">Cal. L. Rev.</span> 1169, 1175 (1998). The difference in standards, however, may be of more symbolic than practical importance. In <i>Hogan</i> and <i>VMI</i>, the Court demanded an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the gender classification and “persuasive evidence” that the classification is “sufficiently related” to the achievement of that interest. <i>Id.</i> at 1208-1209.</p>
<p class="indent">Seeking to resolve this potential anomaly, lower courts and scholars have debated whether gender-based affirmative action is governed by the race standards articulated in <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Parents Involved</i> rather than the lower standard articulated in Title IX regulation 34 C.F.R. §106.3(b). <i>See, e.g.,</i> Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that Title IX incorporated the intermediate scrutiny standard); Weser v. Glen, 190 F. Supp. 2d 384, 395 (E.D.N.Y. 2002); Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 106 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1367 (S.D. Ga. 2000) (applying strict scrutiny to gender-based affirmative action); Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 946 F. Supp. 1480, 1519 n.51 (N.D. Cal. 1996), <i>rev’d on other grounds</i>, 122 F.3d 692 (9th Cir. 1997) (indicating “Congress could not have intended to import the Fourteenth Amendment standards for gender into Title IX.”); David S.

Rep.</span> 1, 17 &amp; n.56 (2003) (stating that “Title IX prohibits gender discrimination to the same extent and under the same standards as the Equal Protection Clause”). Similarly, there is a split among the federal circuit courts over whether to use intermediate or strict scrutiny in evaluating gender-based affirmative action in noneducation contexts. <i>See, e.g.,</i> W. States Paving Co. v. Wash. Dep’t of Transp., 407 F.3d 983, 990 n.6 (9th Cir. 2005) (intermediate scrutiny but requiring “exceedingly persuasive justification”); Berkley v.

Milliken, 834 F.2d 583 (6th Cir. 1987), <i>summarily aff’d</i>, 489 U.S. 1061 (1989) (indicating intermediate scrutiny applies). In short, in the absence of Supreme Court precedent on point, the state of gender-based affirmative action programs benefiting women is unclear.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike race-based affirmative action, where preferences are given to historically disadvantaged groups, some current affirmative action efforts in admissions give preference to male applicants, or attempt to increase their enrollment through gender-neutral methods. There are a number of methods whereby universities can increase male enrollment. One way is to set a threshold score for admission and, once that threshold is met, consider a variety of “soft factors,” some of which might favor men or neutralize gender, in making the final admissions decision. Because those with the very highest GPAs and standardized test scores are not automatically admitted, males have a better chance for admission. Another way “would be to assign extra points to a student just for being the desired sex” or “add up the initial point score and the points from the ‘soft factors’ and to simply admit more males than females from the highest scoring group.” Hinkley, <i>supra</i>, at 357.</p>
<p class="indent">Applicants, however, may be far less aware that gender, as opposed to race, plays a role in admissions. “‘Public universities, likely because of their obligations under Title IX and the Constitution, have been more circumspect about acknowledging any such preferences for males than have private undergraduate colleges (whose admissions policies are exempted from Title IX’s coverage).’ Indeed, there seems to be a general reluctance of colleges to admit a preference for males, as well as a ‘natural murkiness of the admissions process,’ which makes it difficult to determine how, or whether, gender is actually factored into admissions decisions.” <i>Id.</i> at 359.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the underlying policy question in these admissions practices is whether gender balance is educationally important. Those supporting gender considerations in admissions argue that gender balance is critical to the learning environment and academic discourse and, if a university population exceeds 60 percent male or female, it reaches a tipping point where the environment is not attractive to males or females. If this occurs, a university would find it hard to attract the most qualified applicants of either sex. Others are more skeptical and, even accepting the importance of gender balance, question how it justifies policies that exclude otherwise qualified females. <i>Id.</i> at 340-341.</p>
<p class="indent">Since so-called reverse discrimination in favor of men, however benign or remedial, is evaluated under the same standards as discrimination in favor of women, such policies benefiting men may pass constitutional review if remedying gender imbalance constitutes an exceedingly persuasive justification. Of course, the historical exclusion of women in education, the continuing wage and earning-capacity gap disadvantaging women, and the gross underrepresentation of women in leadership positions and fields such as science and engineering would undermine the argument that an exceedingly persuasive justification exists for preferring men and disadvantaging women in admissions. <i>See</i> Debra</p>

Rev.</span> 719, 736-738 (2007). One author argues that affirmative action policies benefiting men should receive special attention to evaluate whether they rely on gender stereotypes and whether their purpose is “truly gender diversity rather than a mere attempt at gender balancing.” <i>Id.</i> at 738.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch140">F. SCHOLARSHIPS AND TESTING</p>
<p class="noindent">Absent important or exceedingly persuasive justifications, the foregoing cases indicate courts will be quick to strike down single-sex schools and programs that explicitly discriminate in admissions based on gender or apply different standards in determining admissions. Whether courts will do the same in regard to the use of criteria in admissions and scholarship awards that have a disparate impact on persons of one gender is far less clear. Title IX regulations prohibit recipients from “administer[ing] or operat[ing] any test or other criteria for admission which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria which do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.” 34 C.F.R. §106.21(b)(2) (2012). But when the Supreme Court in <i>Alexander v. Sandoval</i>, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), held that Title VI regulations that prohibit disparate impact based on race do not create a private cause of action, the Court also indirectly called the enforceability of Title IX regulations into question because, in the past, the Court has tended to interpret Title IX and Title VI coextensively. The Supreme Court, however, has yet to clarify the scope of its decision in <i>Sandoval</i>, and lower courts have split over the viability of Title IX disparate impact claims.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that Title IX’s prohibitions on gender disadvantage are, in some respects, broader and more comprehensive than Title VI’s prohibition on race discrimination might suggest disparate impact falls within the scope of Title IX. Supreme Court precedent recognizing causes of action for things such as student-on-student sexual harassment and retaliation suggests the same. But rigid interpretations of discrimination like those found in <i>Sandoval</i> suggest the opposite. In any event, the Department of Education is free to enforce its disparate impact regulations administratively. The following case explores disparate impact based on gender and how the lines between intent and impact blur.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch141">Sharif by Salahuddin v. New York State Education Department</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>709 F. Supp. 345 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)</i></p>
<p class="indent">This case raises the important question of whether New York State denies female students an equal opportunity to receive prestigious state merit</p>
<p><a id="page_396" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>396</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">scholarships by its sole reliance upon the Scholastic Aptitude Test (“SAT”) to determine eligibility. To the Court’s knowledge, this is the first case where female students are seeking to use the federal civil rights statute prohibiting sex discrimination in federally-funded educational programs to challenge a state’s reliance on standardized tests. This case also presents a legal issue of first impression: whether discrimination under Title IX can be established by proof of disparate impact without proof of intent to discriminate.</p>
<p class="indent">After careful consideration, this Court finds that defendants are discriminating against female plaintiffs and their putative class in violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause. For the reasons set forth below, this Court enjoins the State Education Department (“SED”) and its Commissioner from awarding the merit scholarships at issue solely on the basis of the SAT.</p>
<p class="indent">New York State, in one of the most extensive merit scholarship programs in the country, each year makes 26,000 academic achievement awards to New York’s high school graduates. In order to understand the program’s current purpose, a brief recitation of the program’s evolution is appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1974, the legislature restructured its awards, creating two types of awards: first, “general awards” which provide substantial monetary assistance, and second, “academic performance awards” which recognize achievement. In the “general awards” category, the legislature created a Tuition Assistance Program (“TAP”) to fund college students based upon financial need. In 1977, the legislature directed that the scholarships be awarded on the basis of “nationally established competitive examinations.” [After examining several different exams,] the SED chose the SAT. [T]he entire SAT is labeled an “aptitude” test, and the SAT only purports to test two subjects—Math and English.</p>
<p class="indent">In response to allegations that the SED’s practice of relying solely upon the SAT in awarding Regents and Empire State Scholarships discriminated against females who consistently scored below males, the Board of Regents asked for $100,000 to develop a new scholarship achievement examination. The legislature declined to fund a special examination but, instead, amended the Education Law to require that the awards be based in part upon the student’s grade point average (“GPA”) as a measure of high school achievement. [The stated purpose was] “to correct a gross inequity that pervaded the New York educational system caused by awarding of Regents College Scholarships and Empire State Scholarships of Excellence based solely on the results of a nationally administered standardized examination.”</p>
<p class="indent">The new legislation [required, on a one-year experimental basis, that the criteria for awarding scholarships include] a measure of “high school performance.” [T]he SED chose to use GPAs as the best available measure of high school achievement. In 1988, under the procedure using a combination of grades and SATs weighted equally[,] women received substantially more Regents and Empire Scholarships than in all prior years in which the SAT had been the sole criterion. In both 1987 and 1988, young women comprised approximately 54 percent of the applicant pool for the scholarship, yet the results in 1988 when grades and SATs were used were markedly different. [Females received 38 percent of the Empire Scholarships in 1988 as opposed to 28 percent the previous year, and 49 percent of the Regents Scholarships in </p>
<p><a id="page_397" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>397</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">1988 as opposed to 43 percent the previous year.] When GPAs were used in 1988, the mean GPAs were: 85 for females and 84.4 for males.</p>
<p class="indent">In September, 1989, the SED determined that it would award Regents and Empire Scholarships on the basis of SAT scores alone. It is the SED’s sole reliance on SAT scores for 1989 graduates that plaintiffs complain denies them equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution and violates Title IX.</p>
<p class="indent">The Educational Testing Service (“ETS”) developed the SAT in order to predict academic performance in college. The ability of the SAT to serve this purpose has been statistically “validated.” It is undisputed, however, that the SAT predicts the success of students differently for males and females. In other words, while the SAT will predict college success as well for males within the universe of males as for females within the universe of females, when predictions are within the combined universe of males and females, the SAT <i>underpredicts</i> academic performance of females in their freshman year of college, and <i>overpredicts</i> such academic performance for males. The SAT has never been validated as a measure of past high school performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the ETS and the College Board, which administers the SAT, specifically advise against exclusive reliance upon the SAT, even for the purpose for which the SAT has been validated—predicting future college performance. Instead, ETS researchers recommend that college admissions counselors use a combination of high school grades and test scores because this combination provides the highest median correlation with freshman grades.</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding ETS and [National Association of College Admission Counselors] guidelines recommending against using the SAT as the sole basis on which to award scholarships or offer admissions, the SED adopted such a policy in 1974. New York State is one of only two states in the nation to rely solely on SAT scores for the award of state-sponsored merit. Most states rely, at least in part, upon GPAs.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the Empire and Regents Scholarships are intended to reward past academic achievement of high school students, and to encourage those students who have demonstrated such achievement to pursue their educations in New York State. It is undisputed, however, that the SAT was developed and validated to serve a different purpose—<i>predicting</i> performance <i>in college.</i></p>
<p class="indent">[Nonetheless], it is the SED’s current position that the SAT provides a good measure of high school performance because it “measures skills and knowledge primarily developed in school.” The SED does not dispute that the SAT does not measure performance in all high school courses, but claims merely that the SAT partially tracks high school English and Math courses and thus tests achievement. The SED concedes that the SAT does not measure achievement in other subject matters such as science, social studies, and foreign languages. Moreover, the SED concedes that overall GPAs are a better measure of high school performance than SATs.</p>
<p class="indent">Males have outscored females on the verbal portion of the SAT since 1972, with an average score differential of at least 10 points since 1981. Males have also consistently outscored females on the mathematics portion, with an average differential of at least 40 points since 1967. Statisticians have attempted to</p>
<p><a id="page_398" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>398</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">explain the score differentials between males and females by removing the effect of “neutral” variables, such as ethnicity, socioeducational status (parental education), high school classes, and proposed college major. [E]ven after removing the effect of these factors, at least a 30 point combined differential remains unexplained.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of the State’s practice of basing scholarship awards solely upon SAT scores, males have consistently received substantially more scholarships than females. In 1987 for example, males were 47 percent of the scholarship competitors, but received 72 percent of the Empire State Scholarships and 57 percent of the Regents Scholarships.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs do not claim that defendants have intentionally discriminated against them based on their sex. Rather, they claim that defendants’ practice of sole reliance upon SAT scores to award prestigious state scholarships disparately impacts female students.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither the Supreme Court nor any court in the Second Circuit has determined whether intent must be shown in Title IX cases. This Court, however, is not without substantial guidance. Recognizing that “Title IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” courts examining Title IX questions have looked to the substantial body of law developed under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. §2000d, which prohibits race discrimination in federally-funded programs, and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §2000e, which prohibits discrimination in employment.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Guardians Ass’n v. Civil Service Comm’n</i>, 463 U.S. 582, (1983), the Supreme Court held that a violation of Title VI itself requires proof of discriminatory intent. However, a majority also agreed that proof of discriminatory effect suffices to establish liability when a suit is brought to enforce the regulations promulgated under Title VI, rather than statute itself. [As other courts have held, the same rationale applies to Title IX.]</p>
<p class="indent">Several Title IX regulations specifically prohibit facially neutral policies. For example, the provision governing admissions procedures, 34 C.F.R. §106.21(b)(2), prohibits a recipient from</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">administer[ing] or operat[ing] any test or other criteria for admission which has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria which do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>See also</i> 34 C.F.R. §§106.22, 106.23(b), 106.34(d), 106.37(b), 106.52, and 106.53(b).</p>
<p class="indent">Based upon a reading of the Title IX regulations, as well as the decisions that apply them, the Court finds that Title IX regulations, like the Title VI regulations at issue in <i>Guardians</i>, prohibit testing practices with a discriminatory <i>effect</i> on one sex. Consequently, plaintiffs need not prove intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">In Title VII testing cases, the Supreme Court developed a three-pronged formulation to analyze disparate impact claims. Under this scheme, plaintiffs first must show that a facially neutral practice has a disproportionate effect. After such a showing, the burden shifts to defendants to prove a substantial</p>
<p><a id="page_399" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>399</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">legitimate justification—a “business necessity”—for its practice. The plaintiff then may ultimately prevail by offering either an equally effective alternative practice which has a less of a discriminatory impact, or proof that the legitimate practices are a pretext for discrimination. <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</i>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).</p>
<p class="indent">In educational testing cases, instead of requiring defendants to demonstrate a “business necessity,” courts have required defendants to show an “educational necessity.” For example, the Eleventh Circuit, in <i>Georgia State Conf. of Branches of NAACP v. State of Georgia</i>, 775 F.2d 1403 (11th Cir. 1985), held that defendants had a burden of proving that their practices in question bore “a manifest demonstrable relationship to classroom education.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case through persuasive statistical evidence and credible expert testimony that the composition of scholarship winners tilted decidedly toward males and could not have occurred by a random distribution.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs, moreover, have established that the probability, absent discriminatory causes, that women would consistently score 60 points less on the SAT than men is nearly zero. Defendants concede that at least half of this differential cannot be explained away by “neutral” variables. Based upon the totality of evidence, then, this Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated that the State’s practice of sole reliance upon the SAT disparately impacts young women.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, to prevail, defendants must show a manifest relationship between use of the SAT and recognition and award of academic achievement in high school. The Court finds that defendants have failed to show even a reasonable relationship between their practice and their conceded purpose. The SAT was not designed to measure achievement in high school and was never validated for that purpose. Instead, defendants rely upon anecdotal evidence that the SAT partially tracks what is generally learned in high school Math and English courses. This argument is meritless.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs have offered substantial evidence that the SATs do not mirror high school Math and English classes. The makers of the SAT describe the test as an “aptitude test”; it does not purport to measure what is learned in classrooms but to predict success in college. The testing format of the SAT measures students’ ability to take tests at least as much as it measures substantive material.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, even if SATs provided a partial measurement of what is learned in high school Math and English, these two courses constitute only 20 percent of a high school student’s studies. The SAT fails to provide <i>any</i> measure of what a student learns in foreign language, science, and social studies courses. Moreover, there can be no serious claim that a test given on one single morning can take into account a student’s diligence, creativity and social development and work habits in that student’s environment—all part of high school achievement. After a careful review of the evidence, this Court concludes that SAT scores capture a student’s academic achievement no more than a student’s yearbook photograph captures the full range of her experiences in high school.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs have offered an alternative to sole reliance upon the SAT: a combination of GPAs and SATs. The SED’s use of this alternative in 1988 sharply reduced the disparate impact against females caused by the use of the SAT alone.</p>
<p><a id="page_400" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>400</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Defendants concede that females had a greater opportunity to receive scholarships under the combination system. Defendants also concede that grades are the best measure of high school achievement within the walls of a single school. Instead, they argue that since there is a disparity among schools and their grading systems it is both unfair and impossible to use grades as part of the scholarship eligibility determination. Defendants plan instead to develop a statewide achievement test. While this Court does not dispute the apparent advantages of a statewide achievement test—if indeed a valid test can be developed—it does not agree that pending the implication of such a test, use of grades would be either unfair or infeasible.</p>
<p class="indent">While a combination system—using both GPAs and SATs—is not a perfect alternative, it is the best alternative presently available. The SED is concerned that students in academically superior high schools not be disadvantaged by the use of GPAs. This concern is addressed by the combination system because in effect grades would be weighted by SATs. [Any negative effect on good students at superior schools of using GPAs would be ameliorated by the SATs and, of course, the use of GPAs would be fair because it serves the state’s overall goal of rewarding high school performance and would better provide equal opportunity for scholarships to both male and female students.]</p>
<p class="indent">The SED cannot justify its discriminatory practice because any alternative would be more difficult to administer. All states giving merit scholarships awards, with the exception of New York and Massachusetts, use GPAs, without concern for either administrative difficulties, grade inflation or the comparability of grades</p>
<p class="indent">Faced with a conflict between the SED’s administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial discriminatory harm to plaintiffs on the other, the Court has little difficulty in concluding that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in plaintiffs’ favor. The Court finds that plaintiffs have offered a feasible alternative to sole reliance upon SATs. Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX claim and, thus, a preliminary injunction is warranted.</p>
<p class="indent">The classification of scholarship applicants solely on the basis of SAT scores [also] violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because this method is not rationally related to the state’s goal of rewarding students who have demonstrated academic achievement.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the lowest standard of equal protection review—the “rational relationship standard”—“[t]he State may not rely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.” <i>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985). Although considerable deference is given to the decisions of legislators and state administrators under the rational basis test, the test “is not a toothless one.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the reasons stated above, the SED’s use of the SAT as a proxy for high school achievement is too unrelated to the legislative purpose of awarding academic achievement to survive even the most minimal scrutiny. The evidence is clear that females score significantly below males on the SAT while they perform equally or slightly better than males in high school. Therefore, the SED’s use of the SAT as the sole criterion for awarding Regents and Empire</p>
<p><a id="page_401" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>401</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Scholarships discriminates against females and, since such a practice is not rationally related to the legislative purpose, it unconstitutionally denies young women equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants are hereby ordered to discontinue such discriminatory practices and, instead, to award Regents and Empire Scholarships in a manner that more accurately measures students’ high school achievement. For the present year, the best available alternative is a combination of grades and SATs. The SAT component is justified, not as a measure of achievement, but to weight the GPA component. The Court, however, does not limit the SED’s discretion to develop other alternatives in the future, including a statewide achievement test.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What does a plaintiff have to show to establish a claim of disparate impact? What did the plaintiffs show here? Should the law prohibit these sorts of disparate impacts, or, in the absence of intentional discrimination, would a legal prohibition interfere with legitimate educational policymaking?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Why did the state move away from SAT scores in the first instance? If the motive was to reduce gender inequity, why did it move back to the SAT? Did its motives change over time? Did the inclusion of GPAs produce too much equality, and thus the return to the SAT as a sole determinate was gender motivated, or did the state have legitimate educational concerns? To the extent the state had gender motivations that were not aimed at producing more equality, one could argue that the state engaged in intentional discrimination. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pryor v. NCAA, 288 F.3d 548 (3d Cir. 2002) (a decision to increase academic eligibility standards that included racial considerations stated a claim of discrimination).</p>
<p class="indent">3. As you will see in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/23_ELEFR_Chapter_11.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 11</a>, much of current educational reform efforts concern (1) standardized testing, (2) the validity of such tests as determinant of academic achievement, (3) the effect on student due process rights, (4) the perpetuation of past inequalities, (5) the disparate impact of such tests on disenfranchised groups, and (6) the consequences of poor test results.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Do you agree that standardized tests are indicative of potential for academic achievement in higher education? Considering that schools and districts have different expectations of students, curricula, and grading criteria, how should universities and scholarship committees compare students from different schools?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The court notes that there was at least a 30-point differential between men and women after controlling for socioeconomic variables. Where should courts draw the line between disparities that indicate disparate impact and disparities that are minimal and thus not actionable?</p>
<p class="indent">6. The Code of Federal Regulations, 34 C.F.R. §106.21(b)(2), prohibits the use of tests that have a “disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex.” <i>See also</i> 34 C.F.R. §§106.36(b), 106.52 (2012). Although administrative agencies have expressed authority to enforce this provision, it was not until <i>Cannon v. University of Chicago</i>, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), that plaintiffs had a cause of action to enforce Title IX using disparate impact theories. Afterward, many</p>
<p><a id="page_402" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>402</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">courts, including the <i>Sharif</i> court, allowed plaintiffs to challenge testing in elementary and secondary schools that disparately impacted protected groups. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Johnson v. Sikes, 730 F.2d 644 (11th Cir. 1984); Brookhart v. Bd. of Educ., 697 F.2d 179 (7th Cir. 1983); Anderson v. Banks, 520 F. Supp. 472 (S.D. Ga. 1981); Debra P. v. Turlington, 730 F.2d 1405 (11th Cir. 1984). In the 2001 case <i>Alexander v. Sandoval</i>, 532 U.S. 275, however, the Supreme Court held that regulations enacted pursuant to Title VI, which Title IX mirrors, do not provide a private cause of action and that intentional discrimination must be proved to establish a violation. <i>Id.</i> at 380. Are there distinctions between Title IX and Title VI that would suggest a cause of action for disparate impact should exist under Title IX, even if it does not under Title VI?</p>
<p class="indent">While <i>Sandoval</i> can be read as the death knell of disparate impact, a more detailed and nuanced view suggests that</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent"><i>Sandoval</i> must be understood as but one among a series of cases where the Court has recently explored liability under Title VI and Title IX. These cases demonstrate that intentional discrimination is not a narrow concept restricted solely to instances where race or gender played a role in a funding recipient’s decision. The <i>Gebser [v. Lago Vista Independent School District,</i> 524 U.S. 274 (1989)] line of cases demonstrates that a defendant also violates Title VI and Title IX when it takes intentional action/inaction that causes, contributes to, or perpetuates the discrimination or disadvantages that occur within its programs. Such a violation occurs, even when the defendant did not initially desire or act to create discrimination or disadvantage, if the discrimination and disadvantage continue to occur because the defendant knowingly refuses or fails to intervene.</p>

<p class="h7" id="ch142">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">In 2012, the state of North Virginia commissioned a study that compared males’ and females’ high school performance to their college performance. The study revealed that high school GPAs now tend to underpredict males’ performance in college, but tend to predict many females’ performance correctly. Because males tend to have lower high school GPAs than females and GPAs are the most significant factor in admission to the state’s public universities, males’ enrollment has steadily dropped over the past decade at all of the state’s university campuses. At several campuses, including the flagship school, male enrollment hovers around 40 percent. A more heavy reliance on standardized exams, such as the SAT, would increase male enrollment and more accurately predict their future performance in college, but it would reduce the number of females. The university system states that the primary purpose of its admissions policies is to identify those applicants who are most likely to succeed in higher education.</p>
<p class="indent">Does the heavy reliance on high school grades give rise to a disparate impact claim on behalf of males? Regardless, can you devise an admissions policy that eliminates males’ disadvantage without violating the rights of women?</p>
<p><a id="page_403" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>403</b></a></p>
<p class="h3" id="ch143">G. ATHLETICS</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch144">1. <i>Constitutional Standard</i></p>
<p class="noindent">While single-sex education, admissions, and testing raise crucial questions about how to deliver quality and equal educational opportunities, Title IX’s effect on sports has often drawn more public attention. Title IX has been instrumental in expanding athletic interest and opportunities among females at all levels. In the 1971-1972 school year, only about 7.4 percent of high school athletes were female. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Women’s Sports Found</span>., <span class="smallcap">Play Fair: A Title IX Playbook for Victory</span> (2009). By the 2007-2008 school year, female students accounted for more than 41 percent of high school athletes—a 940 percent increase in the number of females participating in high school athletics compared to only a 19 percent increase for males. <i>Id.</i> For NCAA varsity athletics, women accounted for only 14.9 percent of athletes in the 1971-1972 school year, but by the 2004-2005 school year, women made up about 42.8 percent of varsity college athletes, a 456 percent increase in the number of women athletes compared to only a 31 percent increase for men. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Coal. for Women &amp; Girls in Educ., Title IX at 35: Behind the Headlines</span> 8 (2008). But some charge that these gains are forced and have come at the expense of males. Others would argue that we still have further to go, as sports are generally sex segregated and continue to perpetuate gender stereotypes that undermine equality not only in sports but education and society in general. Likewise, disparities in terms of participation, resources, publicity, coaching, and support persist. <i>See generally id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The following case evaluates the meaning of equal opportunity in athletics, the role gender stereotypes may play in limiting equality, and how Title IX and the Constitution might differ in their treatment of the issues. As you read this and subsequent materials, continue to consider broad questions such as whether the reasons for gender separation in sports are important and whether there are circumstances in athletics where equality requires us to separate students by gender. Regardless of your initial responses to these questions, consider whether any benefits that might come out of gender separation in sports are outweighed by the messages that the separation conveys. Eliminating sex segregation in sports is, no doubt, a radical idea. But is the idea extreme because of practicalities and cultural expectations or because it forces an unrealistic and counterproductive concept of equality?</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch145">Force v. Pierce City School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>570 F. Supp. 1020 (W.D. Mo. 1983)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Nichole Force, a thirteen year old female student in the eighth grade at the Pierce City, Missouri, Junior High School, seeks an injunction which would allow her to compete for a place on the school’s eighth grade football team. Her claims are relatively simple: that defendants’ refusal to accord her that opportunity is based solely upon the fact that she is a female rather than a male, and that a sex-based determination of that sort violates her right to the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p><a id="page_404" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>404</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Pierce City Board has for some time maintained an athletic program at both the junior and senior high school levels. [T]here is no football team for girls, and no volleyball team for boys.</p>
<p class="indent">[In] the spring of 1982, Nichole Force mentioned to her mother that she [wanted to try] out for the seventh grade football team. After an apparently frank discussion, Mrs. Force decided to approach the school authorities to see what might be done. Mrs. Force spoke first with the boys’ athletics coach for the school. He stated that so long as the school administration approved, he would let Nichole participate. [S]chool administrative officials advised her that the matter would have to be presented to the Board for its decision.</p>
<p class="indent">[Mrs. Force met with the Board twice. At those meetings, the Board expressed concern over the potential safety risks to a female competing with males, the “potential precedent involved in granting the request (e.g., the possibility that boys would wish to participate on the girls’ volleyball team, and that high school girls might wish to play on the high school football team),” the administrative difficulties that may result, and that Title IX may prohibit coeducational participation in a contact sport.]</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he Board voted unanimously to deny [Force’s request to try out for the team]. According to Mrs. Force, defendant John Williams explained the decision by stating that while “they all agreed” Nichole would be a good football player and would have no problems playing, if she were permitted to play the same allowance would have to be made for all other girls as well.</p>
<p class="indent">The record makes clear that defendants’ refusal to grant plaintiff’s request is the product of a gender-based classification. Stated simply, only males are permitted to compete for a place on the Pierce City Junior High School football team. Since Nichole is a female, that opportunity is denied to her.</p>
<p class="indent">The principles which must govern in this situation are summarized in the Supreme Court’s recent decision in <i>Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan</i>, 458 U.S. 718 (1982). [<i>Hogan</i> requires that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to achieving important governmental objectives. This test] must be applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females. Care must be taken in ascertaining whether the objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions. Thus if the objective is to exclude or “protect” members of one gender because they are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants do not quarrel with the fact that the present case must be governed by these principles. They argue, rather, that in the circumstances shown here a gender-based classification fully satisfies those principles. To that end, they identify four “important governmental objectives” which are said to be at stake: (a) maximization of equal athletic educational opportunities for all students, regardless of gender; (b) maintenance of athletic educational programs which are as safe for participants as possible; (c) compliance with Title IX and the regulations thereunder; and (d) compliance with the constitution and by-laws of MSHSAA [Missouri State High School Athletic Association]. According to defendants, there is a “substantial relationship” between each of these objectives and a gender based classification which would prevent any female from competing with males for a place on the eighth grade football team.</p>
<p><a id="page_405" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>405</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Defendants’ [Title IX argument] can be dealt with in short order. There is in fact nothing whatsoever in Title IX, or in its implementing regulations, which would mandate the action defendants have taken here. To the contrary, Title IX’s regulations leave each school free to choose whether co-educational participation in a contact sport will be permitted. Title IX simply takes a neutral stand on the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">[D]efendants’ point regarding compliance with MSHSAA rules [have even less force]. Defendants’ first two points, however, are deserving of more detailed treatment. Each will be examined separately below.</p>
<p class="indent">One might wonder, at first blush, how denying all females the right to participate in [football] will result in maximizing the participation of both sexes in athletics. That argument proceeds on three interrelated theories. Defendants suggest, first, that males (as a class) will outperform females (as a class) in most athletic endeavors, given male size, speed and greater ratio of lean body mass. That being so, the argument proceeds, the best way in which to encourage and maximize female participation in athletics is by providing separate male and female teams, since otherwise males will dominate the competition and ultimately discourage female participation. Pursuant to this idea, defendants have established separate interscholastic athletic programs for the two sexes, with the fall season sport being football for males and volleyball for females. But if (second) Nichole Force is permitted to compete for a place on the football team, then other girls must be accorded the same privilege, and boys must be allowed to compete for positions on the volleyball team. When (third) that happens, the girls will lose their best athletes, the boys will come to dominate volleyball, and overall female participation will ultimately wither.</p>
<p class="indent">Based upon the expert testimony presented in this case I am willing to accept the proposition that the average male, even at age 13, will to some extent outperform the average female of that age in most athletic events, although the matter may be open to some dispute.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note19" id="Rnote19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></sup> And I note, without being called upon to decide the issue, that a number of courts have held that the establishment of separate male/female teams in a sport is a constitutionally permissible way of dealing with the problem of potential male athletic dominance. Beyond these two points, however, I am unable to accept defendants’ argument.</p>
<p class="indent">The principal difficulty is that the various hypotheses used to bind [defendants’ argument] together are just that—hypotheses, and nothing more. There is, for example, no factual indication that the girls’ eighth grade volleyball team</p>
<p><a id="page_406" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>406</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">will be blighted by the defection of its best players to the football field. To the contrary, defendants’ own testimony is that Nichole Force is the first and only girl, at any grade level, who has ever made a request to play football. And for that matter, if defendants are correct in their position that females are unable to compete successfully with males in athletics, particularly in contact sports, it is to be expected that such defections would be short-lived in any event, and that the situation would prove to be self-regulating.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor is there any factual indication that eighth grade boys at Pierce City Junior High School are waiting eagerly for volleyball to be desegregated. Again to the contrary, there is no indication that any boy has ever expressed a desire to play on the volleyball team. Indeed, there may be something of a false premise involved in the idea that volleyball in the Pierce City School District is in fact segregated, since nothing in the MSHSAA rules would prevent boys from competing with girls on a volleyball team, and since defendants themselves have never articulated any such rule.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note20" id="Rnote20" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></sup> Instead, it would seem, the question has simply never arisen. And in any event, it is by no means clear that the District would be constitutionally required to permit boys to participate in girls’ volleyball, even if girls were allowed to participate in football. <i>See Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n</i>, 695 F.2d 1126, 1131-32 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that the governmental interest in redressing past discrimination against women in athletics is sufficient to justify a regulation which excludes boys from participating on girls’ teams, even though girls are allowed to compete on boys’ teams); <i>Petrie v. Illinois High Sch. Ass’n</i>, 394 N.E.2d 855 (1979) (same).</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, even if by some chance defendants’ worst case scenario should be realized, there might still be no need for the general breakdown which defendants postulate. For example, if a sufficient number of girls wish to play football, one obvious solution would be to organize a girls’ football team; or if so many boys wish to play volleyball that they would dominate the girls’ competition in that sport, to form a boys’ volleyball team. Such solutions would of course presumably involve added expense to the District, but there is no evidence on how troublesome that factor might be.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, however, a further point implicit in defendants’ argument: the apparent assumption that if, in the interest of maximizing equal athletic opportunities, it is constitutionally permissible to establish separate male and female teams in a given sport and to exclude each sex from the other’s team, then it is equally permissible, in that same interest, to designate separate male and female sports and to exclude each sex from participation in the other’s sport. That is a proposition I am unwilling to accept, at least as a general matter.</p>
<p class="indent">Each sport has its own relatively unique blend of requirements in terms of skills and necessary physical attributes, and each person, male or female, will for a variety of reasons probably find one or another sport more enjoyable and rewarding than others. In point of fact, volleyball is <i>not</i> football; and baseball</p>
<p><a id="page_407" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>407</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">is <i>not</i> hockey; and swimming is <i>not</i> tennis. Accordingly, if the idea is to “maximize educational athletic opportunities for all students, regardless of gender,” it makes no sense, absent some substantial reason, to deny all persons of one sex the opportunity to test their skills at a particular sport. Of course there may be certain exceptional instances in which there is a “substantial reason” for such an exclusion, as for example where peculiar safety and equipment requirements demand it, or perhaps where excluding males is necessary to redress past inequality and to foster female participation. But those instances would, I think, be relatively rare, and would need to be factually established.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not question the idea that maximizing the participation of both sexes in interscholastic athletic events is a worthy, and important, governmental objective. Nor do I question the sincerity of defendants’ efforts in that regard. In the circumstances of this case, however, I hold that the gender based classification used by defendants does not bear a sufficiently “substantial” relationship to that objective to withstand a constitutional challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither do I question the fact that the “maintenance of athletic educational programs which are as safe for participants as possible” is an “important governmental objective.” Indeed, that would seem obvious. Again, however, the facts of this case do not demonstrate a sufficiently “substantial” relationship between that objective and a blanket rule which prohibits all eighth grade females from competing for a place on the eighth grade football team.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no evidence, or even any suggestion, that Nichole Force herself could not safely participate in that football program. And while I do find, from the expert testimony presented, that a “typical” (i.e., average) 13 year old female would in fact, to some degree, have a higher potential for injury in mixed-sex football than would a “typical” (i.e., average) 13 year old male, this does not in my judgment greatly assist the defendants’ argument.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note21" id="Rnote21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></sup> The problem, of course, is that not all 13 year old females are “typical,” any more than all 13 year old males are “typical.” Indeed, as defendants’ own expert candidly admitted, some 13 year old females could safely play eighth grade football in mixed sex competition, and some 13 year old males could not. And yet I note that the School District permits <i>any</i> male to compete in football, regardless of his size, speed, body type, lean body mass, fat body mass, bone structure, “Q” angle measurement or any other factor which might have a bearing on his potential for injury.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, the “safety” factor which defendants would utilize to prevent any female from playing eighth grade football—including those who could play safely—is not applied to males at all, even to those who could not play safely.</p>
<p><a id="page_408" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>408</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">All this tends to suggest the very sort of well-meaning but overly “paternalistic” attitude about females which the Supreme Court has viewed with such concern.</p>
<p class="indent">It is of course true, as defendants point out, that the Supreme Court has recognized that governmental bodies are free to take into account <i>actual</i> differences between the sexes, including physical ones, with the result that a statute or policy which employs a gender based classification will be upheld where that classification merely reflects the fact that the sexes are not “similarly situated” in certain circumstances. I do not, however, read such observations to be an endorsement of the use of broad generalizations which—while perhaps empirically supported <i>as generalizations</i>—do not hold true for all members of a sex. In fact the Supreme Court has rather consistently rejected that idea, since a gender based classification which results from ascribing a particular trait or quality to one sex, when not all share that trait or quality, is not only inherently unfair but generally tends only to perpetuate “stereotypic notions” regarding the proper roles of men and women.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that reliance upon a factually established generalization concerning a particular male or female trait might never be appropriate. But there must obviously be a substantial justification (or perhaps even an “exceedingly persuasive” justification), for using such an imprecise and potentially mischievous tool for these purposes; and the only justification which might even arguably be applied in such circumstances would be that of “administrative ease” to the governmental body. That, in turn, is an argument which has never fared well at the hands of the Supreme Court and I reject it here for the simple reason that it is sophistry to suggest a concern with the “administrative burden” of weeding out physically unfit 13 year old females in connection with a football program when there is no concern at all with weeding out physically unfit 13 year old males involved in the same program. In fact, I think, it might be rather difficult to sustain a requirement that females competing for a place on a particular athletic team be subjected to a fitness screening program, when males competing for a place on the same team are subjected to none at all.</p>
<p class="indent">I conclude, accordingly, that there is an insufficient relationship between defendants’ announced goal of “safety” and a rule which automatically excludes all eighth grade females from competing with eighth grade males for a place on a football team. That holding is consistent with the result reached by virtually every other court which has considered this same sort of “safety” argument in connection with male/female competition in contact sports.</p>
<p class="indent">Nichole Force obviously has no legal entitlement to a starting position on the eighth grade football team, since the extent to which she plays must be governed solely by her abilities, as judged by those who coach her. But she seeks no such entitlement here. Instead she seeks simply a chance, like her male counterparts, to display those abilities. She asks, in short, only the right to try.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not suggest there is any such thing as a constitutional “right to try.” But the idea that one should be allowed to try—to succeed or to fail as one’s abilities and fortunes may dictate, but in the process at least to profit by those things which are learned in the trying—is a concept deeply engrained in our way of thinking; and it should indeed require a “substantial” justification to deny that</p>
<p><a id="page_409" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>409</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">privilege to someone simply because she is a female rather than a male. I find no such justification here.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What is the district’s basis for excluding Ms. Force? Are any of its objectives legitimate? If so, why does the court strike down the policy?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The district asserts, and the court accepts, that 13-year-old girls, on average, are more susceptible to injury than boys. Why then isn’t the district’s policy substantially related to an important state interest in safety? Is football safe for any child, male or female? Does the average propensity for injury of either sex have any bearing on the legitimacy of this policy? Recent statistics show that there were 502,000 emergency room visits by children for concussions between 2001 and 2005. Half of these visits were sports related in some respect and, of those sports-related visits, most were in connection with an organized team for football, basketball, baseball, soccer, or ice hockey. During this time period, about 5 out of 1,000 children visited the emergency room in connection with a sport-related concussion. <i>Concussions in Young Athletes on the Rise, Especially in Hockey and Football Players</i>, <span class="smallcap">Sci. Daily</span>, Sept. 10, 2010.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court indicates that separate football teams may be constitutionally permissible. Are there any potential problems with this option?</p>
<p class="indent">4. As you may have noticed in the Title IX excerpts, and as discussed in <i>Force</i>, there is no requirement that schools allow women to try out for men’s contact sports teams. Critics suggest that the exception perpetuates the ideology of male superiority and female fragility, and the rationality of gender segregation and subordination. <i>See</i> Deborah Brake, <i>The Struggle for Sex Equality in Sport and the Theory Behind Title IX</i>, 34 <span class="smallcap">U. Mich. J.L. Reform</span> 13, 144 (2001); Jessica Constance Caggiano, <i>Girls Don’t Just Wanna Have Fun: Moving Past Title IX’s Contact Sports Exception</i>, 72 <span class="smallcap">U. Pitt. L. Rev.</span> 119 (2010). Thus, they advocate for the elimination of the contact sports exception. Moreover, one critic argues that the exception could be eliminated without leading to the parade of horribles assumed by those who defend the exception. For instance, sports teams could be organized by height and weight rather than gender. Boys and girls above a particular height and weight could try out for one team and those below a particular height and weight could try out for the other team. Caggiano, <i>supra</i>, at 140-141. This would preserve the competitive nature of sports while still providing numerous equal opportunities for members of both sexes.</p>
<p class="indent">5. How does the judicial application of the heightened scrutiny standard in <i>Force</i> compare to the application in cases such as <i>VMI</i>? In important respects, the rationale of <i>Force</i> is a forerunner to <i>VMI.</i></p>
<p class="indent">6. As noted by <i>Force</i>, the court in <i>Clark v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n</i>, 695 F.2d 1126, 1131-1132 (9th Cir. 1982), held that the prohibition of males on volleyball teams is substantially related to the important governmental interest of redressing past discrimination against women in athletics and promoting equality of athletic opportunity between the sexes. The court reasoned that</p>
<p><a id="page_410" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>410</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">“due to average physiological differences, males would displace females to a substantial extent if they were allowed to compete for positions on the volleyball team. Thus, athletic opportunities for women would be diminished.” <i>Id.</i> The court argued that this finding was not embracing archaic stereotypes, but rather recognizing physiological differences disadvantaging women. Is this rationale sound?</p>
<p class="indent">7. As the participation levels of women in sports begin to increase and discrimination fades, will the rationale for excluding males from sports like volleyball erode, or will the potential for undermining female opportunities always justify the exclusion of males? If volleyball, like football, is unique, can the state any more deny a boy the experience than it can deny women enrollment in <i>VMI</i> or Ms. Force the opportunity to try out for football? Is the exclusion of males symbolically and practically different than the exclusion of women in that men do not suffer stigma and their inclusion really would undermine equal opportunity for women?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch146">2. <i>Contact Sports Exception</i></p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, Title IX excludes contact sports from the purview of its requirement of gender equality in athletic programs (although <i>Force v. Pierce City School District,</i> 570 F. Supp. 1020 (W.D. Mo. 1983), indicates that equal protection standards still control for public institutions). The Department of Education’s Title IX regulations provide that “[n]o person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.” 34 C.F.R. §106.41(a) (2012). But the very next subsection of the regulations states that, notwithstanding the foregoing,</p>

<p class="noindent">a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of this part, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.</p>

<p class="indent">In <i>Mercer v.

<p class="noindent">sports becomes irrelevant and the institution must comply with the general antidiscrimination provision of Title IX. Based on this rationale, the court of appeals held that Heather Sue Mercer’s allegation that Duke permitted her to try out for the football team and told her she made the team, only to later refuse to permit her to participate as a full member of the team, stated a claim under Title IX. <i>Id</i>. at 648. The court distinguished and rejected other courts’ opinions that suggest that Title IX creates a complete exemption for differential treatment in contact sports. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, Pa., 998 F.2d 168, 174 (3d Cir. 1993). In doing so, the Fourth Circuit became the first court to recognize such a claim. Two lower courts have followed its lead. Phillips v. Anderson Cnty Bd. of Educ., 2006 WL 3759893, at *8 (E.D. Tenn. 2006); Palmer <i>ex rel</i>. Palmer v. Santa Rosa Cnty., Fla., Sch. Bd., 2005 WL 3338724, at *5 (N.D. Fla. 2005).</p>
<p class="indent">Some have argued that the impetus for the Title IX exemption for contact sports, in general, and basketball and football, in particular, is the NCAA’s vigorous lobbying to protect these revenue-producing sports. Crista D. Leahy, <i>The Title Bout: A Critical Review of the Regulation and Enforcement of Title IX in Intercollegiate Athletics</i>, 24 J.C. &amp; U.L. 489, 493-496 (1998).</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="indent">[Title IX athletics regulations] define the term “contact sports” so broadly and arbitrarily that the exception swallows the rule and undermines Title IX’s <i>raison d’etre</i> in the athletic arena. Indeed, their practical impact is that Title IX often functions as an additional impediment to female athletes. As the Third Circuit so aptly described it, “the contact sports exception is…the broadest exception recognized to the overarching goal of equal athletic opportunity.”</p>
<p class="indent">The rationale for female exclusion from contact sports is two-fold. First, powerful lobbies have sought to protect the status-quo ante—the all-male bastions of college basketball and football. Second, powerful and longstanding paternalistic stereotypes focus on the relative fragility of the female body. Such stereotypes posit that no females should play contact sports with males because females are inherently weaker, slower, and less coordinated than males, and thus are prone to debilitating injuries when they play rough sports with males. Such physical stereotypes mix with cultural stereotypes. Our “instincts” may tell us, for example, that there is something unseemly, something dangerous and wrong, about scantily clad females taking scantily clad males to the mat to struggle and strain and sweat in a tumble of flesh, snot, saliva and even blood. Such a scenario is not properly part of a wholesome and egalitarian American education.</p>
<p class="indent">The historic exclusion of females from athletics generally, and particularly from contact sports, combined with cultural taboos for women against developing “male” qualities of physical stamina and strength, muscle mass, and overt aggressive competitiveness, have surely been central components of female dependence and vulnerability to violence. Moreover, benefits touted to justify large expenditures on male athletic opportunities—the emphasis on character building, leadership development, learning team work, learning to excel in highly competitive environments—would equally advantage female citizens in this competitive market economy. Unfettered participation in athletics for women, not as the sexy, silly decorative cheerleaders for male athletes, but as full status athletes entitled to the respect and political and economic opportunities showered upon male athletes would have wide cultural repercussions.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. As indicated above, the Title IX regulations define “contact sports [to] include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.” 34 C.F.R. §106.41(a)-(b) (2012). Is this list of sports and the definition of contact sports either over- or under-inclusive? Are there any other sports that should be included or excluded? What sports may fall into the category of a sport where “the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact”? How would the <i>Mercer</i> and <i>Force</i> courts examine: baseball or ice hockey? <i>See</i> Cook v. Colgate, 802 F. Supp. 737 (N.D.N.Y. 1992); Leffel v. Wis. Interschol. Athletic Ass’n, 444 F. Supp. 1117 (E.D. Wis. 1978); Carnes v. Tenn. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 415 F. Supp. 569 (E.D. Tenn. 1976). Field Hockey? B.C. v. Bd. of Educ. Cumberland Reg’l Sch. Dist., 531 A.2d 1059 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1987); Kleczek v. R.I. Interschol. League, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 951 (D.R.I. 1991); <i>see also Williams</i>, 998 F.2d at 169-170 (holding that the determination of whether field hockey is a contact sport is a triable issue of fact).</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the regulatory contact sports exemption contradict the purpose of Title IX’s athletics provisions? Is it inconsistent with the Constitution? Is the effect of the exemption to perpetuate stereotypes and gender inequities rather than address them?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Some state courts have found that their state constitutional gender discrimination provision prohibits discrimination against women in contact sports. <i>See</i> NOW v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 318 A.2d 33 (N.J. Super. 1974); Commonwealth v. Pa. Interschol. Athletic Ass’n, 334 A.2d 839 (Pa. Commw. 1975); Darrin v. Gould, 540 P.2d 882 (Wash. 1975) (football); <i>see also</i> Att’y Gen. v. Mass. Interschol. Athletic Ass’n, 393 N.E.2d 284 (Mass. 1979) (holding that boys cannot be excluded from girls’ teams).</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch147">3. <i>Determining Equal Treatment Under Title IX’s Athletic Provisions</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Title IX regulations require all educational institutions receiving federal funds to perform self-evaluations and to provide written assurances that the institution is in compliance with the terms of Title IX and its regulations. 34 C.F.R. §106.3-106.4 (2012). The Department of Education looks at ten aspects of a school’s athletic program in assessing whether a school is providing equal treatment:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">(1) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes; (2) The provision of equipment and supplies; (3) Scheduling of games and practice time; (4) Travel and per diem allowance; (5) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring; (6) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors; (7) Provision of locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities; (8) Provision of medical and training facilities and services; (9) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services; (10) Publicity.</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> §106.41(c). Note that the equal treatment factors do not require equal expenditures for male and female teams, although the Department of Education may consider the failure to provide needed funds for teams for one sex in considering equality of opportunity. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">In 1979, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) clarified what it means to “provide equal athletic opportunities for members of both sexes and to effectively accommodate students’ athletic interests and abilities.” Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979) (adopted by the Department of Education when it was established in 1980). The Department of Education articulated a three-part test to guide this inquiry and indicated that a school was in compliance with Title IX if it could meet any one of three following prongs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments; or</li>
<li>Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members of that sex; or</li>
<li>Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot show a history and continuing practice of program expansion, as described above, whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., <i>Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Clarification: The Three-Part Test—Part Three, Dear Colleague Letter</i> 3 (Apr. 20, 2010). This test is essentially a codification of the First Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in <i>Cohen v. Brown University</i>, 991 F.2d 888, 897-898 (1st Cir. 1993). There, the court indicated that the first prong of the test furnishes “a safe harbor for those institutions that have distributed athletic opportunities in numbers ‘substantially proportionate’ to the gender composition of their student bodies.” <i>Id.</i> at 897. By maintaining proportionality between student body composition and athletic opportunities, these institutions are essentially exempted from further compliance analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 898. Of course, most institutions have yet to reach substantial proportionality. For these schools, the court wrote, the second and third prongs exist and “recognize that there are circumstances under which, as a practical matter, something short of this proportionality is a satisfactory proxy for gender balance.” <i>Id.</i> The second prong recognizes that “so long as a university is continually expanding athletic opportunities in an ongoing effort to meet the needs of the underrepresented gender…[Title IX is “satisfied” and] does not require that the university leap to complete gender parity in a single bound.” <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the third prong is met “if the underrepresented sex’s discernible interests are fully and effectively accommodated,” which means that “Title IX does not</p>
<p><a id="page_414" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>414</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">require that the school create teams for, or rain money upon, otherwise disinterested students.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">In 2010, recognizing the practical importance of this third prong, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) clarified what it means to accommodate student interest. OCR posed three questions to determine whether student interests are being accommodated: (1) Is there unmet interest in a particular sport? (2) Is there sufficient ability to sustain a team in the sport? (3) Is there a reasonable expectation of competition for the team? U.S. Dep’t of Educ., <i>Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Clarification, supra</i>, at 4. If the answer to all three questions is yes, a violation exists. The first of these three questions, however, may be the most nebulous. For the first question of unmet interest, OCR examines a number of indicators, including</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">whether an institution uses nondiscriminatory methods of assessment when determining the athletic interests and abilities of its students; whether a viable team for the underrepresented sex recently was eliminated; multiple indicators of interest [(requests by students, participating in club and intramural sports, results of surveys, etc.)]; multiple indicators of ability [(athletic experiences and accomplishments, opinions of coaches, administrators, and athletes, participation in other sports demonstrating skills fundamental to the sport being considered, tryouts)]; and frequency of conducting assessments.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 4-8. OCR noted that “a properly designed and implemented survey is one tool that can assist an institution in capturing information on students’ interests and abilities,” although OCR “will not accept an institution’s reliance on a survey alone, regardless of the response rate, to determine whether it is fully and effectively accommodating the interests and abilities of its underrepresented students.” <i>Id</i>. at 8.</p>
<p class="indent">As to whether there is sufficient ability to sustain a team in a sport, the OCR evaluates factors comparing the minimum number of participants needed for a particular sport, considering skill sets and rates of substitutions and injuries, the size of teams at other schools, and the opinions of coaches concerning the abilities required to field an intercollegiate team. <i>Id.</i> at 12-13. As to the expectation of competition, OCR considers whether there are opportunities to compete against other schools with which the institution currently competes in these sports and whether other schools in the geographic area, which the institution does not currently compete, can provide competitive opportunities. <i>Id.</i> at 13.</p>
<p class="indent">Critics of Title IX’s sports provisions argue that since women are less interested in sports than men, there is no need to take steps to achieve equal opportunity. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Ross A. Jurewitz, <i>Playing at Even Strength: Reforming Title IX Enforcement in Intercollegiate Athletics</i>, 8 <span class="smallcap">Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L.</span> 283, 332-333 (2000); Michael Straubel, <i>Gender Equity, College Sports, Title IX and Group Rights: A Coach’s View</i>, 62 <span class="smallcap">Brook. L. Rev.</span> 1039, 1041-1042 (1996). But as the court in the second appeal of <i>Cohen v. Brown</i> reasoned, women’s lower rate of participation in sports in not because of an inherent lack of interest; it is a result of the limited opportunities women have historically had to participate in athletics. Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 178-179 (1st Cir. 1996). Some scholars go further, arguing that social conditioning devalues women athletes and discourages participation in sports. Thus, female interest is a false measure. </p>
<p><a id="page_415" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>415</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class="smallcap">Nancy Levit &amp; Robert R.M. Verchick</span>, <span class="smallcap">Feminist Legal Theory</span> 114-115 (2006); Jocelyn Samuels, <i>Reviewing the Play: How Faulty Premises Affected the Work of the Commission on Opportunity in Athletics and Why Title IX Protections Are Still Needed to Ensure Equal Opportunity in Athletics</i>, 3 <span class="smallcap">Margins</span> 233, 242 (2003). Outside social forces intentionally stimulate interest in men, but not necessarily in women. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">OCR received extensive criticism for adopting the three-part test as described in <i>Cohen v. Brown</i>. Many argue that since the last two parts are so difficult to meet, the “substantially proportionate” prong has become a quota system, which restricts the ability of schools to establish nonrevenue building sports such as lacrosse, wrestling, or water polo since such schools would be required to establish both a women’s and a men’s team to comply with Title IX. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Victoria Langton, Comment, <i>Stop the Bleeding: Title IX and the Disappearance of Men’s Collegiate Athletic Teams</i>, 12 <span class="smallcap">Vanderbilt J. Ent. &amp; Tech. L.</span> 181 (2008). Others counter this premise, pointing out that (1) only a small percentage of colleges use the “substantially proportionate” measure; (2) support for sports other than football and basketball has increased over the years; (3) men’s sports still receive the vast majority of athletics funds; and (4) the unequal distribution of athletic funds across sports and the bloated budgets provided to football and basketball have just as large an impact on sports offerings as does Title IX concerns. <i>See generally</i> Nat’l Women’s L. Ctr., <i>Title IX and Men’s “Minor” Sports: A False Conflict</i> (July 15, 2008). Regardless, subsequent courts have rejected challenges to the three-part test. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Nat’l Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366 F.3d 930 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <i>cert. denied</i>, 545 U.S. 1104 (2005); Kelley v. Bd. of Trs., Univ. of Ill., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14272, <i>aff’d</i>, 35 F.3d 265 (7th Cir. 1994), <i>cert. denied</i>, 513 U.S. 1128 (1995).</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch148">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education found that the University of North Virginia was denying females equal athletic opportunities. The university responded that it would remedy the disparity within a reasonable period of time. A decade later, however, female participation in intercollegiate athletics at the University of North Virginia continued to be disproportionately lower than female undergraduate enrollment. Women comprised 44 percent of the student body, but they accounted for only 23.4 percent of the university’s intercollegiate athletes.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2010, the university was faced with a significant deficit in its athletic budget and determined that it would need to reduce athletic costs significantly. Determined to field only teams “capable of competing for championships,” the university concluded that it would have to discontinue some teams to eliminate its deficit. The university evaluated all 19 of its sports against seven criteria: (1) whether its conference or the NCAA sponsored a championship in the sport; (2) the tradition of success in the sport; (3) the level of interest and participation in the sport at the high school level; (4) the adequacy of the university’s facilities for the sport; (5) the level of spectator interest; (6) gender and ethnic issues; and</p>
<p><a id="page_416" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>416</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">(7) the cost of the sport. Based on these factors, the university discontinued four teams: men’s swimming, men’s fencing, and men’s and women’s diving. Men’s swimming was selected for termination because the program was historically weak, swimming is not widely offered in high schools, and it does not have a large fan base. The university did not eliminate women’s swimming because the school’s legal counsel advised that such action might lead to noncompliance with Title IX.</p>
<p class="indent">Members of the men’s swimming team are disappointed and have approached you to represent them. Advise them as to the viability of any legal claims they might assert.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch149">H. PREGNANCY</p>
<p class="noindent">Historically, most schools had policies that excluded women from school when they became pregnant or became mothers. While these schools may have eliminated the policies, pregnancy remains a common reason why young women drop out of school. <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Women’s L. Ctr.</span>, <span class="smallcap">How to Keep Pregnant and Parenting Students from Dropping Out: A Primer for Schools</span> 1 (2007) (noting that “one-quarter to one-third of female dropouts say that pregnancy…played a role in their decision to leave school”). Only about half of women who become mothers during high school ultimately receive a high school diploma by age 22, whereas 90 percent of other female students will earn their diploma. Saul D. Hoffman, <i>By the Numbers—The Public Costs of Teen Childbearing,</i> <span class="smallcap">National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy</span> 14 (2006). Recognizing the unique educational challenges these young women face, Title IX regulations prohibit discrimination against pregnant students:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student’s pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">34 C.F.R. §106.40(b)(1) (2012). Although a school may require certification of the pregnancy, a Title IX recipient must treat pregnancy and related conditions as “any other temporary disability” and allow “a leave of absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student’s physician.” <i>Id.</i> §106.40(b)(2)-(b)(5). These and other regulations are generally designed to achieve three goals: (1) preventing schools from excluding pregnant students from mainstream education programs and extracurricular activities; (2) ensuring pregnant students have a choice in whether to stay in the mainstream classroom or to attend alternative programs; and (3) delivering pregnant students educational opportunities that are comparable in quality to the education other students receive. <i>See generally</i> Kendra Fershee, <i>Hollow Promises for Pregnant</i></p>
<p><a id="page_417" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>417</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Students: How the Regulations Governing Title IX Fail to Protect Pregnancy Discrimination in Schools</i>, 43 <span class="smallcap">Ind. L. Rev.</span> 79, 84-93 (2009).</p>
<p class="indent">Title IX makes clear that a school or activity cannot exclude students for becoming or being pregnant or a parent, but the extent to which they can punish students for sexual activity presents more complex issues. For instance, some school activities such as National Honor Society may include a “moral character” component, which officials might interpret premarital sex as violating. Pregnancy by an unmarried student amounts to per se evidence of premarital sex. The next two cases examine the question of whether enforcement of such policies constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender or whether they are legitimate attempts to regulate student behavior akin to any number of other discipline and character policies. Closely related is the question of whether the disparate impact alone of such policies amounts to a violation of Title IX or whether plaintiffs must establish that the policies are intentionally discriminatory.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch150">Pfeiffer v. School Board for Marion Center Area</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>917 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1990)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The major question in this appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding that there was no violation of Title IX, when Arlene Pfeiffer was dismissed as a member of a high school chapter of the National Honor Society. The district court found that she was dismissed because of premarital sexual activity and not because of gender discrimination. [W]e hold that the finding was not clearly erroneous and accordingly affirm this determination of the court.</p>
<p class="indent">We are troubled, however, with an evidentiary ruling that excluded the testimony of a male student member of the school’s chapter of the National Honor Society. We remand, therefore, for the limited purpose of admitting the proffered testimony. We hold that this testimony has the potential of being relevant to whether there was discriminatory intent by members of the faculty council to dismiss Pfeiffer from the high school chapter.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">The appellant, Arlene Pfeiffer, was a member of the class of 1984 at the Marion Center Area High School in Marion, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. [Based on her high grades, service as president of the student council, and other accolades,] she was elected to her high school’s chapter of the National Honor Society (NHS) in 1981. During the spring of 1983, Pfeiffer, who was unmarried, discovered that she was pregnant [and informed various guidance counselors and the principal]. Principal Stewart told her that he saw no problem in her plan to continue school and graduate.</p>
<p class="indent">The handbook for the National Honor Society requires that students be selected for membership on the basis of scholarship, service, leadership and character. The high school had a selection procedure which followed the national organization’s instructions, in which these qualities were assessed by</p>
<p><a id="page_418" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>418</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">teachers. To be admitted into the NHS, a student was rated by at least five teachers. In the instructions under the heading “Leadership” one of the qualities to be assessed was whether the student exerted the type of leadership which directly influences others for good conduct. Another quality to be assessed under the heading “Character” was whether the student upholds principles of morality and ethics.</p>
<p class="indent">[On learning of Pfeiffer’s pregnancy, the faculty council for NHS scheduled a meeting in the fall of 1983. At the meeting, “council members explained to her that her NHS membership was in question because premarital sex appeared to be contrary to the qualities of leadership and character essential for membership,” but the council took no immediate action against her. In a second meeting prompted by a request from Pfeiffer’s father, the council, by secret ballot, voted unanimously to dismiss her from the NHS. The stated basis was Pfeiffer’s “[f]ailure to uphold the high standards of leadership and character required for admission and maintenance of membership. It is the opinion of the faculty council that a member must consistently set a positive example for others and, as outlined in the selection guidelines, always uphold all of the high standards of moral conduct.” Pfeiffer’s parents then appealed the council’s determination to the school board. After a public meeting with the parents and their counsel, the board unanimously affirmed Pfeiffer’s dismissal from NHS.]</p>
<p class="indent">After graduation from high school, with honors, Pfeiffer elected not to go to college and began working with the Holiday Inn of Indiana, where she is presently a sales manager. She is married, but not to the father of the child conceived while she was in school.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">During a bench trial, the court heard testimony that the school district keeps no records of a student’s extracurricular activities and that there are no records therefore concerning Pfeiffer’s induction or absence thereof, or of her membership in the NHS. The NHS no longer exists at Marion Center Area High School and the national organization is no longer a party to this suit.</p>
<p class="indent">Testimony was presented that a pregnant female student had resigned from the NHS chapter after an admission of engaging in premarital sex 10 to 12 years earlier. She apparently had been given the choice of resignation or dismissal by the faculty council. No male member of the chapter has ever been dismissed for premarital sexual activity. The appellant offered to introduce testimony by a former student who was a male member of the chapter, that two years after Pfeiffer’s dismissal, while a senior at the high school he impregnated his girlfriend and that he was not dismissed from the chapter. The district court excluded the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">After considering the admitted evidence, the district court made a factual finding that the plaintiff was not dismissed for her pregnancy but because the faculty council concluded that she had failed to uphold the standards of the National Honor Society by engaging in premarital sexual intercourse.</p>
<p><a id="page_419" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>419</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">V</span></p>
<p class="indent">Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 provides, in part, as follows: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. §1681(a). Regulations promulgated pursuant to Title IX specifically apply its prohibition against gender discrimination to discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, parental status, and marital status. Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. §106.40 (1980), “A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student’s actual or potential parental, family, or marital status which treats students differently on the basis of sex.…A recipient shall not discriminate against any student or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student’s pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.”</p>
<p class="indent">The district court held that the faculty council and the school board did not violate Title IX or the regulations because the plaintiff was not dismissed from the NHS because of her pregnancy but because the faculty council considered premarital sex as setting an example inconsistent with the objectives and standards of the Honor Society.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VI</span></p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Wort v. Vierling</i>, No. 82-3169, slip op. (C.D. Ill. Sept. 4, 1984), the court held that a school district’s dismissal of a pregnant student from the National Honor Society was a violation both of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. In <i>Wort</i>, the court concluded that “[p]laintiff was dismissed from the NHS because of her pregnancy or the acts leading up to her pregnancy.”</p>
<p class="indent">In reaching that decision, the court in <i>Wort</i> declined to distinguish the sexual conduct from the resulting pregnancy. But the district court here did make this distinction. It specifically found that Pfeiffer was dismissed not because she was pregnant but because she had engaged in premarital sexual activity. This is an important distinction between the two cases. Regulation of conduct of unmarried high school student members is within the realm of authority of the National Honor Society given its emphasis on leadership and character.</p>
<p class="indent">In any event, the appellant’s entire argument before us rests upon her allegation that she was dismissed from the chapter because of her condition of pregnancy. Unfortunately for her theory, however, the district court found that “[t]he plaintiff was not dismissed for her pregnancy but because the council thought she had failed to uphold the standards [of the NHS].” As a finding of fact, this holding may not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. We do not believe that it is erroneous. Supporting this finding is the stated reason given by the council for her dismissal: Failure to uphold the standards of leadership and character required for admission and maintenance of membership. Moreover,</p>
<p><a id="page_420" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>420</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the finding is supported by the testimony of the faculty council members before the district court, each of whom testified at trial. Each faculty council member specifically denied that his or her dismissal vote was based anywhere on Pfeiffer’s sex, on her pregnancy, or on her failure to marry after she had engaged in premarital sexual activity.</p>
<p class="indent">This factual finding is bolstered by the district court’s reasoning that “[f]aced with the task of educating hundreds of young people, and with constant demand by the public that the schools instill attributes of good character as part of the educational process, the Council and the Board can scarcely be criticized for taking the action which was taken.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, the Supreme Court has given us express guidance in matters relating to student conduct in public schools: “The process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum, and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order. Consciously or otherwise, teachers—and indeed the older students—demonstrate the appropriate form of…conduct and deportment in and out of class. Inescapably, like parents, they are role models. The schools, as instruments of the state, may determine that the essential lessons of civil, mature conduct cannot be conveyed in a school that tolerates lewd, indecent, or offensive speech and conduct.…” <i>Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser</i>, 478 U.S. 675, 683 (1986).</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VII</span></p>
<p class="indent">More difficult, however, is appellant’s contention that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony of a former student, a male member of the Marion Center Area High School chapter of the NHS. At trial, [plaintiff’s counsel attempted to introduce testimony by a former student that he had engaged in premarital sex, which some members of the school would have been aware of based on his fiancée’s pregnancy. Plaintiff’s counsel also proffered evidence regarding another male high school student was commonly known to have engaged in premarital sex and that the council had not taken action against either of these males.]</p>
<p class="indent">We find this evidence can possibly be relevant to the state of mind of the faculty council [regarding Pfeiffer], and whether the council and the board’s explanation for their actions was pretextual when they dismissed Pfeiffer. The proffered testimony is relevant to the issue of intentional discrimination. We, therefore, disagree with the district court’s exclusion of it on the grounds that the events in the proffer post-dated by some years the [action against Pfeiffer]. [W]e believe that the evidence has the potential of being relevant to whether the council members followed a double standard in evaluating premarital sexual activities of NHS chapter members. Under these circumstances, to exclude it was not consistent with sound exercise of discretion.</p>
<p class="indent">However, in directing that this testimony be considered, we are not saying that the proffer was sufficient. For example, all the proffer said was that the male student “had informed his teacher and other members of the Marion Center community that he was the father and that he had got married because his</p>
<p><a id="page_421" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>421</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">[fiancée] had gotten pregnant.” There is nothing in the proffer declaring that any member of the council had any knowledge of this situation.</p>
<p class="indent">What is important to the ultimate determination is what information was communicated to the council members. Lacking such communication, the testimony may not even be relevant. Moreover, even if the district court finds that the council did know of the male student’s premarital sexual activity and did nothing about it, this by itself does not require the district court to make automatic findings one way or another. By remanding, we only instruct the district court to consider the proffered testimony for what it may be worth.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VIII</span></p>
<p class="indent">[The Court notes that the Supreme Court has not decided whether intent is a necessary element for a claim under Title IX, but notes that “we need not meet this problem because the gravamen of Pfeiffer’s complaint is that she was intentionally discriminated against in violation of Title IX and its implementing regulations. This is, therefore, not a case of discriminatory effect, but one of discriminatory intention. We find it sufficient to allow a remedy of compensatory damages when a plaintiff alleges and then establishes discriminatory intent.”]</p>

<p class="indent">The court in <i>Chipman v. Grant County School District</i> takes a different approach from <i>Pfeiffer</i> and is skeptical of whether premarital sex can realistically be distinguished from pregnancy given the way in which schools typically enforce the policy. Questions and comments regarding both <i>Pfeiffer</i> and <i>Chipman</i> follow the <i>Chipman</i> excerpt. Compare the differing approaches as you read <i>Chipman</i>.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch151">Chipman v. Grant County School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>30 F. Supp. 2d 975 (E.D. Ky. 1998)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Title IX regulation[s] unequivocally prohibit[t] pregnancy discrimination by the defendants. Although its language is somewhat different, its purpose is generally the same as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Therefore, the court believes precedents under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act are applicable here.</p>
<p class="indent">Use of a disparate impact theory for proving discrimination is well recognized in pregnancy cases. It has long been recognized that the anti-discrimination laws prohibit “both overt discrimination, as well as practices that are fair in form but discriminatory in operation.” The plaintiff’s burden in a disparate impact case “is to prove that a particular…practice has caused a significant</p>
<p><a id="page_422" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>422</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">adverse effect on a protected group. Once the plaintiff establishes the adverse effect, the burden shifts to the [defendant] to produce evidence that the challenged practice is a…necessity.”</p>
<p class="indent">When a disparate impact analysis is applied to the evidence now of record in the instant case, the balance tips decidedly in favor of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have met their burden of proving that the challenged practices of the defendants in screening students for admission to the NHS has caused a significant adverse effect on the protected group, i.e., young women who have become pregnant from premarital sex and have become visibly pregnant. Statistically, 100% of such young women are not admitted to the [Grant County National Honor Society (GCNHS)]. Although the defendants argue that they are not basing their decision on pregnancy, but rather on non-marital sexual relations, the disparate impact on young women such as the plaintiffs is apparent.</p>
<p class="indent">Although 100% of young women who are visibly pregnant or who have had a child out of wedlock are denied membership, as far as the record reflects, defendants’ policy excludes 0% of young men who have had premarital sexual relations and 0% of young women who have had such relations but have not become pregnant or have elected to have an early abortion.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants claim that they would also exclude such students from the NHS membership but none have ever come to their attention. It may be that the discriminatory impact resulting from this policy is unintentional but proof of intentional discrimination is not required under a disparate impact theory.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs having met their initial burden of showing the significant adverse impact of defendants’ policy, the burden now shifts to the defendants to show that the challenged practice is a reasonable necessity. The defendants have not met such burden on the record now before the court. There are many alternate means to assess the character of candidates for membership in the NHS by non-discriminatory criteria. Therefore the court holds that plaintiffs’ probability of success herein is very high using a disparate impact theory.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is “premarital sex contrary to the qualities of leadership and character essential for membership” in the National Honor Society? Is premarital sex an indication of a failure to “uphold high standards of moral conduct”? Is punishing students for premarital sex a form of discrimination based on marital status? If so, would that place the issue of voluntary sexual behavior beyond the purview of school regulation?</p>
<p class="indent">2. As discussed in <i>Pfeiffer</i> and <i>Chipman</i>, courts endeavor to determine whether the exclusion of a pregnant student is gender-based discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause and pregnancy discrimination under Title IX, or is based on prohibitions on premarital sex. Further, there is an inconsistency among courts over whether plaintiffs can prove Title IX pregnancy discrimination under a disparate impact theory. <i>Pfeiffer</i> required proof of intent, while <i>Chipman</i> held that disparate impact was sufficient, relying on authority</p>
<p><a id="page_423" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>423</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">from two other courts. <i>But see</i> Hall v. Lee Coll., 932 F. Supp. 1027, 1031-1033 (E.D. Tenn. 1996) (refusing to examine Title IX’s pregnancy regulations to evaluate the suspension of a pregnant student for premarital sex, arguing that the policy was gender neutral). The Supreme Court has not resolved this split of opinion. <i>See generally</i> Michelle Gough, <i>Parenting and Pregnant Students: An Evaluation of the Implementation of the “Other” Title IX</i>, 17 <span class="smallcap">Mich. J. Gender &amp; L.</span> 211, 229-234, 248 (2011). Which court’s rationale is most compelling? Given the real difference between the sexes in regard to pregnancy and its obvious connection to sex, are distinctions between punishment for pregnancy and premarital sex reliable, or do they just invite biased enforcement? If a school cannot punish students for premarital pregnancy, why should it be able to punish them for premarital sex?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Is it possible that some differential treatment of students for premarital sex is a result of lax enforcement and/or a certain level of respect for student privacy as opposed to gender discrimination? A school might want to prohibit premarital sex as a general principle while at the same time having little interest in seeking it out. Nonetheless, when the school is presented with an obvious infraction based on pregnancy, the school might believe it must either abandon its position or enforce the rule against the pregnant student. Is there any other choice? Is enforcing the rule discrimination? Even if discrimination is not necessarily involved, is it likely enough as a general principle to follow the rationale in <i>Chipman</i>?</p>
<p class="indent">4. One scholar argues that the Title IX pregnancy regulations are insufficient to effectively prevent pregnancy discrimination:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">First, they have no specific mandates requiring schools to report the numbers of pregnant students who drop out of school, choose to attend alternative schools, or what academic requirements are in place for pregnant students at alternative schools. Second, they do not provide adequate enforcement mechanisms to catch violations of the Regulations and Title IX when they occur. Third, they do not require routine reviews of Recipients. Fourth, the provision requiring that any alternative education available to pregnant students must be comparable to that available to non-pregnant students fails to include specific strictures to ensure that pregnant students are not receiving inferior opportunities. Fifth, the Regulations lack directives for school administrators in the role of advising pregnant students about their options and rights under Title IX.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Kendra Fershee, <i>Hollow Promises for Pregnant Students: How the Regulations Governing Title IX Fail to Protect Pregnancy Discrimination in Schools</i>, 43 <span class="smallcap">Ind. L. Rev.</span> 79, 94 (2009). Most important, there is some ambiguity over whether the Title IX pregnancy regulations provide a private cause of action, particularly under disparate impact theories post-<i>Sandoval. See generally id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">5. In response to high dropout rates among pregnant teens and mothers, many communities have established alternative schools and supplemental programs to assist pregnant students in continuing their education. <i>See generally</i> Tamara S. Ling, Comment, <i>Lifting Voices: Towards Equal Education for Pregnant and Parenting Students in New York City</i>, 29 <span class="smallcap">Fordham Urb. L.J.</span> 2387, 2400-2407 (2002); Monica J. Stamm, Note, <i>A Skeleton in the Closet: Single-Sex Schools for Pregnant Girls</i>, 98 <span class="smallcap">Colum. L. Rev.</span> 1203 (1998). Title IX demands that alternative</p>
<p><a id="page_424" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>424</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">programs be voluntary, requires that students be told of the educational options available in both mainstream classes and alternative programs, and prohibits advising the student to transfer to a pregnancy school. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Wendy C. Wolf, Ctr. for Assessment &amp; Pol’y Dev.</span>, <span class="smallcap">Using Title IX to Protect the Rights of Pregnant and Parenting Teens</span> (1999). Some argue that these special programs are necessary, while others argue that mainstream programs need to be more accommodating of the needs of pregnant and parenting students. <i>See generally</i> Ling, <i>supra</i> at 2407-2408.</p>
<p class="indent">6. What kind of accommodations should schools be required to provide to their pregnant and parenting students? Some courts have required significant accommodations, including the provision of childcare and reasonable accommodations for course and exam schedules. <i>See, e.g.,</i> De La Cruz v. Tormey, 582 F.2d 45 (9th Cir. 1978) (childcare facilities); Hogan v. Ogden, No. Cu-06-5078 EFS, 2008 WL 2954245 (E.D. Wash. July 30, 2008) (exam schedule alteration). Requiring schools to respond to pregnant and parenting students’ needs, however, does not mean schools lack discretion in how they meet those needs. It may be enough that a school provides students viable options, even if the options are not the ones a student would prefer. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Darian v. Univ. of Mass., Boston, 980 F. Supp. 77 (D. Mass. 1997) (finding no violation where the school offered “an array of remedial measures” to reasonably accommodate the student); <i>see also</i> Ivan v. Kent State Univ., 863 F. Supp. 581, 583 (N.D. Ohio 1994) (finding that pregnant student was treated differently because of her poor performance, not gender or pregnancy).</p>
<p class="indent">7. An important issue is the extent of privacy protections for pregnant students. Are schools allowed to provide, administer, or require pregnancy tests? <i>See</i> Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, 295 (3d Cir. 2000) (requiring a pregnancy test is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment); Villaneuva v. San Marco Consol. Ind. Sch. Dist., No. A-05-CA-455LY, 2006 WL 2591082, at *8 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 7, 2006) (same). If, however, a school becomes aware of a student’s pregnancy, lower courts have upheld schools’ discretion to notify the student’s parents and other administrators. <i>See</i> Port Wash. Teacher’s Ass’n v. Bd. of Educ. of the Port Wash. Union Free Sch. Dist., 361 F. Supp. 2d 69 (E.D.N.Y. 2005); Holt v. Super. Ct., No. B157647, 2002 WL 1399106 (2d Cir. June 28, 2002).</p>
<p class="indent">8. Equal protection jurisprudence asks whether “similarly situated” individuals have been treated differently. The problem with pregnancy-related issues is that males and females are not similarly situated. Thus, some argue that males and females should not be treated as such for equal protection purposes. In <i>Kicklighter v. Evans County School District</i>, 968 F. Supp. 712 (S.D. Ga. 1997), <i>aff’d</i>, 140 F.3d 1043 (11th Cir. 1998), a case where the plaintiff did not make a Title IX claim, a student alleged that she was suspended for becoming pregnant with a man of a different race, but the school argued that she was suspended for disrupting class. 968 F. Supp. at 714, 720. The court rejected her claim, reasoning that she had not been treated differently from other pregnant students, who were the similarly situated persons to whom she should be compared. <i>Id.</i> at 720; <i>see also</i> Kendra Fershee, <i>An Act for All Contexts: Incorporating the Pregnancy Discrimination Act into Title IX to Help Pregnant Students Gain and</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Retain Access to Education</i>, 39 <span class="smallcap">Hofstra L. Rev.</span> 281, 313 (2010) (arguing that the “court’s narrow construction of who is similarly situated essentially makes it impossible that a pregnant student could win a claim for pregnancy discrimination, unless there were other pregnant students in the school who also had discipline problems” but had been treated differently).</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch152">I. SEXUAL HARASSMENT</p>
<p class="noindent">In a 1986 employment case, the Supreme Court held that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination “based on sex.” Meritor Sav. Bank F.S.B. v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986). The Court reasoned:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Sexual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality. Surely, a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 67 (quoting Henson v. Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (1982)). Six years later, the Supreme Court extended this reasoning to Title IX in <i>Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools</i>, 503 U.S. 60, 75 (1992). Title IX placed the duty on the Gwinnett County Public Schools not to discriminate on the basis of sex, and “when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate’s sex, that supervisor ‘discriminate[s]’ on the basis of sex.” <i>Id.</i> at 75 (quoting <i>Meritor Sav. Bank</i>, 477 U.S. at 64). While <i>Franklin</i> recognized that sexual harassment could be gender discrimination within the meaning of Title IX, the case did not define the contours of prohibited sexual harassment. Questions quickly arose as to whether a school’s liability is dependent on who the harasser is and on whether any particular level of severity is required for the harassment to be actionable. The Court answered the first of these questions in <i>Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District</i>, 524 U.S. 274 (1998).</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Gebser</i>, a teacher had sexually harassed a student, but the Court indicated that a school is not automatically liable under Title IX for all sexual harassment that occurs at school or by its employees. The Court distinguished between schools’ agents (such as their administrators and officials) and their employees (teachers and staff). To be liable for the sexual harassment of an employee under Title IX, the Court held that “an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures” must have “actual knowledge of discrimination…and fail[] adequately to respond.” <i>Id.</i> at 276. The Court labeled this inadequate response as “deliberate indifference to discrimination.” <i>Id.</i> The Court reasoned that liability was appropriate when a school is deliberately indifferent to harassment because the school is not being held liable for someone else’s action but for its own official decision not to remedy the discrimination. When harassment by nonagents occurs on campus</p>
<p><a id="page_426" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>426</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and the school is unaware of it, the Court reasoned that the school itself has not engaged in any type of prohibited activity for which it ought to be liable under Title IX.</p>
<p class="indent">This holding strikes those familiar with employment law as odd given that employers are generally liable for the torts of their employees under principles of vicarious liability. The Court’s holding in <i>Gebser</i> did not affect schools’ vicariously liability under state tort law. The Court simply refused to import those same concepts into Title IX, finding vicarious liability incompatible with the statute’s intent and text.</p>
<p class="indent">The following year in <i>Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</i> the Court took up the question of whether a school might also be liable for student-on-student sexual harassment. The Court was willing to accept the notion that some student-on-student sexual harassment can give rise to a cause of action. If a school is deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, it theoretically makes little difference whether it is harassment by students or teachers. However, the Court recognized that students, due to their immaturity, frequently mistreat one another, and distinguishing sexual harassment from adolescent misbehavior is key. As you read <i>Davis</i>, consider whether the Court was correct to extend its concept of deliberate indifference to student-on-student sexual harassment, whether the Court drew the appropriate line between harassment and misbehavior, and whether its standard can be reliably applied.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch153">Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>526 U.S. 629 (1999)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice O’Connor</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner brought suit against the Monroe County Board of Education and other defendants, alleging that her fifth grade daughter had been the victim of sexual harassment by another student. We consider here whether a private damages action may lie against the school board in cases of student-on-student harassment. We conclude that it may, but only where the funding recipient acts with deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or activities. Moreover, we conclude that such an action will lie only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner’s minor daughter, LaShonda, was allegedly the victim of a prolonged pattern of sexual harassment by one of her fifth-grade classmates at Hubbard Elementary School, a public school in Monroe County, Georgia. According to petitioner’s complaint, the harassment began in December 1992, when the classmate, G.F., attempted to touch LaShonda’s breasts and genital area and made vulgar statements such as “‘I want to get in bed with you’” and “‘I want to feel your boobs.’” Similar conduct allegedly occurred on or about January 4 and January 20, 1993. LaShonda [and her mother] reported each of these</p>
<p><a id="page_427" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>427</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">incidents to her classroom teacher, Diane Fort[, who] allegedly assured petitioner that the school principal had been informed. Petitioner contends that, notwithstanding these reports, no disciplinary action was taken against G.F.</p>
<p class="indent">G.F.’s conduct allegedly continued for many months [and included conduct such as rubbing his body against LaShonda in a sexually suggestive manner, all of which LaShonda and her mother allegedly reported to teachers]. The string of incidents finally ended in mid-May, when G.F. was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, sexual battery for his misconduct. The complaint alleges that LaShonda had suffered during the months of harassment; specifically, her previously high grades allegedly dropped as she became unable to concentrate on her studies, and, in April 1993, her father discovered that she had written a suicide note. The complaint further alleges that, at one point, LaShonda told petitioner that she “‘didn’t know how much longer she could keep [G.F.] off her.’”</p>
<p class="indent">Nor was LaShonda G.F.’s only victim; it is alleged that other girls in the class fell prey to G.F.’s conduct. When petitioner inquired [in May of 1993] as to what action the school intended to take against G.F., [the principal] simply stated, “I guess I’ll have to threaten him a little bit harder.” Yet, petitioner alleges, at no point during the many months of his reported misconduct was G.F. disciplined for harassment. <i>Id.</i> Indeed, [the principal] allegedly asked petitioner why LaShonda “was the only one complaining.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nor, according to the complaint, was any effort made to separate G.F. and LaShonda. On the contrary, only after more than three months of reported harassment was she even permitted to change her classroom seat so that she was no longer seated next to G.F. Moreover, petitioner alleges that, at the time of the events in question, the Monroe County Board of Education (Board) had not instructed its personnel on how to respond to peer sexual harassment and had not established a policy on the issue.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">[A]t issue here is the question whether a recipient of federal education funding may be liable for damages under Title IX under any circumstances for discrimination in the form of student-on-student sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner emphasizes that the statute prohibits a student from being “<i>subjected to discrimination</i> under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” It is Title IX’s “unmistakable focus on the benefited class,” <i>Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago</i>, 441 U.S. 677, 691 (1979), rather than the perpetrator, that, in petitioner’s view, compels the conclusion that the statute works to protect students from the discriminatory misconduct of their peers.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, however, we are asked to do more than define the scope of the behavior that Title IX proscribes. We must determine whether a district’s failure to respond to student-on-student harassment can support a private suit for money damages. This Court has indeed recognized an implied private right of action under Title IX, <i>see Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago</i>, and we have held that money</p>
<p><a id="page_428" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>428</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">damages are available, <i>Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch.,</i> 503 U.S. 60 (1992). Because we have repeatedly treated Title IX as legislation enacted pursuant to Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause, however, private damages actions are available only where recipients of federal funding had adequate notice that they could be liable for the conduct at issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents contend that the statute only proscribes misconduct by grant recipients, not third parties. Respondents argue, moreover, that it would be contrary to the very purpose of Spending Clause legislation to impose liability on a funding recipient for the misconduct of third parties, over whom recipients exercise little control.</p>
<p class="indent">We agree with respondents that a recipient of federal funds may be liable in damages under Title IX only for its own misconduct. The recipient itself must “exclud[e] [persons] from participation in,…den[y][persons] the benefits of, or…subjec[t] [persons] to discrimination under” its “program[s] or activit[ies]” in order to be liable under Title IX. The Government’s enforcement power may only be exercised against the funding recipient, and we have not extended damages liability under Title IX to parties outside the scope of this power.</p>
<p class="indent">We disagree with respondents’ assertion, however, that petitioner seeks to hold the Board liable for G.F.’s actions instead of its own. Here, petitioner attempts to hold the Board liable for its <i>own</i> decision to remain idle in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its schools. In <i>Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> we concluded that a recipient of federal education funds may be liable in damages under Title IX where it is deliberately indifferent to known acts of sexual harassment by a teacher. [Our holding in <i>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman</i>, 451 U.S. 1 (1981), requires that the funding recipients have notice of their potential liability for damages, but <i>Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission of New York City</i> establishes that the general requirement of notice does not act as a bar of liability where the funding recipient intentionally violates the terms of Title IX.]</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Gebser</i> thus established that a recipient intentionally violates Title IX, and is subject to a private damages action, where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of teacher-student discrimination. Indeed, whether viewed as “discriminat[ing]” or “subject[ing]” students to discrimination, Title IX “[u]nquestionably…placed on [the Board] the duty not” to permit teacher-student harassment in its schools, <i>Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch.,</i> and recipients violate Title IX’s plain terms when they remain deliberately indifferent to this form of misconduct.</p>
<p class="indent">We consider here whether the misconduct identified in <i>Gebser</i>—deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment—amounts to an intentional violation of Title IX, capable of supporting a private damages action, when the harasser is a student rather than a teacher. We conclude that, in certain limited circumstances, it does. As an initial matter, in <i>Gebser</i> we expressly rejected the use of agency principles in the Title IX context, noting the textual differences between Title IX and Title VII. Additionally, the regulatory scheme surrounding Title IX has long provided funding recipients with notice that they may be liable for their failure to respond to the discriminatory acts of certain nonagents. The</p>
<p><a id="page_429" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>429</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Department of Education requires recipients to monitor third parties for discrimination in specified circumstances and to refrain from particular forms of interaction with outside entities that are known to discriminate. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 34 C.F.R. §§106.31(b)(6), 106.31(d), 106.37(a)(2), 106.38(a), 106.51(a)(3) (1998). The common law, too, has put schools on notice that they may be held responsible under state law for their failure to protect students from the tortious acts of third parties. In fact, state courts routinely uphold claims alleging that schools have been negligent in failing to protect their students from the torts of their peers.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that the identity of the harasser is irrelevant. On the contrary, both the “deliberate indifference” standard and the language of Title IX narrowly circumscribe the set of parties whose known acts of sexual harassment can trigger some duty to respond on the part of funding recipients. Deliberate indifference makes sense as a theory of direct liability under Title IX only where the funding recipient has some control over the alleged harassment. A recipient cannot be directly liable for its indifference where it lacks the authority to take remedial action.</p>
<p class="indent">The language of Title IX itself—particularly when viewed in conjunction with the requirement that the recipient have notice of Title IX’s prohibitions to be liable for damages—also cabins the range of misconduct that the statute proscribes. The statute’s plain language confines the scope of prohibited conduct based on the recipient’s degree of control over the harasser and the environment in which the harassment occurs. If a funding recipient does not engage in harassment directly, it may not be liable for damages unless its deliberate indifference “subject[s]” its students to harassment. That is, the deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, “cause [students] to undergo” harassment or “make them liable or vulnerable” to it. Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1415 (1966) (defining “subject” as “to cause to undergo the action of something specified; expose” or “to make liable or vulnerable; lay open; expose”). Moreover, because the harassment must occur “under” “the operations of” a funding recipient, the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district’s control.</p>
<p class="indent">These factors combine to limit a recipient’s damages liability to circumstances wherein the recipient exercises substantial control over both the harasser and the context in which the known harassment occurs. Only then can the recipient be said to “expose” its students to harassment or “cause” them to undergo it “under” the recipient’s programs. We agree with the dissent that these conditions are satisfied most easily and most obviously when the offender is an agent of the recipient. We, however, disagree that the term “under” somehow imports an agency requirement into Title IX. As noted above, the theory in <i>Gebser</i> was that the recipient was <i>directly</i> liable for its deliberate indifference to discrimination. Liability in that case did not arise because the “teacher’s actions [were] treated” as those of the funding recipient; the district was directly liable for its <i>own</i> failure to act.</p>
<p class="indent">Where, as here, the misconduct occurs during school hours and on school grounds—the bulk of G.F.’s misconduct, in fact, took place in the classroom—the misconduct is taking place “under” an “operation” of the funding recipient. In these circumstances, the recipient retains substantial control over the context in which the harassment occurs. More importantly, however, in this setting the Board exercises significant control over the harasser. We thus conclude that</p>
<p><a id="page_430" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>430</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">recipients of federal funding may be liable for “subject[ing]” their students to discrimination where the recipient is deliberately indifferent to known acts of student-on-student sexual harassment and the harasser is under the school’s disciplinary authority.</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of the events in question here, in fact, school attorneys and administrators were being told that student-on-student harassment could trigger liability under Title IX. [The National School Boards Association released a publication in March 1993, “even as the events alleged in petitioner’s complaint were unfolding,” which observed that districts could be liable under Title IX for their failure to respond to student-on-student harassment. The OCR also recently adopted policy guidelines providing that student-on-student harassment falls within the scope of Title IX’s proscriptions.]</p>
<p class="indent">We stress that our conclusion here—that recipients may be liable for their deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment—does not mean that recipients can avoid liability only by purging their schools of actionable peer harassment or that administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action. We thus disagree with respondents’ contention that, if Title IX provides a cause of action for student-on-student harassment, “nothing short of expulsion of every student accused of misconduct involving sexual overtones would protect school systems from liability or damages.” Likewise, the dissent erroneously imagines that victims of peer harassment now have a Title IX right to make particular remedial demands. In fact, as we have previously noted, courts should refrain from second-guessing the disciplinary decisions made by school administrators.</p>
<p class="indent">School administrators will continue to enjoy the flexibility they require so long as funding recipients are deemed “deliberately indifferent” to acts of student-on-student harassment only where the recipient’s response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. We believe that the standard set out here is sufficiently flexible to account both for the level of disciplinary authority available to the school and for the potential liability arising from certain forms of disciplinary action. A university might not, for example, be expected to exercise the same degree of control over its students that a grade school would enjoy and it would be entirely reasonable for a school to refrain from a form of disciplinary action that would expose it to constitutional or statutory claims.</p>
<p class="indent">While it remains to be seen whether petitioner can show that the Board’s response to reports of G.F.’s misconduct was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, petitioner may be able to show that the Board “subject[ed]” LaShonda to discrimination by failing to respond in any way over a period of five months to complaints of G.F.’s in-school misconduct from LaShonda and other female students.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The requirement that recipients receive adequate notice of Title IX’s proscriptions also bears on the proper definition of “discrimination” in the context of a private damages action. We have elsewhere concluded that sexual</p>
<p><a id="page_431" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>431</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">harassment is a form of discrimination for Title IX purposes and that Title IX proscribes harassment with sufficient clarity to satisfy <i>Pennhurst’s</i> notice requirement and serve as a basis for a damages action. Having previously determined that “sexual harassment” is “discrimination” in the school context under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude that student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination actionable under the statute. The statute’s other prohibitions, moreover, help give content to the term “discrimination” in this context. Students are not only protected from discrimination, but also specifically shielded from being “excluded from participation in” or “denied the benefits of” any “education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”§1681(a). The statute makes clear that, whatever else it prohibits, students must not be denied access to educational benefits and opportunities on the basis of gender. We thus conclude that funding recipients are properly held liable in damages only where they are deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, of which they have actual knowledge, that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.</p>
<p class="indent">The most obvious example of student-on-student sexual harassment capable of triggering a damages claim would thus involve the overt, physical deprivation of access to school resources. Consider, for example, a case in which male students physically threaten their female peers every day, successfully preventing the female students from using a particular school resource—an athletic field or a computer lab, for instance. District administrators are well aware of the daily ritual, yet they deliberately ignore requests for aid from the female students wishing to use the resource. The district’s knowing refusal to take any action in response to such behavior would fly in the face of Title IX’s core principles, and such deliberate indifference may appropriately be subject to claims for monetary damages. It is not necessary, however, to show physical exclusion to demonstrate that students have been deprived by the actions of another student or students of an educational opportunity on the basis of sex. Rather, a plaintiff must establish sexual harassment of students that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether gender-oriented conduct rises to the level of actionable “harassment” thus “depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships,” including, but not limited to, the ages of the harasser and the victim and the number of individuals involved, <i>see</i> OCR Title IX Guidelines 12041-12042. Courts, moreover, must bear in mind that schools are unlike the adult workplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among adults. Indeed, at least early on, students are still learning how to interact appropriately with their peers. It is thus understandable that, in the school setting, students often engage in insults, banter, teasing, shoving, pushing, and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students subjected to it. Damages are not available for simple acts of teasing and name-calling among school children, however, even where these comments target differences in gender. Rather, in the context of student-on-student harassment,</p>
<p><a id="page_432" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>432</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">damages are available only where the behavior is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education that Title IX is designed to protect.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, the provision that the discrimination occur “under any education program or activity” suggests that the behavior be serious enough to have the systemic effect of denying the victim equal access to an educational program or activity. Although, in theory, a single instance of sufficiently severe one-on-one peer harassment could be said to have such an effect, we think it unlikely that Congress would have thought such behavior sufficient to rise to this level in light of the inevitability of student misconduct and the amount of litigation that would be invited by entertaining claims of official indifference to a single instance of one-on-one peer harassment. By limiting private damages actions to cases having a systemic effect on educational programs or activities, we reconcile the general principle that Title IX prohibits official indifference to known peer sexual harassment with the practical realities of responding to student behavior, realities that Congress could not have meant to be ignored.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that it was a teacher who engaged in harassment in <i>Franklin</i> and <i>Gebser</i> is relevant. The relationship between the harasser and the victim necessarily affects the extent to which the misconduct can be said to breach Title IX’s guarantee of equal access to educational benefits and to have a systemic effect on a program or activity. Peer harassment, in particular, is less likely to satisfy these requirements than is teacher-student harassment.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Applying this standard to the facts at issue here, we conclude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing petitioner’s complaint. Petitioner alleges that her daughter was the victim of repeated acts of sexual harassment by G.F. over a 5-month period, and there are allegations in support of the conclusion that G.F.’s misconduct was severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. The harassment was not only verbal; it included numerous acts of objectively offensive touching, and, indeed, G.F. ultimately pleaded guilty to criminal sexual misconduct. Moreover, the complaint alleges that there were multiple victims who were sufficiently disturbed by G.F.’s misconduct to seek an audience with the school principal. Further, petitioner contends that the harassment had a concrete, negative effect on her daughter’s ability to receive an education. The complaint also suggests that petitioner may be able to show both actual knowledge and deliberate indifference on the part of the Board, which made no effort whatsoever either to investigate or to put an end to the harassment.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Kennedy</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia</span>, and <span class="smallcap">Justice Thomas</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">Title IX gives schools neither notice that the conduct the majority labels peer “sexual harassment” is gender discrimination within the meaning of the</p>
<p><a id="page_433" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>433</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Act nor any guidance in distinguishing in individual cases between actionable discrimination and the immature behavior of children and adolescents. The majority thus imposes on schools potentially crushing financial liability for student conduct that is not prohibited in clear terms by Title IX and that cannot, even after today’s opinion, be identified by either schools or courts with any precision.</p>
<p class="indent">The law recognizes that children—particularly young children—are not fully accountable for their actions because they lack the capacity to exercise mature judgment. No one contests that much of this “dizzying array of immature or uncontrollable behaviors by students,” is inappropriate, even “objectively offensive” at times, and that parents and schools have a moral and ethical responsibility to help students learn to interact with their peers in an appropriate manner. It is a far different question, however, whether it is either proper or useful to label this immature, childish behavior gender discrimination. Nothing in Title IX suggests that Congress even contemplated this question, much less answered it in the affirmative in unambiguous terms.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority, nevertheless, has no problem labeling the conduct of fifth graders “sexual harassment” and “gender discrimination.” Contrary to the majority’s assertion, however, respondents have made a cogent and persuasive argument that the type of student conduct alleged by petitioner should not be considered “sexual harassment,” much less gender discrimination actionable under Title IX: “[A]t the time Petitioner filed her complaint, no court, including this Court had recognized the concept of sexual harassment in any context other than the employment context. Nor had any Court extended the concept of sexual harassment to the misconduct of emotionally and socially immature children. The type of conduct alleged by Petitioner in her complaint is not new. However, in past years it was properly identified as misconduct which was addressed within the context of student discipline. The Petitioner now asks this Court to create out of whole cloth a cause of action by labeling childish misconduct as ‘sexual harassment,’ to stigmatize children as sexual harassers, and have the federal court system take on the additional burden of second guessing the disciplinary actions taken by school administrators in addressing misconduct, something this Court has consistently refused to do.” Brief for Respondents 12-13 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="indent">In reality, there is no established body of federal or state law on which courts may draw in defining the student conduct that qualifies as Title IX gender discrimination. Analogies to Title VII hostile environment harassment are inapposite, because schools are not workplaces and children are not adults. The norms of the adult workplace that have defined hostile environment sexual harassment are not easily translated to peer relationships in schools, where teenage romantic relationships and dating are a part of everyday life. Analogies to Title IX teacher sexual harassment of students are similarly flawed. A teacher’s sexual overtures toward a student are always inappropriate; a teenager’s romantic overtures to a classmate (even when persistent and unwelcome) are an inescapable part of adolescence.</p>
<p class="indent">The only guidance the majority gives schools in distinguishing between the “simple acts of teasing and name calling among school children,” said not to be a</p>
<p><a id="page_434" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>434</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">basis for suit even when they “target differences in gender,” and actionable peer sexual harassment is, in reality, no guidance at all. The majority proclaims that “in the context of student-on-student harassment, damages are available only where the behavior is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it denies its victims the equal access to education that Title IX is designed to protect.” The majority does not even purport to explain, however, what constitutes an actionable denial of “equal access to education.” Is equal access denied when a girl who tires of being chased by the boys at recess refuses to go outside? When she cannot concentrate during class because she is worried about the recess activities? When she pretends to be sick one day so she can stay home from school? It appears the majority is content to let juries decide.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority’s reference to a “systemic effect” does nothing to clarify the content of its standard. The majority appears to intend that requirement to do no more than exclude the possibility that a single act of harassment perpetrated by one student on one other student can form the basis for an actionable claim. That is a small concession indeed.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. A claim of student-on-student sexual harassment is actionable under Title IX if (1) the sexual harassment was so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprived the student access to the educational benefits or opportunities provided by the school; (2) the educational institution had actual knowledge of the sexual harassment; and (3) the funding recipient was deliberately indifferent to the harassment. How does the <i>Davis</i> court define and provide substance to these prongs?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Sexual harassment is prevalent in American middle and high schools and disparately affects women students. A 2011 survey found that 48 percent of students experienced some form of sexual harassment, and 87 percent said that the harassment had a negative effect on them. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Catherine Hill &amp; Holly Kearl, Am. Ass’n of Univ. Women</span>, <span class="smallcap">Crossing the Line: Sexual Harassment at School</span> (2011). Girls are more likely to be sexually harassed than boys (56 percent versus 40 percent), both in person (52 percent versus 35 percent) and through electronic communications and text messaging (36 percent versus 24 percent). <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">3. Recognizing the maturity levels of adolescents, is the dissent correct in its concern about drawing the line between childish behavior and sexual harassment? When children are too young to understand the sexual nature of the conduct they are engaged in, is it nonetheless sexual harassment? Do you believe that the requirement that the harassment be “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school” provides a sufficiently clear line indicating what will subject schools to liability?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Justice Kennedy’s dissent expresses concern that the liability standard adopted in <i>Davis</i> will place schools in a difficult position where they feel</p>
<p><a id="page_435" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>435</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">compelled to respond to all forms of harassment and bullying when, in fact, much of it does not involve gender discrimination. In this respect, Title IX would be transformed into a student code of conduct. While it might be good school policy to prevent all bullying, harassment, and misbehavior, a broad policing of student conduct does not fall within the purview of federal legislation. Is the Court’s opinion sufficiently narrow so as to avoid this result?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The requirement that harassment be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprives a student of access to educational opportunity was not mentioned in <i>Gebser</i> in regard to teacher-on-student harassment. Is that because teacher harassment necessarily interferes with learning, because student harassment generally does not, or because the Court in <i>Davis</i> was simply attempting to limit the scope of schools’ potential liability?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Liability issues play a prominent role in sexual harassment cases. Prior to <i>Davis</i>, the Supreme Court in <i>Gebser</i> held that a district’s liability for sexual harassment by teachers does not flow from respondent superior principles; rather, liability flows only when “an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient’s behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient’s programs and fails adequately to respond.” 524 U.S. at 285. The <i>Davis</i> Court, applying <i>Gebser</i> to the peer sexual harassment context, held that damages may be recoverable only if (1) the harassment is “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school” and (2) the funding recipient is deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment of which it has actual knowledge, and which occurs in a setting that can be construed as under the recipient’s control and within its operations. 526 U.S. at 650. Do these liability standards incentivize or disincentivize reporting of sexual harassment by students, adequate responses by school officials, and adoption of preventative measures by schools?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Because actual notice is part of the prima facia case for sexual harassment under Title IX, a key factor in whether sexual harassment gets remedied by the institution or courts is often the willingness of the victim or someone close to the victim to come forward and report it. Research indicates that sexual harassment often goes unreported. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class="smallcap">Hill &amp; Kearl,</span> <i>supra</i> (although 48 percent of students in middle and high school experience sexual harassment, only about 9 percent report the incidents to the school); <span class="smallcap">Catherine Hill &amp; Elena Silva, Am. Ass’n of Univ. Women, Drawing the Line</span> (2006) (finding that nearly two-thirds of college students experience some form of sexual harassment, but only 7 percent tell a college employee). Several factors contribute to the nonreporting of sexual harassment, including victims blaming themselves for the harassment, victims believing that those receiving complaints will minimize or disregard the severity and impact of the harassment, victims feeling ashamed that the incidents occurred, lack of knowledge of whom to report the incidents, fear of retribution for filing a complaint, ineffective complaint procedures, and the absence of effective remedies for victims. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Hill &amp; Silva</span>, <i>supra.</i> More than 66 percent of female students and 46 percent of male students suggest that schools establish an anonymous complaint system. <i>Id.</i> at 34. Would an anonymous complaint system have been any more effective in addressing the problems in</p>
<p><a id="page_436" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>436</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the foregoing cases and problems? Are there any contexts in which it might be more effective?</p>
<p class="indent">8. Does the Court require any particular type of response or level of punishment for sexually inappropriate behavior? Here, one infers from the principal’s alleged comments that he had spoken to G.F. about his behavior. Might that have been sufficient regardless of his subsequent conduct? Why or why not? Even if a school does not respond to this sort of behavior with exclusionary punishment, at some point it must do more than simply talk to a student whose behavior continues unabated. Had the school reached that point here? Can a school reasonably forecast what that point is based on the Court’s opinion?</p>
<p class="indent">9. Lower courts have reiterated and adhered to the Court’s principle of deference in regard to the specific actions schools must take, but they have also found that, as a practical matter, schools’ responses should be effective and adequate efforts to stop the harassment. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Vance v. Spencer Cnty. Pub. Sch. Dist., 231 F.3d 253, 262-263 (6th Cir. 2000) (finding the school’s ineffective measures to be evidence of deliberate indifference); Gant v. Wallingford Bd. of Educ., 195 F.3d 134, 141 (2d Cir. 1999) (adhering to the Court’s “clearly unreasonable” standard); Murrell v. Sch. Dist., 186 F.3d 1238, 1247-1248 (10th Cir. 1999) (finding the school’s actions ineffective because they allowed harassment to continue); Jones v. Ind. Area Sch. Dist., 397 F. Supp. 2d 628, 644-646 (W.D. Pa. 2005) (not requiring any particular response other than that the school take additional action when it knows its previous ones to be ineffective or inadequate); Canty v. Old Rochester Reg’l Sch. Dist., 66 F. Supp. 2d 114, 117 (D. Mass. 1999) (finding if the school’s actions were “inadequate” to stop harassment, it must “‘take further steps’”) (quoting Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1999)). Moreover, those effective and adequate efforts to stop the harassment should be taken without any unjustifiable delay. Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 352 F.3d 733, 751 (2d Cir. 2003); Bruneau v. S. Kortright Cent. Sch. Dist., 163 F.3d 749, 761 (2d Cir. 1998). In short, the courts will not dictate that a school take specific action, but if the school’s chosen action allows harassment to continue, the courts will require the school to take further action. <i>Wills</i>, 184 F.3d at 26 (finding that if a school’s efforts “proved inadequate, it may be required to take further steps to avoid new liability”).</p>
<p class="indent">10. Title IX is not the exclusive remedy for sexual harassment in public schools. In <i>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm</i>., 555 U.S. 246 (2009), the Supreme Court held that victims of sexual harassment at school might also bring a claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983. Section 1983 is the federal statute that creates federal court jurisdiction over deprivations of federal rights. The question in <i>Fitzgerald</i> was whether Congress intended to preclude other federal statutory and constitutional claims regarding sex discrimination when it enacted the remedial scheme of Title IX. The Supreme Court held that Congress did not intend for Title IX to preclude other claims.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Even where particular activities and particular defendants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, the standards for establishing liability may not be wholly congruent. For example, a Title IX plaintiff can establish school district liability by showing that a single school administrator with authority to take corrective action responded to</p>
<p><a id="page_437" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>437</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">harassment with deliberate indifference. A plaintiff stating a similar claim via §1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause by a school district or other municipal entity must show that the harassment was the result of municipal custom, policy, or practice. In light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, as well as the absence of a comprehensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue [in the cases where we rejected §1983 claims], we conclude that Title IX was not meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimination in schools, or a substitute for §1983 suits as a means of enforcing constitutional rights. Accordingly, we hold that §1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id</i>. at 257-258 (internal citations omitted). The plaintiffs in <i>Fitzgerald</i> indicated that on remand, rather than attempt to show the deliberate indifference that Title IX requires, they would “advance claims of discriminatory treatment in the investigation of student behavior and in the treatment of student complaints.” <i>Id</i>. at 260. You may recall a similar theory of discrimination was raised earlier in cases in this chapter that address discrimination in admissions and the investigation of premarital sex. Pfeiffer v. School Board for Marion Center Area, 917 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1990); Tingley-Kelley v. Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, 677 F. Supp. 2d 764 (E.D. Pa. 2010).</p>
<p class="indent">11. In addition to Title IX and Equal Protection claims under §1983, victims of harassment might also bring a state tort claim. Schools have a duty to reasonably supervise students while at school. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Victoria J. Dodd, Practical Education Law for the Twenty-First Century</span> 232 (2003). If harassment or sexual assault occurred in a location and a time when a school reasonably should have been supervising students but was not, a victim might state a plausible claim. <i>See</i> Doe v. Dep<i>’</i>t of Educ. of City of New York, 862 N.Y.S.2d 598 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008). In other instances, however, the claim would be more difficult, as the victim would need to show that the harassment or assault was foreseeable and that the supervision provided was unreasonable. <i>See, e.g</i>., Doe v. Omaha Public School Dist., 727 N.W.2d 447 (Neb. 2007); Lennon v. Cornwall Cent. Sch. Dist., 132 A.D.3d 820 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015). It is not enough to simply show that the harm occurred at school.</p>
<p class="indent">Sexual harassment or assault may, under certain circumstances, fall under a state’s definition of child abuse. As such, school personnel who know of or reasonably suspect child abuse are required to report the abuse to the relevant child protection agency, although the failure to report does not alone give rise to a cause of action. <span class="smallcap">Dodd</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 244.</p>
<p class="indent">12. The cases in this section primarily address sexual harassment that arises from a sexually hostile environment. Another form of sexual harassment involves quid pro quo harassment, which “occurs most often when some benefit or adverse action, such as change in salary at work or a grade in school, is made to depend on providing sexual favors to someone in authority.” <i>Wills</i>, 184 F.3d 20.</p>

<p class="indent">Anna is a sixth grader in Columbia Middle School. On the second day of school, some boys yelled at her in the hall, saying, “Oh, there’s that gay girl.”</p>
<p><a id="page_438" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>438</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Anna complained to a school counselor, who then spoke to the boys. Two months later, an older boy sat down next to her on the bus and asked Anna to describe oral sex. She again reported it to the counselor, who then reported it to the principal. The principal suspended the student from the bus for three days. When the student returned, he cursed at Anna for reporting him and was even more vulgar than before. Out of fear, she did not report the matter. During her seventh-grade year, another boy confronted Anna in the presence of other students and demanded to know whether she was gay. Afterward, Anna reported the matter to the assistant principal. He said that the boys were flirting with her, so she should just “be friendly.” Later that year, Anna became the target of negativity from several students during the period between class changes. Random students regularly shoved her into walls, grabbed her book bag, and stole and destroyed her homework. Anna reported these incidents to a school counselor again, who said she would see what she could do.</p>
<p class="indent">No further incidents happened in the hall in the ensuing months, but one male student in her gym class called her and other female students “whores,” struck them, snapped their bras, and grabbed their butts. On one instance, he began taking things from Anna’s bag. When she tried to get a pen back from him, he stabbed her in the hand with the pen. The boy was taken to the principal’s office. The principal spoke to the boy and told him to stop bothering Anna. He told the principal he had a crush on her and was just pursuing his feelings. The next day the boy told Anna that the principal had spoken to him and he did not “give a damn about it and he would do whatever he wanted to.” His mistreatment of Anna continued thereafter for the rest of the semester.</p>

In September 2010, Marissa Park, a freshman majoring in history, visited King’s office to discuss the previous day’s assignment. During the visit, King pulled Park into his lap, put his hand under her shirt, and touched her breasts. The next day Park met with the dean of the history department and filed a written complaint. After investigating the matter, the university placed King on probation and stated in a written reprimand that a further incident would be grounds for immediate dismissal. But since this was his first instance of misconduct, he would be permitted to remain on the faculty. In fact, the following spring his tenure was approved by the university.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Court’s willingness to recognize a cause of action for deliberate indifference to sexual harassment opened the door to causes of action for other behavior that interferes with students’ equal access and treatment in schools. The Supreme Court’s holding in <i>Alexander v. Sandoval</i>, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), that the only cause of action under Title VI (and by analogy Title IX) is for intentional discrimination potentially excludes various district actions and policies from legal challenge. But by treating a district’s deliberate indifference as a form of intentional discrimination, even though the district did not directly engage in any harassment itself, the Court implicitly recognized that intentional discrimination may have multiple forms and is not limited to instances of conscious desires to disadvantage a group based on gender or some other protected status.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Court’s next Title IX case after its sexual harassment decisions, <i>Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education,</i> 544 U.S. 167 (2005), the Court addressed whether retaliation against someone who complains about potential gender discrimination gives rise to a cause of action. Although the plaintiffs had alleged that the district was treating its female athletes unfairly, the treatment may or may not have been intentional discrimination by the district. In this respect, <i>Jackson</i> was distinct from the sexual harassment cases because there was no serious dispute that sexual harassment is intentional discrimination. Thus, the precise issue in <i>Jackson</i> was whether retaliation, in and of itself, is a form of intentional discrimination. The Court held that Title IX does include a cause of action for retaliation, reasoning that Title IX</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">broadly prohibits a funding recipient from subjecting any person to “discrimination” “on the basis of sex.” Retaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX’s private cause of action. Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It is a form of “discrimination” because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. Moreover, retaliation is discrimination “on the basis of sex” because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional “discrimination” “on the basis of sex,” in violation of Title IX.</p>

<p class="noindent">practices.”…[T]his objective “would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about sex discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation.” If recipients were permitted to retaliate freely, individuals who witness discrimination would be loath to report it, and all manner of Title IX violations might go unremedied as a result.…Title IX’s enforcement scheme also depends on individual reporting because individuals and agencies may not bring suit under the statute unless the recipient has received “actual notice” of the discrimination.</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch157">K. SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p class="noindent">Discrimination based on real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity has long been a reality in American society, including the education context. For some time this discrimination even had the sanction of law. In <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), the Supreme Court upheld a state law that criminalized homosexual conduct. Rather than address the case as implicating a gay individual’s equal protection interests against discrimination, the Court framed it as involving the fundamental “right to engage in homosexual activity,” which the Court rejected. A decade later, the Supreme Court addressed the appropriate level of equal protection review for classifications discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). There, the Supreme Court examined an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that prohibited legislative, executive, judicial, and municipal action to protect LGBT people from discrimination. The Supreme Court applied rational basis review and found that the amendment lacked a rational relationship to legitimate state interests because the amendment’s sole motivation was animus toward LGBT people.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2003, the Supreme Court finally overruled <i>Bowers</i> in the landmark case <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). The majority held that substantive due process protects the right to privacy in intimate affairs and that the state lacked a legitimate interest to interfere with that privacy. Although the Court did not devote significant attention to equal protection issues, Justice O’Connor argued in her concurrence that the statute in question should be rejected on equal protection grounds, rather than due process, since anti-LGBT animus and “moral disapproval” are not legitimate governmental interests. Many commentators have read <i>Lawrence</i> to indicate that classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to a heightened form of rational basis review. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Courtney A. Powers, <i>Finding LGBTs a Suspect Class: Assessing the Political Power of LGBTs as a Basis for the Court’s Application of Heightened Scrutiny</i>, 17 <span class="smallcap">Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Pol’y</span> 385, 388 (2010); Neelum J. Wadhwani, <i>Rational Views, Irrational Results</i>, 84 <span class="smallcap">Tex. L. Rev.</span> 801, 801 (2006).</p>
<p class="indent">A decade later, the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Windsor</i>, struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional. The Act had refused to recognize that some same-sex couples were, in fact, legitimately married under</p>
<p><a id="page_441" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>441</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">state law. Instead, it denied married same-sex couples certain federal benefits and privileges. The Court held that this denial violated equal protection of the law, primarily because Congress lacked any legitimate basis to discriminate against same-sex couples and was motivated by a desire to disadvantage those couples. United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693-2694 (2013). Two years later, the Court held that the fundamental right to marry also extended to same-sex couples. Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding these constitutional advances, federal laws do not facially prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the Court has yet to hold that classifications based on sexual orientation and gender identity should be subject to equal protection’s intermediate or strict scrutiny review. Moreover, the willingness to strike down antigay legislation does not necessarily translate into an affirmative duty to prevent the harassment of LGBT. The need for affirmative protection is particularly acute for LGBT youth who have no choice but to attend school in an environment that all too often subjects them to intimate and repeated harassment.</p>
<p class="indent">The advocacy group Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) regularly issues a National School Climate Survey report, based on surveys of more than 7,000 middle and high school students. The 2009 survey found that 84.6 percent of LGBT students reported being verbally harassed, 40.1 percent reported being physically harassed, and 18.8 percent reported being physically assaulted at school in the past year because of their sexual orientation. Nearly two-thirds (61.1 percent) reported that they felt unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation. Nearly one-third missed one or more days of school in the past month because of safety concerns, whereas about 7 to 8 percent of other students missed a day of school for safety concerns. The harassment also appears to have negative educational consequences. LGBT students experiencing more frequent harassment reported an average GPA of 2.7, whereas those experiencing less harassment reported a 3.1 GPA. As one would expect, harassment was also related to increased levels of depression and anxiety and decreased levels of self-esteem. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Joseph G. Kosciw et al., Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Straight Educ. Network</span>, <span class="smallcap">2009 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation’s Schools</span> (2010).</p>
<p class="indent">Given the unique concerns over the challenges and abuse faced by LGBT youth in schools, courts have recognized that, at least in some situations, discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of gender discrimination. Courts have drawn on the idea articulated in <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</i>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), that sex stereotyping and different treatment based on the failure to conform to traditional gender roles are forms of discrimination “based on…sex.” The federal administration has, likewise, supported this understanding of sexual orientation discrimination in schools. But with the sexual harassment described in the <i>Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District</i>, 524 U.S. 274 (1998), line of cases, a school’s liability may depend on a very contextualized evaluation of how a school responds to the harassment. In fact, the following case shows that even the most aggressive lower courts may require that victims of sexual orientation harassment show not that they were</p>
<p><a id="page_442" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>442</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">victims of antigay harassment but that they received differential treatment based on their sex, such as a school tolerating some level of harassment—sexual or otherwise—toward a boy that it would not have tolerated toward a girl. As you read the following cases, consider what types of harassment of LGBT people this analytical framework might remedy and what types it might not. Also consider whether this gap in coverage is tolerable or whether new legislation is appropriate.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch158">Nabozny v. Podlesny</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>92 F.3d 446 (7th Cir. 1996)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Jamie Nabozny was a student in the Ashland Public School District in Ashland, Wisconsin throughout his middle school and high school years. During that time, Nabozny was continually harassed and physically abused by fellow students because he is homosexual. Both in middle school and high school Nabozny reported the harassment to school administrators. Nabozny asked the school officials to protect him and to punish his assailants. Despite the fact that the school administrators had a policy of investigating and punishing student-on-student battery and sexual harassment, they allegedly turned a deaf ear to Nabozny’s requests. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that some of the administrators themselves mocked Nabozny’s predicament. Nabozny eventually filed suit against several school officials and the District alleging, among other things, that the defendants: 1) violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by discriminating against him based on his gender; 2) violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by discriminating against him based on his sexual orientation; 3) violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by exacerbating the risk that he would be harmed by fellow students; and 4) violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by encouraging an environment in which he would be harmed. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Because we agree with the district court only in part, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">[The alleged facts, which for purposes of summary judgment we must consider in the light most favorable to Nabozny, are as follows. “In elementary school, Nabozny proved to be a good student and enjoyed a positive educational experience.” But when Nabozny began the seventh grade at Ashland Middle School in 1988, his life changed. Nabozny realized that he is gay, as did his classmates. For the rest of his educational experience in the district’s schools, he was routinely subjected to extreme verbal and physical harassment, only the highlights of which are noted here. “In the seventh grade, Nabozny’s classmates regularly referred to him as ‘faggot,’ and subjected him to various forms of physical abuse, including striking and spitting on him.” That same year, after he and his family complained to the administration, similar treatment</p>
<p><a id="page_443" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>443</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">intensified. One student grabbed Nabozny and pushed him to the floor. A second student joined in and they held him down and subjected him to “a mock rape,” while they exclaimed that he “should enjoy it.” A group of twenty other students looked on and laughed. His eighth grade year was similarly riddled with physical attacks and intimidation. The harassment intensified to the point that Nabozny had to take time off from school. But it continued upon his return, leading him to attempt suicide and a hospital stay. During his ninth grade year, Nabozny was assaulted while using the urinal. Upon falling to the ground, a student then urinated on him. Shortly thereafter, Nabozny again attempted suicide. Next, he ran away from home. He only returned home because his parents promised that he would not have to return to his high school. But his parents were unable to afford private school, and social services ordered him to return to his public high school. During his tenth grade year, he was pelted with dangerous objects while riding the school bus. The worst incident occurred in the library, where a group of eight students confronted him and one kicked him in the stomach repeatedly for five [to] ten minutes while the others laughed. The beating was so severe that it caused internal bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout this time, Nabozny’s parents continually met with school officials and demanded that action be taken to stop the harassment. Almost no action beyond talking with the offending harassers was ever taken. Sometimes the response was to move Nabozny rather than punish the offenders. For instance, they once moved Nabozny to a special education class on the premise that he would not be bothered there. On two other instances, school administrators went so far as to indicate that “if he was ‘going to be so openly gay,’ he should ‘expect’ such behavior.’” These responses seemingly emboldened his attackers. Finally, in his eleventh grade year, Nabozny withdrew from Ashland High School. A guidance counselor, who appeared to have been his only advocate within the school, “told Nabozny and his parents that school administrators were unwilling to help him and that he should seek educational opportunities elsewhere. Nabozny left Ashland and moved to Minneapolis where he was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.”]</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Equal Protection Clause grants to all Americans “the right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity.” <i>Harris v. McRae</i>, 448 U.S. 297, 322 (1980). When a state actor turns a blind eye to the Clause’s command, aggrieved parties such as Nabozny can seek relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. In order to establish liability under §1983, Nabozny must show that the defendants acted with a nefarious discriminatory purpose, <i>Personnel Adm’r of Massachusetts v. Feeney</i>, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979), and discriminated against him based on his membership in a definable class. A showing that the defendants were negligent will not suffice. Nabozny must show that the defendants acted either intentionally or with deliberate indifference. To escape liability, the defendants either must prove that they did not discriminate against Nabozny, or at a bare minimum, the defendants’ discriminatory conduct must satisfy one of two well-established standards of review:</p>
<p><a id="page_444" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>444</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">heightened scrutiny in the case of gender discrimination, or rational basis in the case of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Gender and Equal Protection</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The district court disposed of Nabozny’s equal protection claims in two brief paragraphs. Regarding the merits of Nabozny’s gender claim, the court concluded that “[t]here is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that plaintiff was treated differently because of his gender.” The district court’s conclusion affords two interpretations: 1) there is no evidence that the defendants treated Nabozny differently from other students; or, 2) there is no evidence that the discriminatory treatment was based on Nabozny’s gender. We will examine each in turn.</p>
<p class="indent">The record viewed in the light most favorable to Nabozny, combined with the defendants’ own admissions, suggests that Nabozny was treated differently from other students. The defendants stipulate that they had a commendable record of enforcing their anti-harassment policies[, which under Wisconsin state law included protections against sexual orientation discrimination]. Yet Nabozny has presented evidence that his classmates harassed and battered him for years and that school administrators failed to enforce their anti-harassment policies, despite his repeated pleas for them to do so. If the defendants otherwise enforced their anti-harassment policies, as they contend, then Nabozny’s evidence strongly suggests that they made an exception to their normal practice in Nabozny’s case.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, the question becomes whether Nabozny can show that he received different treatment because of his gender. Nabozny’s evidence regarding the defendants’ punishment of male-on-female battery and harassment is not overwhelming. Nabozny contends that a male student that struck his girlfriend was immediately expelled, that males were reprimanded for striking girls, and that when pregnant girls were called “slut” or “whore,” the school took action. Nabozny’s evidence does not include specific facts, such as the names and dates of the individuals involved. Nabozny does allege, however, that when he was subjected to a mock rape Podlesny responded by saying “boys will be boys,” apparently dismissing the incident because both the perpetrators and the victim were males. We find it impossible to believe that a female lodging a similar complaint would have received the same response.</p>
<p class="indent">More important, the defendants do not deny that they aggressively punished male-on-female battery and harassment. The defendants argue that they investigated and punished all complaints of battery and harassment, regardless of the victim’s gender. According to the defendants, contrary to the evidence presented by Nabozny, they aggressively pursued each of Nabozny’s complaints and punished the alleged perpetrators whenever possible. [But i]n the context of summary judgment, we must assume that Nabozny’s version is the credible one.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants also argue that there is no evidence that they either intentionally discriminated against Nabozny, or were deliberately indifferent to his complaints. The defendants concede that they had a policy and practice of punishing perpetrators of battery and harassment. It is well settled law that</p>
<p><a id="page_445" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>445</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">departures from established practices may evince discriminatory intent. <i>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.,</i> 429 U.S. 252 (1977). Moreover, Nabozny introduced evidence to suggest that the defendants literally laughed at Nabozny’s pleas for help. The defendants’ argument, considered against Nabozny’s evidence, is simply indefensible.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. Sexual Orientation and Equal Protection</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[Because there was a lack of clarity in the district court’s rational for dismissing Nabozny’s sexual orientation claim,] we will assume that the court’s disposition of Nabozny’s sexual orientation claim was synonymous with, and on the same grounds as, the court’s disposition of Nabozny’s gender claim.</p>
<p class="indent">First we must consider whether Nabozny proffered a sufficient evidentiary basis to support his claim. As we noted above, Nabozny’s evidence, combined with the defendants’ admissions, demonstrates that Nabozny was treated differently. What is more, Nabozny introduced sufficient evidence to show that the discriminatory treatment was motivated by the defendants’ disapproval of Nabozny’s sexual orientation, including statements by the defendants that Nabozny should expect to be harassed because he is gay.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case we need not consider whether homosexuals are a suspect or quasi-suspect class, which would subject the defendants’ conduct to either strict or heightened scrutiny. The rational basis standard is sufficient for our purposes herein.</p>
<p class="indent">Under rational basis review there is no constitutional violation if “there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts” that would provide a rational basis for the government’s conduct. We are unable to garner any rational basis for permitting one student to assault another based on the victim’s sexual orientation, and the defendants do not offer us one. Like Nabozny’s gender claim, the defendants argue that they did not discriminate against Nabozny.</p>
<p class="indent">Absent any rational basis for their alleged discrimination, the defendants are left to argue that the principle that the Constitution prohibits discrimination between similarly situated persons based on membership in a delineable class was somehow unclear back in 1988. We find that suggestion unacceptable. As early as 1886 the Supreme Court held that if the law “is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.” <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins</i>, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74 (1886). Further, almost every case that we have cited thus far was decided prior to the events giving rise to this litigation.</p>
<p class="indent">Our discussion of qualified immunity cannot end without mentioning one case in the area of “homosexual rights” commonly cited during the period in question: <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>, 478 U.S. 186 (1986). In <i>Bowers</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that state sodomy statutes that prohibit sodomy performed in private between two consenting adults do not run afoul of an individual’s Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process. We will address Nabozny’s due process arguments below. However, reliance on <i>Bowers</i> by the defendants in this</p>
<p><a id="page_446" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>446</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">case is misplaced. <i>Bowers</i> addressed the criminalization of sodomy. The defendants make no mention of sodomy as a motive for their discrimination. To the contrary, the defendants offer us no rational basis for their alleged conduct. The defendants certainly cannot rely on <i>Bowers</i>’s rational basis analysis to establish qualified immunity when they do not assert a rational basis for their alleged conduct, and expressly maintain that they did not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, although it presents a closer question than does Nabozny’s gender claim, we hold that reasonable persons in the defendants’ positions in 1988 would have concluded that discrimination against Nabozny based on his sexual orientation was unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Now we turn to Nabozny’s due process arguments. We believe that in order to clarify the nature of Nabozny’s due process theories, it is necessary to specify what Nabozny does not argue. However untenable it may be to suggest that under the Fourteenth Amendment a state can force a student to attend a school when school officials know that the student will be placed at risk of bodily harm, our court has concluded that local school administrations have no affirmative substantive due process duty to protect students. <i>J.O. v. Alton Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. 11</i>, 909 F.2d 267, 272-73 (7th Cir. 1990). In <i>Alton Cmty.,</i> we relied on the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Social Services</i> to conclude that school administrators do not have a “special relationship” with students. Absent a “special relationship,” a state actor has no duty to protect a potential victim.</p>
<p class="indent">Nabozny argues that the defendants should be liable because they enhanced his risk of harm, and because their policies encouraged a climate in which he suffered harm. We will consider each theory in turn. First, Nabozny argues that by failing to punish his assailants the defendants exacerbated the risk that he would be harmed, or even encouraged the students to harm him. We agree with Nabozny in principle that the defendants could be liable under a due process theory if Nabozny could show that the defendants created a risk of harm, or exacerbated an existing one. After a thorough review of the record, however, we must agree with the district court that Nabozny’s claim suffers from a paucity of evidence. Nabozny has presented evidence to show that the defendants failed to act, and that their failure to act was intentional. But, as we noted, <i>Alton Cmty.</i> held that the defendants had no affirmative duty to act. The defendants’ failure to act left Nabozny in a position of danger, but nothing suggests that their failure to act placed him in the danger, or increased the pre-existing threat of harm. Nabozny has presented “wrenching” facts, but there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the defendants’ conduct increased the risk of harm to Nabozny beyond that which he would have faced had the defendants taken no action.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Nabozny’s second theory, he argues that the defendants violated his right to due process by acting with deliberate indifference in maintaining a policy or practice of failing to punish his assailants, thereby encouraging a</p>
<p><a id="page_447" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>447</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">harmful environment. The district court rejected Nabozny’s argument because the harm he suffered was not perpetrated by school employees. On appeal, Nabozny challenges the district court’s reasoning, arguing that liability can result regardless whether students or teachers inflicted the harm.</p>
<p class="indent">Nabozny argues, and presents facts suggesting, that the defendants had a policy or practice of ignoring his pleas for help, and that as a result, he was repeatedly assaulted. Nabozny’s theory has one fatal flaw: it rests on a failure to act. Under <i>Alton Community</i> the defendants had no duty to act. Therefore, to hold them liable for adopting a practice of failing to act would run directly counter to <i>Alton Community.</i></p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that, based on the record as a whole, a reasonable fact-finder could find that the District and [school administrators] violated Nabozny’s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by discriminating against him based on his gender or sexual orientation. Further, the law establishing the defendants’ liability was sufficiently clear to inform the defendants at the time that their conduct was unconstitutional. We further conclude that Nabozny has failed to produce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable fact-finder to find that the defendants violated Nabozny’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process either by enhancing his risk of harm or by encouraging a climate to flourish in which he suffered harm. Our disposition of Nabozny’s due process claims renders the district court’s award of qualified immunity as to those claims moot. The decision of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. On what factual predicate does Nabozny’s gender discrimination claim rest? Assume that a school does not seriously prosecute nonviolent male-on-female harassment. If this were the case, by the court’s reasoning in <i>Nabozny</i>, male-on-male harassment of a gay student would not necessarily present a case of gender discrimination. <i>Nabozny</i>, however, predates <i>Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</i>, 526 U.S. 629 (1999). Under <i>Davis</i>, would the failure to prosecute male-on-female harassment potentially amount to deliberate indifference? In other words, a school’s lax enforcement of male-on-female harassment might be irrelevant because Title IX demands a response. This point would be potentially important where a gay youth suffers nonviolent harassment and struggles to present evidence of similarly situated females being treated differently. The court in <i>Nabozny</i> indicated that it was hard for it to imagine the school would have responded the same had Nabozny been a female. This supposition by the court is the sort of normative-based analysis that some scholars argue should guide the courts’ analysis of racial and other forms of discrimination because probative evidence of similarly situated individuals is often missing. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">john a. powell</span>, <span class="smallcap">Racing to Justice: Transforming Our Conceptions of Self and Other to Build an Inclusive Society</span> (2012); Derek W. Black, <i>The Contradiction Between Equal Protection’s Meaning and Its Legal Substance: How Deliberate Indifference Can Cure It</i>, 15 <span class="smallcap">Wm. &amp; Mary Bill of Rts. J.</span> 533 (2006).</p>
<p><a id="page_448" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>448</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. The court also holds that Nabozny’s claims of sexual orientation discrimination would be sufficient to sustain a claim of denial of equal protection, even if sexual orientation is not a suspect class. What is the court’s rationale? How does the court distinguish this alleged sexual orientation discrimination from other sexual orientation discrimination that courts have upheld?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Does framing harassment of LGBT youth as an issue of differential treatment based on sex rather than sexual orientation correctly frame the issue? Does framing it as sex harassment understate or mischaracterize the harassment in any way? Does framing it as sex discrimination demonstrate that “special protection” for orientation is not necessary, or does this framework create a gap in the analysis that would leave some instances of harassment permissible?</p>
<p class="indent">4. After being notified of the harassment and battery that Nabozny was experiencing, the defendant school principal Podlesny responded that “boys will be boys.” Consider Justice Kennedy’s dissent in <i>Davis</i>, where he expressed concern that (1) the recognition of peer-on-peer sexual harassment will place schools in the position of having to respond to harassment faced by girls the same way as harassment faced by boys; (2) there is little guidance for schools to distinguish “between the simple acts of teasing and name-calling among school children” and what is actionable sexual harassment; and (3) tort remedies are sufficient to address most “egregious cases.” Both Kennedy and the majority agree that some harassment does not fall under the category of sexual harassment or is not serious enough to expose a school to liability. Does harassment of LGBT youth based on their sexual orientation, by its very nature, necessarily give rise to serious harassment that demands a response, or does some harassment merely fall into the category of “kids being kids”? Does the problem with drawing this line with LGBT youth suggest Kennedy’s concerns were well founded?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Twice when Nabozny reported the harassment he faced, including after the “mock rape” incident, Podlesny allegedly responded that if Nabozny was “going to be so openly gay,” he should “expect” such behavior. This statement implicates two premises sometimes used to rationalize the harassment of LGBT youth: (1) LGBT youth are harassed for their behavior rather than their sexual orientation; and (2) LGBT youth “asked for” or provoked the discrimination, harassment, or abuse. The district did not attempt to raise these notions as a legal defense, but such notions have been asserted elsewhere, particularly by the assailants themselves. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Kavita B. Ramakrishnan, <i>Inconsistent Legal Treatment of Unwanted Sexual Advances: A Study of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</i>, 26 <span class="smallcap">Berkeley J. Gender L. &amp; Just</span>. 291 (2011); Christina Pei-Lin Chen, Note, <i>Provocations’ Privileged Desire: The Provocation Doctrine, “Homosexual Panic,” and the Non-Violent Sexual Advance Defense</i>, 10 <span class="smallcap">Cornell J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y</span> 195 (2000).</p>
<p class="indent">6. In <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</i>, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination based on a claimant’s failure to conform to sex stereotypes is discrimination “because of sex” within the meaning of Title VII. Later, in <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services</i>, 523 U.S. 75 (1998), the Supreme Court recognized that claims based on same-sex sexual harassment are actionable under Title VII, but emphasized that an employee must be able to prove that the discrimination is “because of sex,” not sexual orientation. A number of cases have suggested that victims of sexual orientation harassment can meet the <i>Oncale</i></p>

New Balance Athletic Shoes, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 261 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999); Schmedding v. Tnemec Co., 187 F.3d 862, 865 (8th Cir. 1999); Doe v. S.E. Greene Sch. Dist., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12790 (W.D.

Gwinnett County Public School Board</i>, 503 U.S. 60, 74 (1992), the Supreme Court cited Title VII precedent in holding that sexual harassment was gender discrimination within the meaning of Title IX.</p>
<p class="indent">7. Several federal courts have extended this sex-stereotyping theory to Title IX, reasoning that the question is not whether Title IX prohibits sexual orientation discrimination but sex stereotyping. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pratt v. Indian River Cent. Sch. Dist., 803 F. Supp. 2d 135, 151 (N.D.N.Y. 2011). Others have emphasized that it is simply impossible to distinguish between sexual orientation discrimination and sex discrimination and, thus, both must be covered by Title IX. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Videckis v. Pepperdine Univ., 2015 WL 8916764, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2015) (“sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex or gender discrimination, and that the ‘actual’ orientation of the victim is irrelevant. It is impossible to categorically separate ‘sexual orientation discrimination’ from discrimination on the basis of sex or from gender stereotypes; to do so would result in a false choice. Simply put, to allege discrimination on the basis of sexuality is to state a Title IX claim on the basis of sex or gender.”). The response, however, has not been uniform, with some courts refusing to recognize claims. Tyrrell v. Seaford Union Free Sch. Dist., 792 F. Supp. 2d 601, 622 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (“harassment or discrimination based upon sexual orientation is not prohibited under…Title IX.”); Kirby v. N. Carolina State Univ., 2015 WL 1036946, at *5 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 10, 2015), <i>aff’d</i>, 615 F. App’x 136 (4th Cir. 2015) (same). In §1983 cases, some schools have raised a slight different defense, arguing that they should be entitled to qualified immunity because at the time of their actions it was not clear that sexual orientation discrimination was prohibited. <i>See, e.g., Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified School District</i>, 324 F.3d 1130, 1137 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasizing that as early as 1990 the Ninth Circuit in <i>High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office</i>, 895 F.2d 563 (9th Cir. 1990), had “established that homosexuals were a definable minority prior to the period of the alleged discrimination in this case.”).</p>
<p class="indent">8. At least for administrative complaint purposes (which may later bleed over into court opinions), the Office for Civil Rights has clarified the way in which it interprets Title IX to apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation. It explained</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Although Title IX does not prohibit discrimination based solely on sexual orientation, Title IX does protect all students, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)</p>
<p><a id="page_450" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>450</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">students, from sex discrimination. When students are subjected to harassment on the basis of their LGBT status, they may also, as this example illustrates, be subjected to forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX. The fact that the harassment includes anti-LGBT comments or is partly based on the target’s actual or perceived sexual orientation does not relieve a school of its obligation under Title IX to investigate and remedy overlapping sexual harassment or gender-based harassment. In this example, the harassing conduct was based in part on the student’s failure to act as some of his peers believed a boy should act. The harassment created a hostile environment that limited the student’s ability to participate in the school’s education program (e.g., access to the drama club). Finally, even though the student did not identify the harassment as sex discrimination, the school should have recognized that the student had been subjected to gender-based harassment covered by Title IX.</p>

<p class="indent">9. Putting aside the issue of harassment based on sexual orientation, could one argue that a significant amount of male-on-male and female-on-female harassment is based on sex stereotyping and is aimed at “policing” the boundaries of so-called male or female behavior?</p>
<p class="indent">10. While Nabozny himself identified as homosexual, the theory adopted by the <i>Nabozny</i> court is equally applicable to those who are “perceived to be” LGBT. Most of the cases on same-sex sexual harassment involve plaintiffs who openly identify as LGBT, but many who are perceived to be LGBT are also victims of sexual harassment. “When these victims file Title VII claims, the courts must grapple with the issue of whether the mere perception of homosexuality transforms a sexual discrimination claim into a de facto sexual orientation discrimination claim.” Jeremy S. Barber, Comment, <i>Re-Orienting Sexual Harassment: Why Federal Legislation Is Needed to Cure Same-Sex Sexual Harassment Law</i>, 52 <span class="smallcap">Am. U. L. Rev.</span> 493, 513 (2004).</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Centola v. Potter</i>, 183 F. Supp. 2d 403 (D. Mass. 2002), a district court found that the plaintiff could not assert a claim of discrimination based on sexual orientation because “the law is relatively clear that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is not barred under Title VII” and, in any event, “plaintiff never informed anyone in his workplace about his sexual orientation.” 183 F. Supp. 2d at 408, 410. But plaintiff could assert a straightforward claim of sex discrimination because the motivation for the harassment must have been his failure to “conform with [the other employees’] ideas about what a ‘real’ man should look or act like.” <i>Id.</i> at 410. If a plaintiff “can demonstrate that he was discriminated against ‘because of…sex’ as a result of sex stereotyping, the fact that he was also discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation has no legal significance under Title VII.” <i>Id.</i> The court emphasized that “the line between discrimination because of sexual orientation and discrimination because of sex is hardly clear. Sex stereotyping is central to all discrimination: Discrimination involves generalizing from the characteristics of a group to those of an individual, making assumptions about an individual because of that person’s gender, assumptions that may or may not be true.” <i>Id.</i> at 408-409. <i>But see</i> Spearman v. Ford Motor Co., 231 F.3d 1080 (7th Cir. 2000) (rejecting claim of sexual orientation sexual harassment because plaintiff was perceived to be a gay</p>
<p><a id="page_451" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>451</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">man, even though the harassers must have relied on sex stereotypes to perceive him as gay); Dandan v. Radisson Hotel Lisle, 2000 WL 336528 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (rejecting arguments similar to those in <i>Centola</i>).</p>
<p class="indent">One commentator argues that courts that reject this distinction allow defendants “who would otherwise be found liable…to escape legal responsibility for discriminatory practices by claiming they were motivated by homophobia—rather than sexism—regardless of the truth behind such an assertion.” Barber, <i>supra</i>, at 517; <i>see also</i> Mims v. Carrier Corp., 88 F. Supp. 2d 706 (E.D. Tex. 2000) (dismissing heterosexual claimant’s complaint since the harassers erroneously perceived him as gay, and therefore the harassment was based on sexual orientation). There is some indication that claims under the <i>Nabozny</i> theory in the Title IX context fare better than similar claims in the Title VII employment context. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Martin v. Swartz Creek Cmty. Schs., 419 F. Supp. 2d 967 (E.D. Mich. 2006); Schroeder v. Maumee Bd. of Educ., 296 F. Supp. 2d 869 (N.D. Ohio 2003); Montgomery v. Indep. School Dist. No. 709, 109 F.

<p class="indent">As alluded to in <i>Nabozny</i> and other cases in the notes, many states and local governments have adopted statutes defining sexual orientation as a protected class.

<p class="indent">Localities and progressive school districts, likewise, have taken up these issues on their own by adopting school based antibullying ordinances and policies. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Safe Sch.

<p class="indent">Bullying, however, encompasses a broader spectrum of behavior and is not limited to the protection of LGBT youth. “Bullying” is often used interchangeably with peer harassment, but bullying denotes intentionally aggressive behavior inflicted on a repeated basis by one or more students against another. “What distinguishes bullying from mere aggression is that bullying is repetitive and involves a power imbalance between a socially powerful perpetrator and a socially weaker victim. Hence, bullies prey on students who are often marginalized in the wider school community because of actual or perceived differences such as obesity, disability, or sexual orientation.” Julie Sacks &amp; Robert Salem, <i>Without Legal Remedies: Why Kids Need Schools to Develop Comprehensive Anti-Bullying Policies</i>, 72 <span class="smallcap">Alb. L. Rev.</span> 147, 148-149 (2009). While bullying takes many forms, it primarily singles out a student based on actual or perceived race/ethnicity, physical appearance, income level/class, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or physical or intellectual ability. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Dana Markow &amp; Jordan Fein</span>, <span class="smallcap">From Teasing to Torment: School Climate in America—A Survey of Students and Teachers</span> 2 (2005). Substantial research indicates that students who are, or are perceived to be, LGBT are severely and disproportionately targets of bullying behavior, often with little effective responses from school authorities. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Joseph G. Kosciw et al., Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Straight Educ. Network</span>, <span class="smallcap">2009 National School Climate Survey: The Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation’s Schools</span> (2010); <i>see also</i> Michael Higdon, <i>To Lynch a Child: Bullying and Gender Nonconformity in Our Nation’s Schools</i>, 86 <span class="smallcap">Ind. L.J.</span> 827 (2011) (arguing that much of bullying is a way to enforce gender roles and the homophobic complicity of educators make the effects of bullying all the more severe for LGBT youth).</p>
<p class="indent">Given the availability of claims under Title IX and tort law, some argue that these local antibullying statutes are unnecessary. Susan Hanley Kosse &amp; Robert H. Wright, <i>How to Best Confront the Bully: Should Title IX or Anti-Bullying Statutes Be the Answer</i>, 12 <span class="smallcap">Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Pol’y</span> 53 (2005). Such arguments, however, may miss the more fundamental problem, which is that the availability of legal recourse for deliberate indifference, for instance, may do little to prevent the harmful conduct from occurring in the first place. Rather, local policies may be necessary to root out the harassing behavior before it happens. Recognizing this, many advocates propose antibullying policies that include provisions requiring extensive data collection, clarity on what is considered bullying, training for staff and designation of parties responsible for review and compliance, bullying prevention school curricula and programs, and clear complaint procedures and incentives for compliance. <i>See generally</i> Higdon, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<p><a id="page_453" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>453</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">While many jurisdictions have adopted such policies, most do not include protections for students bullied based on real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Straight Educ. Network, States with Fully Enumerated Anti-Bullying Laws—US Map, https://safespace.glsen.org/map.cfm (last visited Feb. 28, 2013). Further, some states have begun to allow an exemption to antibullying policies for “a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction of a school employee, school volunteer, pupil, or a pupil’s parent or guardian.” <i>See</i> Brody Levesque, <i>Critics Blast Anti-Bullying Law for Allowing Exceptions Based on Religion, Moral Beliefs</i>, LGBTQNATION, Nov. 3, 2011. Exceptions of this sort sanction anti-LGBT bullying and schools’ failure to respond.</p>
<p class="indent">Considering the homophobia and social alienation faced by many LGBT students, some have sought self-help. In particular, students have attempted to establish supportive spaces within their schools, most commonly referred to as Gay Straight Alliances (GSA). Some school boards, administrators, and local communities oppose these efforts. An important tool for GSA activists has been the Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C. §§4071-4074 (2006) (EAA). Under the Act, a school receiving federal funds that sponsors or sanctions noncurricular student-led clubs must give all clubs equal access to meeting spaces and school publications and cannot prohibit a group based on “political, philosophical, or other content” of speech, except if the group “materially and substantially interfere[s] with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school.” Although the Act was originally passed to allow religious and bible study groups to use school buildings and resources, it has been a powerful tool to establish GSAs. <i>See</i> Boyd Cnty. High Sch. Gay Straight Alliance v. Bd. of Educ., 258 F. Supp. 2d 667, 693 (E.D. Ky. 2003); Colin v. Orange Unified Sch. Dist., 83 F. Supp. 2d 1135 (C.D. Cal. 2000). A more expanded discussion of the EAA and the First Amendment rights of students is included in later chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">Skeptical of the efficacy of legal protections, another more aggressive approach to address the challenges faced by LGBT students in normal school environments has been to establish separate schools specially designed to meet the needs of LGBT students. A number of school districts have established publicly funded schools for LGBT students, most notably NYC’s Harvey Milk High School, Milwaukee’s Alliance School, and Los Angeles’s Opportunities for Learning and Lifeworks multilocation charter school. Such institutions have been subject to extensive controversy, echoing the concerns of opponents of single-sex education regarding schools segregated based on identity. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Randy Hedlund, <i>Chalk Talk: Segregation by Any Other Name: Harvey Milk High School</i>, 33 <span class="smallcap">J.L. &amp; Educ.</span> 425 (2004); Louis P. Nappen, <i>Why Segregated Schools for Gay Students May Pass a “Separate But Equal” Analysis but Fail Other Issues and Concerns</i>, 12 <span class="smallcap">Wm. &amp; Mary J. of Women &amp; L.</span> 101 (2005). Other opponents stress the importance of ensuring that all schools are bullying- and harassment-free spaces where diversity and individual identity is embraced, and argue that removing LGBT students from mainstream educational environments reinforces the notion that those students are different. <i>See, e.g.</i>, John Colapinto, <i>The Harvey Milk School Has No Right to Exist. Discuss.,</i> <span class="smallcap">N.Y. Mag.</span>, May 21, 2005. Proponents tout their higher graduation and college acceptance rates, stress the voluntary</p>

<p class="noindent">nature of such schools, emphasize that the schools are open to all students regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and argue that these schools are necessary in a context of the emotional and physical violence faced by LGBT students in traditional educational environments, the family rejection commonly experienced by LGBT youth, and the systemic failure of schools to effectively protect LGBT youth. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Thomas A. Mayes, Counterpoint, <i>Separate Public High Schools for Sexual Minority Students and the Limits of the</i> Brown <i>Analogy</i>, 35 <span class="smallcap">J.L. &amp; Educ.</span> 339 (2006); Kristina Brittenhan, Note, <i>Equal Protection Theory and the Harvey Milk High School: Why Anti-Subordination Alone Is Not Enough</i>, 45 <span class="smallcap">B.C. L. Rev.</span> 869 (2004).</p>
<p class="indent">Considering what you learned in the single-sex education and LGBT student sections, are these schools constitutionally permissible? How would LGBT schools fare under Title IX? Are antibullying legislation and other safe schools efforts sufficient to meet the needs of LGBT students? What if antibullying legislation did not explicitly include a prohibition for discrimination based on real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity? What if antibullying policies are inadequately enforced?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch159">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Mark, a ninth grader, wore a “fashion forward” shirt to school one day. His male classmates perceived the shirt to be “gay” rather than fashion forward. A few boys circulated a rumor that Mark is gay. During lunch, Steve, who had heard the rumor, walked by Mark’s table and threw a banana on it, saying “here faggot. Maybe you can make use of this.” Many onlookers burst into laughter. Mark did not tell his family and instead feigned sickness to stay home for two days. On the third day, his mother discovered the truth, immediately called the principal (Mr. Davis), and demanded something be done. Davis said he would investigate the matter, and Mark returned to school.</p>
<p class="indent">Davis spoke with the cafeteria monitor, who indicated he had witnessed the event from afar, but did not intercede or follow up. Thus, Davis called Steve to the office, reprimanded him, and told him to “leave Mark alone.” The following week, Steve approached Mark and told him that he would “beat the crap out of him if he ever ratted him or anyone else out again.” Afterward, taunting by Steve and others increased. Mark found graphic sexual drawings anonymously taped to his locker. People would cut him in the cafeteria line, bump him in the hallway, and knock books off his desk, all of which were often followed by comments like “oops” or “sorry, it was an accident.” Mark believed the apologies to be insincere, but told no one of his troubles. During this time, Mark’s grades steadily dropped from As to Bs and Cs and he generally withdrew from any active engagement in school. He also found it difficult to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="indent">Did the school have an obligation to take more action than it did? What claims could Mark’s mother bring if she learns of these incidents, and what will the result likely be?</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch160">L. GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p class="noindent">While most of the cases and discussion in this section most directly focus on discrimination based on sexual orientation, the analysis and law also implicate the educational opportunities of transgender students. The term “transgender” encompasses several categories of students, including those whose biological sex does not correspond to their gender identity, a person whose gender identity does not conform to either male or female roles, and those whose biological sex is intersexed (meaning they have some aspects of both male and female anatomies). Transgender students often face a set of challenges analogous to but distinct from lesbian and gay students. For instance, because their gender identity does not conform to societal expectations, restrooms and locker rooms can be a frightening and even dangerous place, which often forces transgender students to avoid using the bathrooms altogether. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Transgender L. Ctr.</span>, <span class="smallcap">Peeing in Peace: A Resource for Transgender Activists and Allies</span> 3 (2005) (noting that, even in jurisdictions with robust protections and community support for transgender people, 50 percent of respondents in a survey reported being assaulted or harassed in a public restroom).</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch161">1. <i>Access to School Restrooms and Other Facilities</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Courts traditionally have been reluctant to recognize the prohibition on the use of bathrooms by transgender people in conformity with their gender identity as discriminatory. Lisa Mottet, Transgender Civ. Rts. Project, Speech at Georgetown Symposium on Gender &amp; Sexuality (Feb. 27, 2002), in <i>Access to Gender-Appropriate Bathrooms: A Frustrating Diversion on the Path to Transgender Equality</i>, 4 <span class="smallcap">Geo. J. Gender &amp; L.</span> 739, 744 (2003) (citing <i>Goins v. W. Group</i>, 635 N.W.2d 717 (Minn. 2001)). <i>But see</i> Doe v. Yunits, 2001 WL 664947 (Mass. Super. Ct. Feb. 26, 2001) (referencing bathroom access, and discipline for using the “wrong” bathroom, as one of the aspects of gender discrimination affecting transgender students). In recent years, however, judicial and agency responses have been more favorable.</p>
<p class="indent">Between 2010 and 2015, the Department of Education issued policy guidance on more than one occasion indicating that not only did Title IX prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in certain instances, it prohibited discrimination based on gender identity:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Although Title IX does not prohibit discrimination based solely on sexual orientation, Title IX does protect all students, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students, from sex discrimination. When students are subjected to harassment on the basis of their LGBT status, they may also, as this example illustrates, be subjected to forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX. The fact that the harassment includes anti-LGBT comments or is partly based on the target’s actual or perceived sexual orientation does not relieve a school of its obligation under Title IX to investigate and remedy overlapping sexual harassment or gender-based harassment.

<p><a id="page_456" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>456</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">in part on the student’s failure to act as some of his peers believed a boy should act. The harassment created a hostile environment that limited the student’s ability to participate in the school’s education program (e.g., access to the drama club). Finally, even though the student did not identify the harassment as sex discrimination, the school should have recognized that the student had been subjected to gender-based harassment covered by Title IX.</p>

Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes.”).</p>
<p class="indent">With that guidance in place, students began to assert their rights and several highly visible fights over access to school facilities made the national news. Even under the threat of funding termination, one district in suburban Chicago initially refused to comply with the Department’s policy position that Title IX requires that a transgender student be granted access to facilities consistent with the student’s gender. Duaa Eldeib, <i>Feds: Palatine District Discriminated Against Transgender Student by Barring Her from Girls’ Locker Room</i>, <span class="smallcap">Chicago Tribune</span>, Nov. 3, 2015. Relatively quickly, however, districts like this one began to bend to federal pressure. State legislatures then responded in support of districts that wished to resist. In the first few months of 2016, South Dakota, Tennessee, and North Carolina’s legislatures passed bills that prohibited transgender youth from using facilities consistent with their gender. In South Dakota and Tennessee, the governors vetoed the bills, preventing them from becoming law, but in March 2016, the governor of North Carolina approved his legislature’s bill, making it the first state to enact such a law. Just weeks later, in a separate controversy, the Fourth Circuit became the first court to hold that Title IX’s protections extended to transgender youth’s gender identity.</p>

<p class="indent">G.G. and his mother told school officials that G.G. was a transgender boy. The officials were [initially] supportive[,] took steps to ensure that he would be treated as a boy[, and] allowed G.G. to use the boys’ restroom.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note22" id="Rnote22" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> G.G. used this restroom without incident for about seven weeks. G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom, however, excited the interest of others in the community [who sought] to bar G.G. from the boys’ restroom.</p>
<p class="indent">[This led to a school board meeting where] Board Member Carla Hook proposed the following resolution:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Whereas the GCPS [i.e., Gloucester County Public Schools] recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and Whereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance from parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to protect the privacy of all students, therefore It shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">[This policy proposal generated extensive community comments over the course of two board meetings. Community members referred to G.G. in highly offensive terms and asserted that he would violate others’ privacy, incite sexual assaults, and promote other boys sneaking into the girls’ bathroom. Some threatened to vote the Board out of office if they continued to allow G.G. to use the boys’ restroom. T]he Board voted 6-1 to adopt the proposed policy, thereby barring G.G. from using the boys’ restroom at school.</p>
<p class="indent">G.G. alleges that he cannot use the girls’ restroom because women and girls in those facilities “react[] negatively because they perceive[] G.G. to be a boy.” Further, using the girls’ restroom would “cause severe psychological distress” to G.G. and would be incompatible with his treatment for gender dysphoria. As a corollary to the policy, the Board [decided] to improve [the] general privacy for all students, including adding or expanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, adding privacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and constructing single-stall unisex restrooms available to all students. G.G. alleges that he cannot use these new unisex restrooms because they “make him feel even more stigmatized.…Being required to use the separate restrooms sets him apart from his peers, and serves as a daily reminder that the school views him as ‘different.’” G.G. further alleges that, because of this stigma and exclusion, his social transition is undermined and he experiences “severe and persistent</p>
<p><a id="page_458" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>458</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">emotional and social harms.” G.G. avoids using the restroom while at school and has, as a result of this avoidance, developed multiple urinary tract infections.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Title IX provides: “[n]o person…shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. §1681(a). To allege a violation of Title IX, G.G. must allege (1) that he was excluded from participation in an education program because of his sex; (2) that the educational institution was receiving federal financial assistance at the time of his exclusion; and (3) that the improper discrimination caused G.G. harm.</p>
<p class="indent">Not all distinctions on the basis of sex are impermissible under Title IX. For example, Title IX permits the provision of separate living facilities on the basis of sex: “nothing contained [in Title IX] shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.” 20 U.S.C. §1686. The Department’s regulations implementing Title IX permit the provision of “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. §106.33. The Department recently delineated how this regulation should be applied to transgender individuals. In an opinion letter dated January 7, 2015, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) wrote: “When a school elects to separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex…a school generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A.</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">G.G., and the United States as amicus curiae, ask us to give the Department’s interpretation of its own regulation controlling weight pursuant to <i>Auer v. Robbins</i>, 519 U.S. 452 (1997). <i>Auer</i> requires that an agency’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation be given controlling weight unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or statute. Agency interpretations need not be well-settled or long-standing to be entitled to deference. They must, however, “reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.” An interpretation may not be the result of the agency’s fair and considered judgment, and will not be accorded <i>Auer</i> deference, when the interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation, when it appears that the interpretation is no more than a convenient litigating position, or when the interpretation is a post hoc rationalization. Christopher v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 132 S. Ct. 2156, 2166 (2012) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="indent">The district court declined to afford deference to the Department’s interpretation of 34 C.F.R. §106.33. The district court found the regulation to be unambiguous because “[i]t clearly allows the School Board to limit bathroom access ‘on the basis of sex,’ including birth or biological sex.” The district court</p>
<p><a id="page_459" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>459</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">also found, alternatively, that the interpretation advanced by the Department was clearly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation. The district court reasoned that, because “on the basis of sex” means, at most, on the basis of sex and gender together, it cannot mean on the basis of gender alone.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B.</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[O]ur analysis begins with a determination of whether 34 C.F.R. §106.33 contains an ambiguity. Section 106.33 permits schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.” 34 C.F.R. §106.33. “[D]etermining whether a regulation or statute is ambiguous presents a legal question, which we determine de novo.” We determine ambiguity by analyzing the language under the three-part framework set forth in <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co</i>., 519 U.S. 337 (1997). The plainness or ambiguity of language is determined by reference to (1) the language itself, (2) the specific context in which that language is used, and (3) the broader context of the statute or regulation as a whole. Id. at 341.</p>
<p class="indent">First, we have little difficulty concluding that the language itself—“of one sex” and “of the other sex”—refers to male and female students. Second, in the specific context of §106.33, the plain meaning of the regulatory language is best stated by the United States: “the mere act of providing separate restroom facilities for males and females does not violate Title IX.…” Third, the language “of one sex” and “of the other sex” appears repeatedly in the broader context of 34 C.F.R. §106 Subpart D, titled “Discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited.” This repeated formulation indicates two sexes (“one sex” and “the other sex”), and the only reasonable reading of the language used throughout the relevant regulatory section is that it references male and female. Read plainly then, §106.33 permits schools to provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities for its male and female students. By implication, the regulation also permits schools to exclude males from the female facilities and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="indent">Our inquiry is not ended, however, by this straightforward conclusion. Although the regulation may refer unambiguously to males and females, it is silent as to how a school should determine whether a transgender individual is a male or female for the purpose of access to sex-segregated restrooms. We conclude that the regulation is susceptible to more than one plausible reading because it permits both the Board’s reading—determining maleness or femaleness with reference exclusively to genitalia—and the Department’s interpretation—determining maleness or femaleness with reference to gender identity. It is not clear to us how the regulation would apply in a number of situations—even under the Board’s own “biological gender” formulation. For example, which restroom would a transgender individual who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery use? What about an intersex individual? What about an individual born with X-X-Y sex chromosomes? What about an individual who lost external genitalia in an accident? The Department’s interpretation resolves ambiguity by providing that in the case of a transgender individual</p>
<p><a id="page_460" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>460</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">using a sex-segregated facility, the individual’s sex as male or female is to be generally determined by reference to the student’s gender identity.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C.</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Because we conclude that the regulation is ambiguous as applied to transgender individuals, the Department’s interpretation is entitled to <i>Auer</i> deference unless the Board demonstrates that the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or statute. An agency’s view need only be reasonable to warrant deference. Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U.S. 680, 702 (1991) (“[I]t is axiomatic that the [agency’s] interpretation need not be the best or most natural one by grammatical or other standards. Rather, the [agency’s] view need be only reasonable to warrant deference.”).</p>
<p class="indent">Two dictionaries from the [relevant regulation] drafting era inform our analysis of how the term “sex” was understood at that time. The first defines “sex” as “the character of being either male or female” or “the sum of those anatomical and physiological differences with reference to which the male and female are distinguished.…” American College Dictionary 1109 (1970). The second defines “sex” as:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">the sum of the morphological, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserves biparental reproduction with its concomitant genetic segregation and recombination which underlie most evolutionary change, that in its typical dichotomous occurrence is usu[ally] genetically controlled and associated with special sex chromosomes, and that is typically manifested as maleness and femaleness.…</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2081 (1971).</p>
<p class="indent">Although these definitions suggest that the word “sex” was understood at the time the regulation was adopted to connote male and female and that maleness and femaleness were determined primarily by reference to namely reproductive organs, the definitions also suggest that a hard-and-fast binary division on the basis of reproductive organs—although useful in most cases—was not universally descriptive. The dictionaries, therefore, used qualifiers such as reference to the “sum of” various factors, “typical dichotomous occurrence,” and “typically manifested as maleness and femaleness.” Section 106.33 assumes a student population composed of individuals of what has traditionally been understood as the usual “dichotomous occurrence” of male and female where the various indicators of sex all point in the same direction. It sheds little light on how exactly to determine the “character of being either male or female” where those indicators diverge. We conclude that the Department’s interpretation of how §106.33 and its underlying assumptions should apply to transgender individuals is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the text of the regulation. The regulation is silent as to which restroom transgender individuals are to use when a school elects to provide sex-segregated restrooms, and the Department’s interpretation, although perhaps not the intuitive one, is permitted by the varying physical, psychological, and social aspects—or, in the words of an older dictionary, “the morphological, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities”—included in the term “sex.”</p>
<p><a id="page_461" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>461</b></a></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D.</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Even a valid interpretation will not be accorded <i>Auer</i> deference where it conflicts with a prior interpretation, where it appears that the interpretation is no more than a convenient litigating position, or where the interpretation is a post hoc rationalization. [The Department’s interpretation is new, but only because the issue recently arose. Once it arose, the Department’s interpretation and enforcement of the regulation has been consistent. There is no indication that its interpretation is “merely a convenient litigating position” or a post hoc rationalization. Rather, it is consistent “with the existing guidances and regulations of a number of federal agencies—all of which provide that transgender individuals should be permitted access to the restroom that corresponds with their gender identities.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note23" id="Rnote23" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></sup>”] None of the <i>Christopher</i> grounds for withholding <i>Auer</i> deference are present in this case. [Thus,] the Department’s interpretation of its own regulation, §106.33, as it relates to restroom access by transgender individuals, is entitled to <i>Auer</i> deference and is to be accorded controlling weight in this case. We reverse the district court’s contrary conclusion and its resultant dismissal of G.G.’s Title IX claim.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>F.</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In many respects, we are in agreement with the dissent. We agree that “sex” should be construed uniformly throughout Title IX and its implementing regulations. We agree that it has indeed been commonplace and widely accepted to separate public restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of sex. We agree that “an individual has a legitimate and important interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude or partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts” are not involuntarily exposed.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#note24" id="Rnote24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></sup> It is not apparent to us, however, that the truth of these propositions undermines the conclusion we reach regarding the level of deference due to the Department’s interpretation of its own regulations.</p>

We have carefully followed the Supreme Court’s guidance in <i>Chevron, Auer</i>, and <i>Christopher</i> and have determined that the interpretation contained in the OCR letter is to be accorded controlling weight.

<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">N<span class="smallcap">iemeyer</span>, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>
<p class="indent">Accepting [a] new definition of the statutory term “sex,” the majority’s opinion, for the first time ever, holds that a public high school may not provide separate restrooms and locker rooms on the basis of biological sex. Rather, it must now allow a biological male student who identifies as female to use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms and, likewise, must allow a biological female student who identifies as male to use the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms. This holding completely tramples on all universally accepted protections of privacy and safety that are based on the anatomical differences between the sexes. And, unwittingly, it also tramples on the very concerns expressed by G.G., who said that he should not be forced to go to the girls’ restrooms because of the “severe psychological distress” it would inflict on him and because female students had “reacted negatively” to his presence in girls’ restrooms. Surely biological males who identify as females would encounter similar reactions in the girls’ restroom, just as students physically exposed to students of the opposite biological sex would be likely to experience psychological distress. As a result, schools would no longer be able to protect physiological privacy as between students of the opposite biological sex.</p>
<p class="indent">The recent Office for Civil Rights letter, moreover, which is not law but which is the only authority on which the majority relies, states more than the majority acknowledges. In the sentence following the sentence on which the majority relies, the letter states that, to accommodate transgender students, schools are encouraged “to offer the use of gender-neutral, individual-user facilities to any student who does not want to use shared sex-segregated facilities [as permitted by Title IX’s regulations].” This appears to approve the course that G.G.’s school followed when it created unisex restrooms in addition to the boys’ and girls’ restrooms it already had.</p>
<p class="indent">Title IX and its implementing regulations are not ambiguous. In recognition of physiological privacy and safety concerns, they allow schools to provide “separate living facilities for the different sexes,” 20 U.S.C. §1686, provided that the</p>
<p><a id="page_463" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>463</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">facilities are “proportionate” and “comparable,” 34 C.F.R. §106.32(b), and to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” again provided that the facilities are “comparable,” 34 C.F.R. §106.33.</p>
<p class="indent">Across societies and throughout history, it has been commonplace and universally accepted to separate public restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities on the basis of biological sex in order to address privacy and safety concerns arising from the biological differences between males and females. An individual has a legitimate and important interest in bodily privacy such that his or her nude or partially nude body, genitalia, and other private parts are not exposed to persons of the opposite biological sex. Indeed, courts have consistently recognized that the need for such privacy is inherent in the nature and dignity of humankind. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized, when ordering an all-male Virginia college to admit female students, that such a remedy “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 550 n.19 (1996).</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, Title IX’s allowance for the separation, based on sex, of living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities rests on the universally accepted concern for bodily privacy that is founded on the biological differences between the sexes. This privacy concern is also linked to safety concerns that could arise from sexual responses prompted by students’ exposure to the private body parts of students of the other biological sex. Indeed, the School Board cited these very reasons for its adoption of the policy, explaining that it separates restrooms and locker rooms to promote the privacy and safety of minor children, pursuant to its “responsibility to its students to ensure their privacy while engaging in personal bathroom functions, disrobing, dressing, and showering outside of the presence of members of the opposite sex. [That the school has this responsibility] is particularly true in an environment where children are still developing, both emotionally and physically.”</p>
<p class="indent">The realities underpinning Title IX’s recognition of separate living facilities, restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities are reflected in the plain language of the statute and regulations, which is not ambiguous. The text of Title IX and its regulations allowing for separation of each facility “on the basis of sex” employs the term “sex” as was generally understood at the time of enactment. Title IX was enacted in 1972 and the regulations were promulgated in 1975 and readopted in 1980, and during that time period, virtually every dictionary definition of “sex” referred to the physiological distinctions between males and females, particularly with respect to their reproductive functions. Indeed, although the contemporaneous meaning controls our analysis, it is notable that, even today, the term “sex” continues to be defined based on the physiological distinctions between males and females. Any new definition of sex that excludes reference to physiological differences, as the majority now attempts to introduce, is simply an unsupported reach to rationalize a desired outcome. Thus, when the School Board assigned restrooms and locker rooms on the basis of biological sex, it was clearly complying precisely with the unambiguous language of Title IX and its regulations.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination based on sex ambiguous? In what way? Is the Department of Education’s regulation allowing schools to provide “separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex” ambiguous?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Would a prohibition on sex discrimination that did not also protect against gender discrimination make sense? If gender discrimination is prohibited, must gender identity discrimination be prohibited as well?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What rationale does the court offer to justify the Department’s interpretation that “a school [that] elects to separate or treat students differently on the basis of sex…generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity”?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Regardless of what Title IX regulations require or permit, does the board’s treatment of G.G. raise any additional constitutional concerns? What level of constitutional scrutiny should apply to the facts in G.G.? Under that scrutiny, could a school justify the exclusion of transgender students from restrooms consistent with their gender identity? Does the board have a legitimate or important interest in excluding transgender students from restrooms consistent with their gender identity?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Does the presence of a male transgender student, for instance, in the male restroom invade the privacy rights of other students? If such a right exists, how should a court balance that privacy right with the right of the transgender student to use the restroom?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Why does the court find that the provision of a unisex restroom was insufficient to comply with Title IX?</p>
<p class="indent">7. While <i>Grimm</i> was the first federal court to recognize the right of transgender youth to use facilities consistent with their gender identity, the Maine Supreme Court reached a similar result under its state law. The Maine Human Rights Act provides that</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">It is unlawful public accommodations discrimination, in violation of this Act…[f]or any public accommodation or any person who is the…superintendent, agent, or employee of any place of public accommodation to directly or indirectly refuse, discriminate against or in any manner withhold from or deny the full and equal enjoyment to any person, on account of…sexual orientation…any of the accommodations…[or] facilities…of public accommodation.…</p>

<p class="noindent">5 Me. Rev. Stat. §4592. Based on this statute, the court issued a carefully crafted opinion. It wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">we emphasize that in this case the school had a program carefully developed over several years and supported by an educational plan designed to sensitively address Susan’s gender identity issues. The determination that discrimination is demonstrated in this case rests heavily on Susan’s gender identity and gender dysphoria diagnosis, both of which were acknowledged and accepted by the school. The school, her parents, her counselors, and her friends all accepted that Susan is a girl.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, we do not suggest that any person could demand access to any school facility or program based solely on a self-declaration of gender identity or confusion without the plans</p>
<p><a id="page_465" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>465</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">developed in cooperation with the school and the accepted and respected diagnosis that are present in this case. Our opinion must not be read to require schools to permit students casual access to any bathroom of their choice. Decisions about how to address students’ legitimate gender identity issues are not to be taken lightly. Where, as here, it has been clearly established that a student’s psychological well-being and educational success depend upon being permitted to use the communal bathroom consistent with her gender identity, denying access to the appropriate bathroom constitutes sexual orientation discrimination in violation of the [Maine Human Rights Act].</p>

A few courts, however, have interpreted state sex discrimination laws to include transgender people. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Dep’t of Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. v. Marion’s Place, 2006 WL 1130912, FEHC Dec. No. 06-01 (Cal. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. Comm’n 2006); Morales v. ATP Health &amp; Beauty Care, Inc., 2008 WL 3845294 (D. Conn. 2008); Doe <i>ex rel</i>. Doe v.

<p class="indent">8. Some advocates have proposed another theory of relief for transgender students, arguing that gender identity disorder (GID) is a disability and should be protected by relevant disability statutes. This strategy has invoked a vigorous debate within the transgender community. <i>See</i> Jennifer Levi &amp; Bennett Klein, <i>Pursuing Protection for Transgender People through Disability Laws</i>, in <span class="smallcap">Transgender Rights</span> 74-92 (Paisley Currah et al. eds., 2006) (noting that the word “disability” is medically centered and implies that transgender identity is an illness to be cured); Pooja S.

Pol’y</span> 7, 15-16 (2007) (arguing that reliance on medicalization to exercise rights and protections is problematic). GID is explicitly excluded from the two most important federal disability laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§12101 <i>et seq.,</i> and §504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794. Most state disability rights laws either explicitly, or through judicial interpretation, exclude GID. Some state courts, however, have extended state disability protections to transgender people. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Lie v. Sky Publ’g Corp., 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 412 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2002); Enriquez v. W. Jersey Health Sys., 777 A.2d 365 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001), <i>cert denied</i>, 785 A.2d 439 (N.J. 2001); Jean Doe v. Bell, 754 N.Y.S.2d 846 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2003); <i>see also</i> Jeanie J.

<p class="h4" id="ch163">2. <i>Dress Codes</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Dress codes can also present challenges for transgender youth. School dress codes and assertions that a particular way of dressing is “disruptive” have been used to impose conformity with stereotypical gender roles and have resulted in transgender students receiving disciplinary action.

<p class="h4" id="ch164">3. <i>Athletic Opportunities</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Due to the organization of sports based on sex and gender, transgender students are often forced to choose between participating in sex-segregated teams inconsistent with their gender identity or not participating at all. The exclusion of transgender students from teams in accord with their gender identities is justified by arguments that inclusion would create an “unfair disadvantage,” focusing on the concerns over transgender women (born male, but identified as female) playing on girls’ teams. Civil rights advocates counter, arguing that such assertions are premised on transphobic notions that transgender women are not “real” women and that being born male gives them an unfair advantage over those born female. These assertions seemingly rely on stereotypes and disregard the wide variation in size, strength, and athleticism present within genders. Studies have largely discredited the notion that transgender women would have an unfair advantage and that permitting transgender women to participate in female sports would encourage boys to pretend to be transgender. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Pat Griffen &amp; Helen J. Carroll</span>, <span class="smallcap">On the Team: Equal Opportunity for Transgender Student Athletes</span> (2010).</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to 2011, the NCAA had no official policy governing transgender student participation, but generally defined an athlete’s sex based on governmental documents such as birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and taxes. Since each state has different requirements and procedures for the modification of government</p>

<p class="noindent">documents to conform to one’s gender identity (often requiring one to undergo sex reassignment surgery prior to the modification), a school in one state can field a women’s team with a member whose natal gender was not female, while a school in another could not, both consistent with NCAA policy. Erin E. Buzuvis, <i>Transgender Student-Athletes and Sex-Segregated Sport: Developing Policies of Inclusion for Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Athletics</i>, 21 <span class="smallcap">Seton Hall J. Sports &amp; Ent. L.</span> 1, 24 (2011). In 2011, the NCAA approved a final policy that allows “transgender student-athletes to participate in sex-separated sports activities so long as the athlete’s use of hormone therapy is consistent with the NCAA policies and current medical standards.” Marta Lawrence, <i>Transgender Policy Approved</i>, NCAA (Sept. 13, 2011), http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2011/September/Transgender+policy+approved.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, state interscholastic athletic associations have adopted different standards, some requiring surgery prior to participation in a team of one’s gender identity, and others requiring a hearing to determine whether the gender identity is “bona fide.” Buzuvis, <i>supra</i>, at 25. Since advocates and the NCAA have been relatively effective in delineating best practices for schools to address issues related to transgender students in sports, more and more schools, school districts, states, and interscholastic athletic associations have begun to adopt trans-inclusive policies.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote16" id="note16" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a> In Dr. Beech’s own affidavit, she admits that she takes family responsibilities into account when evaluating both male and female applicants. Although Dr. Beech recommended that Ms. Tingley-Kelley be interviewed, which indicates that she thought Ms. Tingley-Kelley had the potential to be admitted, it is still possible that her notations about Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s parental responsibilities were reviewed by other members of the Admissions Committee and played a role in the ultimate denial of Ms. Tingley-Kelley’s applications.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote17" id="note17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a> Had Ms. Tingley-Kelley only presented circumstantial evidence of “sex-plus” discrimination, she may have then needed to demonstrate that she was treated unfavorably as compared to the corresponding subclass of men in proving her case, though the case law is not settled in this respect. Because Ms. Tingley-Kelley presents direct evidence of discrimination, the Court need not evaluate her circumstantial case.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote18" id="note18" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a> Several amici have urged that diversity in educational opportunities is an altogether appropriate governmental pursuit and that single-sex schools can contribute importantly to such diversity. Indeed, it is the mission of some single-sex schools “to dissipate, rather than perpetuate, traditional gender classifications.” We do not question the Commonwealth’s prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities. We address specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized by the District Court and the Court of Appeals as “unique,” an opportunity available only at Virginia’s premier military institute, the Commonwealth’s sole single-sex public university or college.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote19" id="note19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a> The various studies and statistics relied upon by both defendants’ expert and plaintiff’s expert suggest that at age 13 the average female tends to be slightly taller and heavier than the average male of that age, although there is a wide range of variance amongst all the members in both sexes. [But] the average boy at that age has a very slightly higher ratio of lean body mass to fat mass, and a somewhat higher ratio of lean body mass to height, has heavier bones, may have somewhat more speed and upper body strength, and has somewhat better motor coordination. After age 13 these differences begin to widen appreciably, and by the time the later teens are reached the “average” male has not only greatly widened the gap in terms of lean body mass ratio, but has also considerably surpassed the “average” female in terms of height and total body weight.</p>
<p class="findent">All of the above physiological factors are said to have a bearing on one’s physical ability to compete in a sport[, but other factors such as conditioning, desire and intelligence are also involved. Thus, the statistics regarding average males and females may be skewed by the fact “that conditioning can have a bearing on lean body mass ratios” and females, due to societal roles, “have in the past been less physically active than males.”]</p>

Rhode Island Interscholastic League,</i> 469 F. Supp. 659 (D.R.I.1979), <i>vacated as moot</i>, 604 F.2d 733 (1st Cir. 1979). <i>Contra, Mularadelia v. Haldane Cent. Sch. Bd.</i>, 74 App. Div. 2d 248, 427 N.Y.S.2d 458 (1980).</p>

The potential for injury, however, at least in contact sports, is said to be related to the physical characteristics mentioned in [the previous footnote], particularly lean body mass ratios. If that is so, to that extent perhaps the “average” boy at age 13 will have somewhat less potential for injury in football than the “average” girl at age 13. In addition, girls who have reached sexual maturity (on the average between 12 and 13 years, although in some instances much later) begin to develop a wider hip structure, and the angle between the hip and the knee (called the “Q angle”) increases, with resulting potential for increased knee injury. How significant that increased “Q angle” is, and just what its real potential for increased knee injury in football might be, was a subject disputed by Dr. Falls and Dr. Burke.</p>

He does not seek here, and never has sought, use of the boys’ locker room. Only restroom use is at issue in this case.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote23" id="note23" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a> We disagree with the dissent’s suggestion that the result we reach today renders the enforcement of separate restroom facilities impossible because it “would require schools to assume gender identity based on appearances, social expectations, or explicit declarations of identity.” Post at 65. Accepting the Board’s position would equally require the school to assume “biological sex” based on “appearances, social expectations, or explicit declarations of [biological sex].” Certainly, no one is suggesting mandatory verification of the “correct” genitalia before admittance to a restroom. The Department’s vision of sex-segregated restrooms which takes account of gender identity presents no greater “impossibility of enforcement” problem than does the Board’s “biological gender” vision of sex-segregated restrooms.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote24" id="note24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a> We doubt that G.G.’s use of the communal restroom of his choice threatens the type of constitutional abuses present in the cases cited by the dissent. For example, G.G.’s use—or for that matter any individual’s appropriate use—of a restroom will not involve the type of intrusion present in Brannum v. Overton Cty. Sch. Bd., 516 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (involving the videotaping of students dressing and undressing in school locker rooms), Beard v. Whitmore Lake Sch. Dist., 402 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir. 2005) (involving the indiscriminate strip searching of twenty male and five female students), or Supelveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1992) (involving a male parole officer forcibly entering a bathroom stall with a female parolee to supervise the provision of a urine sample).</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote25" id="note25" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a> The dissent accepts the Board’s invocation of amorphous safety concerns as a reason for refusing deference to the Department’s interpretation. We note that the record is devoid of any evidence tending to show that G.G.’s use of the boys’ restroom creates a safety issue. We also note that the Board has been, perhaps deliberately, vague as to the nature of the safety concerns it has—whether it fears that it cannot ensure G.G.’s safety while in the restroom or whether it fears G.G. himself is a threat to the safety of others in the restroom. We are unconvinced of the existence of danger caused by “sexual responses prompted by students’ exposure to the private body parts of students of the other biological sex.” Post at 58. The same safety concern would seem to require segregated restrooms for gay boys and girls who would, under the dissent’s formulation, present a safety risk because of the “sexual responses prompted” by their exposure to the private body parts of other students of the same sex in sex-segregated restrooms.</p>
