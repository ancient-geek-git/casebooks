<p class="noindent">This casebook has examined education primarily from the perspective of students, while emphasizing that teachers are necessarily central to the education that students receive. As various cases in the chapter on poverty and school funding indicated, teachers are the key educational input for ensuring positive student outcomes. As such, any book on education that does not focus on various issues pertaining to teachers would be incomplete. Yet, a chapter devoted solely to teachers presents certain challenges within the scope and focus of this book.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of the case law regarding teachers focuses on their individual interests, such as job retention and employment contracts, or the profession’s right to negotiate certain group-based terms of employment. A comprehensive and singular discussion of these rights would stand out against this book’s approach and not fit well in any particular section of the book. While relevant, an extensive discussion of teachers’ rights in the first part of the casebook would be a tangent to the bigger conversation regarding concepts of equality. Likewise, full coverage of the broader concepts of free speech, establishment of religion, and control over the curriculum leave relatively little room for the additional nuances of how teachers exercise their rights within those frameworks. In other words, teachers are everywhere in the preceding chapters of this book but fit solely and squarely nowhere.</p>
<p class="indent">The subjects of this chapter on teachers, however, fit well in the reform section of the book because of the particular legal changes to teacher policy over the last decade. Education reform had increasingly translated into teacher reform and vice versa. Having reached a consensus on the importance of quality teaching to student outcomes, the laws and policies affecting teacher rights have become the subject of broader conversations about improving education. No longer are they simply questions of employment benefits and management. The result has been a bevy of legislative activity regarding teacher rights in recent years.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter explores the highlights of those legislative and related changes. The chapter begins, however, with a section on the traditional due process protections afforded to teachers prior to termination. Older cases best demonstrate those protections. The chapter’s second section identifies the limits that</p>
<p><a id="page_1006" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1006</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">state and federal constitutions place on the impairment of contracts. These limits have served to block recent changes to teacher tenure and benefits. The third section in the chapter broadly explores teacher unions and the right to collectively bargain over various terms of employment—another right states have sought to narrow in recent years. The fourth section details the statutory and litigation controversies surrounding the use of students’ standardized test scores to evaluate teachers at the point of hiring, firing, and tenure. The chapter concludes with recent litigation claiming that teacher tenure keeps grossly ineffective teachers in the classroom and, thereby, deprives students of access to the equal and quality education that state constitutions mandate.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch373">A. DUE PROCESS RIGHTS PRIOR TO TERMINATION</p>
<p class="noindent">Due process ensures that when a teacher has a property interest in current or future employment, the teacher cannot be terminated without the state making a case against the teacher and allowing the teacher a chance to respond. Teachers’ property interests arise from the contracts into which they enter with their school district and/or state statutes that structure that employment relationship. For instance, a temporary or new teacher might sign a one-year contract to teach in a district. Even though the teacher may not yet have acquired tenure or “career” status, that contract creates a property interest in that job during that one-year period. Once the contract expires, the district no longer owes the teacher process because the property right no longer exists. At that point, the district can excuse or choose not to renew the contract within its unilateral discretion (unless some contract or statutory provision states otherwise). Schools, however, rarely terminate a temporary teacher within a single year. Unless a teacher does something incredibly horrendous, the more likely route is to allow the teacher to finish the school year and just not extend the teacher a contract for the next year.</p>
<p class="indent">Due process concerns are far more likely to arise once a teacher becomes eligible for tenure or acquires it. At that point, teachers acquire a property right in their continued employment. To deprive a teacher of that property, a district must identify a reason for removing a teacher and afford teachers an opportunity to contest the legitimacy of the reasons. Both the reasons for termination and the opportunity to respond are detailed in state statutes. States typically limit the bases for removal to those specified by statute. If, for instance, a district believed a teacher was a particularly weak teacher, the district would cite to a statutory provision identifying “ineffective teaching” or “incompetence” as the basis for removal. The district would then need to put forth affirmative evidence of the teacher’s ineffectiveness. The teacher could contest that evidence and put forth counter evidence of his or her own. This battle over the evidence would normally take place in the context of some type of administrative hearing, where the teacher might also have an attorney present to represent the teacher’s interests. The process might also include an appeal to some higher education authority and eventually to a court.</p>
<p><a id="page_1007" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1007</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In a typical state, notice and response rights prior to termination are afforded through formal procedures. In North Carolina, statutes previously provided, for instance,</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">the superintendent shall give written notice to the career employee by certified mail or personal delivery of his or her intention to make [a] recommendation [of termination to the school board] and shall set forth as part of his or her recommendation the [statutory] grounds upon which he or she believes such dismissal or demotion is justified. The superintendent also shall meet with the career employee and provide written notice of the charges against the career employee, an explanation of the basis for the charges, and an opportunity to respond if the career employee has not done so….</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcap">N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann.</span> §115C-325 (2012). A teacher may request a review of the charges before an impartial hearing officer or the school board. <i>Id</i>. In either forum, the teacher and the superintendent have the right to be represented by counsel and present evidence. <i>Id.</i> The school board has the authority to reject, accept, or modify the superintendent’s recommendation, but the board’s decision is subject to legal appeal before a court. <i>Id</i>. In short, no matter how good a school’s case for terminating an ineffective tenured teacher, it must go through processes of this sort. Moreover, some states, or local interpretations of state law, have required teachers an attempt to remedy their teaching deficiencies. Only after failed remediation would a teacher be terminated.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to popular misconception, however, tenure does not entitle teachers to a lifetime job. Rather, tenure entitles teachers to due process prior to losing their job. The point is to “prevent summary and groundless dismissals.” Monica Teixeira de Sousa, <i>The State of Our Unions: How President Obama’s Education Reforms Threaten the Working Class</i>, 50 U. <span class="smallcap">Louisville L. Rev</span>. 201, 207 (2011). In other words, tenure means that districts cannot eliminate teachers without a good reason as defined by statute. Thus, as a practical matter, if a teacher holds up his or her end of the bargain by effectively discharging his or her duties and the district still has sufficient numbers of students to warrant the teacher’s services, a teacher would generally have a right to remain in the job until retirement.</p>
<p class="indent">The following cases offer brief examples of these statutory frameworks in action. Numerous new cases regarding teacher dismissal are issued each year, but these older cases are included because they focus most on state key legal concepts and reoccurring practical issues: how much process is due, what types of evidence a school and administrative board might consider, typical grounds for dismissal (ineffective teaching and insubordination), the standard of review by courts evaluating those dismissals, and when an opportunity for remediation might be necessary.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch374">Baxter v. Crosby</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>257 S.E.2d 71 (N.C. App. 1979)</i></p>
<p class="indent">F. Leona Baxter (“petitioner”) was employed during the 1973-74 school year by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (“the Board”) as a teacher of orthopedically handicapped children. She had attained status as a</p>
<p><a id="page_1008" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1008</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">career teacher as defined by [state statute] G.S. 115-142(a)(3). On 30 April 1974 Superintendent Rolland W. Jones sent a letter to petitioner in which he said:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">I am writing to advise you pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 115-142(h)(2) that I intend to recommend to the Board of Education that you be dismissed effective at the close of the 1973-74 school year. The grounds for my recommendation include, but are not limited to, inadequate performance, insubordination, neglect of duty, and failure to comply with requirements of the board.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Petitioner requested a review of his recommendation by a panel of the Professional Review Committee, pursuant to G.S. 115-142(h)(3)(i). [T]he Board voted to suspend petitioner without pay pending final determination of [that review]. The five-member panel of the Professional Review Committee, after conducting a hearing, issued a majority report recommend[ing] that petitioner be reinstated with back pay and retention of tenure and that petitioner be transferred to another school and allowed to teach normal children. A [one-person] minority report stated that petitioner “is guilty of inadequate performance, ‘gross’ insubordination, neglect of duty, and failure to comply with Board requirements.” [Superintendent] Jones [then] submitted, pursuant to G.S. 115-142(i)(5), his written recommendation to the Board that petitioner be dismissed “for reasons set forth in a letter from me to her dated April 30, 1974.”</p>
<p class="indent">William E. Poe, Chairman of the Board, informed petitioner pursuant to G.S. 115-142(i)(6) that the Superintendent’s recommendation had been received [and] that she was entitled to a hearing. [T]he hearing was held [and] the Board voted unanimously to terminate petitioner’s employment on the grounds of inadequate performance, insubordination, neglect of duty, and failure to comply with Board guidelines and policy. The Board entered this order after making findings of fact and concluding that “all four (4) grounds for dismissal upon which the Superintendent has based his recommendation of dismissal are true and substantiated upon the basis of competent evidence adduced at these hearings.”</p>
<p class="indent">[P]etitioner appealed from the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County pursuant to G.S. 115-142(n). She alleged that the board had violated both the provisions of G.S. 115-142 and petitioner’s constitutional due process rights and that the Board’s findings of fact and order were unsupported by any competent evidence. [T]he trial court made detailed findings of fact concerning all prior proceedings in this matter and made the following conclusions: 1. The procedures adopted by the Board and rulings made with reference to the admission of evidence were fair and without error[;] 2. Each of the findings of fact by the Board is supported by substantial, competent evidence[;] 3. The findings of fact by the Board support and justify the Board’s conclusion that the grounds upon which Superintendent Jones recommended petitioner’s dismissal were true and substantiated. On these findings and conclusions, the court affirmed the Board’s order. Petitioner appeals.</p>
<p class="indent">The scope of the Superior Court’s review of the Board’s decision in this case and the power of that court in disposing of the case were governed by former</p>
<p><a id="page_1009" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1009</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">G.S. 143-315 (now G.S. 150A-51), which was in effect at the time of the Board hearings in this matter. That statute provided:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional provisions; or (2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; or (3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or (4) Affected by other error of law; or (5) Unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or (6) Arbitrary or capricious.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Due Process</span></p>
<p class="indent">The petitioner’s first group of contentions concern due process. In addressing these contentions, we rely in large measure on the opinion of this Court by Judge (now Chief Judge) Morris in <i>Thompson v. Board of Education</i>, 230 S.E.2d 164 (1976). Petitioner in the present case, as did the petitioner in <i>Thompson</i>, contends that she has been denied due process. We do not agree. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education scrupulously followed the elaborate dismissal procedures mandated by G.S. 115-142. After giving petitioner the required notice, the Board held hearings which extended over three evenings in which the petitioner was represented by counsel, was given the opportunity to cross-examine the Superintendent’s witnesses, and was permitted to present her own evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner’s contentions regarding due process are largely based on a fundamental misconception of the procedures involved in a case of this nature. The procedures prescribed by G.S. 115-142 for the dismissal of a career teacher are essentially administrative rather than judicial. [T]he Board is not bound by the formal rules of evidence which would ordinarily obtain in a proceeding in a trial court. Nor are the Rules of Civil Procedure applicable. While a Board of Education conducting a hearing under G.S. 115-142 must provide all essential elements of due process, it is permitted to operate under a more relaxed set of rules than is a court of law. Boards of Education, normally composed in large part of non-lawyers, are vested with “general control and supervision of all matters pertaining to the public schools in their respective administrative units,” G.S. 115-35(b), a responsibility differing greatly from that of a court. The carrying out of such a responsibility requires a wider latitude in procedure and in the reception of evidence than is allowed a court.</p>
<p class="indent">The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education employed at petitioner’s hearing the same rule of evidence promulgated by the State Board of Education and used by the Wake County Board of Education in <i>Thompson</i>. The rule permits boards of education to admit and give probative effect to “evidence that is of a kind commonly relied on by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of serious affairs.” Petitioner contends that this rule is constitutionally invalid in that it violated her due process rights. We do not agree. This rule of evidence was approved in <i>Thompson</i>. It allows the boards of education to consider a wide range of evidence, as they properly should, in reaching their decisions. Petitioner’s protection lies in the provision in G.S. 143-315(5) which gives to the</p>
<p><a id="page_1010" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1010</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Superior Court power to reverse or modify the Board’s decision if petitioner’s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the administrative decision was “(u)nsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record.”</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner points to the admission at the hearing of hearsay evidence and contends erroneously that this was reversible error. The Board very properly heard such evidence in this case in order to complete its investigation. Evidence of the sort complained of can, and in this case did, provide the necessary background for understanding the matter into which the Board was inquiring.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner further argues, under the rubric of due process, that the Board did not have the requisite degree of impartiality and that this lack of impartiality is shown by the manner in which the hearing was conducted. We have examined the transcript of the hearing in detail and find no evidence of actual bias on the part of any Board member. Petitioner lays stress on the following admission made by one of the Board members at the hearing before Judge Griffin in the Superior Court: “As to whether I understood there was some question of physical abuse of children before the hearing began, I knew, I think most people in the community knew the reasons for Mrs. Baxter’s, the recommendation by the Superintendent that she be terminated.”</p>
<p class="indent">As above noted, the Board of Education is vested by G.S. 115-35(b) with general supervisory authority over the schools within its administrative unit. In the exercise of this authority Board members have a duty to keep themselves apprised of situations such as the one the evidence presented at the hearing in this case discloses. As Judge Morris pointed out in this Court’s opinion in <i>Thompson v. Board of Education</i>, supra, “mere familiarity with the facts of a case gained by an agency in the performance of its statutory duties does not disqualify it as a decisionmaker.”</p>
<p class="indent">After a thorough examination of the transcript of the hearing before the Board we affirm the finding of the Superior Court that “the procedures adopted by the board and rulings made with reference to the admission of evidence were fair and without error.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Substantial Evidence in View of the Entire Record</span></p>
<p class="indent">The petitioner’s second and final major contention is that the Superior Court erred in its finding that “(e)ach of the findings of fact by the Board is supported by substantial, competent evidence.” The required standard of review [is] as follows:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">This standard of judicial review is known as the “whole record” test and must be distinguished from both De novo review and the “any competent evidence” standard of review. The “whole record” test does not allow the reviewing court to replace the Board’s judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even though the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been before it De novo. On the other hand, the “whole record” rule requires the court, in determining the substantiality of evidence supporting the Board’s decision to take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the Board’s evidence. Under the whole evidence rule, the court, may not consider the evidence which in and of itself justifies the Board’s result, without taking into</p>
<p><a id="page_1011" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1011</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Thompson</i>, 233 S.E.2d at 541.</p>
<p class="indent">The grounds on which the Board based its order that petitioner be dismissed are set forth in G.S. 115-142(e): (1) No career teacher shall be dismissed or demoted or employed on a part-time basis except for: a. Inadequate performance; c. Insubordination; d. Neglect of duty; j. Failure to comply with such reasonable requirements as the board may prescribe[.]</p>
<p class="indent">Our task on this appeal is, by application of the “whole record” test to the record of the hearings before the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, to determine whether there is substantial evidence, looking at the record as a whole, of any one of the four grounds which formed the basis of the Board’s dismissal order.</p>
<p class="indent">The finding of fact was that the petitioner was guilty of insubordination. The Board found that petitioner’s insubordination consisted of her continued administration of corporal punishment to her handicapped students after being specifically instructed by her principal, Mrs. Crosby, not to do so without the principal’s prior approval and the presence of an adult witness. This finding is amply supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Crosby, the principal, testified that she received a complaint from the parents of Susan Chapman that petitioner “had been hitting Susan in the head.” Petitioner admitted at the hearing that she had “tapped” Susan Chapman. Petitioner’s classroom aide testified at the hearing that she had seen petitioner whip Susan Chapman “several times.” Mrs. Crosby called in petitioner [and instructed her to not strike or even punish her students without the principal’s presence, an instruction which other witnesses confirmed hearing].</p>
<p class="indent">Principal Crosby received a [subsequent] complaint that petitioner had hit [another student]. At the time [and at the hearing], petitioner admitted striking the boy, but said, “I just tapped him.” Principal Crosby wrote a letter detail[ing] the incident [and other] parental complaints, and asked petitioner once again “to refrain from this sort of practice.”</p>
<p class="indent">[When] petitioner came up for consideration for tenure[,] Principal Crosby expressed to petitioner orally and in person her reservations about giving petitioner tenure. Crosby stated that she agreed to give petitioner tenure upon her word that she would not strike the children any more, and petitioner [agreed]. [In an evaluation letter, which Petitioner received, Crosby wrote that] “Miss Baxter was experiencing difficulty in classroom management and was employing the use of physical punishment in an improper manner. She has made improvement in this area. It is understood, by her, that this type [of] punishment is not acceptable.” [At the hearing,] Principal Crosby explained that by “improper manner” she meant that she expected petitioner to bring the child to the principal’s office and whip it there, if petitioner had to whip it, so that at least the whipping would be in the principal’s presence. Crosby testified that petitioner never brought a child to her office for paddling.</p>
<p class="indent">[Over the next year, Crosby received additional complaints that Baxter had struck two students, which Baxter admitted and other school personnel</p>
<p><a id="page_1012" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1012</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">confirmed seeing. Thus, “by petitioner’s own admission” and the testimony of independent sources,] she struck [two students] in violation of her principal’s orders. We find that the Superior Court was correct in concluding that the Board’s finding of insubordination was based on substantial evidence. We need not pass on the question whether the evidence of the other three grounds was substantial. A finding that the evidence of any of the grounds listed under G.S. 115-142(e)(1) was substantial justifies dismissal where, as here, the teacher was notified that dismissal was based on that ground.</p>
<p class="indent">The Superior Court’s order affirming the order of the Board of Education’s order terminating petitioner’s employment is Affirmed.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. To what extent do schools have discretion in grounds upon which they might terminate a teacher? To what extent are they limited? Are there additional grounds for dismissals that should be afforded to schools? Are there any grounds that should be excluded?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What procedural steps must a school take to remove a teacher in North Carolina? Do these steps provide sufficient protections for teachers? Do they place too much of a burden on schools? What is the purpose or goal of affording teachers these protections?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What evidence and information can a board rely or not rely on in its decision to remove a teacher? Does the process include evidence that is unreliable or should be excluded? Are there any problems with allowing a wide array of evidence in these cases?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Based on the standard of review in this case, how likely is it that a court will reverse a school’s decision to terminate a teacher?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Most states tend to follow a common pattern regarding the grounds for dismissal, including “immorality, criminal conviction, fraud, misrepresentation, incompetency, insubordination, neglect of duty, [and] substantial noncompliance with school laws” in some form as statutory grounds. Joseph O. Oluwole, <i>Tenure and the “Highly Qualified Teacher” Requirement</i>, 8 <span class="smallcap">Whittier J. Child &amp; Fam. Advoc</span>. 157, 175 (2009). Some, however, also include the catchall “other good and just cause,” which theoretically expands the grounds for dismissal. <i>Id</i>. For instance, a school district might argue that a teacher’s failure to meet new teacher certification requirements issued by the state is a good or just cause for termination, although a teacher might still defend that he or she is still otherwise an effective teacher. <i>Id</i>. at 182. If new certification or other requirements are imposed too quickly, teachers might also defend on the basis that they have not been afforded sufficient notice of those requirements nor an adequate amount of time to meet them. Jerry R. Parkinson, <i>The Use of Competency Testing in the Evaluation of Public School Teachers</i>, 39 U. <span class="smallcap">Kan. L. Rev</span>. 845, 866-867 (1991). For a full explanation of the varying grounds for dismissal, see Oluwole, <i>supra</i> at 174-183.</p>
<p><a id="page_1013" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1013</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">6. Several states distinguish between dismissals based on misconduct and dismissals based on poor performance, and follow a slightly different process for each. Misconduct might include, for instance, striking a student, committing a felony inside or outside school, or immoral behavior. Whereas, poor performance would pertain to the quality of teaching itself. Allegations of misconduct might lead to a teacher in some states being immediately placed on leave (with or without pay depending on the state) pending an investigation into the misconduct itself. <i>See, e.g</i>, Homa v. Carthage R-IX Sch. Dist., 345 S.W.3d 266, 272 (Mo. Ct. App. 2011). Whereas, termination for poor performance most often requires far more notice and a lengthier process.</p>
<p class="indent">7. The forgoing due process rights may also intersect with free speech rights. One can easily imagine a teacher making statements or holding opinions that place him or her at odds with a principal or the superintendent. When those matters fall within a teacher’s exercise of First Amendment rights, teachers should be protected from removal. With that said, what is to be taught and how falls within the authority of the state and district. Thus, if a teacher refuses to comply with state or district rules under the guise of exercising free speech, the teacher can be subject to dismissal based on violation of rules, insubordination (if specifically instructed to follow some existing rule or newly stated directive), or failure to effectively discharge his or her duty. For more on the line between teachers’ free speech and insubordination, see <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 10</a>.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch375">Crump v. Durham County Board of Education</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>74 N.C. App. 77 (1985)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The respondent Board of Education, after a hearing, dismissed petitioner from her school teaching job on the grounds of inadequate performance. Her dismissal had been recommended by the Superintendent of Durham County Schools and was approved by the Professional Review Committee. The decision of the respondent Board was reviewed and affirmed by the Superior Court and petitioner’s appeal is therefrom.</p>
<p class="indent">During the hearings conducted by the Professional Review Committee and the respondent Board evidence to the following effect was presented: petitioner had been a junior high school teacher in the Durham County school system for twenty-seven years and had taught science for several years. During the 1980–81 school term there were many disciplinary problems in petitioner’s classroom, and at the end of the term the school principal, Mr. Barry, discussed these problems with her. Shortly before the 1981–82 school term began respondent received a letter from a student’s parent complaining of petitioner’s failure to maintain order in her classroom during the preceding term. The letter, which listed several specific disturbances by students that petitioner allegedly did nothing about, was put in her personnel file. After that Principal Barry and Mr. Gatling, the co-ordinator of mathematics and science teaching programs in the county, met with petitioner and suggested ways that she could improve both her classroom control and teaching effectiveness, and Gatling made</p>
<p><a id="page_1014" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1014</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">periodic visits to petitioner’s classroom. At the end of the 1981–82 school term Principal Barry again recommended that petitioner take various steps to improve classroom discipline and placed her on marginal status. During the second semester of the 1982–83 school term Principal Barry [and Mr. Gatling] visited petitioner’s classroom often and noted [numerous] instances of uncorrected student misconduct[, including students walking around and talking during class, “throwing papers at each other and the teacher,” and “climbing in and out of windows.”] Both Principal Barry and Mr. Gatling advised petitioner in writing of the various delinquencies noted, made specific suggestions for improving her classroom discipline and teaching techniques, required her to observe the classroom methods of an exemplary teacher in another school for a week and the respondent Board paid her substitute; but neither petitioner’s control of her class nor her teaching methods improved. [The teacher in the classroom next door indicated that petitioner’s class was so unruly that it often disturbed her classroom as well.]</p>
<p class="indent">In April, 1983 the county school superintendent recommended that petitioner be dismissed from her teaching job on the grounds of inadequate performance. This recommendation was approved by the Peer Review Committee in June, 1983 and she was dismissed by the respondent Board on August 15, 1983.</p>
<p class="indent">[Petitioner contends] that G.S. 115C–325(e)(1), which authorizes the dismissal of a career teacher for “inadequate performance,” is unconstitutionally void for vagueness. That [contention] was considered and rejected in <i>Nestler v. Chapel Hill/Carrboro City Schools Board of Education</i> for the reason that the term “inadequate performance” in regard to a job can be readily understood by any person of ordinary intelligence who knows what the job entails. Nor is the statute unconstitutional as applied in this case to petitioner. The evidence clearly shows that she was aware that her job as a schoolteacher entailed maintaining good order and discipline in the classroom, as G.S. 115C–307(a) provides, and that her alleged failure to maintain good classroom order on numerous, specific occasions was the basis for the steps taken to dismiss her.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioner’s final contention, that in view of the whole record there is no substantial evidence to support her dismissal for inadequate performance of her job, is likewise without merit and is overruled. That the evidence referred to above substantially supports the conclusion that petitioner inadequately performed her duty to maintain good order and discipline in the classroom is, we think, self-evident. Though it is fundamental and generally known that students cannot effectively learn and teachers cannot effectively teach in an unruly, chaotic, noisy, disruptive classroom, that is just the kind of classroom that petitioner had and was apparently satisfied to have over a long period of time, according to the testimony of the three professional educators who had seen or heard students misbehave in her classroom on many different occasions. The only evidence of probative value that might detract from all this direct evidence of petitioner’s failure to maintain good order in her classroom, and therefore must be considered under the “whole record” test is the following: Petitioner’s testimony that some of the disorders that occurred during Principal Barry’s surveillance of her classroom were aggravated by <i>his</i> failure to correct the misbehaving students, but the duty to maintain control of the classroom was hers,</p>
<p><a id="page_1015" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1015</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">not his, as she conceded; and the testimony of one of petitioner’s many students that she is a good teacher. In all events, all of the other evidence relating to petitioner’s classroom control by whoever presented detracts not a whit from the great volume of direct evidence that the respondent Board presented as to petitioner’s failure to maintain any semblance of good order and discipline in her classroom on innumerable occasions.</p>
<p class="indent">The argument that petitioner’s failure to maintain order was because she had more than her share of problem students is not supported by the evidence, including petitioner’s own testimony. And the further argument that her classroom discipline and control was no worse than that maintained by other teachers is both irrelevant and at variance with much evidence and the Board’s finding that the disturbing misconduct that repeatedly occurred in petitioner’s classroom did not occur in other rooms, even though all of petitioner’s students were in other classrooms for six periods each school day.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is “inadequate performance” a sufficiently clear basis for removing a teacher or is it vague enough to allow administrators to abuse their discretion and remove teachers as they see fit? Why does the court reject petitioner’s challenge to this standard? Some courts have reasoned that the level of potential discretion embodied in the concept renders it unenforceable while others reason that the concept has its own reasonable meaning within the teaching profession or state regulatory structure. <i>Compare</i> Cty. Bd. of Educ. of Clarke Cty. v. Oliver, 116 So. 2d 566, 567 (1959) (“[T]he term ‘incompetent’ is generic in its meaning and of itself conveys no information of the particular act of commission or omission, or want of qualification which will authorize the conclusion that the individual having such status or guilty of such act or omission is incompetent.”) (citing Ridgway v. City of Fort Worth[, 243 S.W. 740 (Tex. Civ. App. 1922)], <i>with</i> Sekor v. Bd. of Educ. of the Town of Ridgefield, 689 A.2d 1112, 1119 (Conn. 1997) (“[T]he essential inquiry, when a board decides to terminate a teacher for incompetence under §10–151, is whether the teacher’s overall performance falls below the requisite standard.”); Benke v. Neenan, 658 P.2d 860, 861 (Colo. 1983) (“Competence indicates the ability to perform ably and above a minimum level of sufficiency.”).</p>
<p class="indent">2. Without challenging the facts regarding disorder in her class, Crump seems to shift the blame to school administration in two respects: that the principal did not sufficiently ensure order and that she was saddled with a disproportionate number of students with problematic behavior. Are either of her points persuasive? Should the board or court have considered the latter issue more closely? Is it possible that the school was setting her up for a dismissal?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Given the anecdotal stories portrayed in the media and by anti-tenure advocates, does it surprise you that the removals of the teachers in <i>Baxter</i> and <i>Crump</i> were relatively straightforward? To be clear, however, both school systems spent months documenting the deficiencies in these teachers and attempting to remediate them in some respect. Should schools be required to go through</p>

<p class="h5a"><i>241 S.E.2d 897 (S.C. 1978)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The appellant was a classroom teacher at Manning High School when the events leading to this appeal arose. By hand delivered letter of March 10, 1976, the appellant was informed by the principal that he was not going to be recommended as a teacher for the following school year. The reasons for such action were stated in the letter, from which we quote: “1. General incompetence. Your educational level and written and oral communications are at such a low level as to render you ineffective as a Manning High School Teacher. 2. Apparent inability to comprehend and follow instructions. 3. Apparent inability to keep accurate and necessary school records.”</p>
<p class="indent">On March 29, the principal wrote another letter to the appellant giving particulars in support of the reasons prompting his recommendation for non-renewal. The appellant was advised of his right to a hearing and a hearing was held at his request. No objections have been made as to the sufficiency of this hearing. After the hearing, the appellant was advised by letter of May 7 that the board of trustees was non-renewing his contract in accordance with the principal’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout these proceedings the appellant has never contested on the merits the grounds given for termination of his contract. His sole ground for attacking the non-renewal is failure of the respondents to comply with §59-25-440 of the Employment and Dismissal Act. That section provides as follows:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Whenever a principal or other school administrator charged with the supervision of a teacher finds it necessary to admonish a teacher for a reason that he believes may lead to dismissal or cause the teacher not to be reemployed he shall: (1) bring the matter in writing to the attention of the teacher involved and make a reasonable effort to assist the teacher to correct whatever appears to be the cause of potential dismissal or failure to be reemployed and, (2) except as provided in §59-25-450, allow reasonable time for improvement.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">The appellant contends that, with the exception of situations where immediate suspension is permitted (see §59-25-450), compliance with §59-25-440 is a mandatory prerequisite to dismissal of a teacher for cause.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no question that if §59-25-440 is applicable to the present case, the school board has not complied with that section and the appellant would have to</p>
<p><a id="page_1017" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1017</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">prevail. However, we find the section is inapplicable and hold that the appellant’s termination was proper under authority of Code §59-25-430 which provides:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Any teacher may be dismissed at any time who shall fail, or who may be incompetent, to give instruction in accordance with the directions of the superintendent, or who shall otherwise manifest an evident unfitness for teaching; Provided, however, that notice and an opportunity shall be afforded for a hearing prior to any dismissal. Evident unfitness for teaching is manifested by conduct such as, but not limited to, the following: persistent neglect of duty, willful violation of rules and regulations of district board of trustees, drunkenness, violation of the law of this State or the United States, gross immorality, any cause involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, illegal use, sale or possession of drugs or narcotics.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Although the appellant has ably argued his views with respect to the applicability of §59-25-440, we feel he has viewed the section in isolation from the other provisions of the Employment and Dismissal Act. We cannot ignore §59-25-430 which, too, is a part of the Employment and Dismissal Act and which was enacted at the same time as the section upon which the appellant relies. It is the duty of this Court to give all parts and provisions of a legislative enactment effect and reconcile conflicts if reasonably and logically possible. And, of course, where we are called upon to interpret statutes, we must be mindful of the principle that the intention of the legislature is the primary guideline to be used.</p>
<p class="indent">The section upon which the appellant relies is only one facet of a comprehensive legislative scheme designed to afford the teacher safeguards against arbitrary discharge from employment while at the same time recognizing the public’s legitimate interest in quality education.</p>
<p class="indent">A school board has long had the power to discharge teachers “when good and sufficient reasons for so doing present themselves,” S.C. Code §59-19-90(2) (1976). The Employment and Dismissal Act was not so much intended to limit this power as it was intended to prevent its abuse. As we perceive it, the Act has clearly separated the circumstances for which a teacher may be discharged for cause into two categories. One of these categories is explicitly set out in §59-25-430 and the other is implicit in §59-25-440.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 59-25-430 provides that a teacher may be dismissed for “evident unfitness for teaching.” This section expressly authorizes dismissal “at any time,” subject, of course, to the rights of notice and a hearing. Section 59-25-440, on the other hand, while not expressly setting forth any grounds for dismissal, requires notice “in writing” and a “reasonable time for improvement” whenever a “reason (which) may lead to dismissal or cause a teacher not to be reemployed” becomes the subject of an admonition by designated school authorities. Under this section it is clear that “a reason” which may lead to the termination of employment does not become a “good and sufficient” reason (§59-19-90(2)) until after a reasonable time for improvement has been allowed. In other words it would seem that it is the failure to improve which constitutes the “good and sufficient” reason warranting the termination of employment.</p>
<p class="indent">Unless we are to attribute inconsistency to the legislature, the two sections in question must speak to different categories of grounds for dismissal. Section 59-25-430 identifies what is subject to its provisions, namely, an evident unfitness for teaching. It logically follows, then, that §59-25-440 must address those</p>
<p><a id="page_1018" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1018</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">deficiencies or shortcomings other than those which manifest an evident unfitness for teaching but which do, nevertheless, constitute improper performance of employment duties.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to the facts of the present case. Although the March 10th letter to the appellant set forth three grounds as the basis for recommending termination of the appellant’s employment, we deal with only the first ground since we find this ground alone was sufficient to bring the appellant under §59-25-430 and subject him to dismissal at any time.</p>
<p class="indent">The first ground charged the appellant with a low level of both oral and written communication to the extent that he was rendered ineffective as a Manning High School teacher. He was further accused of “general incompetence.” The principal informed the appellant in the letter of March 29 that the reason he considered the appellant “incompetent” was because of his “low basic level of English.” Not only is this allegation amply supported by the record, the appellant does not deny or contest it.</p>
<p class="indent">Allegations of incompetence or evident unfitness for teaching are broad terms and ones that should be closely scrutinized when offered as a ground for teacher dismissal. However, in the present case the task is simplified in that it is apparent that the appellant does not possess even a rudimentary competence in English. Deficiency in such a basic skill is proof of “evident unfitness for teaching” when one considers that the appellant is a teacher in an institution charged with the duty of imparting the very skills he lacks. The nature of the position itself dictates that, for one who occupies it, a competence in basic language skills is an indispensable tool.</p>
<p class="indent">Since we have found that the termination of the appellant’s employment is authorized by §59-25-430, the fact that the school board allowed him to serve out the remainder of the school year gives the appellant no cause to complain. Although the appellant sees an inconsistency in the actions of the school board in allowing him to serve out his contract even though school authorities had been aware of his deficiencies for some time, we find that the timing of termination was solely within the discretion of the board. Section 59-25-430 expressly authorizes dismissal “at any time.” Simply because the board chose to “non-renew” instead of “dismiss” does not alter the fact that the board had the power to discharge the appellant at any time after evident unfitness for teaching manifested itself. The only real distinction between “non-renewal” and “dismissal” as it bears on the facts of this case is one of when termination was to be effective during or at the close of the school year. Given proper grounds for discharge under §59-25-430, all that was required was prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. The appellant was accorded both.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. South Carolina statutes do not specifically grant teachers tenure or career status, but as a practical matter achieve the same result through two processes: automatic contract renewals prior to the end of each school year (or continuing</p>
<p><a id="page_1019" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1019</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">contracts) and requirements that dismissals be for good cause. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">S.C. Code Ann.</span> §§59-25-410, 59-25-430.</p>
<p class="indent">2. On the one hand, §59-25-430 would appear to make it easier to remove teachers in South Carolina than in other states, whereas §59-25-440 would appear to require teacher remediation prior to removal. How does the court reconcile these two statutory provisions?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Should Adams have been afforded remediation prior to his termination? Why did the court conclude he was not? Is the court’s rationale sound? When exactly are South Carolina teachers entitled to remediation? When are they not? Is the concept of remediation itself a defensible one or simply a self-serving benefit that teachers have secured through the political process?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Interestingly, in 2011-2012, the dismal and nonrenewal rate in South Carolina was 1.3 percent, significantly below the national average. <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Ctr. for Educ. Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)</span> tbl.8 (2011-2012), <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass1112_2013311_d1s_008.asp" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/tables/sass1112_2013311_d1s_008.asp</a>. Does this suggest that dismissal rates are affected by more than just the strength or weakness of the statutory protections provided to teachers? What other factors might affect teacher dismissal rates?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch377">B. LIMITATIONS ON CHANGING TEACHERS’ CONTRACT RIGHTS</p>
<p class="noindent">The forgoing due process rights primarily address the rights of individual teachers facing termination, demotion, or layoff. Those protections, however, do not necessarily protect teachers as a group when a state decides to alter tenure itself or other group-based teacher rights and interests. Could a state, for instance, repeal its tenure statutes or good-cause dismissal protections? Contract rights, rather than due process, provide the most likely limitation on state actions of this sort.</p>
<p class="indent">Both the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the analogous provisions in state constitutions prohibit states from impairing contractual obligations. In other words, if parties enter into legally binding contracts, the state cannot, after the fact, simply eliminate or substantially alter those contracts. The Supreme Court has articulated a three-part test for evaluating Contracts Clause claims: (1) whether there is a contractual relationship, (2) whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and (3) whether the impairment is substantial. Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244 (1978). State courts have adopted identical tests for evaluating state contract clause claims.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, these Contracts Clause principles have become increasingly important. During the Great Recession, several states sought to alter the benefit packages of teachers as a way of balancing the budget in the face of falling tax revenues. <i>See, e.g</i>., Madison Teachers v. Walker, 851 N.W.2d 337 (2014)</p>
<p><a id="page_1020" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1020</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">(evaluating the Wisconsin Budget Repair Act of 2011). Likewise, calls by the U.S. Department of Education to improve teacher evaluation systems generated a flurry of legislative changes to teacher tenure and dismissal. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Race to the Top Program Executive Summary</span> 2-3 (2009); Benjamin Michael Superfine, <i>The Promises and Pitfalls of Teacher Evaluation and Accountability Reform</i>, 17 <span class="smallcap">Rich. J.L. &amp; Pub. Int.</span> 591, 592 (2014). The response was a significant increase in litigation. North Carolina offers one of the best examples, with its supreme court holding that the state was free to change tenure rules for future teachers but could not impair the contractual rights of existing teachers whose contracts had already included the protections of the old system.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch378">North Carolina Association of Educators v. State</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>786 S.E.2d 255 (2016)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Until 2013, North Carolina public school teachers were employed under a system usually described generically as the “Career Status Law,” through which teachers could earn career status after successfully completing a probationary period and receiving a favorable vote from their school board. N.C.G.S. §115C–325 (2012). That process changed with passage of the Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2013 (“the Act”). Details of the Act are described below, but most pertinent to the case at bar, the Act retroactively revoked the career status of teachers who had already earned that designation by repealing the Career Status Law (“Career Status Repeal”), and created a new system of employment for public school teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs allege that the Act violate[s] Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution (forbidding passage of any “Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts”) and Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution (the Law of the Land Clause), as it applied to teachers who have previously earned career status. We conclude that repeal of the Career Status Law unlawfully infringes upon the contract rights of those teachers who had already achieved career status.</p>
<p class="indent">We begin our analysis with an overview of the evolution of state statutes that have controlled career status of public school teachers. For over four decades, North Carolina public schools have operated under what was commonly called the Career Status Law, a statutory framework setting out a system for the employment, retention, and dismissal of public school teachers. However, little in this framework has remained static over the years.</p>
<p class="indent">Beginning in 1971, the General Assembly created a procedure through which teachers who were employed for at least three consecutive years as probationers would bec[o]me “career teachers” if the school board voted to reemploy the teacher for the upcoming school year. <i>See</i> 1971 N.C. Sess. Laws 1396 (codified at N.C.G.S. §115–142 (1971)). In addition, any teacher who had been employed in the same public school system for four consecutive years or been employed by the State as a teacher for five consecutive years would automatically became a career teacher. These career teachers could only be dismissed for</p>
<p><a id="page_1021" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1021</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">one of twelve grounds specified in the statute. If a teacher was to be dismissed, the act provided for notice and [a hearing. Over the next five decades, the system was “subject to continual tinkering and revision by the General Assembly,” including adding new grounds for dismissing teachers, shortening and then lengthening the time necessary to receive career status, modifying the appeals process and the persons responsible for hearing them, and defining “inadequate performance.”]</p>
<p class="indent">The employment system in place at the time of the passage of the Act was codified under N.C.G.S. §115C–325 (2012) and established two classes of public school teachers[: probationary and career teachers]. Probationary teachers were employed through annual contracts with the local board of education. These contracts were subject to nonrenewal for any reason that was not “arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or for personal or political reasons.” <i>Id.</i> [After four years, probationary teachers were eligible for career status and, if denied, were entitled to notice and a hearing before their school board.]</p>
<p class="indent">Career status teachers could only be dismissed, demoted, or relegated to part-time status based on one or more of fifteen specified statutory grounds. Prior to making a recommendation for dismissal, demotion, or relegation to part-time status of a career status teacher, the superintendent was required to give written notice of the grounds on which he or she believed the action to be justified. Upon receipt of such written notice, a career teacher had a right to request a hearing before a hearing officer to contest the superintendent’s recommendation, at which the career teacher was entitled “to be present and to be heard, to be represented by counsel and to present through witnesses any competent testimony relevant to the issue of whether grounds for dismissal or demotion exist.” The decision of the hearing officer could be further appealed to the full school board.</p>
<p class="indent">Now the Career Status Law, N.C.G.S. §115C–325 (2012), is no more. [In 2013, t]he Act revoke[d] career status for all teachers. Under the new system, teacher contracts are not open-ended, as was previously the case for career teachers, but instead extend “for a term of one, two, or four school years.” A decision not to renew a teacher’s contract can be based on any reason not “arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, for personal or political reasons, or on any basis prohibited by State or federal law.” The superintendent must give the teacher written notice of a decision to recommend nonrenewal. Within ten days of receiving such notice, the teacher can petition the local school board for a hearing, but the school board has discretion whether to grant the request. Dismissal, demotion, or a change to part-time status during the term of the contract remains based on the fifteen statutory grounds and procedure set forth previously in the Career Status Law. Any teacher who had not achieved career status “prior to the 2013–2014 school year” is no longer eligible to receive career status in the future and will instead be employed primarily by one-year contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court presumes that statutes passed by the General Assembly are constitutional and duly passed acts will not be struck unless found unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Even so, we review de novo any challenges to a statute’s constitutionality.</p>
<p><a id="page_1022" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1022</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs first allege that the Career Status Repeal violated Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States by impairing the contract rights of teachers who had earned career status before the repeal. The Contract Clause, “one of the few express limitations on state power” in the Constitution, provides that “[n]o State shall…pass any…Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,” U.S. Const. art. I, §10. [T]his Court uses the three-factor test set out in <i>Bailey</i> to determine whether a Contract Clause violation exists.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we first consider whether any contractual obligation arose from the statute making up the now-repealed Career Status Law. The United States Supreme Court has recognized a presumption that a state statute “is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.” Dodge v. Bd. of Educ., 302 U.S. 74, 79 (1937). This presumption is rooted in the longstanding principle that the primary function of a legislature is to make policy rather than contracts. Indiana <i>ex rel</i>. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U.S. 95, 100 (1938). A party asserting that a legislature created a statutory contractual right bears the burden of overcoming that presumption by demonstrating that the legislature manifested a clear intention to be contractually bound, <i>Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison,</i> 470 U.S. 451, 466 (1985). Construing a statute to create contractual rights in the absence of an expression of unequivocal intent would be at best ill-advised, binding the hands of future sessions of the legislature and obstructing or preventing subsequent revisions and repeals. We are deeply reluctant to “limit drastically the essential powers of a legislative body” by finding a contract created by statute without compelling supporting evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">This requirement for explicit indications of legislative intent is shown in two United States Supreme Court cases in which the use or omission of the word “contract” in the statute was deemed critical. In <i>Phelps v. Board of Education,</i> that Court considered a New Jersey employment system where, after completing three years of service, teachers were hired for an ongoing open-ended period during which they could not be dismissed or subjected to a reduction in salary without notice and a hearing. The Supreme Court found that this system did not set up a contract but instead “established a legislative status for teachers,” and was a “regulation of the conduct of the board” that created no binding obligation. However, the Court shortly thereafter distinguished <i>Phelps</i> in <i>Brand,</i> 303 U.S. 95, when it held that Indiana’s “Teachers’ Tenure Act” created a statutory contractual right between the teachers and a local school district. In <i>Brand,</i> the Court looked specifically to the language of Indiana’s Act, noting that the word “contract” was peppered throughout nearly every section of the statute.</p>
<p class="indent">These cases indicate that courts must consider the language used by the legislature to determine whether a statute “provides for the execution of a written contract on behalf of the state.” North Carolina’s Career Status Law does not present the type of unmistakable legislative intent found by the United States Supreme Court in the statute at issue in <i>Brand.</i> Nowhere in the portion of section 115C–325 establishing the promotion of a teacher to career status does the word “contract” appear. The word “contract,” as used in the remainder of our Career Status Law refers only to individual contracts with the local school boards and</p>
<p><a id="page_1023" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1023</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">relationships between teachers and the local school system, with no mention of the State.</p>
<p class="indent">Turning next to cases from this Court, we considered an alleged Contract Clause violation in the context of retirement benefits and in the context of disability retirement payments. In [those] cases, this Court held that vested contractual rights were created by the statutes at issue because, at the moment the plaintiffs fulfilled the conditions set out in the two benefits programs, the plaintiffs earned those benefits. Though the benefits would be received at a later time, the plaintiffs’ right to receive them accrued immediately, became vested, and a contract was formed between the plaintiffs and the State. In other words, the retirement benefits [and] disability payments were [not] based upon future actions by the plaintiffs. Instead, those benefits had been presently earned and became vested as the plaintiffs performed, even though payment of those benefits was deferred until a later time.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, a teacher has no vested career status rights at the end of the probationary period. Instead, after successfully meeting all the requirements, a teacher could enter a career contract with the school board. Thus, we see that the Career Status Act is a regulation of conduct through which local school boards can exercise their discretion to enter into contracts with teachers for whom they approve career status. The Career Status Law contemplates the creation of individual contracts between school boards and teachers but does not itself establish any benefit provided to teachers by the State nor create any relationship between them. As a result, plaintiffs have not overcome the strong presumption against finding a vested right created by the Career Status Law.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the oft-amended course of the Career Status Law over the decades is evidence that the State did not intend to create a contract with teachers by the terms of the statute. Each new version of the statute did not immediately create a vested contract between the State and public school teachers. The amendments instead altered details of career status while leaving the overall career status system intact, thereby allowing the possibility of future modifications and amendments as needs arose. Accordingly, we conclude the Career Status Law did not itself create any vested contractual rights.</p>
<p class="indent">However, our analysis does not end here. “[L]aws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract…enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.” Before receiving career status, plaintiffs entered individual contracts with the local school boards. Implied as a part of each of these contracts was the Career Status Law. As the State concedes in its brief, the “applicable statutory terms must be read into the contracts” and the contracts “[i]ncorporat[ed] the statutory body of ‘school law’ applicable to Plaintiffs as teachers.” The statutory system that was in the background of the contract between the teacher and the board set out the mechanism through which the teachers could obtain career status. A teacher’s career status rights under the Career Status Law become vested only upon completing several consecutive years as a probationary teacher and then receiving approval from the school board. Thus, vesting stems not from the Career Status Law, but from the teacher’s entry into an individual contract with the local school system. At the time the parties made the contract, the right to career status vested. At</p>
<p><a id="page_1024" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1024</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that point, the General Assembly no longer could take away that vested right retroactively in a way that would substantially impair it.</p>
<p class="indent">The record demonstrates the importance of those protections to the parties and the teachers’ reliance upon those benefits in deciding to take employment as a public school teacher. [Teachers have been] promised career status protections in exchange for meeting the requirements of the law, relied on this promise in exchange for accepting their teacher positions and continuing their employment with their school districts, and consider the benefits and protections of career status to offset the low wages of public school teachers. Thus, we conclude that, although the Career Status Law itself created no vested contractual rights, the contracts between the local school boards and teachers with approved career status included the Career Status Law as an implied term upon which teachers relied.</p>
<p class="indent">We next move to the second part of a Contract Clause analysis in which we consider whether the vested rights found above were substantially impaired by the Career Status Repeal. “Total destruction of contractual expectations is not necessary for a finding of substantial impairment.” However, a showing that the change in the law results in an outcome different from that “reasonably expected from the contract” may be sufficient to show a substantial deprivation.</p>
<p class="indent">The benefits enjoyed by career teachers have been described above, most of which boil down to enhanced job security. The Career Status Law establishing those benefits was replaced by a new system that eliminates career status entirely, allowing local school boards and teachers to enter into contracts in durations of only one, two, or four years. Nonrenewal of these shortened contracts can be based on any reason not “arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, for personal or political reasons, or on any basis prohibited by State or federal law.” If the superintendent recommends that a teacher not be renewed, the teacher can petition for a hearing but the school board has unrestricted discretion whether to grant or deny that request.</p>
<p class="indent">We hold that these changes are a substantial impairment of the bargained-for benefit promised to the teachers who have already achieved career status. Retroactively revoking this status from those whose career status rights had already vested deprives career teachers of the promise of continuing employment, as well as the right to a hearing in circumstances in which their now-shortened contracts may not be renewed. Plaintiffs’ affidavits indicate they relied both on the promise of continued employment as a form of added compensation to supplement their lower salaries and on the benefits of career status when deciding to continue teaching in the public school systems. Elimination of these benefits substantially deprives current career status teachers of the value of their vested contractual rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the third prong of the test, a substantial impairment of contractual rights can still be upheld if the impairment was a reasonable and necessary means of serving a legitimate public purpose. The Contract Clause is not meant to bind the hands of the State absolutely. The Clause’s “prohibition must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State ‘to safeguard the vital interests of its people.’” Energy Reserves Grp. v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, 459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983). Courts weigh a state’s interest in exercising its police</p>
<p><a id="page_1025" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1025</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">power against the impairment of individual contractual rights when determining whether the impairment is sufficiently justified. This portion of the inquiry involves a two-step process, first identifying the actual harm the state seeks to cure, then considering whether the remedial measure adopted by the state is both a reasonable and necessary means of addressing that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we consider the interest the State argues is furthered by repealing the Career Status Law. The burden is upon the State when it seeks to justify an otherwise unconstitutional impairment of contract. Relying on Article I, Section 15 of our constitution, which establishes the duty of the State to guard and maintain the people’s right to the privilege of education, the State claims that improving public education is an essential constitutional responsibility. Hoke Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. State<i>,</i> 358 N.C. 605, 614–15 (2004) (“[T]he State and State Board of Education had constitutional obligations to provide the state’s school children with an opportunity for a sound basic education, and that the state’s school children had a fundamental right to such an opportunity.” The State argues that “the goal of the Career Status Repeal was to address ‘adequate’ but marginal teachers with career status” as part of a series of reforms intended to improve the deficiencies in the State’s public school system.</p>
<p class="indent">We fully agree that maintaining the quality of the public school system is an important purpose. Nevertheless, while alleviating difficulties in dismissing ineffective teachers might be a legitimate end justifying changes to the Career Status Law, no evidence indicates that such a problem existed. Instead, the record is replete with affidavits from teachers and administrators who relate that the Career Status Law did not impede their ability to dismiss teachers who failed to meet the academic standards necessary properly to educate students in public schools. Instead, these affiants indicate that the Career Status Law was an important incentive in recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers. Inadequate teachers could be and were dismissed under the Career Status Law on the statutory grounds laid out in N.C.G.S. §115C–325(e)(1) (2012), including dismissal for “[i]nadequate performance,” defined in the Career Status Law as “(i) the failure to perform at a proficient level on any standard of the evaluation instrument or (ii) otherwise performing in a manner that is below standard.” Accordingly, we fail to see a legitimate public purpose for which it was necessary substantially to impair the vested contractual rights of career status teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, even if we conclude that a legitimate public purpose did exist justifying such an impairment, the method adopted for alleviating that harm must be necessary and reasonable. U.S. Tr. Co. of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 25 (1977). While we acknowledge that the retroactive repeal was motivated by the General Assembly’s valid concern for flexibility in dismissing low-performing teachers, we do not see how repealing career status from those for whom that right had already vested was necessary and reasonable. “[A] State is not free to impose a drastic impairment [of contract] when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.” <i>Id.</i> at 31. In the record, plaintiffs suggest several alternatives to retroactive repeal of the Career Status Law that would allow school boards more flexibility in dismissing low-quality teachers. The legislature could add additional grounds for dismissal as it did in 1973. Or the General Assembly could have refined the definition of “inadequate</p>
<p><a id="page_1026" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1026</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">performance” as it did in 2011. Given the possibility of such less sweeping alternatives for improving teacher quality, “the State has failed to demonstrate” why the retroactive repeal was necessary and reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">Because we hold the repeal is unconstitutional in its retroactive application based on the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, we need not address plaintiffs’ alternative claim based on Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution. Accordingly, we conclude that the retroactive repeal of career status from those teachers who had earned that designation prior to the Career Status Repeal is unconstitutional. The vested contractual rights of those teachers were substantially impaired without adequate justification, in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. In what way did the North Carolina legislature alter teachers’ rights in the state? Purely as a matter of policy, were these desirable changes?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What is the court’s rationale for concluding that North Carolina’s old career status statutes did not, in and of themselves, give rise to a contract right? Why would a court be reluctant to recognize a contract right in a statute? Does the absence of a contract right mean that teachers lack a property right?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If North Carolina’s statutes did not create contract rights, from whence do teachers’ contract rights arise? With whom do teachers have a contract? How do the statutory terms in place at the time of a teacher’s contract relate to a teacher’s contract rights?</p>
<p class="indent">4. According to the state, why did it eliminate tenure? Why does the court reject the state’s justification for the repeal? What are justifiable reasons for impairing teachers’ contracts? Some courts have recognized budgetary shortfalls, upgrading the state’s public education system, regulating the teaching profession, and maintaining the public school system as legitimate bases for impairing teachers’ contracts. <i>See, e.g</i>., Baltimore Teachers Union v. Baltimore, 6 F.3d 1012 (4th Cir. 1993); Connecticut Educ. Ass’n, Inc. v. Tirozzi, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989); Texas State Teachers Ass’n v. State, 711 S.W.2d 421 (Tex. Ct. App. 1986).</p>
<p class="indent">5. Are there other or better ways to achieve the North Carolina legislature’s purported goal? As a matter of law, the court indicates that the chosen means of achieving the state’s goal must be reasonable and necessary. Some other courts, however, appear to be more flexible on this point than was the North Carolina Supreme Court. For instance, the Supreme Court wrote of a challenge under the U.S. Constitution that substantial impairments of contract are permissible when necessary to “accommodat[e] to the inherent police power of the State ‘to safeguard the vital interests of its people.’” Energy Reserves Grp. v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, 459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983); <i>see also</i> Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 502 (1987) (“[T]he prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts is not to be read literally.”).</p>
<p class="indent">6. At least two other high state courts have recently sided with North Carolina in finding that the state and federal contract clauses limit the state’s ability</p>
<p><a id="page_1027" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1027</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to retroactively repeal tenure or undermine some other vested interest of teachers. Masters v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2015 COA 159<i>, cert. granted sub nom</i>. Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Masters, 2016 WL 1104060 (Colo. Mar. 21, 2016); Madison Teachers, Inc. v. Walker, 851 N.W.2d 337, 401 (Wisc. 2014) (holding that statutory changes to teachers’ retirement benefits violated Wisconsin Contracts Clause). While the Contracts Clause might prevent a state from repealing certain tenure rights for existing teachers, does it place any limit on changing those rights for future teachers?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, the overall legal structure still favors the state because it is premised on ensuring discretion for the state. In those states where statutes do not clearly establish a legislative intent to establish a contract through tenure laws, a state will remain largely free, under the Contracts Clause, to alter tenure and teacher evaluation as they see fit. Other states remain free to make moderate changes so long as they do not substantially impair a vested right. For instance, these states could likely ease some burdens of due process prior to termination and make the evaluation of teachers (which could create the basis for termination) more rigorous. Only aggressive measures like the elimination of tenure or process would likely trigger a state’s need to justify its actions. Even then, states would be allowed to defend their actions as necessary to improve the quality of teaching, the accountability of teaching, and the efficiency of managing its workforce.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch379">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Assume you are counsel to your local school district. A middle school principal tells you that he has a teacher whom he believes to be extremely ineffective. The teacher has all the requisite certifications, has been teaching in the district for a decade, and is generally a pleasant person. He is not exactly sure what the problem in the classroom is—ineffective classroom management, poor instruction skills, or a lack of knowledge—but he is constantly receiving complaints from parents and requests to transfer to another classroom. The principal would like to either transfer or terminate the teacher. Identify the relevant teacher tenure, dismissal, and retention statutes in your state. What options does the principal have? What plan of action would you suggest?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch380">C. THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AND COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN</p>
<p class="noindent">Teachers frequently organize themselves into bargaining units or labor unions. This allows a labor union to negotiate the more specific terms of employment left open by statutes with school boards. Collective bargaining, in some substantial form, is permitted in every state except Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Laura McNeal, <i>Total Recall: The Rise and Fall of Teacher Tenure</i>,</p>
<p><a id="page_1028" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1028</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">30 <span class="smallcap">Hofstra Lab. &amp; Emp</span>. L.J. 489, 492-493 (2012). The remaining states vary in the extent to which they mandate or prohibit collective bargaining on particular terms of employment. For instance, some states mandate that school districts bargain with teachers in regard to “the conditions under which teachers will receive due process [and tenure] protections…; rules governing the compensation schedule for teachers…; rules governing the process by which teachers are laid off due to economic reasons…; and rules that prescribe procedures for teacher evaluation and discipline….” William S. Koski, <i>Teacher Collective Bargaining, Teacher Quality, and the Teacher Quality Gap: Toward a Policy Analytic Framework</i>, 6 <span class="smallcap">Harv. L. &amp; Pol’y Rev</span>. 67, 71-72 (2012). Other states prohibit bargaining in regard to assignment and transfer policies; granting tenure; creating school calendars; appointing principals and department heads; and withholding salary increments. Charles J. Russo, <i>A Cautionary Tale of Collective Bargaining in Public Education: A Teacher’s Right or Tail Wagging the Dog?</i>, 37 U. <span class="smallcap">Dayton L. Rev</span>. 317, 331-332 (2012). While there is some overlap between these two categories, the former tends to encompass generally applicable terms, conditions, and procedures of employment, whereas the latter generally encompasses the administration’s right to run the district independent of teacher interference.</p>
<p class="indent">While some argue that teacher unions are a primary obstacle to education reform, teachers only have the right to organize; they do not have a right to terms of their choosing. As the Supreme Court has stated, “[t]he public employee surely can associate and speak freely and petition openly, and he is protected by the First Amendment from retaliation for doing so[, but] the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen, to respond or, in this context, to recognize the association and bargain with it.” Smith v. Ark. State Highway Emps., 441 U.S. 463, 465 (1979). Thus, some would argue that the success of teacher labor unions is not due to legislative protection or favoritism, but to the political strength and unity of teachers themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless, collective bargaining by teachers has come under increased scrutiny in recent years and caught national attention. Most notably, in Wisconsin and Ohio, the legislatures sought to limit the scope of collective bargaining for teachers. In both states, the impetus was the fiscal impacts of teaching. In an attempt to limit costs and balance the budget during the recent economic crisis, Wisconsin and Ohio passed legislation to prevent teacher unions from negotiating health care and other benefits, although they would remain free to negotiate salary. Teachers filed various legal challenges in Wisconsin, the results of which are reprinted below. The issue never made it to the courts in Ohio because voters reversed the legislation.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">A. Terminology</span></p>
<p class="indent">The heart of this appeal centers on unions, collective bargaining, and the right to associate with others to collectively engage in protected First Amendment activities. These issues are always emotionally charged, especially in turbulent times, but perhaps nowhere are these topics more controversial or sensitive than in the State of Wisconsin. The importance of these questions demands clarity on what precisely is before the court, which in turn requires specificity on our part in the terminology upon which we rely.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the term “collective bargaining,” we agree with the court of appeals that the following discussion provided by an amicus effectively highlights an important definitional distinction:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Historically, in the United States the term “collective bargaining” has been used to describe two legally different activities.…The first way in which the term has been used has been to describe an activity that is an element of the right of individual citizens to associate together for the purpose of advocating regarding matters of mutual interest or concern, including matters concerning wages and employment conditions. When used in this way the term “collective bargaining” is descriptive of a collective effort and refers to an activity where the party that is the object of the advocacy, the employer, has no legal obligation to respond affirmatively to the advocacy, but may do so voluntarily.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">[This type of “collective bargaining”] is a fundamental right that constitutionally is protected.</p>
<p class="indent">The second way in which the term “collective bargaining” has been used is to refer to a statutorily mandated relationship between an association of employees and their employer, by the terms of which an employer and its employees are obligated to negotiate, in “good faith,” for the purpose of reaching an agreement regarding the employees’ wages and conditions of employment. Such statutorily recognized “collective bargaining” is subject to legislative modification, for the purpose, at least heretofore, of protecting the employees’ fundamental right to bargain with their employer.</p>
<p><a id="page_1030" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1030</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">[W]e use the term “collective bargaining” in the latter sense; that is, to refer to the statutorily established relationship between an association of public employees and their employer.</p>
<p class="indent">This definition of “collective bargaining” is consistent with the language of Act 10, which defines “collective bargaining” to mean “the performance of the mutual obligation of a municipal employer…and the representative of its municipal employees in a collective bargaining unit, to meet and confer at reasonable times, in good faith, with the intention of reaching an agreement, or to resolve questions arising under such an agreement,” with respect to wages for general employees. Wis. Stat. §111.70(1)(a). A “collective bargaining unit” is a “unit consisting of municipal employees” that has been recognized by WERC, pursuant to statute, as qualified for the purpose of collective bargaining. Stat. §111.70(1)(b).</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the term “labor organization,” “union” is not defined under Act 10, though as the court of appeals noted, the parties use the term in two distinct ways. First, the term “union” may refer to what the parties in this case agree is a constitutionally protected association that individuals have the right to form and employers have the right to disregard. However, the term “union” may also refer to the “representative” of a “collective bargaining unit” in the statutorily established relationship between an association of public employees and their employer. For this reason, we follow the practice of the court of appeals and generally avoid use of the term “union.” Instead, when referring to the “exclusive certified bargaining agent” of a collective bargaining unit, as that term is understood within the statutory framework established by Act 10, we use the term “certified representative.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we refer to a general employee that has chosen to participate in collective bargaining within the statutory framework established by Act 10 as a “represented general employee,” and in contrast, the term “non-represented general employee” to refer to a general employee who has declined to participate.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">B. Associational Claims</span></p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs’ central argument on appeal is that the following provisions of Act 10 violate the associational rights of general employees and their certified representatives that are guaranteed under Article I, Sections 3 and 4 of the Wisconsin Constitution:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent">1. The provision prohibiting collective bargaining between municipal employers and the certified representatives for municipal general employee bargaining units on all subjects except base wages. Wis. Stat. §111.70(4)(mb)1.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The provisions limiting negotiated base wage increases to the increase in the Consumer Price Index, unless a higher increase is approved by a municipal voter referendum. Wis. Stat. §§66.0506, 111.70(4)(mb)2., and 118.245.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The provisions prohibiting fair share agreements that previously required all represented general employees to pay a proportionate share of the costs of collective bargaining and contract administration. Wis. Stat. §111.70(1)(f) and the third sentence of Wis. Stat. §111.70(2).</p>
<p><a id="page_1031" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1031</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">4. The provision prohibiting municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees. Wis. Stat. §111.70(3g).</p>
<p class="indent">5. The provision requiring annual recertification elections of the representatives of all bargaining units, requiring 51% of the votes of the bargaining unit members (regardless of the number of members who vote), and requiring the commission to assess costs of such elections. Wis. Stat. §111.70(4)(d)3.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge to these provisions has any merit is the lynchpin of this appeal. The core of our review is determining whether there is a cognizable First Amendment interest, which establishes the attendant level of scrutiny applied to the legislative judgment behind the requirement. If Act 10 does not infringe on the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, it will be upheld if any rational basis can be found for the contested provisions.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>i. Freedom of Association Doctrine</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The freedom of association doctrine has two analytically distinct categories: “intrinsic” freedom of association, which protects certain intimate human relationships under the Substantive Due Process component of the Fourteenth Amendment, and “instrumental” freedom of association, which protects associations necessary to effectuate First Amendment rights. The second category of association is the type of freedom of association right the plaintiffs assert has been infringed upon in this case. Regarding this form of association, the United States Supreme Court has “recognized a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment—speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association of this kind as an indispensable means of preserving other individual liberties.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>iii. Limitations on Permissible Collective Bargaining Subjects</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Before the enactment of Act 10, general employees were permitted under MERA to collectively bargain over a broad array of subjects, including wages, working conditions, work hours, and grievance procedures. Act 10 limits collective bargaining between municipal employers and the certified representatives of general employees to the single topic of “total base wages and excludes any other compensation….” Wis. Stat. §111.70(4)(mb)1. Moreover, Act 10 prohibits collective bargaining for base wage increases that exceed an increase in the Consumer Price Index unless approved in a municipal voter referendum. Wis. Stat. §§111.70(4)(mb)2., 66.0506, and 118.245.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs argue this limitation penalizes general employees who choose to be represented by a certified representative because Act 10 imposes no limitations whatsoever on the terms that non-represented general employees may negotiate with their municipal employers. Consequently, the plaintiffs contend, Act 10 unconstitutionally burdens the associational rights of general employees because they must surrender their association with a certified representative in order to negotiate anything beyond base wages.</p>
<p><a id="page_1032" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1032</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs’ argument does not withstand scrutiny. As discussed above, the plaintiffs cite to this court’s holding in Lawson v. Housing Authority of Milwaukee, 270 Wis. 269 (1955), for the general proposition that the government may not condition the receipt of a discretionary benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right. In essence, the plaintiffs rely on <i>Lawson</i> as an illustration of our court applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. Beyond <i>Lawson,</i> the plaintiffs cite to numerous cases that support the same doctrinal principle: it is impermissible for the government to condition the receipt of a tangible benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not dispute the existence of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine or its robustness in our jurisprudence. The problem lies in the doctrine’s inapplicability to this case, and consequently, the absence of support it provides the plaintiffs’ argument.</p>
<p class="indent">Comparing <i>Lawson</i> to the facts of this case swiftly illustrates the problem. In <i>Lawson,</i> this court held that it was unconstitutional for the government to condition the receipt of a benefit (living in a federally aided housing project) on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right (the right to associate with organizations that engage in constitutionally protected speech). Here, the plaintiffs argue that it is unconstitutional for the government, through Act 10, to condition the receipt of a benefit (to participate in collective bargaining on the lone topic of base wages) on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right (the right to associate with a certified representative in order to collectively bargain on any subject).</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs’ logical fallacy rests in the false analogy between the respective rights being relinquished in <i>Lawson</i> and in this case. Without question, in <i>Lawson,</i> the right being relinquished for a benefit—the right to associate with organizations that engage in constitutionally protected speech—is fundamental in nature and protected under the First Amendment. Here, however, the “right” the plaintiffs refer to—the right to associate with a certified representative in order to collectively bargain on any subject—is categorically not a constitutional right.</p>
<p class="indent">General employees have no constitutional right to negotiate with their municipal employer on the lone issue of base wages, let alone on any other subject. As the United States Supreme Court made clear:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[While t]he public employee surely can associate and speak freely and petition openly, and he is protected by the First Amendment from retaliation for doing so[,] the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen, to respond or, in this context, to recognize the association and bargain with it.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Smith v. Ark. State Highway Emps<i>.,</i> 441 U.S. 463, 465 (1979) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs have insisted at every stage of litigation in this case that they are not arguing a constitutional right exists to collectively bargain. It is evident, however, that they really are, for without such a constitutional right, their challenge fails. The plaintiffs’ reliance on <i>Lawson</i> hinges on the defendants</p>
<p><a id="page_1033" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1033</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">conditioning the receipt of a benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, but as the plaintiffs acknowledge, collective bargaining—no matter the specific statutory limitations at issue—is not constitutionally protected.</p>
<p class="indent">Put differently, general employees are not being forced under Act 10 to choose between a tangible benefit and their constitutional right to associate. Instead, Act 10 provides a benefit to represented general employees by granting a statutory right to force their employer to negotiate over base wages, while non-represented general employees, who decline to collectively bargain, have no constitutional or statutory right whatsoever to force their employer to collectively bargain on any subject. For this reason, the plaintiffs’ argument must be rejected.</p>
<p class="indent">This point is vital and bears repeating: the plaintiffs’ associational rights are <i>in no way implicated</i> by Act 10’s modifications to Wisconsin’s collective bargaining framework. At issue in this case is the State’s implementation of an exclusive representation system for permitting public employers and public employees to negotiate certain employment terms in good faith. It is a prerogative of a state to establish workplace policy in a non-public process in consultation with only select groups—here, an organization selected by the affected workforce itself—and not others.</p>
<p class="indent">Not at issue in this case is the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to associate to engage in protected First Amendment activities. The plaintiffs remain free to advance <i>any</i> position, on <i>any</i> topic, either individually or in concert, through any channels that are open to the public. Represented municipal employees, non-represented municipal employees, and certified representatives lose no right or ability to associate to engage in constitutionally protected speech because their ability to do so outside the framework of statutory collective bargaining is not impaired. Act 10 merely provides general employees with a statutory mechanism to force their employer to collectively bargain; outside of this narrow context, to which the plaintiffs freely concede public employees have no constitutional right, every avenue for petitioning the government remains available.</p>
<p class="indent">General employees may feel inclined to collectively bargain under Act 10 in order to compel their employer to negotiate on the issue of base wages, but this creates no unconstitutional inhibition on associational freedom. The defendants are not barring the plaintiffs from joining any advocacy groups, limiting their ability to do so, or otherwise curtailing their ability to join other “like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views….” Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1000<i>,</i> 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2288 (2012).</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs’ reliance on <i>Lawson</i> and the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to be misplaced. The limitations on permissible collective bargaining subjects imposed by Act 10 do not force general employees to choose between their constitutional right to associate and the benefit of collective bargaining. Therefore, we hold that Wis. Stat. §§111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, and 118.245 do not violate Plaintiffs’ right to freedom of association.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="indent">We hold that the plaintiffs’ associational rights argument is without merit. We reject the plaintiffs’ argument that several provisions of Act 10, which delineate the rights, obligations, and procedures of collective bargaining, somehow infringe upon general employees’ constitutional right to freedom of association. No matter the limitations or “burdens” a legislative enactment places on the collective bargaining process, collective bargaining remains a creation of legislative grace and not constitutional obligation. The First Amendment cannot be used as a vehicle to expand the parameters of a benefit that it does not itself protect. Accordingly, we conclude that Wis. Stat. §§111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, 118.245, 111.70(1)(f), 111.70(3g), 111.70(4)(d) 3 and the third sentence of §111.70(2) do not violate the plaintiffs’ associational rights.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The court identifies two different types of meanings for collective bargaining. What are they? What protections does each receive or not receive?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Why might a state mandate collective bargaining on certain terms of teachers’ employment, such as compensation, evaluations, leave, and work conditions? Why might a state prohibit bargaining on these or other terms?</p>
<p class="indent">3. How did Act 10 change collective bargaining in Wisconsin? What effect, if any, might these changes have on the quality of education and teaching in the state?</p>
<p class="indent">4. What is plaintiffs’ theory of why these changes violate their constitutional rights? Why does the court reject plaintiffs’ claim?</p>
<p class="indent">5. In portions of the opinion not reprinted here, the plaintiffs also alleged that the changes to collective bargaining violated equal protection by discriminating against those who join unions and that changes to the retirement system violated the Contracts Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. The court rejected the equal protection claim, reasoning that because no fundamental right was infringed and no suspect classification involved, rational basis applied and the Act easily met it. The court, as in North Carolina, upheld the Contracts Clause claim.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Much of the national debate regarding teachers and teacher unions focuses on the basic question of whether teacher unions have become too powerful. Some would argue that teacher unions have so many members, are so well organized, and deliver such a crucial public service that they can dominate the political process. <i>See generally</i> Nicholas Dagostino, <i>Giving the School Bully a Timeout: Protecting Urban Students from Teachers’ Unions</i>, 63 <span class="smallcap">Ala. L. Rev</span>. 177, 181-185 (2011). More problematic, they use that power to protect their self-interests rather than those of the students they serve. <i>Id</i>. at 185-198. Others counter that what is good for teachers is good for students. For instance, smaller class sizes, more school funding, and more supplemental services are all good for students and would not occur without the concerted efforts of teacher unions. <i>See generally</i> William S. Koski, <i>Teacher Collective Bargaining, Teacher Quality, and the</i></p>

L. &amp; Pol’y Rev</span>. 67 (2012) (identifying the varying interests of students, teachers, and other educational actors and their intersections). Which has the strongest argument? Is there a happy median between the two?</p>
<p class="indent">7. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in <i>Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association</i>, a case challenging California’s collective bargaining statutes. In <i>Friedrichs</i>, plaintiffs asked the Court to overturn <i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>, 431 U.S. 209 (1977)—a case in which the Court previously held that although public employees who do not join a union cannot be forced to pay for or subsidize the political activities of unions, the state can force non-union employees to pay an “agency” or “fair share” fee to cover the costs of activities that still directly impact all employees—bargaining for and administering the labor contract for employees. In oral argument in 2016, a majority of the Court appeared ready to overturn the holding from <i>Abood</i>, but the final decision in <i>Friedrichs</i> was not issued until after Justice Scalia’s vacancy and the Court split 4-4. This meant that the Ninth Circuit decision upholding the California statute was affirmed. Friedrichs v. California Teachers Ass’n, 136 S. Ct. 1083 (2016) (Mem.).</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch382">D. TEACHER EVALUATIONS</p>
<p class="noindent">Teacher evaluation has traditionally been a flexible and informal system. The extent to which teachers received an annual evaluation from their superiors varied from district to district. Where these evaluations occurred, they typically consisted of a principal observing a teacher once or twice in the classroom and then meeting with the teacher afterward to discuss the teacher’s strengths and weaknesses. Where appropriate, a principal might identify strategies for improvement and direct the teacher to implement them over some period of time. Otherwise, the principal might simply indicate that the teacher met all of the necessary competencies and move on to the next teacher or task. In other instances, observations might not follow any set schedule, but might only occur after a principal heard complaints about a teacher’s classroom. As the teacher termination cases at the beginning of this chapter suggest, this form of evaluation lent itself to subjective judgments by school officials and disagreements with teachers over those judgments. Regardless, traditional evaluation systems were not designed to specifically assess teaching quality or rank teachers based on their effectiveness. Some policymakers and reformers argued that this weak form of evaluation undermined the overall profession by creating a very low baseline for acceptable teaching and almost no incentives for high performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Teacher evaluations have changed drastically over the past decade. The expansion of standardized testing and the growing amounts of data collected provided a potential means by which to more precisely track individual teachers’ effects on student outcomes. Sensing this possibility and believing that it would help improve teaching effectiveness, the U.S. Department of Education used</p>
<p><a id="page_1036" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1036</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">competitive grant programs during the Great Recession to prompt states to implement data systems to track student achievement by classroom and from year to year. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Race to the Top Program Executive Summary</span> 2-3 (2009). That data would then be tied to teachers, and provide the means by which to evaluate them. <i>Id</i>.; <i>see also</i> Benjamin Michael Superfine, <i>The Promises and Pitfalls of Teacher Evaluation and Accountability Reform</i>, 17 <span class="smallcap">Rich. J.L. &amp; Pub. Int.</span> 591, 592 (2014). Later, the Department went one step further and indicated that adopting these systems would be a condition of receiving a waiver of No Child Left Behind provisions of which states were in violation. <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., ESEA Flexibility</span> 4 (June 7, 2012). Both the competitive grants and the waiver required that states and local districts develop assessments that “measure student growth,” and based on that data, adopt “teacher and principal evaluation and support systems” that “meaningfully differentiate [teacher] performance” into at least three levels based on “student growth” data and other factors. <i>Id</i>. at 5-6. States and districts must use that data to “evaluate teachers and principals on a regular basis” and “inform personnel decisions.” <i>Id</i>. at 6.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the changes were primarily the result of federal leadership or federal leadership simply reinforced local initiatives is not entirely clear, but an entirely new system of teacher evaluation now exists in most states. Between 2009 and 2012, thirty-six states and Washington D.C. passed laws that formally included student performance on standardized tests in the evaluation of teachers. Superfine, <i>supra</i>, at 592. Classroom observations, certifications, and other measures can also play a role, but student performance is the one factor that consistently plays a significant role across states.</p>
<p class="indent">Tennessee, for instance, required that teachers be annually evaluated on two bases—student test scores and frequent principal observations. <span class="smallcap">Tenn. Code Ann.</span> §49-1-302 (20)(d)(2) (2016). Based on those two factors, administrators are to rank each teacher in one of four tiers of effectiveness. <i>Id</i>. The exact weight the performance data must carry in teacher evaluations varies from state to state, with some states requiring it count for 50 percent or more and others only requiring that it be significant. <i>See</i> Derek W. Black, <i>The Constitutional Challenge to Teacher Tenure</i>, 104 <span class="smallcap">Calif. L. Rev.</span> 75, 93 (2016). Once those evaluations are complete, states also mandate consequences. In Tennessee, to receive tenure, teachers must be in the top two tiers of effectiveness two of their first five years of teaching. After that, a teacher can still lose tenure after receiving two consecutive years of below expectations evaluations. Some states even mandate dismissal upon a certain number of low evaluations, while others afford the district discretion to terminate the teacher. Bruce D. Baker et al., <i>The Legal Consequences of Mandating High Stakes Decisions Based on Low Quality Information: Teacher Evaluation in the Race-to-the-Top Era</i>, 21(5) <span class="smallcap">Educ. Pol’y Analysis Archives</span> (2013).</p>
<p class="indent">Teachers have challenged these new evaluation systems on a number of grounds. The most significant, however, is based on the notion that the evaluation systems themselves produce arbitrary results and are so fundamentally unfair that they violate substantive due process. To appreciate the claims, one first needs a basic understanding of how students’ standardized test scores are used to evaluate teachers. States generally rely on one of two statistical models. The first is called a “value-added model” (VAM). This model attempts to</p>
<p><a id="page_1037" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1037</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">estimate how a group of students would perform if all things but the teacher were equal. Based on that estimate, value-added models measure whether individual teachers help students achieve more or less than expected. This serves as the basis to compare teachers to each other and determine which teachers “add value” to learning outcomes. The second model is a “student growth percentile model” (SDP). They are similar in theory to value-added models, but student growth percentile models are distinct in their calculations. Rather than rely on estimates, student growth percentile models measure the actual growth that students demonstrate on standardized tests from one school year to the next. That growth is then compared to the growth of students in other classrooms to rank the growth of a teacher’s students in terms of percentiles. Student growth percentile models, however, do not control for student demographics and other relevant school level factors. In this respect, they are no more than raw data and not well suited to assessing a teacher’s effectiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">Scholars have increasingly identified technical flaws in both models. First is the problem of year-to-year changes. Teachers’ scores on these models routinely change significantly from year to year, are often revised after the fact based on subsequent year data, and may not include data sufficiently disaggregated by student demographics and variables. These year-to-year changes strongly suggest the model calculations for any given individual year are invalid. Second is the problem of arbitrary cut-off scores. States have not validated the cut-off scores embedded in the models, and it is not clear that they can. Being in the top or bottom percentile of teachers, for instance, has not been measured against actual performance in the classroom. Instead, states have arbitrarily determined that being in some statistical percentile means that a teacher is effective or ineffective. Third is the problem of attributing student learning to particular teachers. A standardized history test, for instance, will also test reading comprehension. Thus, the history teacher will be scored based not just on what he or she has taught, but on the quality of instruction the student received in other classes. Moreover, even as to history, students’ learning and interests outside the classroom will affect their performance. Fourth, even if the forgoing issues could be resolved, the statistical models fail to inform the most basic question regarding teaching effectiveness: what the teacher is doing well (or not). VAM and SDP outputs are no more than data points. They do not tell administrators why a teacher is ineffective. Thus, they offer no meaningful notice to teachers of what they are doing wrong, nor an opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p class="indent">As a result of these problems, teachers have challenged the new evaluation systems in several states, including Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. <i>Teacher Evaluation Heads to the Courts</i>, <span class="smallcap">Educ. Week</span>, Oct. 7, 2015; <i>see also</i> LaJuana Davis, <i>Huntsville, AL Education Association Sues District for Withholding List of “Ineffective” Teachers</i>, <span class="smallcap">Educ. Law Prof Blog</span> (Apr. 28, 2016). The Eleventh Circuit was the first high court to offer an opinion on the issues. As you will see, its analysis was relatively perfunctory in upholding Florida’s evaluation system. Whether the opinion will shape the outcome in other states remains to be seen, but at least one trial court has already rejected its reasoning. Stewart v. New Mexico Public Educ. Dep’t, No. D-101-DV-2015-</p>

<p class="noindent">00409, Findings and Conclusions and Memorandum Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (First Judicial District Court, Dec. 2, 2015).</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch383">Cook v. Bennett</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>792 F.3d 1294 (11th Cir. 2015)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Florida public school teachers challenged Florida’s Student Success Act, as well as the Florida State Board of Education’s and three school districts’ implementation of the Act, alleging that the Act resulted in teacher evaluation policies that violated the teachers’ rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because we agree with the district court that the policies pass rational basis review, we affirm.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2011, the Florida legislature enacted the Student Success Act, establishing new requirements for public school teachers’ performance evaluations. Fla. Stat. §012.34 (2011). The Act provided that “[a]t least 50 percent of a performance evaluation must be based upon data and indicators of student learning growth assessed annually by statewide assessments.” <i>Id.</i> §1012.34(3)(a)(1). It tasked the Florida Commissioner of Education with approving “a formula to measure individual student learning growth on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).” <i>Id.</i> §1012.34(7)(a).</p>
<p class="indent">The Commissioner developed a formula known as the FCAT value-added model (“FCAT VAM”), which is based on students’ FCAT scores for English and mathematics and accounts for a host of predictor variables (such as a student’s prior test scores, attendance rate, and disability status). The FCAT VAM outputs a “teacher component,” which measures an individual teacher’s effect on student scores, and a “common school component,” which measures the potential impact of factors that are part of a school’s environment, such as the principal or the neighborhood. A teacher’s final evaluation score is calculated by adding the FCAT VAM teacher component score with 50 percent of the common school component score.</p>
<p class="indent">Students take the English FCAT exam in grades 3 through 10 and the mathematics FCAT exam in grades 3 through 8. The FCAT VAM was designed to provide evaluation scores for teachers who teach FCAT courses and whose students have FCAT scores from at least two years: the earlier score serves as a baseline of the student’s achievement, and the more recent score is used to evaluate his or her current teacher’s performance. Thus, the model only works as designed in evaluating teachers of English in grades 4 through 10 and math in grades 4 through 8. The district court referred to these teachers as “Type A” teachers, and we will adopt its nomenclature for the purposes of this opinion. The rest of Florida’s public school teachers fall into two groups. “Type B” teachers teach students in grades 4 through 10, but in subjects other than English or math. A Type B teacher’s students have at least two FCAT scores that can be used in the FCAT VAM, but the teacher does not teach the subjects in which the scores were received. “Type C” teachers teach students who either (1) are in grades below 4 or above 10 or (2) do not take standardized tests. A Type C</p>
<p><a id="page_1039" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1039</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">teacher’s students do not have at least two FCAT scores that can be used in the FCAT VAM.</p>
<p class="indent">The Student Success Act required schools to adopt the FCAT VAM for purposes of evaluating Type A teachers beginning with the 2011–12 school year. For Type B and C teachers, the Act instructed school districts to select an “equally appropriate formula for measuring student learning growth.” However, most districts—including the three school district defendants here—lacked the resources necessary to develop alternative assessments (such as district-wide testing in non-FCAT subjects) or the statistical models (equivalent to the FCAT VAM) necessary to derive student growth measurements from alternative assessment data. In the absence of an “equally appropriate formula,” the Act required school districts to evaluate Type B teachers using “the growth in learning of the classroom teacher’s students on statewide assessments.” In practice, Type B teachers’ evaluations were based on FCAT VAM scores derived from their students’ FCAT scores in English and math.</p>
<p class="indent">For Type C teachers, in the absence of a formula, school districts had to evaluate them using “measurable learning targets…established based upon the goals of the school improvement plan and approved by the school principal.” In practice, Type C teachers’ evaluations were based on school-wide FCAT VAM scores derived from the FCAT scores of students whom the Type C teachers did not teach. The Florida State Board of Education approved the districts’ evaluation procedures and assisted the districts in calculating FCAT VAM scores for Type B and C teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs challenged, under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the constitutionality of the Student Success Act and the district and state defendants’ implementation of the Act.</p>
<p class="indent">We begin by analyzing the plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim. For such claims, we apply the rational basis standard when a challenged law infringes upon a non-fundamental right, as is the case here. Under rational basis review, the school district’s evaluation policies must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. We will uphold a law if “there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for [it].” “[A] state has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.…[T]he burden is on the one attacking the law to negate every conceivable basis that might support it, even if that basis has no foundation in the record.” A law need not be sensible to pass rational basis review; rather, it “may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.” A statute survives rational basis review even if it “seems unwise…or if the rationale for it seems tenuous.”</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs argue that the evaluation policies fail rational basis review because the policies arbitrarily and illogically evaluate teachers based on test scores either of students or in subjects they did not teach. The plaintiffs claim that the evaluation policies are not rationally related to, and in fact run counter to, the purpose for which the FCAT VAM was developed—that is, to attribute student learning growth to specific teachers by controlling for variables such as student demographics or school-wide factors like a principal.</p>
<p><a id="page_1040" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1040</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Certainly the FCAT VAM was not designed to evaluate Type B and C teachers, but the defendants do not justify the evaluation policies in relation to the FCAT VAM’s purpose. Rather, they argue that the policies are rationally related to the purpose behind the Student Success Act itself, which is to “increas[e] student academic performance by improving the quality of instructional, administrative, and supervisory services in the public schools of the state.” Fla. Stat. §1012.34(1)(a). The plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden to refute this justification for the law. While the FCAT VAM may not be the best method—or may even be a poor one—for achieving this goal, it is still rational to think that the challenged evaluation procedures would advance the government’s stated purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">As the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument, Florida officials could have reasonably believed that (1) a teacher can improve student performance through his or her presence in a school and (2) the FCAT VAM can measure those school-wide performance improvements, even if the model was not designed to do so. For example, Type B teachers may have a positive impact on their students that bleeds over into the students’ work in other classes, including those measured by the FCAT. Type C teachers may have a positive impact on the learning environment of the school overall. The FCAT VAM can capture such impacts either by measuring the growth of a Type B teacher’s students or by measuring the growth of a school overall. It is also reasonable to think that tying teacher evaluation scores and teacher compensation to FCAT VAM scores can incentivize teachers to pursue more school-wide improvements, which would in turn improve student academic performance. Thus, we agree with the district court that the policies pass rational basis review. Without a doubt, the evaluation scheme has led to some unfair results for Type B and C teachers, but “[t]he Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.” Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="indent">We reach the same result as to the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim. Rational basis review also applies to equal protection challenges concerned with a distinction between two groups drawn without reference to a protected class, as is the case here. On rational basis review, “[t]he general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.” <i>Id.</i> Rational basis review in the context of equal protection is essentially equivalent to rational basis review in the context of due process.</p>
<p class="indent">As we held above, the challenged evaluation procedures were rationally related to the purpose of improving student academic performance. Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim also fails. The plaintiffs argue that the decisions in <i>Debra P. v. Turlington,</i> 644 F.2d 397 (5th Cir.1981), and <i>Armstead v. Starkville Mun. Separate Sch. Dist.,</i> 461 F.2d 276 (5th Cir.1972), dictate the opposite result. <i>Turlington</i> concerned Florida’s creation of a new prerequisite for graduation, requiring students to get a minimum score on a state-created assessment test. The Fifth Circuit held that the test was not rationally related to a</p>
<p><a id="page_1041" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1041</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">legitimate state interest insofar as it tested material not taught to the students. The court remanded the case for further development of the record as to whether the test covered untaught material.</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Armstead</i> struck down a Mississippi school’s use of the Graduate Record Examination (“GRE”) as an employment qualification for teachers. Both prospective and incumbent teachers had to achieve a certain minimum score on the GRE in order to gain employment or continue teaching at the school. It was undisputed in the case that the GRE could not predict the future effectiveness of teachers. The court held that the GRE had “no reasonable function in the teacher selection process.” <i>Armstead,</i> 461 F.2d at 280.</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Armstead</i> and <i>Turlington</i> are distinguishable from the case before us. Both cases involved tests that could not further a legitimate state objective. A test based on information never taught to a student cannot assess whether a student is ready for graduation from high school. Similarly, the GRE (which measures vocabulary, reading comprehension, and mathematical reasoning to determine an individual’s capacity for advanced study) cannot predict how effective a teacher will be in the classroom. In this case, however, the plaintiffs have conceded that the FCAT VAM is—or at least a rational policymaker could believe it is—capable of measuring some marginal impact that teachers can have on their own students or on the overall school environment. Thus, the FCAT VAM is not analogous to the tests at issue in <i>Armstead</i> and <i>Turlington,</i> and it was not irrational for the districts to use the model for teacher evaluations.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the state and district defendants could have rationally believed that the challenged evaluation policies would improve students’ academic achievement, we affirm the district court’s entry of summary judgment in the defendants’ favor.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. How does Florida’s teacher evaluation system work? Are there any practical problems with it? How accurate or inaccurate is it likely to be in assessing teaching effectiveness? Might the evaluation system be more accurate for some teachers and less for others? If so, is the system reliable?</p>
<p class="indent">2. No system is perfect and, thus, the appropriate inquiry may be how accurate the system needs to be for districts to fairly rely upon it. What level of accuracy in the evaluation system does the court require? Do you agree that this level of accuracy is sufficient to render it constitutionally rational? If the system produces random results, can it be a rational system?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Eleventh Circuit’s outcome appears to be dictated by its notion that rational basis review requires an extremely deferential approach to the testing and evaluation system. According to the Eleventh Circuit, so long as the state has a legitimate goal and the system furthers it in some way, the system is constitutional. While there are few cases directly on point, in similar contexts, courts have asked preliminary questions about the tests themselves, reasoning that if the test to be administered is not technically valid, it is impermissible. <i>See,</i></p>
<p><a id="page_1042" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1042</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>e.g</i>., Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 406 (5th Cir. 1981) (focusing heavily on the validity of a high school graduation and writing that “[i]f the test is not fair, it cannot be said to be rationally related to a state interest”); <i>see also</i> <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ. Off. for Civil Rights, The Use of Tests as Part of High-Stakes Decision-Making for Students</span> (2000). This analysis proceeds from the notion that due process includes both substantive and procedural protections. While the basic rule of substantive due process might only require that the evaluation system marginally further some legitimate goal, as a matter of fairness and procedure, the system must also offer teachers meaningful notice and a fair opportunity to respond. Technically invalid tests do neither, as teachers may not know what their actual deficiencies are, nor how to correct them. <i>See generally</i> Bruce D. Baker et al., <i>The Legal Consequences of Mandating High Stakes Decisions Based on Low Quality Information: Teacher Evaluation in the Race-to-the-Top Era</i>, 21 <span class="smallcap">Educ.

E<span class="smallcap">duc</span>. &amp; L.J. 1 (2012).</p>
<p class="indent">4. Notwithstanding its deferential review, does the court sufficiently justify its conclusion that the evaluation system furthers the state’s goals? How is the evaluation of teachers on material that they did not teach reasonably related to furthering the state’s goal?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The trial court in <i>New Mexico ex rel. Stewart v. N.M. Public Education Department</i>, No. D-101-CV-2015-00409 (N.M. Dec. 2, 2015), enjoined New Mexico’s value-added model of teacher evaluation. Although the state is free to continue to use its model for diagnostic or other purposes, it cannot use it for high-stakes purposes of terminating teachers or placing teachers on notice of future termination. Nor can it use the model to revoke licenses or deny raises. Throughout its opinion, the court found various aspects of the evaluation system that made it generally unreliable. It emphasized, for instance, the random variations in the model’s results for teachers from district to district and year to year. As one superintendent admitted, he could not determine why a teacher was rated as ineffective; he just knew that was her rating.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, a trial court in New York struck down the state’s value-added system. Based on submissions from leading education experts, the court found:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>

<p class="h3" id="ch384">E. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO TEACHER TENURE</p>
<p class="noindent">As prior sections imply, many education reformers are convinced that eliminating teacher tenure is a necessary first step to any meaningful improvement to teaching quality because tenure locks in the status quo. But as the prior sections also demonstrate, certain federal and state constitutional principles place limits on states’ abilities to change or eliminate tenure. Equally important, the political strength of teachers and their unions would often serve to block these changes in the first instance.</p>
<p class="indent">Acknowledging these constraints, reformers have joined with plaintiffs to pursue the same ends through other means, developing the theory that tenure and the retention of ineffective teachers violates students’ constitutional right to education. As explored in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>, a majority of state supreme courts have used state constitutional rights to equalize school funding. If unequal funding violates the constitutional right to education, reformers reason that so too might ineffective teaching caused by tenure.</p>
<p class="indent">The first case, <i>Vergara v. State</i>, was filed in California in 2012. The plaintiffs alleged that California statutes grant teachers tenure far too easily and “force school administrators to keep teachers in the classroom long after they have demonstrated themselves to be grossly ineffective.” First Amended Complaint for Declaratory &amp; Injunctive Relief at 1, Vergara v. State, No. BC484642 (Cal. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2012). This, plaintiffs reasoned, violates the California Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, under which education is a fundamental right. In 2014, the trial court in <i>Vergara</i> became the first to strike down a tenure statute as unconstitutional. Vergara v. State, No. BC484642, 2014 WL 6478415 (Cal. Super. Ct. Aug. 27, 2014). With that result, it triggered similar litigation in other states and what some call a “War on Teacher Tenure.” Haley Sweetland Edwards, <i>The War on Teacher Tenure</i>, <span class="smallcap">Time</span>, Oct. 30, 2014. That “war,” however, suffered a major setback when the California appellate court reversed the decision in <i>Vergara</i>.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch385">Vergara v. State</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>246 Cal. App. 4th 619, 202 Cal. Rptr. 3d 262 (2016)</i></p>
<p class="indent">[N]ine students sued the State of California and several state officials, seeking a court order declaring various provisions of California’s Education Code unconstitutional. According to plaintiffs, these provisions, which govern how K-12 public school teachers obtain tenure, how they are dismissed, and how they are laid off on the basis of seniority, violate the California Constitution’s guarantee that all citizens enjoy the “equal protection of the laws.” The matter went to trial. After hearing eight weeks of evidence, the trial court issued a 16-page tentative decision, finding the challenged statutes unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the California Constitution.</p>
<p><a id="page_1044" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1044</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In its decision, the trial court noted that in <i>Serrano v. Priest</i>, 5 Cal.3d 584 (1971) (<i>Serrano I</i>) and <i>Serrano v. Priest</i>,<i>
</i> 18 Cal.3d 728 (1976) (<i>Serrano II</i>), our Supreme Court held education to be a fundamental interest and struck down the then-operative school financing system for violating the equal protection provisions of the California Constitution. The trial court also discussed <i>Butt,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that students in the Richmond Unified School District would be deprived of their right to basic educational equality if the district closed its schools six weeks early due to a budgetary shortfall. In light of this legal authority, the trial court characterized its task as determining whether the challenged statutes “cause the potential and/or unreasonable exposure of grossly ineffective teachers to all California students in general and to minority and/or low income students in particular, in violation of the equal protection clause of the California Constitution.” Answering this question affirmatively, the court determined that plaintiffs “met their burden of proof on all issues presented.”</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court found that competent teachers are a critical component of the success of a child’s educational experience, and that grossly ineffective teachers substantially undermine the ability of a child to succeed in school. It further found that evidence presented at trial on the effects of grossly ineffective teachers was compelling and “shocks the conscience.” The court wrote there was “no dispute” that a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers are active in California classrooms and, based on the testimony of defendants’ expert Berliner, estimated this number to comprise 1 to 3 percent of California teachers—or approximately 2,750 to 8,250 teachers. Based on its determination that the challenged statutes (i) impose a “real and appreciable impact” on students’ fundamental rights to equality of education, and (ii) “impose a disproportionate burden on poor and minority students,” the court employed a “strict scrutiny” examination of the challenged statutes.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to the tenure statute, the trial court found “extensive evidence” that the probationary period “does not provide nearly enough time for an informed decision to be made regarding the decision of tenure.” As a result, “teachers are being reelected who would not have been had more time been provided for the process,” and students “are unnecessarily, and for no legally cognizable reason (let alone a compelling one), disadvantaged by the current [tenure statute].” The court determined that defendants had not met their burden under the strict scrutiny standard and declared the tenure statute unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent">Turning to the dismissal statutes, the trial court found that, based on the evidence presented, the dismissal process’s time and costs cause districts to be very reluctant to commence dismissal procedures. Due to this situation, “grossly ineffective teachers are being left in the classroom because school officials do not wish to go through the time and expense to investigate and prosecute these cases.” The court further found that due process for tenured teachers is a legitimate concern, but the dismissal statutes “present the issue of über due process.” In concluding that defendants failed to meet their burden under the strict scrutiny standard, the court wrote: “There is no question that teachers should be afforded reasonable due process when their dismissals are sought. However, based on the evidence before this Court, it finds the current system…to be</p>
<p><a id="page_1045" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1045</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">so complex, time consuming and expensive as to make an effective, efficient yet fair dismissal of a grossly ineffective teacher illusory.”</p>
<p class="indent">Regarding the reduction-in-force statute, the trial court noted it contained no exception based on teacher effectiveness. Therefore, the court found, because the “last-hired” teacher is statutorily mandated to be “first fired” when layoffs occur, students are separated from competent junior teachers while incompetent teachers with seniority remain in the classroom. “The result is classroom disruption on two fronts, a lose-lose situation.” Again, the court found that defendants did not carry their burden under the strict scrutiny test, and deemed the reduction-in-force statute unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the trial court determined that substantial evidence showed the challenged statutes disproportionately affect poor and/or minority students. Citing to the 2007 [California Department of Education (CDE)] report, it found that students attending high-poverty, low-performing schools were far more likely than wealthier peers to attend schools with a disproportionately high number of underqualified, inexperienced, and ineffective teachers. The court further found that the “dance of the lemons”—where poorly performing teachers are transferred from school to school—was caused by the lack of effective dismissal statutes and the reduction-in-force statute, and that it affected high-poverty and minority students disproportionately.</p>
<p class="indent">[On these grounds, t]he trial court ordered the statutes enjoined, and stayed all injunctions pending appellate review.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Discussion</span></p>
<p class="indent">As explained above, plaintiffs contend that the challenged statutes create an oversupply of grossly ineffective teachers because (i) the tenure statute’s probationary period is too short, preventing the identification of grossly ineffective teachers before the mandated deadline for reelection; (ii) when grossly ineffective tenured teachers are identified, it is functionally impossible to terminate them under the overly burdensome and complicated dismissal statutes; and (iii) when reductions-in-force are required, the statute requires the termination of junior, competent teachers while more senior, grossly ineffective teachers keep their jobs only because they have seniority. Plaintiffs argued, and the trial court agreed, that two distinct classes of students—Group 1 (an “unlucky subset” of students within the population of students at large) and Group 2 (poor and minority students)—were denied equal protection because the challenged statutes led members of these groups to be assigned to grossly ineffective teachers.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Group 1: No Identifiable Class Under Equal Protection Analysis</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs describe Group 1 as an “unlucky subset” of the general student population that is denied the fundamental right to basic educational equality because students within this subset are assigned to grossly ineffective teachers. According to plaintiffs, the students comprising Group 1 are, in all pertinent respects, similar to the population of students at large, except for their exposure</p>
<p><a id="page_1046" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1046</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to grossly ineffective teachers. In the judgment, the trial court found that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional because they lead students within Group 1 to be assigned to grossly ineffective teachers and thereby have a real and appreciable impact on these students’ fundamental right of education.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court’s judgment, however, omits analysis of a key preliminary question: Is the unlucky subset of students comprising Group 1 a sufficiently identifiable group for purposes of an equal protection action? “In equal protection analysis, the threshold question is whether the legislation under attack somehow discriminates against an identifiable class of persons. Only then do the courts ask the further question of whether this identifiable group is a suspect class or is being denied some fundamental interest, thus requiring the discrimination to be subjected to close scrutiny.”</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the unlucky subset is not an identifiable class of persons sufficient to maintain an equal protection challenge. Although a group need not be specifically identified in a statute to claim an equal protection violation, group members must have some pertinent common characteristic other than the fact that they are assertedly harmed by a statute.</p>
<p class="indent">The defining characteristic of the Group 1 students, who are allegedly harmed by being assigned to grossly ineffective teachers, is that they are assigned to grossly ineffective teachers. Such a circular premise is an insufficient basis for a proper equal protection claim. To avoid this circularity, a group must be identifiable by a shared trait other than the violation of a fundamental right.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs argue that a class need only be identifiable when the asserted equal protection violation stems from the differential treatment of a suspect class, rather than the infringement of a fundamental right. For support, they cite <i>Moreno v. Draper</i> (1999). But <i>Moreno</i> does not support their argument. The statute at issue in <i>Moreno,</i> which the plaintiff claimed infringed the fundamental right to raise one’s children, “create[d] two classes of parents paying child support—those with children receiving public assistance and those with children <i>not</i> receiving public assistance.” Indeed, every equal protection case based on the infringement of a fundamental right has involved a class identified by some characteristic other than asserted harm. In <i>Butt,</i> the classes were the students of the Richmond Unified School District, who would be harmed by the closing of schools, and the students outside that district. In the <i>Serrano</i> cases, the impairment of the fundamental right to education was suffered by students living in relatively poor school districts, which had less taxable wealth and therefore, under the then-existent financing systems, lower levels of educational expenditures. In other words, students were impacted by the system based on their residency.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, the unlucky subset constituting Group 1 is definable only by the characteristic that group members have assertedly suffered constitutional harm. What is more, the statutes do not assist plaintiffs with their definitional deficiency because they do not specify which students will be the “unlucky ones.” In <i>Gould,</i> our Supreme Court held that a system that assigned ballot position randomly would not violate equal protection because, since all candidates had an equal chance of obtaining the top position, it would not “continually work a disadvantage upon a fixed class of candidates.” The claimed effect on students</p>
<p><a id="page_1047" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1047</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">here is analogous. Under plaintiffs’ Group 1 theory, an unlucky subset of students will inevitably be assigned to grossly ineffective teachers. The chance that this will happen to any individual student, however, is random, as the challenged statutes do not make any one student more likely to be assigned to a grossly ineffective teacher than any other student. Thus, the unlucky subset is nothing more than a random assortment of students. Moreover, because (according to the trial court’s findings) approximately 1 to 3 percent of California teachers are grossly ineffective, a student in the unlucky subset one year will likely not be the next year, meaning that the group is subject to constant flux. The claimed unlucky subset, therefore, is not an identifiable class sufficient to maintain an equal protection claim, and the judgment, insofar as it is based on plaintiffs’ Group 1 theory, cannot be affirmed.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. Group 2: No Inevitable Constitutional Violation</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The trial court also found that poor and minority students (Group 2) suffered disproportionate harm from being assigned to grossly ineffective teachers. Race is generally considered a “suspect classification” under equal protection analysis. In the context of education, under California law, wealth is considered a suspect classification as well. Based on its finding of disproportionate harm, the trial court determined that strict scrutiny of the challenged statutes was appropriate. In making this determination, however, the trial court bypassed an initial question of the required analysis: Did the <i>challenged statutes</i> cause low-income and minority students to be disproportionately assigned to grossly ineffective teachers?</p>
<p class="indent">A statute is facially unconstitutional when the constitutional violation flows “inevitably” from the statute, not the actions of the people implementing it. This can occur when (1) the text of the statute mandates the constitutional violation (see <i>Serrano I,</i> 5 Cal.3d 584, 603 [noting how the unequal “school funding scheme is mandated in every detail by the California Constitution and statutes”]); or (2) the constitutional violation, while not mandated by the statute’s text, “inevitably” flows from the statute regardless of the actions of those administering it (see <i>Serrano II,</i> 18 Cal.3d 728, 768-69 [noting how, in light of a property tax–based school funding scheme, a poor school district “cannot freely choose to tax itself into an excellence…”].</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that the challenged statutes here, by only their text, do not inevitably cause poor and minority students to receive an unequal, deficient education. With respect to students, the challenged statutes do not differentiate by any distinguishing characteristic, including race or wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs still could have demonstrated a facial equal protection violation, however, by showing that the challenged statutes, regardless of how they are implemented, inevitably cause poor and minority students to be provided with an education that is not “basically equivalent to” their more affluent and/or white peers. It is possible, though not certain, that plaintiffs could have made such a showing by proving that any implementation of the statutes inevitably resulted in the consequential assignment of disproportionately high numbers of</p>
<p><a id="page_1048" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1048</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">grossly inefficient teachers to schools predominantly serving low-income and minority students.</p>
<p class="indent">No such showing was made. Instead, the evidence at trial firmly demonstrated that staffing decisions, including teacher assignments, are made by administrators, and that the process is guided by teacher preference, district policies, and collective bargaining agreements. This evidence is consistent with the process set forth in the Education Code, which grants school district superintendents the power to assign teachers to specific schools or to transfer teachers between schools within a district, subject to conditions imposed by collective bargaining agreements, district policies, and by statute. Further, the evidence at trial showed what the text of the challenged statutes makes clear—that the challenged statutes do not in any way instruct administrators regarding which teachers to assign to which schools. Thus, it is administrative decisions (in conjunction with other factors), and not the challenged statutes, that determine where teachers are assigned throughout a district.</p>
<p class="indent">The trial court’s conclusions do not support a contrary finding. In determining that the challenged statutes disproportionately affect Group 2 students, the trial court (i) cited to a CDE report stating that students attending high-poverty, low-performing schools are far more likely than wealthier peers to attend schools with a high number of underqualified, inexperienced, and ineffective teachers, and (ii) found that the “dance of the lemons” is caused by the lack of effective dismissal statutes and the reduction-in-force statute, and that it affects high-poverty and minority students disproportionately. Neither of these findings supports a conclusion that the challenged statutes determine where grossly ineffective teachers work. The CDE report relied on by the court does not suggest that the challenged statutes cause disparities in the assignment of poor or minority students to grossly ineffective teachers. Instead, it repeatedly documents the reason for higher concentrations of ineffective teachers in schools serving such students—the “counterproductive hiring and placement practices” of local administrators. Nor did the trial evidence show the “dance of the lemons” is inevitably caused by the statutes. Instead, as described at trial, the dance of the lemons is a process driven by local administrators. According to trial testimony, some principals rid their schools of highly ineffective teachers by transferring them to other schools, often to low-income schools. This phenomenon is extremely troubling and should not be allowed to occur, but it does not inevitably flow from the challenged statutes, and therefore cannot provide the basis for a facial challenge to the statutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs contend that the testimony of their expert witnesses supports their position that the challenged statutes cause grossly ineffective teachers to be disproportionately assigned to schools with large low-income and minority populations. These witnesses opined that grossly ineffective teachers “tend to” accumulate in schools serving minority students, and that the challenged statutes “could” be a cause. We are not required to defer to expert opinion regarding the ultimate issue in a case, particularly when the issue is a predominantly legal mixed question of law and fact. In any event, these opinions do not sustain plaintiffs’ burden. The first opinion does not explain why grossly ineffective teachers “tend to” accumulate at certain schools, and the second opinion</p>
<p><a id="page_1049" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1049</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">only indicates the statutes “could be” a cause, not that they are or, more importantly, <i>inevitably</i> are.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor have plaintiffs demonstrated that the challenged statutes inevitably lead to greater disruption at schools serving poor and minority students during reductions-in-force. Plaintiffs presented evidence that certain schools serving these students have higher numbers of inexperienced teachers and go through more layoffs than other schools. Witnesses for plaintiffs testified that this “constant churn” of staff is destabilizing. Again, while plaintiffs have identified a troubling problem, they have not properly targeted the cause. The challenged statutes do not inevitably lead to the assignment of more inexperienced teachers to schools serving poor and minority children. Rather, assignments are made by administrators and are heavily influenced by teacher preference and collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible that the challenged statutes—in the way they pertain to teacher tenure and seniority—lead to a higher number of grossly ineffective teachers being in the educational system than a hypothetical alternative statutory scheme would. This possibility may present a problem with policy, but it does not, in itself, give rise to an equal protection violation, which requires a classification affecting similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming that poor and minority students encounter more grossly ineffective teachers and that this impacts their constitutional right to “basic educational equality,” the constitutional infringement is the product of staffing decisions, not the challenged statutes. Even if the statutes were struck down, the harm at issue—the disproportionate assignment of inferior teachers to poor and minority students—could still occur as before. (Any system will have some teachers who are not as effective as others.) And, since the challenged statutes, on their face and in effect, do not dictate where teachers are assigned, declaring the statutes facially unconstitutional would not prevent administrators from assigning the worst teachers to schools serving poor and minority students.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the evidence presented at trial highlighted likely drawbacks to the current tenure, dismissal, and layoff statutes, but it did not demonstrate a facial constitutional violation. The evidence also revealed deplorable staffing decisions being made by some local administrators that have a deleterious impact on poor and minority students in California’s public schools. The evidence did not show that the challenged statutes inevitably cause this impact. Plaintiffs elected not to target local administrative decisions and instead opted to challenge the statutes themselves. This was a heavy burden and one plaintiffs did not carry. The trial court’s judgment declaring the statutes unconstitutional, therefore, cannot be affirmed.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Putting aside the evidence in this case, do plaintiffs raise a theoretically valid claim that tenure violates the fundamental or constitutional right to education? How does that claim compare to those plaintiffs’ assertions regarding</p>
<p><a id="page_1050" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1050</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">funding and other resources and opportunities in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>? Is there any important distinction between the tenure claim and those others?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Is this challenge more akin to the adequacy and equity challenges asserted in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a> or closer to an education malpractice tort claim, whereby individuals seek the ability to remove particular teachers from their jobs? Courts have traditionally rejected education malpractice claims due to actual and proximate cause problems and the absence of objective standards for evaluation of teachers, but relying on much of the same type of data presented in <i>Vergara</i>, Ethan Hutt and Aaron Tang argue that courts could now recognize the claim. <i>The New Education Malpractice Litigation</i>, 99 <span class="smallcap">Va. L. Rev</span>. 419, 421 (2013). Do you agree?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court allows that some students—potentially even a substantial number—may be saddled with grossly ineffective teachers. Why does the court, nonetheless, conclude that plaintiffs’ claim fails? The court’s answer to this question also helps resolve another issue initially raised in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a> regarding whether strict scrutiny of education as a fundamental right requires the state to perfect its education system and eliminate all inequalities. Here, the court indicates that random variations in educational opportunity alone do not give rise to constitutional claim. Is the court’s explanation on this point compelling?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Even if plaintiffs could identify a discrete class of students who are saddled with grossly ineffective teachers, the court finds that their challenge to tenure and seniority statutes would fail for another fundamental reason. What is that reason?</p>
<p class="indent">5. What causes other than tenure might explain the retention of ineffective teachers or their disproportionate numbers at predominantly poor and minority schools? Which causes are likely the strongest?</p>
<p class="indent">6. The challenge to tenure and seniority arguably seeks to dictate the terms of employment of teachers rather than just ensure equal access to quality teachers. If so, this challenge would seek to set or dictate education policy at a deeper level than the challenges raised in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>. Does this present any policy or separation of powers concerns?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Just weeks after the trial court decision in <i>Vergara</i>, two different challenges to teacher tenure were filed in New York (and thereafter consolidated). Al Baker, <i>Lawsuit Challenges New York’s Teacher Tenure Laws</i>, N.Y. <span class="smallcap">Times</span>, July 4, 2014, at A14. Plaintiffs survived the state’s initial motion to dismiss. Davids v. State, No. 10115/14 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Mar. 12, 2014), <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/03/new-york-trial-court-permits-constitutional-challenge-to-teacher-tenure-proceed.html" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/03/new-york-trial-court-permits-constitutional-challenge-to-teacher-tenure-proceed.html</a> (order denying motions to dismiss). Another tenure challenge was filed in Minnesota in 2016.

<p class="indent">8. Value-added models of teacher evaluation also weighed heavily in <i>Vergara</i>.
