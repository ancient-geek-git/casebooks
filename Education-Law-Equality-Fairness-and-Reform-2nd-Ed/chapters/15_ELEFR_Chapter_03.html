<p class="noindent">Public schools rely heavily on local property taxes to fund education. As a result, the resources available in schools vary significantly across school districts and states. In the past, it was not uncommon for some school districts to spend more than double that of other districts in the same state. For instance, in <i>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</i>, 411 U.S. 1, 16 (1973), the Supreme Court revealed that the wealthiest districts in Texas spent $815 per pupil whereas the poorest spent $305 per pupil.</p>
<p class="indent">For a variety of political reasons, most states have done little to seriously address this problem. Yet, it is inaccurate to say states have done nothing or that all have piles of money that they refuse to allocate to needy districts. Some states have willingly allocated additional resources to poorer districts, but those funds have often been insufficient to remedy otherwise extreme inequality. Some states simply lack the capacity to properly fund education. As Goodwin Liu points out, the greatest funding inequalities exist between states, not within them. Goodwin Liu, <i>Interstate Inequality in Educational Opportunity</i>, 81 <span class="smallcap">N.Y.U. L. Rev</span>. 2044 (2006). For instance, Mississippi’s per-pupil expenditures are the lowest in the nation, even though the state exerts significant effort to raise educational funds. <i>Id.</i> In poor states, huge efforts still net relatively small financial resources. In some wealthier states, per-pupil expenditures are low or unequal because the state makes so little effort to address the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the cause, funding inequality and inadequacy disadvantages numerous communities across the country. In states like Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming, rural white communities tend to suffer the most inequality. In states like California, New Jersey, and New York, urban minority communities tend to suffer the most. In other states, inequality defies easy categorization, affecting rural and urban, minority and nonminority students. In short, finance systems operate to disadvantage some group in nearly every state. In response, advocates have filed litigation in 44 of 50 states. Michael A. Rebell, <i>Education Adequacy, Democracy, and the Courts</i>, in <span class="smallcap">Achieving High Educational Standards for All: Conference Summary</span> 218, 227 (Timothy Ready et al., eds., 2002).</p>
<p class="indent">Many term this litigation “school finance litigation.” This chapter often uses that term as well, but frames the issue differently. The focus of this chapter is the affirmative right to education and the state’s duty to assist poor</p>
<p><a id="page_150" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>150</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and other disadvantaged students in overcoming challenges they may face in fully benefiting from that education. While the remedies in most litigation have been additional funding and reforms in school finance formulas, the justification for that remedy is the existence of an affirmative or equal right to education and the state’s failure to provide poor and disadvantaged students with appropriate educational opportunities. To be clear, however, poverty operates at both the individual and community level. At the individual level, student poverty creates educational challenges that require supplemental resources beyond the norm if most poor students are going to have a reasonable chance at educational success. Of course, these barriers entail any number of complex issues, but the example of nutrition makes the point simply. Were it not for free school breakfasts and lunches, many poor students would not receive a full meal at any point during the day, which has obvious consequences on learning. Realities of this sort make delivering quality educational opportunities to poor students more expensive.</p>
<p class="indent">At the community level, the effects of poverty are more complex. Putting individual student need aside, schools need a baseline of resources to pay teachers and build and maintain schools. Yet, not all communities have ready access to the resources necessary to achieve these ends. Some districts lack a significant commercial sector and are entirely dependent on residential property taxes to fund schools. In suburban neighborhoods with high home values and higher-earning families, raising funds this way is not a problem, but in communities where homes are not nearly as highly valued, localities must tax property-poor communities at much higher rates to generate the same amount of funding as other jurisdictions. At some point, raising taxes produces diminishing gains and actually reduces the value of homes and tax receipts. Other localities may not be property poor, but still face challenges in raising sufficient revenues because their costs are so high. Large cities, in particular, deliver far more municipal services than other areas, and these services are also more expensive to deliver in cities than elsewhere. Unless the city has a high tax base—and some do not—it may experience “municipal overburden,” and lack the capacity to both fund schools at high levels and offer necessary community services.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the problems of financing schools are so diverse, the key to a sophisticated understanding of this litigation is to develop a robust framework for the cases. This chapter attempts this by separating federal litigation and policy from state litigation and, within state litigation, separating the legal theory of cases from the remedies they warrant. The chapter begins with federal litigation, which is premised on the notion that education is a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution and poverty is a suspect class. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected those arguments in <i>San Antonio Independent School District</i>, although it left open the possibility for narrower future litigation. The second section of the chapter examines state litigation that relies on education clauses in state constitutions. The first cases in this section offer examples of the major constitutional theories that litigants pursued: education as a fundamental right, a right to equal educational opportunities, and a right to a quality education. The subsequent cases offer a detailed examination of how to demonstrate a constitutional violation under these theories and the different remedies a</p>
<p><a id="page_151" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>151</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">violation might support. Throughout these cases, the chapter also focuses on separation of powers concerns that constrain courts in adjudicating the issues.</p>
<p class="indent">After establishing this framework, the chapter explores global issues, including whether litigation has remedied inequality, whether money actually matters, whether race and school poverty are separate issues, what effect poor education has on society at large, to what extent federal policy can or should address resource inequality, and, finally, what the future of the school finance movement holds. While these questions come at the end of the chapter, each is worth considering throughout the chapter as you read each case.</p>

<p class="h5" id="ch62">San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>411 U.S. 1 (1973)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Powell</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">This suit attacking the Texas system of financing public education was initiated by Mexican-American parents whose children attend the elementary and secondary schools in the Edgewood Independent School District, an urban school district in San Antonio, Texas. They brought a class action on behalf of schoolchildren throughout the State who are members of minority groups or who are poor and reside in school districts having a low property tax base.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The first Texas State Constitution, promulgated upon Texas’ entry into the Union in 1845, provided for the establishment of a system of free schools. Early in its history, Texas adopted a dual approach to the financing of its schools, relying on mutual participation by the local school districts and the State.</p>
<p class="indent">Until recent times, Texas was a predominantly rural State and its population and property wealth were spread relatively evenly across the State. Sizable differences in the value of assessable property between local school districts became increasingly evident as the State became more industrialized and as rural-to-urban population shifts became more pronounced. The location of commercial and industrial property began to play a significant role in determining the amount of tax resources available to each school district. These growing disparities in population and taxable property between districts were responsible in part for increasingly notable differences in levels of local expenditure for education.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing the need for increased state funding to help offset disparities in local spending and to meet Texas’ changing educational requirements, the state legislature in 1947 [established] the Texas Minimum Foundation School</p>
<p><a id="page_152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>152</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Program. Today, this Program accounts for approximately half of the total educational expenditures in Texas.</p>
<p class="indent">The Program calls for state and local contributions to a fund earmarked specifically for teacher salaries, operating expenses, and transportation costs. The State, supplying funds from its general revenues, finances approximately 80% of the Program, and the school districts are responsible—as a unit—for providing the remaining 20%. The districts’ share, known as the Local Fund Assignment, is apportioned among the school districts under a formula designed to reflect each district’s relative taxpaying ability.</p>
<p class="indent">The school district in which appellees reside, the Edgewood Independent School District, has been compared throughout this litigation with the Alamo Heights Independent School District. This comparison between the least and most affluent districts in the San Antonio area serves to illustrate the manner in which the dual system of finance operates and to indicate the extent to which substantial disparities exist. Edgewood is one of seven public school districts in the metropolitan area. The district is situated in the core-city sector of San Antonio in a residential neighborhood that has little commercial or industrial property. The residents are predominantly of Mexican-American descent: approximately 90% of the student population is Mexican-American and over 6% is Negro. The average assessed property value per pupil is $5,960—the lowest in the metropolitan area—and the median family income ($4,686) is also the lowest. At an equalized tax rate of $1.05 per $100 of assessed property—the highest in the metropolitan area—the district contributed $26 to the education of each child for the 1967-1968 school year above its Local Fund Assignment for the Minimum Foundation Program. The Foundation Program contributed $222 per pupil for a state-local total of $248. Federal funds added another $108 for a total of $356 per pupil.</p>
<p class="indent">Alamo Heights is the most affluent school district in San Antonio in a residential community quite unlike the Edgewood District. The school population is predominantly “Anglo,” having only 18% Mexican-Americans and less than 1% Negroes. The assessed property value per pupil exceeds $49,000, and the median family income is $8,001. In 1967-1968 the local tax rate of $.85 per $100 of valuation yielded $333 per pupil over and above its contribution to the Foundation Program. Coupled with the $225 provided from that Program, the district was able to supply $558 per student. Supplemented by a $36 per-pupil grant from federal sources, Alamo Heights spent $594 per pupil.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite these recent increases [in state aid], substantial interdistrict disparities in school expenditures prevail in San Antonio and in varying degrees throughout the State still exist. And it was these disparities, largely attributable to differences in the amounts of money collected through local property taxation, that led the District Court to conclude that Texas’ dual system of public school financing violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p class="indent">We must decide, whether the Texas system of financing public education operates to the disadvantage of some suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution.</p>
<p><a id="page_153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>153</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The wealth discrimination discovered by the District Court in this case is quite unlike any of the forms of wealth discrimination heretofore reviewed by this Court. The individuals, or groups of individuals, who constituted the class discriminated against in our prior cases shared two distinguishing characteristics: because of their impecunity they were completely unable to pay for some desired benefit, and as a consequence, they sustained an absolute deprivation of a meaningful opportunity to enjoy that benefit. [For instance, the Court has struck down state laws that denied an indigent criminal defendant a trial transcript or an attorney on direct appeal, incarcerated indigents based on their inability to pay a fine, and barred candidates from running for office if they could not pay large filing fees. These cases involved absolute denials and none involved qualitative differences, for instance, in the counsel that the less wealthy might be able to secure.]</p>
<p class="indent">Even a cursory examination, however, demonstrates that neither of the two distinguishing characteristics of wealth classifications can be found here. First, in support of their charge that the system discriminates against the “poor,” appellees have made no effort to demonstrate that it operates to the peculiar disadvantage of any class fairly definable as indigent, or as composed of persons whose incomes are beneath any designated poverty level. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the poorest families are not necessarily clustered in the poorest property districts. A recent and exhaustive study of school districts in Connecticut concluded that “[i]t is clearly incorrect…to contend that the ‘poor’ live in ‘poor’ districts.…Defining ‘poor’ families as those below the Bureau of the Census ‘poverty level,’ ” the Connecticut study found, not surprisingly, that the poor were clustered around commercial and industrial areas—those same areas that provide the most attractive sources of property tax income for school districts. Whether a similar pattern would be discovered in Texas is not known, but there is no basis on the record in this case for assuming that the poorest people—defined by reference to any level of absolute impecunity—are concentrated in the poorest districts.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, neither appellees nor the District Court addressed the fact that, unlike each of the foregoing cases, lack of personal resources has not occasioned an absolute deprivation of the desired benefit. The argument here is not that the children in districts having relatively low assessable property values are receiving no public education; rather, it is that they are receiving a poorer quality education than that available to children in districts having more assessable wealth. Apart from the unsettled and disputed question whether the quality of education may be determined by the amount of money expended for it, a sufficient answer to appellees’ argument is that, at least where wealth is involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages. Nor indeed, in view of the infinite variables affecting the educational process, can any system assure equal quality of education except in the most relative sense. Texas asserts that the Minimum Foundation Program</p>
<p><a id="page_154" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>154</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">provides an “adequate” education for all children in the State. By providing 12 years of free public-school education, and by assuring teachers, books, transportation, and operating funds, the Texas Legislature has endeavored to “guarantee, for the welfare of the state as a whole, that all people shall have at least an adequate program of education. This is what is meant by ‘A Minimum Foundation Program of Education.’ ” The State repeatedly asserted in its briefs in this Court that it has fulfilled this desire and that it now assures “every child in every school district an adequate education.” No proof was offered at trial persuasively discrediting or refuting the State’s assertion.</p>
<p class="indent">For these two reasons—the absence of any evidence that the financing system discriminates against any definable category of “poor” people or that it results in the absolute deprivation of education—the disadvantaged class is not susceptible of identification in traditional terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees and the District Court may have embraced a second or third approach, the second of which might be characterized as a theory of relative or comparative discrimination based on family income. Appellees sought to prove that a direct correlation exists between the wealth of families within each district and the expenditures therein for education. That is, along a continuum, the poorer the family the lower the dollar amount of education received by the family’s children.</p>
<p class="indent">If, in fact, these correlations could be sustained, then it might be argued that expenditures on education—equated by appellees to the quality of education—are dependent on personal wealth. Appellees’ comparative-discrimination theory would still face serious unanswered questions, including whether a bare positive correlation or some higher degree of correlation is necessary to provide a basis for concluding that the financing system is designed to operate to the peculiar disadvantage of the comparatively poor, and whether a class of this size and diversity could ever claim the special protection accorded “suspect” classes. These questions need not be addressed in this case, however, since appellees’ proof fails to support their allegations or the District Court’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="indent">This brings us, then, to the third way in which the classification scheme might be defined—district wealth discrimination. Since the only correlation indicated by the evidence is between district property wealth and expenditures, it may be argued that discrimination might be found without regard to the individual income characteristics of district residents. Assuming a perfect correlation between district property wealth and expenditures from top to bottom, the disadvantaged class might be viewed as encompassing every child in every district except the district that has the most assessable wealth and spends the most on education. Alternatively, the class might be defined more restrictively to include children in districts with assessable property which falls below the statewide average, or median, or below some other artificially defined level.</p>
<p class="indent">However described, it is clear that appellees’ suit asks this Court to extend its most exacting scrutiny to review a system that allegedly discriminates against a large, diverse, and amorphous class, unified only by the common factor of residence in districts that happen to have less taxable wealth than other districts. The system of alleged discrimination and the class it defines have none of the traditional indicia of suspectness: the class is not saddled with such disabilities, or</p>
<p><a id="page_155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>155</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.</p>
<p class="indent">We thus conclude that the Texas system does not operate to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class. But in recognition of the fact that this Court has never heretofore held that wealth discrimination alone provides an adequate basis for invoking strict scrutiny, appellees have not relied solely on this contention. They also assert that the State’s system impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a “fundamental” right and that accordingly the prior decisions of this Court require the application of the strict standard of judicial review. It is this question—whether education is a fundamental right, in the sense that it is among the rights and liberties protected by the Constitution—which has so consumed the attention of courts and commentators in recent years.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, a unanimous Court recognized that “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.” What was said there in the context of racial discrimination has lost none of its vitality with the passage of time:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">This theme, expressing an abiding respect for the vital role of education in a free society, may be found in numerous opinions of Justices of this Court writing both before and after <i>Brown</i> was decided. Nothing this Court holds today in any way detracts from our historic dedication to public education. We are in complete agreement with the conclusion of the three-judge panel below that “the grave significance of education both to the individual and to our society” cannot be doubted. But the importance of a service performed by the State does not determine whether it must be regarded as fundamental for purposes of examination under the Equal Protection Clause. Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting from the Court’s application of strict scrutiny to a law impinging upon the right of interstate travel, admonished that “[v]irtually every state statute affects important rights.” In his view, if the degree of judicial scrutiny of state legislation fluctuated, depending on a majority’s view of the importance of the interest affected, we would have gone “far toward making this Court a ‘super-legislature.’ ” We would, indeed, then be assuming a legislative role and one for which the Court lacks both authority and competence.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not the province of this Court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws. Thus, the key to</p>
<p><a id="page_156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>156</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">discovering whether education is “fundamental” is not to be found in comparisons of the relative societal significance of education as opposed to subsistence or housing. Nor is it to be found by weighing whether education is as important as the right to travel. Rather, the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right to education explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Education, of course, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected. As we have said, the undisputed importance of education will not alone cause this Court to depart from the usual standard for reviewing a State’s social and economic legislation. It is appellees’ contention, however, that education is distinguishable from other services and benefits provided by the State because it bears a peculiarly close relationship to other rights and liberties accorded protection under the Constitution. Specifically, they insist that education is itself a fundamental personal right because it is essential to the effective exercise of First Amendment freedoms and to intelligent utilization of the right to vote. In asserting a nexus between speech and education, appellees urge that the right to speak is meaningless unless the speaker is capable of articulating his thoughts intelligently and persuasively. The “marketplace of ideas” is an empty forum for those lacking basic communicative tools. Likewise, they argue that the corollary right to receive information becomes little more than a hollow privilege when the recipient has not been taught to read, assimilate, and utilize available knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">A similar line of reasoning is pursued with respect to the right to vote. Exercise of the franchise, it is contended, cannot be divorced from the educational foundation of the voter. The electoral process, if reality is to conform to the democratic ideal, depends on an informed electorate: a voter cannot cast his ballot intelligently unless his reading skills and thought processes have been adequately developed.</p>
<p class="indent">We need not dispute any of these propositions. The Court has long afforded zealous protection against unjustifiable governmental interference with the individual’s rights to speak and to vote. Yet we have never presumed to possess either the ability or the authority to guarantee to the citizenry the most effective speech or the most informed electoral choice. That these may be desirable goals of a system of freedom of expression and of a representative form of government is not to be doubted. These are indeed goals to be pursued by a people whose thoughts and beliefs are freed from governmental interference. But they are not values to be implemented by judicial instruction into otherwise legitimate state activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of either right, we have no indication that the present levels of educational expenditures in Texas provide an education that falls short. Whatever merit appellees’ argument might have if a State’s financing system occasioned an absolute denial of educational opportunities to any of its children, that argument provides no basis for finding an interference with fundamental rights where only relative differences in spending levels are involved and where—as is true in the present case—no charge fairly could be made that the system fails to provide each child with an</p>
<p><a id="page_157" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>157</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full participation in the political process.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, the logical limitations on appellees’ nexus theory are difficult to perceive. How, for instance, is education to be distinguished from the significant personal interests in the basics of decent food and shelter? Empirical examination might well buttress an assumption that the ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed are among the most ineffective participants in the political process, and that they derive the least enjoyment from the benefits of the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="indent">We have carefully considered each of the arguments supportive of the District Court’s finding that education is a fundamental right or liberty and have found those arguments unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">We need not rest our decision, however, solely on the inappropriateness of the strict-scrutiny test. A century of Supreme Court adjudication under the Equal Protection Clause affirmatively supports the application of the traditional standard of review, which requires only that the State’s system be shown to bear some rational relationship to legitimate state purposes. This case represents far more than a challenge to the manner in which Texas provides for the education of its children. We have here nothing less than a direct attack on the way in which Texas has chosen to raise and disburse state and local tax revenues. We are asked to condemn the State’s judgment in conferring on political subdivisions the power to tax local property to supply revenues for local interests. In so doing, appellees would have the Court intrude in an area in which it has traditionally deferred to state legislatures. This Court has often admonished against such interferences with the State’s fiscal policies under the Equal Protection Clause[.]</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, we stand on familiar grounds when we continue to acknowledge that the Justices of this Court lack both the expertise and the familiarity with local problems so necessary to the making of wise decisions with respect to the raising and disposition of public revenues. Yet, we are urged to direct the States either to alter drastically the present system or to throw out the property tax altogether in favor of some other form of taxation. No scheme of taxation, whether the tax is imposed on property, income, or purchases of goods and services, has yet been devised which is free of all discriminatory impact. In such a complex arena in which no perfect alternatives exist, the Court does well not to impose too rigorous a standard of scrutiny lest all local fiscal schemes become subjects of criticism under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to matters of fiscal policy, this case also involves the most persistent and difficult questions of educational policy, another area in which this Court’s lack of specialized knowledge and experience counsels against premature interference with the informed judgments made at the state and local levels. Education presents a myriad of “intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems.” The very complexity of the problems of financing and managing a statewide public school system suggests that “there will be more than one constitutionally permissible method of solving them,” and that, within</p>
<p><a id="page_158" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>158</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the limits of rationality, “the legislature’s efforts to tackle the problems” should be entitled to respect. On even the most basic questions in this area, the scholars and educational experts are divided. Indeed, one of the major sources of controversy concerns the extent to which there is a demonstrable correlation between educational expenditures and the quality of education—an assumed correlation underlying virtually every legal conclusion drawn by the District Court in this case. Related to the questioned relationship between cost and quality is the equally unsettled controversy as to the proper goals of a system of public education. And the question regarding the most effective relationship between state boards of education and local school boards, in terms of their respective responsibilities and degrees of control, is now undergoing searching re-examination. The ultimate wisdom as to these and related problems of education is not likely to be divined for all time even by the scholars who now so earnestly debate the issues. In such circumstances, the judiciary is well advised to refrain from imposing on the States inflexible constitutional restraints that could circumscribe or handicap the continued research and experimentation so vital to finding even partial solutions to educational problems and to keeping abreast of ever-changing conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">It must be remembered, also, that every claim arising under the Equal Protection Clause has implications for the relationship between national and state power under our federal system. Questions of federalism are always inherent in the process of determining whether a State’s laws are to be accorded the traditional presumption of constitutionality, or are to be subjected instead to rigorous judicial scrutiny. While “[t]he maintenance of the principles of federalism is a foremost consideration in interpreting any of the pertinent constitutional provisions under which this Court examines state action,” it would be difficult to imagine a case having a greater potential impact on our federal system than the one now before us, in which we are urged to abrogate systems of financing public education presently in existence in virtually every State.</p>
<p class="indent">The foregoing considerations buttress our conclusion that Texas’ system of public school finance is an inappropriate candidate for strict judicial scrutiny. These same considerations are relevant to the determination whether that system, with its conceded imperfections, nevertheless bears some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. It is to this question that we next turn our attention.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">Because of differences in expenditure levels occasioned by disparities in property tax income, appellees claim that children in less affluent districts have been made the subject of invidious discrimination. The District Court found that the State had failed even “to establish a reasonable basis” for a system that results in different levels of per-pupil expenditure. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">In its reliance on state as well as local resources, the Texas system is comparable to the systems employed in virtually every other State. The power to tax</p>
<p><a id="page_159" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>159</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">local property for educational purposes has been recognized in Texas at least since 1883. When the growth of commercial and industrial centers and accompanying shifts in population began to create disparities in local resources, Texas undertook a program calling for a considerable investment of state funds.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees do not question the propriety of Texas’ dedication to local control of education. To the contrary, they attack the school-financing system precisely because, in their view, it does not provide the same level of local control and fiscal flexibility in all districts. Appellees suggest that local control could be preserved and promoted under other financing systems that resulted in more equality in education expenditures. While it is no doubt true that reliance on local property taxation for school revenues provides less freedom of choice with respect to expenditures for some districts than for others, the existence of “some inequality” in the manner in which the State’s rationale is achieved is not alone a sufficient basis for striking down the entire system. It may not be condemned simply because it imperfectly effectuates the State’s goals. Nor must the financing system fail because, as appellees suggest, other methods of satisfying the State’s interest, which occasion “less drastic” disparities in expenditures, might be conceived. Only where state action impinges on the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights or liberties must it be found to have chosen the least restrictive alternative. It is also well to remember that even those districts that have reduced ability to make free decisions with respect to how much they spend on education still retain under the present system a large measure of authority as to how available funds will be allocated. They further enjoy the power to make numerous other decisions with respect to the operation of the schools. The people of Texas may be justified in believing that other systems of school financing, which place more of the financial responsibility in the hands of the State, will result in a comparable lessening of desired local autonomy. That is, they may believe that along with increased control of the purse strings at the state level will go increased control over local policies.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees further urge that the Texas system is unconstitutionally arbitrary because it allows the availability of local taxable resources to turn on “happenstance.” They see no justification for a system that allows, as they contend, the quality of education to fluctuate on the basis of the fortuitous positioning of the boundary lines of political subdivisions and the location of valuable commercial and industrial property. But any scheme of local taxation—indeed the very existence of identifiable local governmental units—requires the establishment of jurisdictional boundaries that are inevitably arbitrary. It is equally inevitable that some localities are going to be blessed with more taxable assets than others. Nor is local wealth a static quantity. Changes in the level of taxable wealth within any district may result from any number of events, some of which local residents can and do influence. For instance, commercial and industrial enterprises may be encouraged to locate within a district by various actions—public and private.</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, if local taxation for local expenditures were an unconstitutional method of providing for education then it might be an equally impermissible means of providing other necessary services customarily financed largely from</p>
<p><a id="page_160" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>160</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">local property taxes, including local police and fire protection, public health and hospitals, and public utility facilities of various kinds. We perceive no justification for such a severe denigration of local property taxation and control as would follow from appellees’ contentions. It has simply never been within the constitutional prerogative of this Court to nullify statewide measures for financing public services merely because the burdens or benefits thereof fall unevenly depending upon the relative wealth of the political subdivisions in which citizens live.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, to the extent that the Texas system of school financing results in unequal expenditures between children who happen to reside in different districts, we cannot say that such disparities are the product of a system that is so irrational as to be invidiously discriminatory. Texas has acknowledged its shortcomings and has persistently endeavored—not without some success—to ameliorate the differences in levels of expenditures without sacrificing the benefits of local participation. The Texas plan is not the result of hurried, ill-conceived legislation. It certainly is not the product of purposeful discrimination against any group or class. One also must remember that the system here challenged is not peculiar to Texas or to any other State. In its essential characteristics, the Texas plan for financing public education reflects what many educators for a half century have thought was an enlightened approach to a problem for which there is no perfect solution. We are unwilling to assume for ourselves a level of wisdom superior to that of legislators, scholars, and educational authorities in 50 States, especially where the alternatives proposed are only recently conceived and nowhere yet tested. The constitutional standard under the Equal Protection Clause is whether the challenged state action rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose or interest. We hold that the Texas plan abundantly satisfies this standard.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Court acknowledges that “substantial interdistrict disparities in school expenditures” exist in Texas, and that these disparities are “largely attributable to differences in the amounts of money collected through local property taxation.” But instead of closely examining the seriousness of these disparities and the invidiousness of the Texas financing scheme, the Court undertakes an elaborate exploration of the efforts Texas has purportedly made to close the gaps between its districts in terms of levels of district wealth and resulting educational funding. Yet, however praiseworthy Texas’ equalizing efforts, the issue in this case is not whether Texas is doing its best to ameliorate the worst features of a discriminatory scheme but, rather, whether the scheme itself is in fact unconstitutionally discriminatory in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. When the Texas financing scheme is taken as a whole, I do not think it can be doubted that it produces a discriminatory impact on substantial numbers of the school age children of the State of Texas.</p>
<p><a id="page_161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>161</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Court apparently seeks to establish today that equal protection cases fall into one of two neat categories which dictate the appropriate standard of review—strict scrutiny or mere rationality. But this Court’s decisions in the field of equal protection defy such easy categorization. A principled reading of what this Court has done reveals that it has applied a spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination allegedly violative of the Equal Protection Clause. This spectrum clearly comprehends variations in the degree of care with which the Court will scrutinize particular classifications, depending, I believe, on the constitutional and societal importance of the interest adversely affected and the recognized invidiousness of the basis upon which the particular classification is drawn. I find in fact that many of the Court’s recent decisions embody the very sort of reasoned approach to equal protection analysis for which I previously argued—that is, an approach in which “concentration [is] placed upon the character of the classification in question, the relative importance to individuals in the class discriminated against of the governmental benefits that they do not receive, and the asserted state interests in support of the classification.”</p>
<p class="indent">I therefore cannot accept the majority’s labored efforts to demonstrate that fundamental interests, which call for strict scrutiny of the challenged classification, encompass only established rights which we are somehow bound to recognize from the text of the Constitution itself. To be sure, some interests which the Court has deemed to be fundamental for purposes of equal protection analysis are themselves constitutionally protected rights. Thus, discrimination against the guaranteed right of freedom of speech has called for strict judicial scrutiny. Further, every citizen’s right to travel interstate, although nowhere expressly mentioned in the Constitution, has long been recognized as implicit in the premises underlying that document: the right “was conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the stronger Union the Constitution created.” But it will not do to suggest that the “answer” to whether an interest is fundamental for purposes of equal protection analysis is always determined by whether that interest “is a right…explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.”</p>
<p class="indent">I would like to know where the Constitution guarantees the right to procreate, or the right to vote in state elections, or the right to an appeal from a criminal conviction. These are instances in which, due to the importance of the interests at stake, the Court has displayed a strong concern with the existence of discriminatory state treatment. But the Court has never said or indicated that these are interests which independently enjoy fullblown constitutional protection.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority is, of course, correct when it suggests that the process of determining which interests are fundamental is a difficult one. But I do not think the problem is insurmountable. And I certainly do not accept the view that the process need necessarily degenerate into an unprincipled, subjective “picking-and-choosing” between various interests or that it must involve this Court in creating “substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing</p>
<p><a id="page_162" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>162</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">equal protection of the laws.” Although not all fundamental interests are constitutionally guaranteed, the determination of which interests are fundamental should be firmly rooted in the text of the Constitution. The task in every case should be to determine the extent to which constitutionally guaranteed rights are dependent on interests not mentioned in the Constitution. As the nexus between the specific constitutional guarantee and the nonconstitutional interest draws closer, the nonconstitutional interest becomes more fundamental and the degree of judicial scrutiny applied when the interest is infringed on a discriminatory basis must be adjusted accordingly. Thus, it cannot be denied that interests such as procreation, the exercise of the state franchise, and access to criminal appellate processes are not fully guaranteed to the citizen by our Constitution. But these interests have nonetheless been afforded special judicial consideration in the face of discrimination because they are, to some extent, interrelated with constitutional guarantees. Procreation is now understood to be important because of its interaction with the established constitutional right of privacy. The exercise of the state franchise is closely tied to basic civil and political rights inherent in the First Amendment. And access to criminal appellate processes enhances the integrity of the range of rights implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process of law. Only if we closely protect the related interests from state discrimination do we ultimately ensure the integrity of the constitutional guarantee itself. This is the real lesson that must be taken from our previous decisions involving interests deemed to be fundamental.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Since the Court now suggests that only interests guaranteed by the Constitution are fundamental for purposes of equal protection analysis, and since it rejects the contention that public education is fundamental, it follows that the Court concludes that public education is not constitutionally guaranteed. It is true that this Court has never deemed the provision of free public education to be required by the Constitution. Indeed, it has on occasion suggested that state-supported education is a privilege bestowed by a State on its citizens. Nevertheless, the fundamental importance of education is amply indicated by the prior decisions of this Court, by the unique status accorded public education by our society, and by the close relationship between education and some of our most basic constitutional values.</p>
<p class="indent">The special concern of this Court with the educational process of our country is a matter of common knowledge. Only last Term, the Court recognized that “[p]roviding public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State.” <i>Wisconsin v. Yoder</i>, 406 U.S. 205, 213 (1972). This is clearly borne out by the fact that in 48 of our 50 States the provision of public education is mandated by the state constitution. No other state function is so uniformly recognized as an essential element of our society’s well-being. In large measure, the explanation for the special importance attached to education must rest, as the Court recognized in <i>Yoder</i>, on the facts that “some degree of education is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system…,” and that “education prepares individuals to be self-reliant</p>
<p><a id="page_163" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>163</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and self-sufficient participants in society.” Both facets of this observation are suggestive of the substantial relationship which education bears to guarantees of our Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Education directly affects the ability of a child to exercise his First Amendment rights, both as a source and as a receiver of information and ideas, whatever interests he may pursue in life. The opportunity for formal education may not necessarily be the essential determinant of an individual’s ability to enjoy throughout his life the rights of free speech and association guaranteed to him by the First Amendment. But such an opportunity may enhance the individual’s enjoyment of those rights, not only during but also following school attendance. Thus, in the final analysis, “the pivotal position of education to success in American society and its essential role in opening up to the individual the central experiences of our culture lend it an importance that is undeniable.”</p>
<p class="indent">Of particular importance is the relationship between education and the political process. “Americans regard the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government.” Education serves the essential function of instilling in our young an understanding of and appreciation for the principles and operation of our governmental processes. Education may instill the interest and provide the tools necessary for political discourse and debate. Indeed, it has frequently been suggested that education is the dominant factor affecting political consciousness and participation. But of most immediate and direct concern must be the demonstrated effect of education on the exercise of the franchise by the electorate. The right to vote in federal elections is conferred by Art. 1, §2, and the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution, and access to the state franchise has been afforded special protection because it is “preservative of other basic civil and political rights.” Data from the Presidential Election of 1968 clearly demonstrate a direct relationship between participation in the electoral process and level of educational attainment. It is this very sort of intimate relationship between a particular personal interest and specific constitutional guarantees that has heretofore caused the Court to attach special significance, for purposes of equal protection analysis, to individual interests such as procreation and the exercise of the state franchise.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Plaintiffs assert two different theories of why the funding system in Texas violates their constitutional rights. What are they?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The Court distinguishes the deprivation in this case from the deprivations in cases where the Court has previously recognized a constitutional violation regarding access to an attorney, transcripts for criminal appeals, and the ability to run for public office. In what way does the Court indicate the deprivation of education is distinct from these other rights? Is the Court persuasive?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Court refuses to recognize education as a fundamental right. Why? What counterarguments do the dissenters offer? If education were a fundamental right, is there any basis to distinguish it from other important rights</p>
<p><a id="page_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>164</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that the state extends to citizens? Does the majority leave open the possibility that some other right to education exists?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Why does the Court reject the idea that the poor constitute a suspect class? Does Texas’s finance scheme discriminate against the poor?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The Court has held that voting is a fundamental right under equal protection, but not substantive due process. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Harper v. Virginia, 383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966). In effect, this means that the Constitution does not per se guarantee the right to vote, but once the state extends the right to vote, any inequities are subject to strict scrutiny. Is there any reason to permit the state to treat citizens differently in regard to education, but not voting?</p>
<p class="indent">Distinguishing between fundamental rights under substantive due process and fundamental rights under equal protection can be difficult. The simplest explanation is that due process fundamental rights refer to those rights we possess without government granting them to us. One might think of them as inalienable rights (although they are not limited to those rights) such as the freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and the right to life. The government does not give us these rights, and because they are fundamental, the government cannot take them away from anyone or infringe on them without being subject to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, fundamental rights under equal protection are not freestanding inalienable rights. The idea is that, although the government may not be obliged to extend citizens a particular benefit, some benefits are so important that the government should not be permitted to treat citizens unequally once it extends the benefit. For instance, federal law does not require state governments to afford their citizens the right to vote in various state and local elections. Thus, the state would presumably be free to withdraw the right to vote for local school board members and instead permit mayors to appoint them. But when the state affords the right to vote in local school board elections, it must treat everyone equal in the voting process. Kramer v. Union Free School Dist. No. 15, 395 U.S. 621 (1969). Inequalities and infringements are subject to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p class="indent">If a fundamental right exists under substantive due process, a violation occurs when any single person’s right is infringed, whereas if a right is only fundamental under equal protection, a violation typically occurs only if a group of individuals is treated differently.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Because education is not a fundamental right, the Court applies rational basis scrutiny to the educational inequalities. Was the Court’s application of rational basis review too deferential? Is there a plausible argument that Texas’s funding scheme does not even pass rational basis review? In a subsequent case, the Court applied a more rigorous version of rational basis to another form of discrimination in education. <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, 457 U.S. 202 (1982) (striking down the denial of education to undocumented immigrants because the state’s objectives and means were irrational). Some state courts have held that their state finance systems do not pass rational basis. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Tenn. Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 851 S.W.2d 139 (Tenn. 1993); Bingham v. State, 692 A.2d 384 (Vt. 1997).</p>
<p class="indent">7. The Court in <i>Rodriguez</i> frames the case as a choice between strict scrutiny and rational basis. Justice Marshall advocates a different approach. Is his approach preferable? Does Marshall’s approach pose another set of problems?</p>
<p><a id="page_165" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>165</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Under his approach, what level of scrutiny would have applied to these educational inequalities?</p>
<p class="indent">8. Are the Court’s federalism concerns valid? Were the concerns with local autonomy any less pressing in regard to desegregation?</p>
<p class="indent">9. To what extent, if any, should it matter whether differences in school funding can be demonstrated to have an impact on educational quality or student outcomes? Is it enough that money differentials will affect the resources available for school facilities, specialized educational programs, and teacher recruitment? The Court in <i>Rodriguez</i> indicated that “[o]n even the most basic questions in this area the scholars and educational experts are divided. Indeed, one of the major sources of controversy concerns the extent to which there is a demonstrable correlation between educational expenditures and the quality of education.” 411 U.S. at 42-43. The Court further indicated that the lower court had incorrectly “assumed [a] correlation [in] virtually every legal conclusion” it drew regarding money. <i>Id.</i> at 43. As you will see, this question continually resurfaces in state courts, many of which disagree with the Court’s conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">10. The Court’s opinion in <i>Rodriguez</i> did not end the litigation over Texas’s school finance system. Challenges to the state’s finance system had reached the Texas Supreme Court six times as of 2012. In 1989, the court held that inequities in the finance system violated the education clause of the state constitution. Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 777 S.W.2d 391 (Tex. 1989). In 1991 and 1992, the court held the state’s revisions to its finance system were insufficient. Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 804 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. 1991) (<i>Edgewood II</i>); Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 826 S.W.2d 489 (Tex. 1992) (<i>Edgewood III</i>). Finally, in 1995, the court upheld the state’s new finance scheme. Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 893 S.W.2d 450 (Tex. 1995) (<i>Edgewood IV</i>).</p>
<p class="indent">The state’s new finance scheme recaptured funds from wealthier school districts and redistributed them to property-poor districts. This led to a legal challenge by wealthy districts in 2001. The case made it to the Texas Supreme Court again in <i>West Orange-Cove Consolidated ISD v. Nelson</i>, 107 S.W.3d 558 (Tex. 2003). The court permitted the challenge to move forward and remanded the case for trial. Poor districts intervened in the case, and, at trial, the issues reverted back to those relating to inadequacy in poor districts. The trial court found that the finance system had again become inadequate and inefficient. On appeal, the supreme court rejected most of the trial court’s findings, but still declared the state’s tax scheme unconstitutional. West Orange-Cove Consol. ISD v. Neeley, 176 S.W.3d 746 (Tex. 2005).</p>
<p class="indent">The particular theories by which plaintiffs pursue claims under state law are further explored later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch63">2. <i>Rationality and Minimally Adequate Education</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Rodriguez</i> is generally understood in regard to what it appeared to rule out—education as a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution. Rarely emphasized is the fact that <i>Rodriguez</i> left other questions open. First, the Court in <i>Rodriguez</i> suggested that the outcome may have been different had the state</p>
<p><a id="page_166" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>166</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">failed to deliver a minimally adequate education, 411 U.S. at 37, leaving open the question of whether there is a federal fundamental right to a minimally adequate education. Daniel S. Greenspahn, <i>A Constitutional Right to Learn: The Uncertain Allure of Making a Federal Case out of Education</i>, 59 <span class="smallcap">S.C. L. Rev</span>. 755, 768-770 (2008). The Court in <i>Papasan v. Allain</i>, 478 U.S. 265 (1986), later returned to this point and emphasized its importance. The <i>Papasan</i> Court explained that the <i>Rodriguez</i> Court had</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">declined to apply any heightened scrutiny based either on wealth as a suspect classification or on education as a fundamental right. As to the latter, the Court recognized the importance of public education but noted that education “is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution.” The Court did not, however, foreclose the possibility “that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of either [the right to speak or the right to vote].” Given the absence of such radical denial of educational opportunity, it was concluded that the State’s school financing scheme would be constitutional if it bore “some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.”</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 283-284.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court in <i>Papasan</i> then emphasized the relevance of this narrow holding to facts presented in other cases that followed <i>Rodriguez</i>, including the facts in <i>Papasan</i>. The Court wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent">Almost 10 years [after <i>Rodriguez</i>], the Court again considered the equal protection status of the administration of the Texas public schools—this time in relation to the State’s decision not to expend any state funds on the education of children who were not “legally admitted” to the United States. <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). The Court did not, however, measurably change the approach articulated in <i>Rodriguez</i>. It reiterated that education is not a fundamental right and concluded that undocumented aliens were not a suspect class. Nevertheless, it concluded that the justifications for the discrimination offered by the State were “wholly insubstantial in light of the costs involved to these children, the State, and the Nation.”</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint in this case asserted not simply that the petitioners had been denied their right to a minimally adequate education but also that such a right was fundamental and that because that right had been infringed the State’s action here should be reviewed under strict scrutiny. As <i>Rodriguez</i> and <i>Plyler</i> indicate, this Court has not yet definitively settled the questions whether a minimally adequate education is a fundamental right and whether a statute alleged to discriminatorily infringe that right should be accorded heightened equal protection review.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">478 U.S. at 285. The Court in <i>Papasan</i> did not resolve these questions either. It found those questions unnecessary to decide the specific case before it.</p>
<p class="indent">The additional question left open by <i>Rodriguez</i> was whether some financing systems or educational policies might be so discriminatory or flawed that they would not pass rational basis review. The Court’s approach in <i>Rodriguez</i> was so deferential that it appeared to leave little room for subsequent courts to meaningfully scrutinize educational inequities. Thus, the Court’s more rigorous application of rational basis in <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), came as somewhat of a surprise. Rather than a challenge to school finance, <i>Plyler</i> involved a challenge to a Texas statute that permitted public schools to deny undocumented immigrants education. Because immigrants are not a suspect class for purposes of</p>
<p><a id="page_167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>167</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">equal protection and the Court in <i>Rodriguez</i> held that education is not a fundamental right, the Court in <i>Plyler</i> applied rational basis review to the denial of education. The Court recognized that “[i]n applying the Equal Protection Clause to most forms of state action, we…seek only the assurance that the classification at issue bears some fair relationship to a legitimate public purpose.” <i>Id.</i> at 216. But the Court added that “we would not be faithful to our obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment if we applied so deferential a standard to every classification.” <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The Court offered two reasons for a less deferential form of rational basis review in <i>Plyler</i>. First, “certain forms of legislative classification, while not facially invidious, nonetheless give rise to recurring constitutional difficulties.” <i>Id.</i> at 217. The Court found that even though undocumented immigrants are not a suspect class, the Texas statute would create a stigmatized underclass by excluding these children from school. Second, “[p]ublic education is not a ‘right’ granted to individuals by the Constitution. But neither is it merely some governmental ‘benefit’ indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation.…[Education plays a] pivotal role…in sustaining our political and cultural heritage [and] denial of education to some isolated group of children poses an affront to one of the goals of the Equal Protection Clause: the abolition of governmental barriers presenting unreasonable obstacles to advancement on the basis of individual merit.” <i>Id.</i> at 221-222. Based on the intersection of class-based discrimination and the denial of a right as important as education, the Court indicated that “we may appropriately take into account [the statute’s] costs to the Nation and to the innocent children who are its victims. In light of these countervailing costs, the discrimination contained in [the statute] can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State.” <i>Id.</i> at 223. The Court then went on to find that the state’s arguments that it was attempting to conserve education resources, to protect itself from an influx of immigrants, and to focus its resources on students who would remain in the state were all irrational, reasoning that the statute was an ineffective way to achieve the state’s objectives and its premises were flawed. The dissent argued that, regardless of whether this statute was the most effective or wise, it easily passes rational basis review, and no precedent exists for a more rigorous version of rational basis review. Regardless, the dissent’s critique tends to reinforce that the Court could and would apply a more rigorous review to some inequalities, and, thus, <i>Rodriguez</i> did not establish an absolute ceiling.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Does the Court’s holding in <i>Plyler</i> represent the vindication of Justice Marshall’s dissent in <i>Rodriguez</i>? Or is it an example of the Court stretching the law to reach a desired result?</p>
<p class="indent">2. A few years after <i>Plyler</i>, the Court again faced the constitutionality of educational inequity in <i>Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools</i>, 487 U.S. 450 (1988). The dispute in <i>Kadrmas</i> involved a state statute that permitted school districts to</p>
<p><a id="page_168" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>168</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">charge students a user fee for bus transportation. The plaintiff argued that heightened scrutiny should apply under equal protection because of the effects the statute would have on poor students. The Supreme Court rejected this argument and applied rational basis review. Consistent with <i>Rodriguez</i>, the Court held that socioeconomic status is not a suspect class nor is education a fundamental right. The Court did, however, recognize the need to distinguish the facts before it from those in <i>Plyler</i>, indicating the bus fee will not “promot[e] the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment welfare, and crime.” <i>Id.</i> at 459. The Court reasoned that the statute’s goal was to encourage districts to provide transportation that they otherwise had no obligation to provide. Allowing them to charge fees is a rational means to achieve that goal. <i>Id.</i> at 462. Given that <i>Kadrmas</i> involved ancillary education benefits, rather than education itself, what precedential value would it have in a case involving a denial of substantive educational benefits?</p>
<p class="indent">3. With the apparent legal blessing of <i>Kadrmas</i>, school districts have increasingly charged students fees for various aspects of school, including supplemental instructional materials, extracurricular fees, and science and art class supplies. Because there are so many aspects of school that entail fees now, some schools have instituted general registration fees that can amount to several hundred dollars.

<p class="h7" id="ch64">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The structure and regulation of public schools have changed enormously since <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i>. Assume you are in a state that now, rather than leave matters to local discretion, sets the standard course of study for its public schools, establishes the learning objectives and specific items of knowledge students should obtain, and assesses students annually through standardized exams, which students must pass for promotion to the next grade and graduation. The state similarly regulates teacher certification and quality standards. In addition, the funding of schools has changed. The state now provides around 75 percent of most districts’ budgets. Another 10 percent comes from the federal government in exchange for the state’s consent to extensive federal regulation of schools. Ten years ago, the state supreme court held that the state constitution guarantees students the right to a quality education and that all students must have equal access to it, but in subsequent years, the state courts have encountered problems enforcing this right and prompting effective action by the legislature.</p>
<p class="indent">You represent students from one of the lowest performing and poorest school districts in the state. They want to bring a claim in federal court, which might eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. What, if any arguments, would you make that <i>Rodriguez</i> should be reconsidered?</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch65">B. STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</p>
<p class="noindent">A number of scholars have divided school finance litigation into what they call “three waves of litigation,” and some have suggested that a fourth wave began a few years after the turn of the century. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Michael Heise, <i>The Political Economy of Education Federalism</i>, 56 <span class="smallcap">Emory L.J</span>. 125, 132-133 (2006); William E. Thro, <i>The Third Wave: The Impact of the Montana, Kentucky and Texas Decisions on the Future of Public School Finance Reform Litigation</i>, 19 <span class="smallcap">J.L. &amp; Educ</span>. 219, 239-242 (1990); Julie K. Underwood, <i>School Finance Adequacy as Vertical Equity</i>, 28 <span class="smallcap">U. Mich. J.L. Reform</span> 493, 498-502 (1995). This section of the chapter organizes itself around the categorical theories and remedies pursued in school finance rather than waves of litigation, but a basic explanation of the waves is helpful in understanding the history of school finance, regardless of their value in regard to any particular current claims.</p>
<p class="indent">The first wave of litigation involved a series of court challenges in state and federal courts, and included <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i>. As demonstrated in <i>Rodriguez</i>, the legal theory in this first wave of litigation was that school district inequities that stem from relying on local property tax to fund education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The goal of this litigation was to produce “equity,” which meant an equal amount of funding for each student. Before the Court issued its opinion in <i>Rodriguez</i>, the California Supreme Court in <i>Serrano v. Priest</i>, 487 P.2d 1241, 1258 (Cal. 1971), found that education was a fundamental right, relying on both federal and state law. Thus, funding inequities in the state were unconstitutional. But the Court’s holding in <i>Rodriguez</i> undercut the California Supreme Court’s rationale and forestalled other similar federal theories that were part of this first wave.</p>
<p class="indent">By discouraging further school finance litigation in federal court, <i>Rodriguez</i> set off a second wave of litigation in state courts, some of which was already under way. When the Court issued its decision in <i>Rodriguez</i>, the New Jersey Supreme Court had written, but not issued, its opinion in <i>Robinson v. Cahill</i>, 303 A.2d 273 (N.J. 1973), on whether funding inequities violate its state constitution. The litigants in <i>Serrano</i> also returned to the California Supreme Court a second time to argue that, even if the funding inequities in the state did not violate the U.S. Constitution, they violated the state constitution. Both the New Jersey and California supreme courts held that their state constitutions provided greater protection for education than the U.S. Constitution and that education was a fundamental right under state law. Serrano v. Priest, 557 P.2d 929, 951 (Cal. 1976) (<i>Serrano II</i>); <i>Robinson</i>, 303 A.2d at 291-292, 295. Courts in Arkansas, Connecticut, Washington, and Wyoming shortly thereafter also found a fundamental right to education in their state constitutions, thereby furthering advocates’ ability to promote equitable financing of public schools. Dupree v. Alma Sch. Dist. No. 30, 651 S.W.2d 90, 93 (Ark. 1983); Horton v. Meskill, 376 A.2d 359 (Conn. 1977); Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. State, 585 P.2d 71 (Wash. 1978); Washakie Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Herschler, 606 P.2d 310 (Wyo. 1980).</p>
<p class="indent">The obvious question is why funding inequities would violate a state constitution but not the U.S. Constitution. The answer is twofold. First, state</p>
<p><a id="page_170" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>170</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">constitutions have their own equal protection clauses, which were largely untested. Prior to school finance litigation, many states applied their equal protection clauses as no more than a font of federal equal protection, but others held that their respective equal protection clauses had independent meaning based on their unique history and intent. Second and most important, unlike the U.S. Constitution, all state constitutions guarantee a right to education in some way. All 50 state constitutions explicitly mention or guarantee education through an education clause. Many of these clauses date back to the Civil War and Reconstruction period when state constitutions were redrafted and education was one of the pressing public needs for a modernizing country. <i>See generally</i> John C. Eastman, <i>When Did Education Become a Civil Right? An Assessment of State Constitutional Provisions for Education 1776-1900</i>, 42 <span class="smallcap">Am. J. Legal Hist</span>. 1 (1998) (describing the various state constitutional developments and amendments relating to education during the period leading up to and following the Civil War). Until relatively recently, Mississippi was the only state without an education clause, but in the 1980s its state supreme court indicated that education was nonetheless a fundamental right under the due process clause of its constitution. Board of Trs. v. T.H., III, 681 So. 2d 110, 114 (Miss. 1996); Clinton v. Byrd, 277 So. 2d 237, 240 (Miss. 1985). Shortly thereafter, the state amended its constitution to include an explicit education obligation. Miss. Const. Art. VII, §201.</p>
<p class="indent">This second wave of litigation is distinguished from the first largely in terms of its success and reliance on state constitutions, but its underlying concept of equity was effectively the same as in the first wave. The notion that equal expenditures were insufficient to provide equal opportunity for all districts and students, however, began to develop during this period. A few plaintiffs successfully argued that state equal protection and education clauses also include a substantive component. <i>See generally</i> Underwood, <i>supra</i>, at 511-513. This concept of equity recognizes that some students, based on their place of residence, socioeconomic status, or disability, have greater learning needs than others and, therefore, may need greater educational resources than other students, depending on their unique circumstances or need.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs in the second wave of litigation achieved mixed success in the courts. As a practical matter, addressing the unique needs of individual students, while also attempting to equalize spending among districts, was challenging. First, even if equalized funding could be accomplished, this alone would not ensure equal educational opportunities, which was the real purpose of most litigation. Peter Enrich, <i>Leaving Equality Behind: New Directions in School Finance Reform</i>, 48 <span class="smallcap">Vand. L. Rev</span>. 101, 147 (1995); Liz Kramer, <i>Achieving Equitable Education Through the Courts: A Comparative Analysis of Three States</i>, 31 <span class="smallcap">J.L. &amp; Educ</span>. 1, 3 (2001). Second, public opposition arose to the concept of strict equity because it required shifting funds away from some districts to others. Douglas S. Reed, <i>Twenty-Five Years after</i> Rodriguez: <i>School Finance Litigation and the Impact of the New Judicial Federalism</i>, 32 <span class="smallcap">Law &amp; Soc’y Rev</span>. 175 (1998). Some have argued that the requirement of strict equity diminished the local incentive to support education that otherwise would have existed in wealthy districts, leading to an overall reduction rather than increase in school funding. Molly McUsic, <i>The</i></p>
<p><a id="page_171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>171</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Law’s Role in Distribution of Education: The Promises and Pitfalls of School Finance Litigation</i>, <i>in</i> <span class="smallcap">Law and School Reform: Six Strategies for Promoting Educational Equity</span> 88, 114 (Jay P. Heubert ed., 1999). Others dispute this point. Kramer, <i>supra</i>, at 7-8 (citing Sheila A. Murray et al., <i>Education-Finance Reform and the Distribution of Education Resources</i>, 88 <span class="smallcap">Am. Econ. Rev</span>. 791, 807 (1998)). Regardless, facing the practical difficulty of equalizing funding and realizing the possible limitations of traditional equity litigation in state courts, some plaintiffs shifted toward a third strategy premised on educational quality.</p>
<p class="indent">The third wave of finance litigation was intertwined with the national movement toward standards-based education. In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education published a report titled <i>A Nation at Risk</i>. This and other subsequent reports warned of a “rising tide of mediocrity” in American education and fueled the notion that the country was suffering a national “crisis in education.” <i>See generally</i> Susan H. Bitensky, <i>Theoretical Foundations for a Right to Education under the U.S. Constitution: A Beginning to the End of the National Education Crisis</i>, 86 <span class="smallcap">Nw. U. L. Rev</span>. 550, 555-562 (1992). Central to this claim were statistics indicating that America’s children were falling behind their counterparts in other industrialized nations. In 1989, President Bush called a National Education Summit with the states’ governors to address the problems in America’s schools. Joetta L. Sack, <i>The End of an Education Presidency</i>, <span class="smallcap">Educ. Wk.</span>, Jan. 17, 2001. The “standards-based reform” movement, which demanded that states set high academic standards in core subject areas, grew out of these events and concerns.</p>
<p class="indent">The national concern over educational quality and content presented an opening for school finance litigants to capitalize on those aspects of state educational clauses that reference some substantive concept of education. Prior litigation had used the fact that state constitutions explicitly guarantee education to argue that education was a fundamental right or required heightened equal protection scrutiny. The third wave of litigation, in contrast, focused not just on the fact that education was specifically protected, but that various state constitutions described education in a way that suggested a qualitative guarantee. For instance, various state constitutions indicate that the state must deliver “efficient,” “thorough,” or “sound basic” education.</p>
<p class="indent">Focusing squarely on these qualitative descriptions, litigants sought to establish state constitutional rights to what is commonly called an “adequate” education. Adequacy cases are premised on the theory that the state has a duty to supply students with an education that allows them to meet particular substantive standards, graduate, and pursue higher education or employment. Plaintiffs seek to establish that students are not obtaining an adequate education with evidence that students are failing to meet standards as measured by results on standardized tests and other indicators of educational success.</p>
<p class="indent">The earliest court opinions fleshed out an adequate education in the broadest terms, defining it as an education that equips students to be citizens or participants in the job market. Vague definitions of this sort proved largely unsuccessful in substantively improving educational systems because it was nearly impossible to measure whether the state was meeting the standard. But, in 1989, in <i>Rose v. Council for Better Education</i>, 790 S.W.2d 186 (Ky. 1989),</p>
<p><a id="page_172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>172</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the Kentucky Supreme Court took a different approach by delving deep into the meaning of an adequate education. The court held that a constitutionally adequate or “efficient” education included several specific competencies: “sufficient oral and written skills to enable students to function in…civilization; sufficient knowledge of economic, social and political systems to enable the student to make informed decisions; sufficient understanding of governmental processes to enable the student to understand the issues that affect his or her…nation; self-knowledge of mental and physical wellness; art and culture appreciation; and preparation for higher learning in either academics or a vocation.” <i>Id.</i> at 212.</p>
<p class="indent">Several states followed Kentucky’s lead and prescriptively established what is meant by analogous language in their own constitutions. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Alabama Opinion of the Justice, 624 So. 2d 107, 165-166 (Ala. 1993); Idaho Schs. for Equal Educ. Opportunity v. Evans, 850 P.2d 724, 734 (Idaho 1993); McDuffy v. Secretary, 615 N.E.2d 516, 554 (Mass. 1993); Claremont Sch. Dist. v. Governor, 703 A.2d 1353, 1359 (N.H. 1997); Leandro v. State, 488 S.E.2d 249, 255 (N.C. 1997); Abbeville Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State, 515 S.E.2d 535, 540 (S.C. 1999). Some courts established standards directly fashioned after those in <i>Rose</i>, while others looked at their own state’s statutory and regulatory academic standards as a point of departure in determining the meaning of a constitutional education. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Idaho Schs. for Equal Educ. Opportunity, 850 P.2d at 724; Abbott by Abbott v. Burke, 693 A.2d 417, 427 (N.J. 1997); Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State, 719 N.Y.S.2d 475, 484 (Sup. Ct. 2001); Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Kirby, 917 S.W.2d 717, 730 (Tex. 1995). In this latter respect, courts sought to hold state legislatures to their own word by incorporating statutory or regulatory standards into the constitutional meaning of an adequate education.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases below develop the theories from each of these waves of litigation, along with the various doctrinal and practical issues they raise. As you explore them, consider (1) whether there are significant differences between adequacy and equity theories or whether the theories are simply variations on the attempt to achieve the same end; (2) why courts have been more receptive to adequacy theories; (3) whether adequacy is actually possible without also ensuring equity; (4) whether courts are overstepping their institutional authority and competency when they intervene in school policy and finance; and (5) what role, if any, the federal government should play in encouraging or forcing more equity and adequacy.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch66">1. <i>The Fundamental Right to an Equitable Education</i></p>
<p class="noindent">As noted above, the California Supreme Court in <i>Serrano v. Priest</i>, 487 P.2d 1241, 1258 (Cal. 1971), had found that education was a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution prior to the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i>. After the Court rejected this position in <i>Rodriguez</i>, the California litigants returned to their state supreme court to argue that, under the state constitution, education was a fundamental right and wealth was a suspect classification. In most respects, these arguments were indistinguishable from those in <i>Rodriguez</i>.</p>
<p><a id="page_173" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>173</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">They simply proceeded under state equal protection rather than federal. As you read the following case, consider whether there is any reason why education would be a fundamental right for state purposes but not federal.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch67">Serrano v. Priest</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>557 P.2d 929 (Cal. 1977)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Serrano I</i> this court was faced at the outset with the task of choosing the proper equal protection standard to be applied. “[T]he United States Supreme Court,” we pointed out, “has employed a two-level test for measuring legislative classifications against the equal protection clause. ‘In the area of economic regulation, the high court has exercised restraint, investing legislation with a presumption of constitutionality and requiring merely that distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. On the other hand, in cases involving “suspect classifications” or touching on “fundamental interests,” the court has adopted an attitude of active and critical analysis, subjecting the classification to strict scrutiny. Under the strict standard, the state bears the burden of establishing not only that it has a <i>compelling</i> interest which justifies the law but that the distinctions drawn by the law are <i>necessary</i> to further its purpose.”</p>
<p class="indent">During the progress of trial proceedings below, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in <i>San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez</i>[, holding that strict scrutiny was inappropriate because poverty is not a suspect class and education is not a fundamental right under the federal constitution.] We think it is clear that <i>Rodriguez</i> undercuts our decision in <i>Serrano I</i> to the extent that we held the California public school financing system to be invalid as in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, as we made clear in footnote 11, our decision in <i>Serrano I</i> was based not only on the provisions of the federal Constitution but on the provisions of our own state Constitution as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Our footnote 11 read as follows: “The complaint also alleges that the financing system violates…the California Constitution. Section 11 [of the Constitution] provides: ‘All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation.’ Section 21 states: ‘No special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the Legislature; nor shall any citizen, or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.’ We have construed these provisions as ‘substantially the equivalent’ of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. Consequently, our analysis of plaintiffs’ federal equal protection contention is also applicable to their claim under these state constitutional provisions.” The first question here facing us is that of the proper interpretation of the foregoing two sentences in light of <i>Rodriguez</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">As <i>Serrano I</i> makes clear, our state equal protection provisions, while “substantially the equivalent of” the guarantees contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, are possessed of an independent</p>
<p><a id="page_174" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>174</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">vitality which, in a given case, may demand an analysis different from that which would obtain if only the federal standard were applicable. We have recently stated in a related context: “[I]n the area of fundamental civil liberties—which includes all protections of the California Declaration of Rights—we sit as a court of last resort, subject only to the qualification that our interpretations may not restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter. In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is California law and the full panoply of rights Californians have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but are to be followed by California courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by California law.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the fact that a majority of the United States Supreme Court have now chosen to contract the area of active and critical analysis under the strict scrutiny test for federal constitutional purposes can have no effect upon the existing construction and application afforded our own constitutional provisions. Nor can the additional fact—if it be a fact—that certain of the high court’s former decisions (which may have been relied upon by us in <i>Serrano I</i>) may not be expected to thrive in the shadow of <i>Rodriguez</i> cause us to withdraw from the principles we there announced on state as well as federal grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">For these reasons then, we now adhere to our determinations, made in <i>Serrano I</i>, that for the reasons there stated and for purposes of assessing our state public school financing system in light of our state constitutional provisions guaranteeing equal protection of the laws (1) discrimination in educational opportunity on the basis of district wealth involves a suspect classification, and (2) education is a fundamental interest. Because the school financing system here in question has been shown by substantial and convincing evidence produced at trial to involve a suspect classification (insofar as this system, like the former one, draws distinctions on the basis of district wealth), and because that classification affects the fundamental interest of the students of this state in education, we have no difficulty in concluding today, as we concluded in <i>Serrano I</i>, that the school financing system before us must be examined under our state constitutional provisions with that strict and searching scrutiny appropriate to such a case.</p>
<p class="indent">We are fortified in reaching this conclusion by language appearing in the <i>Rodriguez</i> decision itself. The high court, in passing upon the validity of the Texas system under the federal equal protection clause, repeatedly emphasized its lack of “expertise” and familiarity with local problems of school financing and educational policy, which lack “counsel[ed] against premature interference with informed judgments made at the state and local levels.” These considerations, in conjunction with abiding concerns from the standpoint of federalism, in the high court’s view “buttress[ed its] conclusion that Texas’ system of public school finance is an inappropriate candidate for strict judicial scrutiny.” This court, on the other hand, in addressing the instant case occupies a position quite different from that of the high court in <i>Rodriguez</i>. The constraints of federalism, so necessary to the proper functioning of our unique system of national government, are not applicable to this court in its determination of whether our own</p>
<p><a id="page_175" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>175</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">state’s public school financing system runs afoul of state constitutional provisions. Moreover, while we cannot claim that we have achieved the perspective of “expertise” on the subjects of school financing and educational policy, our deliberations in this matter have had the benefit of a thoughtfully developed trial record, comprehensive if not exhaustive findings on the part of an able trial judge, and voluminous briefing by the parties and no less than nine amici curiae, among which are included the state Superintendent of Public Instruction. We believe that this background amply equips us to undertake the searching judicial scrutiny of our state’s public school financing system which is required of us under our state constitutional provisions guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p class="indent">We point out in closing, however, that our application of the strict scrutiny test in this case should in no way be interpreted to imply an acceptance of the theory by which the <i>Rodriguez</i> approach to assessing “fundamentalness” in affected rights is applied by analogy in the state sphere. Suffice it to say that we are constrained no more by inclination than by authority to gauge the importance of rights and interests affected by legislative classifications wholly through determining the extent to which they are “explicitly or implicitly guaranteed” by the terms of our compendious, comprehensive, and distinctly mutable state Constitution. In applying our state constitutional provisions guaranteeing equal protection of the laws we shall continue to apply strict and searching judicial scrutiny to legislative classifications which, because of their impact on those individual rights and liberties which lie at the core of our free and representative form of government, are properly considered “fundamental.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the reasons above stated, we have concluded that the state public school financing system here under review, because it establishes and perpetuates a classification based upon district wealth which affects the fundamental interest of education, must be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny in determining whether it complies with our state equal protection provisions. Under this standard the presumption of constitutionality normally attaching to state legislative classifications falls away, and the state must shoulder the burden of establishing that the classification in question is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. Basing our determination upon the amply supported factual findings of the trial court, we conclude without hesitation that the trial court properly determined that the state failed to bear this burden.</p>
<p class="indent">The system in question has been found by the trial court, on the basis of substantial and convincing evidence, to allow[] the availability of educational opportunity to vary as a function of the assessed valuation of taxable property within a given district. The state interest advanced in justification of this discrimination continues to be that of local control of fiscal and educational matters. However, the trial court has found that asserted interest to be chimerical from the standpoint of those districts which are less favored in terms of taxable wealth per pupil, and we ourselves, after a thorough examination of the record, are in wholehearted agreement with this assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">The admitted improvements to the system which were wrought by the Legislature following <i>Serrano I</i> have not been and will not in the foreseeable future be sufficient to negate those features of the system which operate to</p>
<p><a id="page_176" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>176</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">perpetuate this inequity. Foremost among these—especially in a period of rising inflation and restrictive revenue limits—is the continued availability of voted tax overrides which, while providing more affluent districts with a ready means for meeting what they conceive as legitimate and proper educational objectives, will be recognized by the poorer districts, unable to support the passage of such overrides in order to meet equally desired objectives, as but a new and more invidious aspect of that “cruel illusion” which we found to be inherent in the former system. In short, what we said in our former opinion in this respect is equally true here. “[S]o long as the assessed valuation within a district’s boundaries is a major determinant of how much it can spend for its schools, only a district with a large tax base [per ADA] will be truly able to decide how much it really cares about education. The poor district cannot freely choose to tax itself into an excellence which its tax rolls cannot provide. Far from being necessary to promote local fiscal choice, the present financing system actually deprives the less wealthy districts of that option.”</p>
<p class="indent">It is accordingly clear that the California public school financing system here under review, because it renders the educational opportunity available to the students of this state a function of the taxable wealth of the districts in which they live, has not been shown by the state to be necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. In <i>Serrano I</i>, the court had not given clear separate treatment to whether education was a fundamental right under the state and U.S. Constitutions. Rather, it had indicated that it would apply the same scrutiny under state law that federal law required. Does the court in <i>Serrano II</i> provide a compelling explanation for why it will now apply a different level of scrutiny? Are the concepts of equal protection and fundamental rights under state law different than federal law, or is this an example of a court having already reached an outcome in an early case and now using any rationale necessary to support that holding?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What issues presented obstacles to the Court in <i>Rodriguez</i> that the California Supreme Court argues are not obstacles at the state level? Does the California Supreme Court’s opinion suggest that there really were no obstacles in <i>Rodriguez</i> and that the Court simply did not want to act, or is there something fundamentally different about challenging educational inequities in the state court?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Three sections of the California Constitution explicitly mention education. Article IX, Section 1, provides: “A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.” Article IX, Section 5, provides: “The Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district</p>
<p><a id="page_177" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>177</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.” Article XVI, Section 8 (formerly article XIII, Section 15), provides: “From all state revenues there shall first be set apart the monies to be applied by the state for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education.” Do these clauses explain the different outcome in state court? Could the U.S. Supreme Court have cited to state constitutions to distinguish inequities in education from those in other areas and justify higher scrutiny?</p>
<p class="indent">4. If education is a fundamental right under state law, does it change the level of scrutiny applicable in a federal equal protection challenge to educational inequity?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="noindent">Shortly after <i>Serrano I</i>, the New Jersey Supreme Court took up its own school finance case in <i>Robinson v. Cahill</i>, 303 A.2d 273 (N.J. 1973). Rather than base its decision on education as a fundamental right or wealth as a suspect class, the court found that its education clause required a thorough and efficient system of schools, which the state’s funding system was insufficient to deliver. <i>Id.</i> at 294, 297. Interestingly, the <i>Robinson</i> court had prepared, but not released, its decision when the U.S. Supreme Court decided <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i>. Thus, before releasing it, the New Jersey Supreme Court took the opportunity to add a section to its opinion explaining its outcome in relation to the rationale of <i>Rodriguez</i>:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Conceivably a State Constitution could be more demanding [than the U.S. Constitution]. For one thing, there is absent the principle of federalism which cautions against too expansive a view of a federal constitutional limitation upon the power and opportunity of the several States to cope with their own problems in the light of their own circumstances. The majority in <i>Rodriguez</i> expressly noted that “every claim arising under the Equal Protection Clause has implications for the relationship between national and state power under our federal system,” adding that “it would be difficult to imagine a case having a greater potential impact on our federal system than the one now before us, in which we are urged to abrogate systems of financing public education presently in existence in virtually every State.”</p>
<p class="indent">We go then to the question whether our State guarantee of equal protection is offended. [While <i>Rodriguez</i> indicated that a “compelling state interest” doctrine would apply to federal fundamental rights,] we are not prepared to accept that concept for State constitutional purposes. We have no difficulty with the thought that a discrimination which may have an invidious base is “suspect” and will be examined closely. And if a discrimination of that kind is found, the inquiry may well end, for it is not likely that a State interest could sustain such a discrimination. But we have not found helpful the concept of a “fundamental” right. No one has successfully defined the term for this purpose. Even the proposition discussed in <i>Rodriguez</i>, that a right is “fundamental” if it is explicitly or implicitly guaranteed in the Constitution, is immediately vulnerable, for the right to acquire and hold property is guaranteed in the Federal and State Constitutions, and surely that right is not a likely candidate for such preferred treatment. And if a right is somehow found to be “fundamental,” there remains the question as to what State interest is “compelling” and there, too, we find little, if any, light.

<p class="noindent">judicial intervention under either the equal protection or the due process clauses may only divert a court from the meritorious issue or delay consideration of it. Ultimately, a court must weigh the nature of the restraint or the denial against the apparent public justification, and decide whether the State action is arbitrary. In that process, if the circumstances sensibly so require, the court may call upon the State to demonstrate the existence of a sufficient public need for the restraint or the denial.</p>

<p class="indent">The Connecticut Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Horton v. Meskill</i> was the next major school finance decision after <i>Serrano</i> and <i>Robinson.</i> Given that New Jersey had taken a differing approach from <i>Serrano</i>, the court in <i>Horton</i> had the opportunity to choose between two modes of analysis. The Connecticut Supreme Court adopted the fundamental rights approach of <i>Serrano</i>. It also further developed the concept of a fundamental right to education under state law, offering a more complete rationale than the court in <i>Serrano II</i>. The fundamental rights approach to education finance reform would go on to dominate for, at least, the next decade. But, as the next section of this chapter reveals, New Jersey’s approach was the forerunner to the educational adequacy movement that would gain steam a decade later.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch68">Horton v. Meskill</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>376 A.2d 359 (Conn. 1977)</i></p>
<p class="indent">[Plaintiffs seek] by declaratory judgment a judicial determination as to whether the Connecticut educational finance system violates constitutional equal rights and equal protection guarantees and is constitutionally mandated “appropriate legislation” to provide free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The questions presented are not only of great importance but of considerable complexity, and it is of small comfort to note that members of the judiciary throughout the country are also being faced with the same or similar complex questions.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he relevant provisions of the state constitutions on which the plaintiffs rely [provide: [1]] “There shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation.”[2] “All men when they form a social compact, are equal in rights; and no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.”[3] “No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national origin.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Superior Court declared that the present system of financing public education in Connecticut insofar as the system purports to delegate to the town of Canton the duty of raising taxes to operate free public elementary and secondary schools and insofar as it purports to delegate to Canton the duty of operating and maintaining free public elementary and secondary schools violates the constitution of Connecticut.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[I]</span></p>
<p class="indent">The public schools in Canton, like those of all other towns in the state, are financed primarily by two means: funds raised by the town by assessment on property within the town and funds distributed by the state pursuant to legislation providing for a flat grant depending on the average number of pupils attending school daily. This grant is usually referred to as the ADM (average daily membership) grant. The ADM grant paid during 1973-74 was $215 per pupil and has since been increased to $250 per pupil. It has been the principal source of the state’s contribution to local public school education for about three decades though, by statute, the state provides for various other grant payments to each town or district for public and nonpublic school programs and activities. These include grants for exceptional and handicapped students, for school construction, and for student transportation.</p>
<p class="indent">In Connecticut, the percentage contribution of the local, state, and federal governments has been approximately 70 percent local, 20 to 25 percent state, and 5 percent or less federal. This contrasts with the average figures nationally of 51 percent local, 41 percent state, and 8 percent federal. Funds raised by local governments for local public school education come principally from one source: the local property tax. For the year 1972-73, 80.1 percent of the state aid for local public school operating expenses was distributed as a flat grant that was not based upon the ability of the towns to finance education, 12.6 percent came from the reimbursement grant for special education, and 7.3 percent came from twelve miscellaneous grants, none of which was distributed on the basis of a town’s ability to finance education.</p>
<p class="indent">The total average statewide per pupil expenditure as reported by the state board of education for the year 1972-73 was $1091. Because local property taxes are the principal source of revenue for local public schools, a significant measure of the ability of the various towns to finance local education is the dollar amount of taxable property per pupil in each town which can be figured by dividing the grand list of a town by the number of pupils. For the 1972-73 school year, wide disparities existed in the effective yield per pupil ranging from approximately $20,000 per pupil to approximately $170,000 per pupil. During that year, the state average was $53,639. In Canton, it was $38,415.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]axpayers in property-poor towns such as Canton pay higher tax rates for education than taxpayers in property-rich towns. The higher tax rates generate tax revenues in comparatively small amounts and property-poor towns cannot afford to spend for the education of their pupils, on a per pupil basis, the same amounts that property-rich towns do. These facts were affirmed by a conclusion of the governor’s commission on tax reform: “In short, many towns can tax far less and spend much more; and those less fortunate towns can never catch up in school expenditure because taxes are already as high as homeowners can tolerate. This dual inequity—a family can pay more and get less for its children—is the fundamental issue of school finance.”</p>
<p class="indent">The wide disparities that exist in the amount spent on education by the various towns result primarily from the wide disparities that exist in the taxable wealth of the various towns; the present system of financing education in</p>
<p><a id="page_180" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>180</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Connecticut ensures that, regardless of the educational needs or wants of children, more educational dollars will be allotted to children who live in property-rich towns than to children who live in property-poor towns.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1972-73 school year, the per pupil operating expenses of sample towns were as follows: Darien, $1570.47; West Hartford, $1443.10; Greenwich, $1428.99; Weston, $1332.79; Canton, $945.15; Lisbon, $669.94. The state average was $1054.70. Property-rich towns were and still are able, through higher per pupil expenditures, to provide a substantially wider range and higher quality of educational services than Canton in the areas of course offerings, special education, learning disability teachers and facilities, library resources, television teaching, and in numerous other areas, including higher ratios of classroom teachers to students, specialist teachers to students, guidance counselors to students, and other similar relationships. Because of the two-thirds reimbursement provision of the state aid statute for special education, towns that spend more on special education receive more state aid than towns that spend less.</p>
<p class="indent">High education-spending towns, such as Darien, were and are able to obtain more special education funds from the state because they are better able to afford the one-third portion of the expense, better equipped to identify special education problems and better staffed to apply for funds.</p>
<p class="indent">An important factor in determining what school system a teacher chooses to teach in is the school’s salary scale. Although over 80 percent of Canton’s educational budget goes to teachers’ salaries, in 1973-74, Canton’s average teacher salary was $10,830 compared with $14,175 in West Hartford. Top salary comparisons were $14,990 and $19,140, respectively. Towns with fewer tax resources such as Canton tend to have a higher percentage of inexperienced teachers, especially teachers with only one year of experience or less.</p>
<p class="indent">The criteria for evaluating the “quality of education” in a town include the following: (a) size of classes; (b) training, experience and background of teaching staff; (c) materials, books and supplies; (d) school philosophy and objectives; (e) type of local control; (f) test scores as measured against ability; (g) degree of motivation and application of the students; (h) course offerings and extracurricular activities. In most cases, the optimal version of these criteria is achieved by higher per pupil operating expenditures, and because many of the elements of a quality education require higher per pupil operating expenditures, there is a direct relationship between per pupil school expenditures and the breadth and quality of educational programs.</p>
<p class="indent">Further findings by the trial court were addressed to consideration of possible means of achieving equality of educational opportunities with further consideration given to the variations in types of education and other variables that may affect the educational program and its cost. It found that equalizing the ability of the various towns to finance education would provide all towns, property-poor and property-rich, with the opportunity to exercise a meaningful choice as to educational services to be offered to students. It found that Connecticut ranked fiftieth among the states in its efforts to distribute aid in such a way as to equalize the abilities of the various towns to finance education, ranked forty-seventh in the percent of educational funding coming from the state and</p>
<p><a id="page_181" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>181</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">second in the percent of education funding coming from local governments, and that of all the existing forms of distributing state funds used throughout the country, the flat grant has the least equalizing effect on local financial abilities.</p>
<p class="indent">It further found that substantial progress can be made toward equalizing the financial abilities of the local districts by redistributing the flat grant funds according to a different formula, which can be accomplished without the need for additional state taxes; that equalizing the ability of the various towns to finance education would not require that all towns spend the same amount for the education of each pupil since towns can be left free to choose the level of expenditures appropriate for their circumstances; and that there is no reason why local control needs to be diminished in any degree merely because some financing system other than the present one is adopted.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he court took cognizance of legislation passed by the 1975 session of the General Assembly which increased the state’s flat grant from $215 per pupil to $250 per pupil and provided for “Special Instant Lottery Games” the net proceeds of which were to be used “solely for educational equalization grants to towns[.]” The court found that the $35 per pupil increase in the flat grant has little, if any, effect on equalizing the ability of the various towns to finance education, and that although the instant lottery legislation would provide an additional grant of $12.50 per pupil per year to those towns which fall in the bottom eighty-fifth percentile of all Connecticut towns ranked according to property-taxable wealth and median family income, the effect of the additional lottery fund grant on equalizing the ability of Canton and other property-poor towns to finance education “will be miniscule and not significant.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[II]</span></p>
<p class="indent">This court has many times noted that the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions have a like meaning and impose similar constitutional limitations. In <i>State v. Rao</i>, we reiterated the controlling principles of law as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court: “Equal protection analysis must commence with a determination of whether a legislative classification…impinges upon a fundamental right. Where the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right…it must be struck down unless justified by a compelling state interest. Where the statute does not involve fundamental rights…the legislation will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis.”</p>
<p class="indent">In [<i>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</i>], the United States Supreme Court adopted what appears to be a special test for determining whether education is a fundamental constitutional right: “(T)he key to discovering whether education is ‘fundamental’ is not to be found in comparisons of the relative societal significance of education as opposed to subsistence or housing. Nor is it to be found by weighing whether education is as important as the right to travel. Rather, the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right to education explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.” The court concluded that no such right was guaranteed by the federal constitution and, accordingly, declined to apply a strict scrutiny test.</p>
<p><a id="page_182" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>182</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In our consideration of the merits of the present appeals, we have not found material aid in the many decisions from the courts of other jurisdictions since most of them depend upon the controlling and differing provisions of the constitutions in the particular jurisdictions. Nor have we found the <i>Rodriguez</i> test for the fundamentality of the right to an education of particular help although under that test it cannot be questioned but that in the light of the Connecticut constitutional recognition of the right to education it is, in Connecticut, a “fundamental” right.</p>
<p class="indent">As other courts have recognized, educational equalization cases are “in significant aspects sui generis” and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional tests or the application of mechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute. Further, the children living in towns with relatively low assessable property values are afforded public education but, as the trial court found, the education they receive is to a substantial degree narrower and lower in quality than that which pupils receive in comparable towns with a larger tax base and greater ability to finance education. True, the state has mandated local provision for a basic educational program with local option for a program of higher quality but, as the trial court’s finding indicates, that option to a town which lacks the resources to implement the higher quality educational program which it desires and which is available to property-richer towns is highly illusory. As Mr. Justice Marshall put it in his dissent in <i>Rodriguez:</i> “[T]his Court has never suggested that because some ‘adequate’ level of benefits is provided to all, discrimination in the provision of services is therefore constitutionally excusable. The Equal Protection Clause is not addressed to the minimal sufficiency but rather to the unjustifiable inequalities of state action. It mandates nothing less than that ‘all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.’” With justification, the trial court found merit to the complaints of the plaintiffs about “the sheer irrationality” of the state’s system of financing education in the state on the basis of property values, noting that their argument “‘would be similar and no less tenable should the state make educational expenditures dependent upon some other irrelevant factor, such as the number of telephone poles in the district.’”</p>
<p class="indent">We find our thinking to be substantially in accord with the decisions of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Robinson v. Cahill</i>, 303 A.2d 273, and the California Supreme Court in <i>Serrano II</i>, and whether we apply the “fundamentality” test adopted by <i>Rodriguez</i> or the pre-<i>Rodriguez</i> test under our state constitution (as the California Supreme Court did in <i>Serrano II</i>) or the “arbitrary” test applied by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <i>Robinson v. Cahill</i>, we must conclude that in Connecticut the right to education is so basic and fundamental that any infringement of that right must be strictly scrutinized.</p>
<p class="indent">“Connecticut has for centuries recognized it as her right and duty to provide for the proper education of the young.” Education is so important that the state has made it compulsory through a requirement of attendance. As early as 1650, the General Court (as the General Assembly was then called) adopted a provision that “euery Towneshipp within this Jurissdiction, after the Lord</p>
<p><a id="page_183" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>183</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">hath increased them to the number of fifty houshoulders, shall then forthwith appoint one within theire Towne to teach all such children as shall resorte to him, to write and read.…And it is further ordered, that where any Towne shall increase to the number of one hundred families or housholders, they shall sett vp a Grammer Schoole, the masters thereof being able to instruct youths so farr as they may bee fitted for the Vniversity.” This same basic educational system has continued to this date, the state recognizing that providing for education is a state duty and function now codified in the constitution, article eighth, §1, with the obligation of overseeing education on the local level delegated to local school boards which serve as agents of the state. The General Assembly has by word, if not by deed, recognized in the enactment of §10-4a of the General Statutes that it is the concern of the state that “each child shall have…equal opportunity to receive a suitable program of educational experiences.” Indeed the concept of equality is expressly embodied in the constitutional provision for distribution of the school fund in the provision (article eighth, §4) that the fund “shall be inviolably appropriated to the support and encouragement of the public schools throughout the state, and for the equal benefit of all the people thereof.”</p>
<p class="indent">The present-day problem arises from the circumstance that over the years there has arisen a great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education, which has given rise to a consequent significant disparity in the quality of education available to the youth of the state. It was well stated in the memorandum of decision of the trial court, which noted that the “present method (of financing education in the state) is the result of legislation in which the state delegates to municipalities of disparate financial capability the state’s duty of raising funds for operating public schools within that municipality. That legislation gives no consideration to the financial capability of the municipality to raise funds sufficient to discharge another duty delegated to the municipality by the state, that of educating the children within that municipality. The evidence in this case is that, as a result of this duty-delegating to Canton without regard to Canton’s financial capabilities, pupils in Canton receive an education that is in a substantial degree lower in both breadth and quality than that received by pupils in municipalities with a greater financial capability, even though there is no difference between the constitutional duty of the state to the children in Canton and the constitutional duty of the state to the children in other towns.”</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that without doubt the trial court correctly held that, in Connecticut, elementary and secondary education is a fundamental right, that pupils in the public schools are entitled to the equal enjoyment of that right, and that the state system of financing public elementary and secondary education as it presently exists and operates cannot pass the test of “strict judicial scrutiny” as to its constitutionality. These were the basic legal conclusions reached by the court. The remaining conclusions arise from the application of these legal principles to the facts which the court found. The exhaustive finding of facts amply supports the conclusions of the court that the present legislation enacted by the General Assembly to discharge the state’s constitutional duty to educate its children, depending primarily on a local property tax base without regard to the disparity in the financial ability of the towns to finance an educational program and with no significant equalizing state support, is not</p>
<p><a id="page_184" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>184</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">“appropriate legislation” (article eighth, §1) to implement the requirement that the state provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to its youth in its free public elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What was the extent of the inequality in Connecticut? Which inequities do you find to be the most problematic?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What method of analysis does the Connecticut Supreme Court use to determine whether education is a fundamental right: textual language, historical approach to education, the importance of the right? Is the Connecticut Supreme Court more persuasive in justifying its treatment of education as a fundamental right than California? Is Connecticut’s opinion dependent on the specific language of its constitution and statutes, or is its rationale transferrable?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If education is a fundamental right, can any inequities (other than trivial ones) survive strict scrutiny? What rationale would justify spending substantially more money in one location than another? Must that inequality produce a differing educational outcome—as in student achievement—to amount to violation, or is it enough that resources are unequal? Should the state be obligated to eliminate inequalities in all respects (such as teachers, facilities, transportation, and curriculum), or only money? Is the point of money to secure equality in these other respects?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Connecticut Supreme Court refrained from ordering the state to implement any specific remedy. What remedy would be necessary to cure the constitutional violation? Is it appropriate for a court to order a specific remedy? If not, what guidelines might you offer the state in shaping a remedy?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch69">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Locate the clause or clauses pertaining to education in your state constitution. Does the language resemble or differ from the education clauses in California’s and Connecticut’s constitutions? Does the language in your state clause provide any basis for recognizing education as a fundamental right? If so, would this fundamental right protect against all educational inequalities or only particular ones? Are there any reasons why a court should not recognize education as a fundamental right? In reaching your conclusions, do not read any modern opinions interpreting the right to education in your state. Instead, focus solely on the constitutional language itself (and potentially any available legislative history or older court opinions interpreting education rights).</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch70">2. <i>The Right to a Qualitative Education</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The Kentucky Supreme Court in <i>Rose v. Council for Better Education</i> became the first court to detail the meaning of an adequate education, which marked the</p>
<p><a id="page_185" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>185</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">beginning of a new and expanding category of litigation focused on ensuring a certain qualitative level of education rather than an enforcing equity across all districts. As you read the case, pay close attention to (1) any distinctions between education as a fundamental right and a constitutional right to a quality education; (2) whether a fundamental right to education or a right to a quality education is easier to enforce; (3) which approach is most likely to ensure the best outcomes for students; and (4) whether the court is reaching beyond its institutional expertise and capacity in defining a quality education or whether defining a quality education is a necessary part of interpreting an educational clause.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch71">Rose v. Council for Better Education</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>790 S.W.2d 186 (Ky. 1989)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The issue we decide on this appeal is whether the Kentucky General Assembly has complied with its constitutional mandate to “provide an efficient system of common schools throughout the state.”</p>
<p class="indent">In deciding that it has not, we intend no criticism of the substantial efforts made by the General Assembly, nor do we intend to substitute our judicial authority for the authority and discretion of the General Assembly. We are, rather, exercising our constitutional duty in declaring that, when we consider the evidence in the record, and when we apply the constitutional requirement of Section 183 to that evidence, it is crystal clear that the General Assembly has fallen short of its duty to enact legislation to provide for an efficient system of common schools throughout the state. In a word, the present system of common schools in Kentucky is not an “efficient” one in our view of the clear mandate of Section 183. The common school system in Kentucky is constitutionally deficient.</p>
<p class="indent">In reaching this decision, we are ever mindful of the immeasurable worth of education to our state and its citizens, especially to its young people. The framers of our constitution intended that each and every child in this state should receive a proper and an adequate education, <i>to be provided for by the General Assembly.</i> This opinion dutifully applies the constitutional test of Section 183 to the existing system of common schools. We do no more, nor may we do any less.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">What Is an “Efficient System of Common Schools”?</span></p>
<p class="indent">In a few simple, but direct words, the framers of our present Constitution, set forth the will of the people with regard to the importance of providing public education in the Commonwealth. “<i>General Assembly to provide for school system</i>—The General Assembly shall, by appropriate legislation, provide for an efficient system of common schools throughout the State.” Ky. Const. Sec. 183.</p>
<p class="indent">Several conclusions readily appear from a reading of this section. First, it is the obligation, the sole obligation, of the General Assembly to provide for a system of common schools in Kentucky. The obligation to so provide is clear and unequivocal and is, in effect, a constitutional mandate. Next, the school system must be provided throughout the entire state, with no area (or its children) being omitted. The creation, implementation and maintenance of the</p>
<p><a id="page_186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>186</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school system must be achieved by appropriate legislation. Finally, the system must be an efficient one.</p>
<p class="indent">It is, of course, the last “conclusion” that gives us pause and requires study and analysis. What, indeed, is the meaning of the word “efficient” as used in Section 183?</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">The Constitutional Debates</span></p>
<p class="indent">A brief sojourn into the Constitutional debates will give some idea of the depth of the delegates’ intention when Section 183 was drafted and eventually made its way into the organic law of this state. It will provide a background for our definition of “efficient.”</p>
<p class="indent">Comments of Delegate Beckner on the report which led to the selection of the language in Section 183 reflect the framers’ cognizance of the importance of education and, emphasized that the educational system in Kentucky must be improved. Referring to the education of our children, he admonished the delegates, “do not let us make a mistake in dealing with the most vital question that can come before us.”</p>
<p class="indent">After summarizing other achievements made in the proposed new Constitution he continued—“If, however, after accomplishing so much good on these lines—we forget the children, and, in the slightest degree, fail to appreciate the obligations of the State to provide sufficient facilities for training them to be good citizens, we will deserve and receive in the great hereafter anathema, and not ascription of praise.” Incorporating a report made to the Kentucky legislature in 1822, Beckner quoted (referring to a system of common schools): “‘…It is a system of practical equality in which the children of the rich and poor meet upon a perfect level and the only superiority is that of the mind.’” Beckner further declared, “Instruction of children under the auspices of the State has become the settled policy of our people.”</p>
<p class="indent">Beckner set out four permanent justifications for and characteristics of state provided schools: 1) The education of young people is essential to the prosperity of a free people[;] 2) The education should be universal and should embrace all children[;] 3) Public education should be supervised by the State, to assure that students develop patriotism and understand our government[;] 4) Education should be given to all—rich and poor—so that our people will be homogeneous in their feelings and desires.</p>
<p class="indent">One final passage merits quotation. Since education provided by the State is no longer an open question, the only thing that remains is how it shall be made “most valuable and effective.” Let Mr. Beckner’s answer be a guidepost for all Kentuckians today and in the future: “If public schools have come to stay, if they are a part and parcel of our free institutions, woven into the very web and woof of popular government; and if they are in the future to be the dependence of the people of Kentucky for the instruction of their youth, what is the logic of the situation? Manifestly to encourage and improve them, <i>to seize every opportunity to make them more efficient</i>.…”</p>
<p class="indent">Beckner and [quotes from his] fellow delegates [tell] us what this section means[:] The providing of public education through a system of common</p>
<p><a id="page_187" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>187</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">schools by the General Assembly is the most “vital question” presented to them[;] Education of children must not be minimized to the “slightest degree”[;] Education must be provided to the children of the rich and poor alike[;] Education of children is essential to the prosperity of our state[;] Education of children should be supervised by the State[;] There must be a constant and continuing effort to make our schools more efficient[;] We must not finance our schools in a <i>de minimis</i> fashion[;] All schools and children stand upon one level in their entitlement to equal state support.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court, in defining efficiency must, at least in part, be guided by these clearly expressed purposes. The framers of Section 183 emphasized that education is essential to the welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. By this animus to Section 183, we recognize that education is a fundamental right in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="indent">[The Court quoted and discussed previous holdings dating back to the time of the constitutional amendment and, drawing on them, indicated that] this Court, since the adoption of the present Constitution, has, in reflecting on Section 183, drawn several conclusions: 1) The General Assembly is mandated, is duty bound, to create and maintain a system of common schools—throughout the state[;] 2) The expressed purpose of providing such service is vital and critical to the well being of the state[;] 3) The system of common schools must be efficient[;] 4) The system of common schools must be free[;] 5) The system of common schools must provide equal educational opportunities for all students in the Commonwealth[;] 6) The state must control and administer the system[;] 7) The system must be, if not uniform, “substantially uniform,” with respect to the state as a whole[;] 8) The system must be equal to and for all students.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the financial burden entailed in meeting these responsibilities in no way lessens the constitutional duty. “In short, once the citizens of Kentucky made the voluntary commitment to educate the children of this state in public schools neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor those individuals responsible for discharging the duties imposed on them by the state constitution can abrogate those duties merely because the monetary obligations becomes unexpectedly large or onerous.” The taxpayers of this state must pay for the system, no matter how large, even to the point of being “unexpectedly large or even onerous.”</p>
<p class="indent">Before proceeding, therefore, to a definition of “efficient” we must address a point made by the appellants with respect to our authority to enter this fray and to “stick our judicial noses” into what is argued to be strictly the General Assembly’s business. Appellants argue and cite several cases to support their position, that the General Assembly has sole and exclusive authority to determine whether the system of common schools is constitutionally “efficient” and that a Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="indent">It is textbook law that enactments of the General Assembly have a strong presumption of constitutionality. It is also a textbook law that where legislative discretion is present, the judiciary will be reluctant to interfere. The separation of powers doctrine of the Kentucky Constitution underpins and buttresses these legal theories.</p>
<p><a id="page_188" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>188</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In this context, we review the question before us. The ultimate issue is whether the system of common schools in the Commonwealth established by the General Assembly, with respect to the mandate of Section 183, is in compliance with the constitution. Specifically, we are asked—based solely on the evidence in the record before us—if the present system of common schools in Kentucky is “efficient” in the constitutional sense. It is our sworn duty, to decide such questions when they are before us by applying the constitution. The duty of the judiciary in Kentucky was so determined when the citizens of Kentucky enacted the social compact called the Constitution and in it provided for the existence of a third equal branch of government, the judiciary.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue before us—the constitutionality of the system of statutes that created the common schools—is the only issue. To avoid deciding the case because of “legislative discretion,” “legislative function,” etc., would be a denigration of our own constitutional duty. To allow the General Assembly (or, in point of fact, the Executive) to decide whether its actions are constitutional is literally unthinkable.</p>
<p class="indent">We believe that what these several cases cited as controlling by appellants mean is that great weight should be given to the decision of the General Assembly. We believe they mean that the presumption of constitutionality is substantial. We believe that they mean that legislative discretion—in this specific matter of common schools—is to be given great weight and, we do so in this decision. We do not question the wisdom of the General Assembly’s decision, only its failure to comply with its constitutional mandate. In so doing, we give deference and weight to the General Assembly’s enactments; however, we find them constitutionally deficient.</p>
<p class="indent">The judiciary has the ultimate power, and the duty, to apply, interpret, define, construe all words, phrases, sentences and sections of the Kentucky Constitution as necessitated by the controversies before it. It is <i>solely</i> the function of the judiciary to so do. This duty must be exercised even when such action serves as a check on the activities of another branch of government or when the court’s view of the constitution is contrary to that of other branches, or even that of the public.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Other Authority</span></p>
<p class="indent">In our sister and adjoining state of West Virginia, the state Constitution requires that “The legislature shall provide, by general law, for a thorough and efficient system of free schools.” In the landmark case of <i>Pauley v. Kelly</i>, (1979), the West Virginia Supreme Court faced a lawsuit similar to the one before us. The Court engaged in extensive historical analysis, in which it carefully interpreted other states’ constitutional mandates with regard to public education. The court rejected the contention that legislative discretion in public school system matters is determinative[, writing that] “on the threshold question: no court has been hesitant to affirm legislation; many have required specific actions by local boards to bring them to compliance with the constitutional mandate; and legislation has been declared unconstitutional because it failed the mandate. <i>There is ample authority that courts will enforce constitutionally mandated education quality standards.</i>”</p>
<p><a id="page_189" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>189</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In turning to the definition of “efficient” the Court, began with definition which was “lexically” founded. “…[T]he mandate,…becomes a command that the education system be absolutely complete, attentive to every detail, extending beyond ordinary parameters, and further, it must produce results without waste.”</p>
<p class="indent">Following an analysis of the admitted plethora of legal precedent, the West Virginia Supreme Court adopted a definition of “thorough and efficient.” “We may now define a thorough and efficient system of schools: It develops, as best the state of education expertise allows, the minds, bodies and social morality of its charges to prepare them for useful and happy occupations, recreation and citizenship, and does so economically.”</p>
<p class="indent">We cite <i>Pauley</i>, and quote from it at some length to show that Courts may, should and have involved themselves in defining the standards of a constitutionally mandated educational system.</p>
<p class="indent">We consider foreign cases, along with our constitutional debates, Kentucky precedents and the opinion of experts in formulating the definition of “efficient” as it appears in our Constitution.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Opinions of Experts</span></p>
<p class="indent">Numerous well-qualified experts testified in this case. They were all well educated, experienced teachers, educators, or administrators; and all were familiar with the Kentucky system of common schools and with other states’ and national school issues.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Richard Salmon testified that the concept of efficiency was a three part concept. First, the system should impose no financial hardship or advantage on any group of citizens. Further, local school districts must make comparable tax efforts. Second, resources provided by the system must be adequate and uniform throughout the state. Third, the system must not waste resources.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Kern Alexander opined that an efficient system is one which is unitary. It is one in which there is uniformity throughout the state. It is one in which equality is a hallmark and one in which students must be given equal educational opportunities, regardless of economic status, or place of residence. He also testified that “efficient” involves pay and training of teachers, school buildings, other teaching staff, materials, and adequacy of all educational resources. Moreover, he, like Dr. Salmon, believed that “efficient” also applies to the quality of management of schools. Summarizing Dr. Alexander’s opinion, an efficient system is unitary, uniform, adequate and properly managed.</p>
<p class="indent">The definitions of “efficient” were documented and supported by numerous national and local studies, prepared and authorized by many of the giants of the education profession.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary expert for the appellees was a local school superintendent who felt that an efficient system is one which is operated as best as can be with the money that was provided. We reject such a definition which could result in a system of common schools, efficient only in the uniformly deplorable conditions it provides throughout the state.</p>
<p><a id="page_190" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>190</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In summary the experts in this case believed that an “efficient” system of common schools should have several elements: 1) The system is the sole responsibility of the General Assembly[;] 2) The tax effort should be evenly spread[;] 3) The system must provide the necessary resources throughout the state—they must be uniform[;] 4) The system must provide an adequate education[;] 5) The system must be properly managed.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Definition of “Efficient”</span></p>
<p class="indent">We now hone in on the heart of this litigation. In defining “efficient,” we use all the tools that are made available to us. In spite of any protestations to the contrary, we do not engage in judicial legislating. We do not make policy. We do not substitute our judgment for that of the General Assembly. We simply take the plain directive of the Constitution, and, armed with its purpose, we decide what our General Assembly must achieve in complying with its solemn constitutional duty.</p>
<p class="indent">Any system of common schools must be created and maintained with the premise that education is absolutely vital to the present and to the future of our Commonwealth. As Herbert Spencer observed, “Education has for its object the formation of character.” No tax proceeds have a more important position or purpose than those for education in the grand scheme of our government. The importance of common schools and the education they provide Kentucky’s children cannot be overemphasized or overstated.</p>
<p class="indent">The sole responsibility for providing the system of common schools is that of our General Assembly. It is a duty—it is a constitutional mandate placed by the people on the 138 members of that body who represent those selfsame people.</p>
<p class="indent">The General Assembly must not only establish the system, but it must monitor it on a continuing basis so that it will always be maintained in a constitutional manner. The General Assembly must carefully supervise it, so that there is no waste, no duplication, no mismanagement, at any level.</p>
<p class="indent">The system of common schools must be adequately funded to achieve its goals. The system of common schools must be substantially uniform throughout the state. Each child, <i>every child</i>, in this Commonwealth must be provided with an equal opportunity to have an adequate education. Equality is the key word here. The children of the poor and the children of the rich, the children who live in the poor districts and the children who live in the rich districts must be given the same opportunity and access to an adequate education. This obligation cannot be shifted to local counties and local school districts.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have indicated, Section 183 requires the General Assembly to establish a system of common schools that provides an equal opportunity for children to have an adequate education. In no way does this constitutional requirement act as a limitation on the General Assembly’s power to create local school entities and to grant to those entities the authority to supplement the state system. Therefore, if the General Assembly decides to establish local school entities, it may also empower them to enact local revenue initiatives to supplement the uniform, equal educational effort that the General Assembly must provide. This</p>
<p><a id="page_191" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>191</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">includes not only revenue measures similar to the special taxes previously discussed, but also the power to assess local ad valorem taxes on real property and personal property at a rate over and above that set by the General Assembly to fund the statewide system of common schools. Such local efforts may not be used by the General Assembly as a substitute for providing an adequate, equal and substantially uniform educational system throughout this state.</p>
<p class="indent">Having declared the system of common schools to be constitutionally deficient, we have directed the General Assembly to recreate and redesign a new system that will comply with the standards we have set out. Such system will guarantee to all children the opportunity for an adequate education, through a <i>state</i> system. To allow local citizens and taxpayers to make a supplementary effort in no way reduces or negates the minimum quality of education required in the statewide system.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not instruct the General Assembly to enact any specific legislation. We do not direct the members of the General Assembly to raise taxes. It is their decision how best to achieve efficiency. We only decide the nature of the constitutional mandate. We only determine the intent of the framers. Carrying out that intent is the duty of the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="indent">A child’s right to an adequate education is a fundamental one under our Constitution. The General Assembly must protect and advance that right. We concur with the trial court that an efficient system of education must have as its goal to provide each and every child with at least the seven following capacities: (i) sufficient oral and written communication skills to enable students to function in a complex and rapidly changing civilization; (ii) sufficient knowledge of economic, social, and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices; (iii) sufficient understanding of governmental processes to enable the student to understand the issues that affect his or her community, state, and nation; (iv) sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental and physical wellness; (v) sufficient grounding in the arts to enable each student to appreciate his or her cultural and historical heritage; (vi) sufficient training or preparation for advanced training in either academic or vocational fields so as to enable each child to choose and pursue life work intelligently; and (vii) sufficient levels of academic or vocational skills to enable public school students to compete favorably with their counterparts in surrounding states, in academics or in the job market.</p>
<p class="indent">The essential, and minimal, characteristics of an “efficient” system of common schools, may be summarized as follows: 1) The establishment, maintenance and funding of common schools in Kentucky is the sole responsibility of the General Assembly[;] 2) Common schools shall be free to all[;] 3) Common schools shall be available to all Kentucky children[;] 4) Common schools shall be substantially uniform throughout the state[;] 5) Common schools shall provide equal educational opportunities to all Kentucky children, regardless of place of residence or economic circumstances[;] 6) Common schools shall be monitored by the General Assembly to assure that they are operated with no waste, no duplication, no mismanagement, and with no political influence[;] 7) The premise for the existence of common schools is that all children in Kentucky have a constitutional right to an adequate education[;] 8) The General Assembly shall</p>
<p><a id="page_192" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>192</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">provide funding which is sufficient to provide each child in Kentucky an adequate education[;] 9) An adequate education is one which has as its goal the development of the seven capacities recited previously.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Summary/Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="indent">We have decided this case solely on the basis of our Kentucky Constitution, Section 183.</p>
<p class="indent">We have decided one legal issue—and one legal issue only—viz., that the General Assembly of the Commonwealth has failed to establish an efficient system of common schools throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="indent">Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that Kentucky’s <i>entire system</i> of common schools is unconstitutional. There is no allegation that only part of the common school system is invalid, and we find no such circumstance. This decision applies to the entire sweep of the system—all its parts and parcels. This decision applies to the statutes creating, implementing and financing the <i>system</i> and to all regulations, etc., pertaining thereto. This decision covers the creation of local school districts, school boards, and the Kentucky Department of Education to the Minimum Foundation Program and Power Equalization Program. It covers school construction and maintenance, teacher certification—the whole gamut of the common school system in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="indent">While individual statutes are not herein addressed specifically or considered and declared to be facially unconstitutional, the statutory system as a whole and the interrelationship of the parts therein are hereby declared to be in violation of Section 183 of the Kentucky Constitution. Just as the bricks and mortar used in the construction of a schoolhouse, while contributing to the building’s facade, do not ensure the overall structural adequacy of the schoolhouse, particular statutes drafted by the legislature in crafting and designing the current school system are not unconstitutional in and of themselves. Like the crumbling schoolhouse which must be redesigned and revitalized for more efficient use, with some component parts found to be adequate, some found to be less than adequate, statutes relating to education may be reenacted as components of a constitutional system if they combine with other component statutes to form an efficient and thereby constitutional system.</p>
<p class="indent">Since we have, by this decision, declared the system of common schools in Kentucky to be unconstitutional, Section 183 places an absolute duty on the General Assembly to re-create, re-establish a new system of common schools in the Commonwealth. As we have said, the premise of this opinion is that education is a basic, fundamental constitutional right that is available to all children within this Commonwealth. The General Assembly should begin with the same premise as it goes about its duty. The system, as we have said, must be efficient, and the criteria we have set out are binding on the General Assembly as it develops Kentucky’s new system of common schools.</p>
<p class="indent">As we have previously emphasized, the <i>sole responsibility</i> for providing the system of common schools lies with the General Assembly. If they choose to delegate any of this duty to institutions such as the local boards of education, the General Assembly must provide a mechanism to assure that the ultimate control</p>
<p><a id="page_193" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>193</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">remains with the General Assembly, and assure that those local school districts also exercise the delegated duties in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="indent">The General Assembly must provide adequate funding for the system. How they do this is their decision. However, if ad valorem taxes on real and personal property are used by the General Assembly as part of the financing of the redesigned state system of common schools, the General Assembly has the obligation to see that <i>all such property</i> is assessed at 100% of its fair market value. Moreover, because of the great disparity of local tax efforts in the present system of common schools, the General Assembly must establish a uniform <i>tax rate</i> for such property. In this way, all owners of real and personal property throughout the <i>state</i> will make a comparable effort in the financing of the state system of common schools.</p>
<p class="indent">This decision has not been reached without much thought and consideration. We do not take our responsibilities lightly, and we have decided this case based on our perception and interpretation of the Kentucky Constitution. We intend no criticism of any person, persons or institutions. We view this decision as an opportunity for the General Assembly to launch the Commonwealth into a new era of educational opportunity which will ensure a strong economic, cultural and political future.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. In <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, the Court specifically directed the litigants to examine the original intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment in regard to segregation. The Court in <i>Brown</i> indicated that the legislative history was inconclusive, although some argued that it was conclusive but at odds with the Court’s desired outcome. <span class="smallcap">Michael J. Klarman, From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality</span> 447 (2004); Mark V. Tushnet, <i>Following the Rules Laid Down: A Critique of “Interpretivism,” and Neutral Principles</i>, 96 <span class="smallcap">Harv. L. Rev</span>. 781, 800 (1983). Putting <i>Brown</i> aside, what is the proper way to interpret constitutional clauses, and to what extent is history relevant? What does the legislative history in Kentucky reveal about the framers’ intent for education? Does affirmative support for and the guarantee of education surprise you given the time at which it was enacted?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Many education clauses grew out of the post–Civil War period. Congress conditioned southern states’ readmission to the Union, not only on adopting the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, but on making certain changes to their own state constitutions, including some aspects of clauses related to education. John C. Eastman, <i>When Did Education Become a Civil Right? An Assessment of State Constitutional Provisions for Education 1776-1900</i>, 42 <span class="smallcap">Am. J. Legal Hist</span>. 1, 26-27 (1998); <span class="smallcap">Robert F. Williams, The Law of American State Constitutions</span> 90 (2009). The newly enacted education clauses reshaped the legal framework and aspirations for education. For instance, Louisiana’s prewar constitution explicitly apportioned education funds based only on “the number of free white children.” La. Const., tit. VIII, art. 136 (1852). Virginia’s constitution included no provision for education at all.</p>
<p><a id="page_194" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>194</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Overall, during the antebellum period, only a single state—Wisconsin—enacted a constitutional provision that mandated the education of all children in the state. Eastman, <i>supra</i>, at 17. But, with the exception of Virginia, every state seeking readmission to the Union adopted constitutional language during the postwar period that required their legislatures “to establish and maintain a uniform or thorough system of free schools, for the gratuitous instruction of all children in the State.” <i>Id.</i> at 27.</p>
<p class="indent">Also important is the fact that newly freed slaves and other African Americans who served as state representatives during Reconstruction played a dominant role in the enactment of several southern states’ education clauses. <i>See, e.g</i>., <span class="smallcap">At Freedom’s Door: African American Founding Fathers and Lawyers in Reconstruction South Carolina</span> (Underwood &amp; Burke eds., 2000). Having been denied all rights of citizenship and the basic right to read, many surely held lofty expectations for education in their states.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2009, the Institute for Educational Equity and Opportunity issued a comprehensive study of the legislative history of the constitutional right to education in all 50 states<span class="smallcap">. Institute for Educational Equity and Opportunity</span>, <span class="smallcap">Education in the 50 States: A Deskbook of the History of State Constitutions and Laws about Education</span> (2009). The book reveals a commitment to education that stretches back to the early colonies and carries forward today with a similarly singular goal of maintaining our democracy by equipping citizens with the education necessary to vote and obtain useful work.</p>
<p class="indent">3. As a general matter, which is the constitutionally more sound theory: education as a fundamental right or the right to an adequate education? What, if anything, distinguishes the right to an adequate education from a fundamental right to education? Which is the easiest to enforce? Is one or the other likely to produce better outcomes for students? Is there a flaw in either?</p>
<p class="indent">4. What is the overriding tension the court is confronting in recognizing plaintiffs’ claim versus dismissing it? What is the relationship between the court and the state legislature regarding education? Does the court go beyond its authority and encroach on the legislature in any way? Would it have been appropriate for the court to dismiss this case as posing a political question and matters beyond its capacity to decide? If the responsibility for and discretion in delivering education rests solely with the state legislature, how can the court appropriately second-guess the legislature’s delivery of education?</p>
<p class="indent">5. What is the relationship between local school districts and the state in Kentucky? Who bears final responsibility for education and why?</p>
<p class="indent">6. What type of education does the constitution of Kentucky guarantee, if any, to students? On what basis does this court offer further definition to the constitutional right? Is its analysis compelling?</p>
<p class="indent">7. The court lists seven general capacities that students should obtain as part of an adequate education. Does the court reach beyond its institutional expertise and capacity in defining an adequate education in such specific terms, or is this interpretive definition of the educational clause’s meaning precisely the court’s job? Is expert testimony appropriate on the question of the meaning of efficient? How should a court determine whether students are receiving such an education?</p>
<p><a id="page_195" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>195</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">8. Is the reasoning and holding of this case transferrable or relevant to lawsuits in other states? Why does the court discuss cases from other jurisdictions? Do similar opinions in other states minimize the perception that this court is overreaching? Several other state courts cite to or quote <i>Rose</i>’s definition of adequacy in their own analysis of educational rights. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Lake View Sch. Dist. No. 25 of Phillips Cnty. v. Huckabee, 91 S.W.3d 472, 487 (Ark. 2002); Claremont Sch. Dist. v. Governor, 703 A.2d 1353, 1359 (N.H. 1997); Leandro v. State, 488 S.E.2d 249, 255 (N.C. 1997).</p>
<p class="indent">9. Having found that the state is failing to deliver an efficient system of common schools, what steps does the court indicate the state must now take? Does the court have the authority to mandate a particular result, or does the state have discretion in these steps?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">One of the challenges in understanding constitutional rights to education is the diversity in constitutional clauses and court decisions. While they share much in common, each state’s constitutional clause/s and history relating to education are unique. Thus, each state court system must perform its own independent evaluation. For instance, the North Carolina Supreme Court relies heavily on <i>Rose</i> in one respect, but primarily addresses North Carolina–specific issues and themes elsewhere.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch72">Leandro v. State</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>488 S.E.2d 249 (N.C. 1997)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The right to a free public education is explicitly guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution: “The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right.” The Constitution also provides: “The General Assembly shall provide by taxation and otherwise for a general and uniform system of free public schools, which shall be maintained at least nine months in every year, and wherein equal opportunities shall be provided for all students.” The principal question presented by this argument is whether the people’s constitutional right to education has any qualitative content, that is, whether the state is required to provide children with an education that meets some minimum standard of quality. We answer that question in the affirmative and conclude that the right to education provided in the state constitution is a right to a sound basic education.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals concluded that the right to education guaranteed by the state constitution “is limited to one of equal access to education, and it does not embrace a qualitative standard.” [But t]his Court has long recognized that there is a qualitative standard inherent in the right to education guaranteed by this state’s constitution. The General Assembly also seems to have recognized the constitutional right to a sound basic education and to have embraced that right in the General Statutes. For example, the General Assembly has[, through statutes,] stated: (a) It is the policy of the State of North Carolina to create a</p>
<p><a id="page_196" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>196</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">public school system that graduates good citizens with the skills demanded in the marketplace, and the skills necessary to cope with contemporary society[;] (b) To insure a <i>quality</i> education for every child in North Carolina, and to assure that the necessary resources are provided, it is the policy of the State of North Carolina to provide from State revenue sources the instructional expenses for current operations of the public school system as defined in the standard course of study. In addition, the legislature has required local boards of education “to provide <i>adequate</i> school systems within their respective local school administrative units, as directed by law.” N.C.G.S. §115C-47(1) (Supp. 1996).</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that Article I, Section 15 and Article IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution combine to guarantee every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools. For purposes of our Constitution, a “sound basic education” is one that will provide the student with at least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak the English language and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental mathematics and physical science to enable the student to function in a complex and rapidly changing society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography, history, and basic economic and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices with regard to issues that affect the student personally or affect the student’s community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to successfully engage in post-secondary education or vocational training; and (4) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to compete on an equal basis with others in further formal education or gainful employment in contemporary society. <i>See generally</i> Rose v. Council for Better Educ., 790 S.W.2d 186, 212 (Ky. 1989).</p>
<p class="indent">We first look to the North Carolina Constitution itself to determine whether it provides a basis for relief [for alleged inequities and inadequacies]. It places upon the General Assembly the duty of providing for “a general and uniform system of free public schools…wherein equal opportunities shall be provided for all students.” N.C. Const. art. IX, §2(1). We conclude that at the time this provision was originally written in 1868 providing for a “general and uniform” system but without the equal opportunities clause, the intent of the framers was that every child have a fundamental right to a sound basic education which would prepare the child to participate fully in society as it existed in his or her lifetime. The 1970 amendment adding the equal opportunities clause ensured that all the children of this state would enjoy this right.</p>
<p class="indent">Although we have concluded that the North Carolina Constitution requires that access to a sound basic education be provided equally in every school district, we are convinced that the equal opportunities clause of Article IX, Section 2(1) does not require substantially equal funding or educational advantages in all school districts. We have considered the language and history underlying this and other constitutional provisions concerned with education as well as former opinions by this Court. As a result, we conclude that provisions of the current state system for funding schools which require or allow counties to help finance their school systems and result in unequal funding among the school districts of the state do not violate constitutional principles.</p>
<p><a id="page_197" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>197</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Article IX, Section 2(2) of the North Carolina Constitution expressly authorizes the General Assembly to require that local governments bear part of the costs of their local public schools. Further, it expressly provides that local governments may add to or supplement their school programs as much as they wish. The General Assembly may assign to units of local government such responsibility for the financial support of the free public schools as it may deem appropriate. The governing boards of units of local government with financial responsibility for public education may use local revenues to add to or supplement any public school or post-secondary school program.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the North Carolina Constitution expressly states that units of local governments with financial responsibility for public education may provide additional funding to supplement the educational programs provided by the state, there can be nothing unconstitutional about their doing so or in any inequality of opportunity occurring as a result.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, as the North Carolina Constitution so clearly creates the likelihood of unequal funding among the districts as a result of local supplements, we see no reason to suspect that the framers intended that substantially equal educational opportunities beyond the sound basic education mandated by the Constitution must be available in all districts. A constitutional requirement to provide substantial equality of educational opportunities in every one of the various school districts of the state would almost certainly ensure that no matter how much money was spent on the schools of the state, at any given time some of those districts would be out of compliance. If strong local public support in a given district improved the educational opportunities of that district to the point that they were substantially better than those of any other district, the children of all the other school districts by definition would be denied substantially equal educational opportunities. The result would be a steady stream of litigation which would constantly interfere with the running of the schools of the state and unnecessarily deplete their human and fiscal resources as well as the resources of the courts.</p>
<p class="indent">We believe that even greater problems of protracted litigation resulting in unworkable remedies would occur if we were to recognize the purported right to equal educational opportunities in every one of the state’s districts. We conclude that the framers of our Constitution did not intend to set such an impractical or unattainable goal. Instead, their focus was upon ensuring that the children of the state have the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.</p>
<p class="indent">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Article IX, Section 2(1) of the North Carolina Constitution requires that all children have the opportunity for a sound basic education, but it does not require that equal educational opportunities be afforded students in all of the school districts of the state.</p>
<p class="indent">We have concluded that the North Carolina Constitution does guarantee every child of the state the opportunity to receive a “sound basic education” as we have defined that phrase in this opinion. We have announced that definition with some trepidation. We recognize that judges are not experts in education and are not particularly able to identify in detail those curricula best designed to ensure that a child receives a sound basic education. However, it is the duty of this Court under the North Carolina Constitution to be the final authority in</p>
<p><a id="page_198" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>198</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">interpreting that constitution, and the definition we have given of a “sound basic education” is that which we conclude is the minimum constitutionally permissible.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he courts of the state must grant every reasonable deference to the legislative and executive branches when considering whether they have established and are administering a system that provides the children of the various school districts of the state a sound basic education. A clear showing to the contrary must be made before the courts may conclude that they have not. Only such a clear showing will justify a judicial intrusion into an area so clearly the province, initially at least, of the legislative and executive branches as the determination of what course of action will lead to a sound basic education.</p>
<p class="indent">But like the other branches of government, the judicial branch has its duty under the North Carolina Constitution. If on remand of this case to the trial court, that court makes findings and conclusions from competent evidence to the effect that defendants in this case are denying children of the state a sound basic education, a denial of a fundamental right will have been established. It will then become incumbent upon defendants to establish that their actions denying this fundamental right are “necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.” If defendants are unable to do so, it will then be the duty of the court to enter a judgment granting declaratory relief and such other relief as needed to correct the wrong while minimizing the encroachment upon the other branches of government.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What right does the court recognize in regard to education, and where does that right originate from? How is that right distinct from the one alleged in <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i> and other equity cases? Note that the court combined fundamental rights analysis with adequacy, holding that students have a fundamental right to a sound basic education. Does this approach limit the problem of potentially subjecting all educational inequity to strict scrutiny?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How is state funding of schools implicated, if at all, by a qualitative right to a sound basic education? Is the right in <i>Leandro</i> a right to school funding or something else? Does this distinction matter? <i>See</i> Derek W. Black, <i>Middle Income Peers as Educational Resources and the Constitutional Right to Equal Access</i>, 53 <span class="smallcap">B.C. L. Rev</span>. 373, 390-404 (2012) (detailing the various implications of adequacy rights beyond just money); James E. Ryan, <i>Schools, Race and Money</i>, 109 <span class="smallcap">Yale L.J</span>. 249, 308 (1999) (arguing that the right to an adequate or equal education encompasses far more than just money). How might a right to a qualitative education be broader than a right to school funding?</p>
<p class="indent">3. How is this qualitative right to education to be measured? In a portion of the opinion not reprinted here, the court indicates that on remand the trial court should examine schools’ ability to meet the educational goals and standards found in state statutes, student performance on standardized tests, and per-pupil</p>

<p class="noindent">expenditures, although the court emphasizes that these are not exclusive factors and are not determinative. What other evidence might be relevant?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The court is clear that the state constitution does not require equality among all school districts, but only a sound basic education. Is the court motivated by the practical difficulty of ensuring equity and the experience of other states in attempting school finance reform? Can one protect the right to a sound basic education if there is no guarantee of equity? Is the question of whether educational opportunities are adequate partly answered by the level of education that students receive elsewhere? Commentators have argued that, while courts like <i>Leandro</i> have eschewed equity, they still retain some notion of equity in conceptualizing adequacy. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Gregory C. Malhoit &amp; Derek W. Black, <i>The Power of Small Schools: Achieving Equal Educational Opportunity Through Academic Success and Democratic Citizenship</i>, 82 <span class="smallcap">Neb. L. Rev</span>. 50, 66-67 (2003). <i>See also</i> Joshua E. Weishart, Transcending Equality Versus Adequacy, 66 Stan. L. Rev. 477 (2014) (analyzing the ways in which adequacy and equity overlap). However, by treating education as a constitutional right with specific qualitative components rather than a general fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny, courts effectively lower the burden of equity and the scrutiny with which inequity will be examined. These courts set a minimum floor below which no district shall fall, but which others are free to exceed. The minimum floor, however, is implicitly related to the general level of education elsewhere.</p>
<p class="indent">5. The court in <i>Leandro</i> repeatedly emphasizes that the administration of education is best left to the legislature. It, nonetheless, recognizes the court’s authority and responsibility to intervene under certain circumstances. Is this court more deferential to the legislature than previous courts or is this just feigned deference? What level of deference is appropriate?</p>
<p class="indent">6. This chapter is titled “Poverty” rather than “School Finance.” The case excerpts, thus far, have devoted relatively little attention to poor children and their plight and have focused more on doctrinal, financial, practical, and institutional issues. This is not to say that litigants have not framed the issue around poverty and need. For instance, in <i>Leandro</i>, the plaintiff-intervenors argued “that due to the particular demographics of their urban districts, which include many disadvantaged children,” they would also require additional funds to meet the needs of their students. Leandro v. State, 488 S.E.2d 249, 251 (N.C. 1997). The court, however, treated the claim as “repetitious” of the claim “that the state must provide all of its children with the opportunity to receive a sound basic education.” <i>Id.</i> at 252. It is true that, if all students are receiving an adequate education, disadvantaged or poor students would be receiving an adequate education. But does the delivery of an adequate education to disadvantaged students raise issues that warrant specific treatment beyond global issues of school finance and state policy? What additional issues should courts address? Is there any practical or political reason to avoid addressing the plight of poor children with specificity? Does the fact that much of this litigation is brought and financed by school districts rather than students tend to shift the focus to money and policy?</p>

<p class="h7" id="ch73">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Revisit the education clause in your state constitution. To the extent it implies some educational right, is the implication more in the nature of a fundamental right to education or a right to an adequate education? Based on the cases you have read thus far, is the specific language of an education clause determinative on this issue, or are other factors more important? As a practical matter, is adequacy or equity preferable?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch74">3. <i>Demonstrating a Constitutional Violation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Demonstrating educational inadequacy is extremely fact intensive. Trials routinely run months and touch on a number of different issues in districts across an entire state. The following case involves a full record of a plaintiff’s attempt to prove inadequacy and a court’s attempt to categorize and frame the relevant facts.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch75">DeRolph v. Ohio</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>677 N.E.2d 733 (Ohio 1997)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Today, Ohio stands at a crossroads. We must decide whether the promise of providing to our youth a free, public elementary and secondary education in a “thorough and efficient system” has been fulfilled. The importance of this case cannot be overestimated. It involves a wholesale constitutional attack on Ohio’s system of funding public elementary and secondary education. Practically every Ohioan will be affected by our decision: the 1.8 million children in public schools and every taxpayer in the state. For the 1.8 million children involved, this case is about the opportunity to compete and succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon a full consideration of the record and in analyzing the pertinent constitutional provision, we can reach but one conclusion: the current legislation fails to provide for a thorough and efficient system of common schools, in violation of Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Ohio’s System of Public School Financing</span></p>
<p class="indent">Ohio’s statutory scheme for financing public education is complex. At the heart of the present controversy is the School Foundation Program (R.C. Chapter 3317) for allocation of state basic aid and the manner in which the allocation formula and other school funding factors have caused or permitted to continue vast wealth-based disparities among Ohio’s schools, depriving many of Ohio’s public school students of high quality educational opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">According to statute, the revenue available to a school district comes from two primary sources: state revenue, most of which is provided through the School Foundation Program, and local revenue, which consists primarily of locally voted school district property tax levies. Federal funds play a minor</p>
<p><a id="page_201" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>201</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">role in the financing scheme. Ohio relies more on local revenue than state revenue, contrary to the national trend.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the foundation program, state basic aid is available for school districts that levy at least twenty mills of local property tax revenue for current operating expenses. State basic aid for qualifying school districts is calculated each biennium as part of the General Assembly’s budget pursuant to a formula set forth in R.C. 3317.022.</p>
<p class="indent">The “formula amount” has no real relation to what it actually costs to educate a pupil. In fact, Dr. Howard B. Fleeter, Assistant Professor at the School of Public Policy and Management at Ohio State University, stated that the foundation dollar amount “is a budgetary residual, which is determined as a result of working backwards through the state aid formula after the legislature determines the total dollars to be allocated to primary and secondary education in each biennial budget. Thus, the foundation level reflects political and budgetary considerations at least as much as it reflects a judgment as to how much money <i>should</i> be spent on K-12 education.”</p>
<p class="indent">The foundation formula amount, which was set at $2,817 per pupil in the 1992-1993 school year is adjusted by a school district equalization factor, now called the “cost of doing business” factor. These rates of adjustment vary from county to county and apply equally to all districts within the county without regard to the actual costs of operations within the individual school districts. The cost-of-doing-business factor assumes that costs are lower in rural districts than in urban districts.</p>
<p class="indent">A target amount of combined local and state aid per district is reached by multiplying the formula amount, the cost-of-doing-business factor, and the average daily membership. However, subtracted or “charged off” from that figure is the total taxable value of real and tangible personal property in the district times a certain percentage. Subtracting the applicable charge-off results in a figure constituting basic state aid for the district in question. The effect of an increase in this percentage would be to decrease the amount of basic state aid, resulting in an even greater burden for local schools to fund education through local property and/or income taxes.</p>
<p class="indent">The financing scheme is further complicated when special factors are taken into account. For instance, additional appropriations may be made for categorical programs, such as vocational education, special education, and transportation. However, no adjustment is made for the relative wealth of the receiving district. Moreover, children in funded handicapped “units” are not included in the state basic aid formula. Thus, funds for handicapped students, for instance, whose education costs are substantially higher (due to state mandates of small class size and because of related extra services) are disbursed in a flat amount per unit. If the actual cost exceeds the funds received, wealthier districts are in a better position to make up the difference.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, school districts with children whose families collect Aid to Dependent Children (“ADC”) receive additional distributions which increase according to the concentration of ADC pupils. However, the level of distributions freezes once the concentration reaches twenty percent. Thus, districts with higher concentrations of ADC pupils are forced to carry more of the extra</p>
<p><a id="page_202" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>202</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">cost. Moreover, testimony revealed that above the twenty-percent concentration level, educational need increases at a faster rate than the concentration percentage.</p>
<p class="indent">The School Foundation Program does contain certain guarantees so that a school district receives the greater of the program amount or the guarantee amount. However, testimony revealed that the guarantees work to the substantial benefit of the wealthier districts and represent a flaw in the system of school funding, because they work against the equalization effect of the formula.</p>
<p class="indent">Another weakness in the system is certain “tax reduction factors” introduced to limit growth of real property tax revenues that would otherwise occur as a consequence of inflation of property values. R.C. 319.301 requires the application of tax reduction factors when property values increase due to reappraisal or update. The result is that a school district will receive the same number of dollars from voted tax levies after reappraisal as it did before reappraisal, even though real property valuation in the district has increased through real estate inflation. As a direct result of these tax reduction measures, local revenues cannot keep pace with inflation, and school districts have been required to propose additional tax levies—most of which ultimately fail.</p>
<p class="indent">H.B. No. 920 has also resulted in a phenomenon called “phantom revenue.” As already explained, tax reduction factors limit revenue growth that would otherwise occur due to inflation of real property values. However, at the same time, the increased valuation of property is taken into account in the charge-off portion of the foundation formula. Thus, a school district can experience an increase in the valuation of its taxable real property without enjoying any additional income and yet receive less under the formula because the total taxable value of property has increased.</p>
<p class="indent">Another inherent weakness in the system stems from forced borrowing. Districts unable to meet their budgets are forced to borrow funds [from the state. If state loans are insufficient, districts must borrow from a commercial lender. To borrow from a commercial lender, local school boards must] declare by resolution that they are unable to remain open for instruction and are unable to meet their expenses. The board must then request that the State Auditor determine that such a condition exists. If the Auditor finds that the board has exhausted all available revenue sources, the Auditor must certify that finding to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Education and must also certify the amount of operating deficit the district will have at the end of the fiscal year. A school district that has been certified as having a projected operating deficit must apply for a loan from a commercial lender. However, if the commercial loan is denied, a school district must submit a plan for reducing the district’s budget. The budget reduction plan must provide for repayment of the loan within two years (ten years for very large amounts), but the plan need not provide for repayment of any spending reserve loan. The loan is repaid by diverting funds otherwise available to the school district under the School Foundation Program to the commercial lender. R.C. 3313.483(E)(3).</p>
<p class="indent">The debt which stems from mandated borrowing programs is in many instances staggering, and the cyclical effect of continued borrowing has made</p>
<p><a id="page_203" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>203</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">it more difficult to maintain even minimal school operations. See R.C. 133.301 and 3313.483. These loan programs, discussed above, are nothing less than a clever disguise for the state’s failure to raise revenue sufficient to discharge its constitutional obligations.</p>
<p class="indent">The School Foundation Program contains no aid expressly for capital improvements for Ohio’s public schools. Aid for that purpose is provided by the Classroom Facilities Act, R.C. Chapter 3318. However, the evidence showed, and the trial court found, that the Act is insufficiently funded to meet the needs of districts that are poor in real property value.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">A “Thorough and Efficient System of Common Schools”</span></p>
<p class="indent">In urging this court to strike the statutory provisions relating to Ohio’s school financing system, appellants argue that the state has failed in its constitutional responsibility to provide a thorough and efficient system of public schools. We agree.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution requires the <i>state</i> to provide and fund a system of public education and includes an explicit directive to the General Assembly: “The general assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State.”</p>
<p class="indent">[Legislative history and our prior decisions have “construed the words ‘thorough and efficient’ ” to mean a ‘system of schools throughout the state’ that is not local, not municipal, but <i>state-wide</i>.” Moreover, a “thorough system could not mean one in which part or any number of the school districts of the state were starved for funds. An efficient system could not mean one in which part or any number of the school districts of the state lacked teachers, buildings, or equipment.”]</p>
<p class="indent">[W]e find that exhaustive evidence was presented to establish that the appellant school districts were starved for funds, lacked teachers, buildings, and equipment, and had inferior educational programs, and that their pupils were being deprived of educational opportunity.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1989, the General Assembly directed the Superintendent of Public Instruction to conduct a survey of Ohio’s public school buildings. The purpose of this survey was to determine the cost of bringing all facilities into compliance with state building codes and asbestos removal requirements, as well as all other state and local provisions related to health and safety. The results of this study were published in the 1990 Ohio Public School Facility Survey. The survey identified a need for $10.2 billion in facility repair and construction. Among its findings, the survey determined that one-half of Ohio’s school buildings were fifty years old or older, and fifteen percent were seventy years old or older. A little over half of these buildings contained satisfactory electrical systems; however, only seventeen percent of the heating systems and thirty-one percent of the roofs were deemed to be satisfactory. Nineteen percent of the windows and twenty-five percent of the plumbing and fixtures were found to be adequate. Only twenty percent of the buildings had satisfactory handicapped</p>
<p><a id="page_204" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>204</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">access. A scant thirty percent of the school facilities had adequate fire alarm systems and exterior doors.</p>
<p class="indent">Over three years after the 1990 survey was published, the current Superintendent of Public Instruction, John Theodore Sanders, averred that his visits to Ohio school buildings demonstrated that some students were “making do in a decayed carcass from an era long passed,” and others were educated in “dirty, depressing places.”</p>
<p class="indent">Robert Franklin, the Building Assistance Supervisor for the Ohio Department of Education, gave disturbing examples of incidents where the health and safety of students were threatened. In Buckeye Local, Belmont County, three hundred students were hospitalized because carbon monoxide leaked out of heaters and furnaces. In another school district in Wayne County, an elementary school built in 1903 had floors so thin that a teacher’s foot went through the floor while she was walking across her classroom.</p>
<p class="indent">Another major health and safety hazard is asbestos, which has yet to be removed from 68.6 percent of Ohio’s school buildings, in direct violation of a 1987 mandate by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In fact, over ninety-nine percent of public school structures in Ohio have asbestos in them. For fiscal year 1990, over two hundred forty school districts applied for $140,000,000 in asbestos-abatement money from the state. Only sixty-three districts received funds.</p>
<p class="indent">Other conditions which existed within the appellant school districts were equally deplorable. In the Dawson-Bryant school system, where a coal heating system is used, students are subjected to breathing coal dust that is emitted into the air and actually covers the students’ desks after accumulating overnight. Band members are forced to use a former coal bin for practice sessions where there is no ventilation whatsoever, causing students to complain of headaches. Special education classes are also held in a former closet that has one bare lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">Deering Elementary is not handicapped accessible. The library is a former storage area located in the basement. Handicapped students have to be carried there and to other locations in the building. One handicapped third-grader at Deering had never been to the school library because it was inaccessible to someone in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="indent">Equally alarming are the conditions found in the Southern Local School District in Perry County, where buildings are crumbling and chunks of plaster fall from the walls and ceiling. In fact, the problem was so severe that the principal and custodians at Miller Junior High at Shawnee deliberately knocked plaster off the ceilings so that the plaster would not fall on the students during the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, state funding of school districts cannot be considered adequate if the districts lack sufficient funds to provide their students a safe and healthy learning environment.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to deteriorating buildings and related conditions, it is clear from the record that many of the school districts throughout the state cannot provide the basic resources necessary to educate our youth. For instance, many of the appellant school districts have insufficient funds to purchase textbooks and must</p>
<p><a id="page_205" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>205</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">rely on old, outdated books. For some classes, there were no textbooks at all. For example, at Southern Local during the 1992-1993 school year, none of the students in a Spanish I class had a textbook at the beginning of the year. Later, there was a lottery for books. Students who picked the lucky numbers received a book.</p>
<p class="indent">The accessibility of everyday supplies is also a problem, forcing schools to ration such necessities as paper, chalk, art supplies, paper clips, and even toilet paper. A system without basic instructional materials and supplies can hardly constitute a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state as mandated by our Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, many districts lack sufficient funds to comply with the state law requiring a district-wide average of no more than twenty-five students for each classroom teacher. Ohio Adm. Code 3301-35-03(A)(3). Indeed, some schools have more than thirty students per classroom teacher, with one school having as many as thirty-nine students in one sixth grade class. As the testimony of educators established, it is virtually impossible for students to receive an adequate education with a student-teacher ratio of this magnitude.</p>
<p class="indent">The curricula in the appellant school districts are severely limited compared to other school districts and compared to what might be expected of a system designed to educate Ohio’s youth and to prepare them for a bright and prosperous future. For example, elementary students at Dawson-Bryant have no opportunity to take foreign language courses, computer courses, or music or art classes other than band. Junior high students in this district have no science lab. In addition, Dawson-Bryant offers no honors program and no advanced placement courses, which disqualifies some of the students from even being considered for a scholarship or admittance to some universities. Dawson-Bryant is not alone—similar problems were being experienced by each of the appellant school districts.</p>
<p class="indent">None of the appellant school districts is financially able to keep up with the technological training needs of the students in the districts. The districts lack sufficient computers, computer labs, hands-on computer training, software, and related supplies to properly serve the students’ needs. In this regard, it does not appear likely that the children in the appellant school districts will be able to compete in the job market against those students with sufficient technological training.</p>
<p class="indent">Lack of sufficient funding can also lead to poor academic performance. Proficiency tests are a method of measuring education. The ninth grade proficiency test was designed to measure that body of knowledge pupils are expected to have mastered by the ninth grade. Passage of the ninth grade proficiency test is required before a student may receive a high school diploma. As of the fall of 1993, thirty-two out of ninety-nine seniors at Dawson-Bryant had not passed all parts of the ninth grade proficiency test. This means that nearly one-third of the senior class had not met basic graduation requirements. The district did not have enough money to pay tutors to assist these students. Poor performance on the ninth grade proficiency tests is further evidence that these schools lack sufficient funds with which to educate their students.</p>
<p><a id="page_206" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>206</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The dissent emphasizes that since schools have complied with minimum standards enacted in 1983, students are being provided with an adequate education. However, in March 1992, the State Superintendent suspended routine minimum standard evaluations. Consequently, these minimum standards have not been regularly enforced since that time.</p>
<p class="indent">All the facts documented in the record lead to one inescapable conclusion—Ohio’s elementary and secondary public schools are neither thorough nor efficient. The operation of the appellant school districts conflicts with the historical notion that the education of our youth is of utmost concern and that Ohio children should be educated adequately so that they are able to participate fully in society. Our state Constitution was drafted with the importance of education in mind. In contrast, education under the legislation being reviewed ranks miserably low in the state’s priorities. In fact, the formula amount is established after the legislature determines the total dollars to be allocated to primary and secondary education in each biennial budget. Consequently, the present school financing system contravenes the clear wording of our Constitution and the framers’ intent.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, rather than following the constitutional dictate that it is the <i>state’s</i> obligation to fund education (as this opinion has repeatedly underscored), the legislature has thrust the majority of responsibility upon local school districts. This, too, is contrary to the clear wording of our Constitution. The responsibility for maintaining a thorough and efficient school system falls upon the state. When a district falls short of the constitutional requirement that the system be thorough and efficient, it is the state’s obligation to rectify it.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he evidence is overwhelming that many districts are “starved for funds,” and lack teachers, buildings, or equipment. These school districts, plagued with deteriorating buildings, insufficient supplies, inadequate curricula and technology, and large student-teacher ratios, desperately lack the resources necessary to provide students with a minimally adequate education. Thus, it is painfully obvious that the General Assembly, in structuring school financing, has failed in its constitutional obligation to ensure a thorough and efficient system of common schools. Clearly, the current school financing scheme is a far cry from thorough and efficient. Instead, the system has failed to educate our youth to their fullest potential.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he evidence clearly indicates that the funding level set by today’s School Foundation Program has absolutely no connection with what is necessary to provide each district enough money to ensure an adequate educational program. The system in place today differs dramatically from that in place nearly twenty years ago [and upheld by this Court].</p>
<p class="indent">We recognize that money alone is not the panacea that will transform Ohio’s school system into a model of excellence. Although a student’s success depends upon numerous factors besides money, we must ensure that there is enough money that students have the chance to succeed because of the educational opportunity provided, not in spite of it. Such an opportunity requires, at the very least, that all of Ohio’s children attend schools which are safe and conducive to learning. At the present, Ohio does not provide many of its students with even the most basic of educational needs.</p>
<p><a id="page_207" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>207</b></a></p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What are the indicia of an inadequate or inefficient education in Ohio? Is this sort of evidence relevant in all school finance cases, regardless of the underlying legal theory? The court also identifies six or more major flaws in Ohio’s finance mechanisms. What rationale explains these mechanisms? Is there any argument that these deficiencies do not demonstrate a constitutional violation?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The deficiencies described by the court were particularly egregious in Ohio, but the court does not identify at what point those deficiencies cross the line to become unconstitutional. Would less severe conditions be constitutional? Would this court have intervened in Ohio’s education system if the problem was significant qualitative differences between districts, but none that included the type of deplorable conditions detailed in this opinion? Consider that educational quality spans a large spectrum. A court could theoretically place the constitutional standard at various different places on that spectrum. Some schools may be so low in quality that they would fall below any standard. Where this is true, the prevalence of deplorable school conditions may be as, if not more, important than the standard a court adopts.</p>
<p class="indent">3. What if egregious conditions existed, but they were random rather than systematic? When are deficiencies the fault of the local school district rather than the state? Are certain variances and deficiencies inevitable and thus not evidence of a violation, or must the state essentially perfect its education system?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Based on the cases you have read thus far, what evidence most compellingly demonstrates a constitutional violation: money, school quality, basic resources, student outcomes? What other types of evidence beyond those discussed in the cases might demonstrate a constitutional violation?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch76">4. <i>Causation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">School finance and quality cases hinge on plaintiffs’ ability to prove that educational inequities and qualitative shortfalls are causally connected to a state policy or practice. One might succinctly state the question in most cases as being whether funding variations are the cause of differences in education quality. But the factual inquiry tends to be far more complex, regardless of how definitively a court might state its final causal conclusions. For instance, one might ask whether the state funding formula is the cause of funding variances at the local level or differences in local effort cause the variances. The answer to that question, however, only leads to a second question: If state policy is the cause of local variance, does the variance cause qualitative differences at the local level?</p>
<p class="indent">These causal questions address two different and distinct types of causation that plaintiffs must address. First, plaintiffs must establish that a state statute or policy is the cause of some precise financial, resource, or other tangible deficiency in local school districts. Second, plaintiffs must establish that the deficiency, not some other factor, causes educational harm to students. As the North Carolina Supreme Court emphasized: “[I]t is one thing for plaintiffs to demonstrate that a large number of Hoke County students are failing to obtain a sound,</p>
<p><a id="page_208" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>208</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">basic public education. It is quite another for plaintiffs to show that such a failure is primarily the result of action and/or inaction of the State.” Hoke Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. State, 599 S.E.2d 365, 386 (N.C. 2004).</p>
<p class="indent">In the earliest years of school finance litigation, some courts were willing to infer causal connections based on general social science or common sense. Subsequent courts increasingly parsed out distinct causal inquiries and required specific supporting statistical evidence. This step in a plaintiff’s claim is far more challenging than establishing the mere fact that students have suffered an educational deprivation at the local level. A state might concede the existence of educational inequities or deprivations at the local level, but the state, if not the court, will inevitably raise the possibility that state action is not the cause of local educational deficiencies. If plaintiffs allege schools do not have enough money to maintain their facilities, for instance, the state will question whether its action or inaction is the cause of the money shortfall. This causal inquiry frequently leads to lengthy judicial discussions of how school financing works and whether the financing system places too much burden on localities. It may be that some similarly situated districts can maintain adequate facilities, while others cannot. If this is the case, local action or random variables may be the cause of deprivations rather than the state.</p>
<p class="indent">After establishing a causal connection between state policy and local deficiencies, plaintiffs must also establish a causal connection between the deficiency—for instance, teacher qualifications—and educational outcomes. New York’s highest court provides one of the most poignant delineations of this two-step causation analysis. In analyzing various alleged inadequacies in inputs (teachers, class size, facilities, computers, libraries, and textbooks), the court asked whether each one was causally connected to the deprivation of the constitutionally required education. Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State, 801 N.E.2d 326, 340-341 (N.Y. 2003). Plaintiffs’ burden was to establish “the necessary ‘causal link’ between the present funding system and the poor performance of City schools.” Id. at 335, 340-341. This means proving that: (1) increased funding leads to “better teachers, facilities and instrumentalities of learning” and (2) better teachers, facilities, and instrumentalities “yield better student performance.” Id. at 340. Speaking of the second link in this causal chain, the court wrote: “[O]n this record it cannot be said that plaintiffs have proved a measurable correlation between building disrepair and student performance.” Id. at 334-335. But in regard to teachers, it concluded that the evidence demonstrated “that better funded schools would hire and retain more certified teachers, and that students with such teachers would score better.” Id. at 340-341.</p>
<p class="indent">To reliably address this second step of causation, plaintiffs’ evidence needs to account for any number of variables, including, at the very least, locality costs, locality capacity, and student demographics (poverty, language status, race, and disability). States tend to point to some of these same factors and argue that student characteristics are beyond the state’s control, and that student characteristics—not state policy—are the primary causal factor in student outcomes. See, e.g., Sheff v. O’Neill, 678 A.2d 1267, 1287 (Conn. 1996) (stating that “defendants stress…the significant role that adverse socioeconomic conditions play”); Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 341 (examining State’s argument that “children come to the New York City schools ineducable, unfit to</p>
<p><a id="page_209" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>209</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">learn”); Hoke Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. State, 599 S.E.2d 365, 384 (N.C. 2004) (arguing that “students…failing to obtain a sound basic education…is due to factors other than the educational offerings provided by the State”).</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch77">5. <i>Separation of Powers Limitations</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Litigation over the meaning of state educational clauses tests courts unlike most any other claim. State educational clause litigation tests the institutional <i>authority</i> of courts, whereas desegregation, for instance, tests institutional <i>power</i>. In retrospect, there is little doubt that federal courts had the authority to command desegregation; the question was whether they would have the power to compel it in the face of political resistance. In fact, danger lay with simply testing this issue, for a failed assertion of power would have undermined the Supreme Court’s long-term institutional legitimacy. This danger led the Court to proceed cautiously in desegregation.</p>
<p class="indent">State courts adjudicating educational rights face a different, yet equally serious, institutional problem that prompts extreme caution. Courts in the cases you have read thus far routinely acknowledge that they are deciding issues that are at the outer bounds of their competency and jurisdiction. First, state constitutions typically vest authority for delivering educational rights in the state or state legislature. For instance, the North Carolina Constitution states: “The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right.” N.C. Const. art. I, §15. Similarly, Rhode Island’s constitution provides that “it shall be the duty of the general assembly to promote public schools…and to adopt all means which it may deem necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education.” R.I. Const. art. XII, §1. While such clauses obligate states to provide education, they vest vast, if not total, discretion in the legislature as to how to deliver education. Thus, only in rare circumstances would a court have the authority to adjudicate matters relating to that delivery. In short, separation of powers principles place significant constraints on courts.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, even if a legislature does not have vast discretion, adjudicating the quality and funding of education can involve pedagogical, value, and political judgments that courts feel ill equipped to resolve. The following case provides an example of a court grappling with these issues and, unlike the previous cases, refusing to entertain a lawsuit under the state’s education clause. It also points out that other courts have done the same.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">We first consider the dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims that the statutory system for financing public schools violates the education article of our state constitution. [T]he Illinois Constitution of 1970 provides: “A fundamental goal of the</p>
<p><a id="page_210" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>210</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">People of the State is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. <i>The State shall provide for an efficient system of high quality public educational institutions and services.</i> Education in public schools through the secondary level shall be free. There may be such other free education as the General Assembly provides by law. The State has the primary responsibility for financing the system of public education.” Ill. Const. 1970, art. X, §1.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs’ challenge to the statutory system for financing public schools is based on the emphasized language above. First, plaintiffs contend that because the system produces vast disparities in the level of funding and educational resources available to various school districts based on differences in local taxable property wealth, it is not “efficient” within the meaning of the constitution. Second, plaintiffs argue that school districts with low property tax bases are unable to provide a “high quality” education to their students due to inadequate funding. Third, plaintiffs contend that under the financing scheme, funding is insufficient to provide a “high quality” education to at-risk children.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">We first consider plaintiffs’ argument that the present school funding system is not “efficient” within the meaning of the constitution because it produces disparities in educational resources and services based on differences in local taxable property wealth. In plaintiffs’ view, the efficiency requirement guarantees some measure of equality in educational funding and opportunity. Plaintiffs deny that they seek absolute uniformity in educational offerings or precisely equal spending. Plaintiffs would apparently approve variations in educational spending from district to district based on criteria such as local differences in the costs of resources and special educational needs in particular districts. However, plaintiffs maintain that a school district’s property wealth is “educationally irrelevant” and is not a proper factor upon which to set the level of resources available to the district.</p>
<p class="indent">“Efficient” has been defined as follows: “1: serving as or characteristic of an efficient cause: causally productive: Operant 2: marked by ability to choose and use the most effective and least wasteful means of doing a task or accomplishing a purpose.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 725 (1981).</p>
<p class="indent">This definition does not inherently compel the conclusion that an “efficient system” of public schools necessarily involves statewide parity of educational opportunity and resources. However, we do not believe that the precise meaning of the word “efficient” as used in section 1 of the education article is entirely clear and free from doubt, or that “efficient” could not conceivably be interpreted in the manner that plaintiffs claim. We note that the Court of Appeals of Maryland determined that Maryland’s constitutional requirement that the General Assembly establish a “thorough and efficient” system of free public schools was “on its face plainly susceptible of more than one meaning.” <i>Hornbeck v. Somerset County Board of Education</i>, 458 A.2d 758, 770 (1983). In determining whether the “thorough and efficient” provision required exact equality in per pupil funding and expenditures among Maryland’s school districts, the <i>Hornbeck</i> court deemed it essential to consider the history underlying</p>
<p><a id="page_211" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>211</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the enactment of the provision. <i>Hornbeck</i>, 458 A.2d at 770. Courts in other jurisdictions with similar constitutional efficiency provisions have also looked to sources beyond the language of the constitution to determine the meaning of those provisions. We shall likewise consider the history underlying the adoption of section 1 of the education article.</p>
<p class="indent">The education article of the 1970 Constitution originated as a proposal submitted by the education committee of the Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention. At the outset, we note that an introductory passage in the education committee’s report on the proposed education article states, “[t]he opportunity for an education, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” Considered in isolation, this statement might lend some credence to plaintiffs’ position. However, this general statement of principle was not made in reference to the efficiency requirement or any other specific language in the proposed education article. Instead, as authority for this proposition the education committee report cites <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, which was, of course, based on the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution. As explained below, specific references in the convention record to the efficiency requirement place the concept in a significantly different light.</p>
<p class="indent">The constitutional requirement that the State provide for an efficient system of high quality educational institutions and services corresponds to section 1 of article VIII of the 1870 Constitution, which stated, “The general assembly shall provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, whereby all children of this state may receive a good common school education.” Under the 1870 Constitution, this court consistently held that the question of the efficiency and thoroughness of the school system was one solely for the legislature to answer, and that the courts lacked the power to intrude.</p>
<p class="indent">However, under a limited exception to this principle it was held that pursuant to the “thorough and efficient” requirement school district boundaries must be established so that the districts are compact and contiguous. As explained in <i>People ex rel. Leighty v. Young</i>, 133 N.E. 693 (1921), “[i]t cannot be said that a system which places the school house at a point so remote that the children of school age cannot reach it conveniently is either thorough or efficient.” School districts organized in contravention of the requirements of compactness and contiguity have been held invalid.</p>
<p class="indent">The framers of the 1970 Constitution embraced this limited construction that the constitutional efficiency requirement authorized judicial review of school district boundaries, but they did not intend to otherwise limit legislative discretion. The education committee’s report accompanying the proposed education article specifically states, “The concept of the efficiency of the system (already contained in the present Constitution) has been used by the courts as a guide to the validation of district boundary changes. The Committee believes it useful to continue this concept and to add the notion of high quality.”</p>
<p class="indent">Disparity in educational funding was a highly charged and controversial subject during the constitutional convention, but it was not touched upon to any significant degree in connection with section 1’s efficiency requirement. Instead, the debate over unequal opportunities and resources ultimately led to the</p>
<p><a id="page_212" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>212</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">incorporation of section 1’s final sentence, which provides that “[t]he State has the primary responsibility for financing the system of public education.” Ill. Const. 1970, art. X, §1. That language did not appear in the education committee’s originally proposed education article. [That section was added “not [as] a legally obligatory command to the state legislature,” but “only to express a goal or objective, and not to state a specific command.” The framers rejected the previous version because it could have been construed to the contrary.]</p>
<p class="indent">In our view, the framers of the 1970 Constitution viewed educational equality and “efficiency” to be separate and distinct subjects. The framers of the 1970 Constitution grappled with the issue of unequal educational funding and opportunity, and chose to address the problem with a purely hortatory statement of principle. To ignore this careful and deliberate choice by interpreting the efficiency requirement as an enforceable guarantee of equality would do violence to the framers’ understanding of the education article.</p>
<p class="indent">In view of the foregoing considerations, we agree with the courts below that disparities in educational funding resulting from differences in local property wealth do not offend section 1’s efficiency requirement.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The remaining question under section 1 of the education article pertains to its guarantee of a system of “high quality” educational institutions and services. There is no dispute as to the nature of this guarantee in the abstract. Instead, the central issue is whether the quality of education is capable of or properly subject to measurement by the courts. Plaintiffs maintain that it is the courts’ duty to construe the constitution and determine whether school funding legislation conforms with its requirements and cite a number of decisions from other jurisdictions [to the same effect]. As explained below, however, we conclude that questions relating to the quality of education are solely for the legislative branch to answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, this court has assumed only an exceedingly limited role in matters relating to public education, recognizing that educational policy is almost exclusively within the province of the legislative branch. Section 1 of article VIII of the 1870 Constitution provided that “[t]he general assembly shall provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, whereby all children of this state may receive a good common school education.” As discussed earlier, except in matters relating to school district boundaries, this court consistently held that questions relating to the efficiency and thoroughness of the school system were left to the wisdom of the legislative branch. This principle has likewise been applied with respect to the efficiency requirement in the 1970 Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">More generally, it has been stated that section 1 of article VIII of the 1870 Constitution was both “a mandate to the legislature and a limitation on the exercise of the [legislative] power. The mandate is to provide a thorough and efficient system of schools, and the limitations are that they shall be free to all children of the State and such that all children may receive a good common school education.” <i>People ex rel. Leighty v. Young</i>, 139 N.E. 894 (1923). Yet, while</p>
<p><a id="page_213" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>213</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the requirement that schools provide a “good common school education” was explicitly recognized to be a limitation on the legislature’s power to enact public school laws, that limitation was not among those held generally capable of <i>judicial</i> enforcement. <i>Fiedler v. Eckfeldt</i>, 166 N.E. 504 (1929), illustrates this subtle but important point: “[Section 1 of article VIII of the 1870 Constitution] was a command addressed to the legislature, and it has been construed as a limitation also on its power to provide for the maintenance by local taxation of free schools of a different character from that named in the section. When we look for the limitations on that power we find these two, and these two only, <i>which the courts can enforce:</i> that the schools shall be free, and that they shall be open to all equally. The court has enforced these limitations when the occasion requiring the enforcement of them arose. There are no others <i>to which the judicial power extends.</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding this jurisprudence, plaintiffs insist that our present constitution accommodates a more active judicial role. In this regard, plaintiffs stress that while the 1870 Constitution specified that the <i>General Assembly</i> shall provide a system of public schools, the 1970 Constitution expressly places that duty on <i>the State</i>. In plaintiffs’ view, the change in language signifies that section 1 of the education article is no longer merely a mandate to the General Assembly, but is a mandate to <i>all three</i> branches of the State government: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. Surely, however, this provision does not alter the roles or expand the powers assigned to the different branches of government by the constitution. Courts may not legislate in the field of public education any more than they may legislate in any other area. In reviewing legislation, the role of the courts is now, as before, to ensure that the enactment does not exceed whatever <i>judicially enforceable</i> limitations the constitution places on the General Assembly’s power. Courts are no more capable of defining “high quality educational institutions and services” under our present constitution than they were able to define a “good common school education” under the 1870 Constitution. As the following exchange during the constitutional convention shows, the framers of the 1970 Constitution did not intend to formulate any specific definition of “high quality,” nor did they anticipate that the concept would be defined by the courts. [As one member of the education committee indicated,] “ ‘Quality,’ I suppose, means different things to different people. We had in mind the highest, the most excellent educational system possible; leave this up to the determination of the legislature and your local districts, and let the citizens keep pushing for higher-quality education. We didn’t attempt to define all of the ramifications of high quality.”</p>
<p class="indent">Our constitutional jurisprudence in the field of public education has been guided by considerations of separation of powers. In federal courts, the principles of separation of powers find expression in the so-called “political question” doctrine. The United States Supreme Court has stated that, “ ‘[i]n determining whether a question falls within [the political question] category, the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments <i>and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination</i> are dominant considerations.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">What constitutes a “high quality” education, and how it may best be provided, cannot be ascertained by any judicially discoverable or manageable</p>
<p><a id="page_214" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>214</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">standards. The constitution provides no principled basis for a judicial definition of high quality. It would be a transparent conceit to suggest that whatever standards of quality courts might develop would actually be derived from the constitution in any meaningful sense. Nor is education a subject within the judiciary’s field of expertise, such that a judicial role in giving content to the education guarantee might be warranted. Rather, the question of educational quality is inherently one of policy involving philosophical and practical considerations that call for the exercise of legislative and administrative discretion.</p>
<p class="indent">To hold that the question of educational quality is subject to judicial determination would largely deprive the members of the general public of a voice in a matter which is close to the hearts of all individuals in Illinois. Judicial determination of the type of education children should receive and how it can best be provided would depend on the opinions of whatever expert witnesses the litigants might call to testify and whatever other evidence they might choose to present. Members of the general public, however, would be obliged to listen in respectful silence. We certainly do not mean to trivialize the views of educators, school administrators and others who have studied the problems which public schools confront. But nonexperts—students, parents, employers and others—also have important views and experiences to contribute which are not easily reckoned through formal judicial factfinding. In contrast, an open and robust public debate is the lifeblood of the political process in our system of representative democracy. Solutions to problems of educational quality should emerge from a spirited dialogue between the people of the State and their elected representatives.</p>
<p class="indent">We are well aware that courts in other jurisdictions have seen fit to define the contours of a constitutionally guaranteed education and to establish judicial standards of educational quality reflecting varying degrees of specificity and deference to the other branches of government. By and large these courts have viewed the process of formulating educational standards as merely an exercise in constitutional interpretation or construction. For the reasons already stated, we disagree; we will not “under the guise of constitutional interpretation, presume to lay down guidelines or ultimatums for [the legislature].”</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that the question of whether the educational institutions and services in Illinois are “high quality” is outside the sphere of the judicial function. To the extent plaintiffs’ claim that the system for financing public schools is unconstitutional rests on perceived deficiencies in the quality of education in public schools, the claim was properly dismissed. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims under the education article of our state constitution.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">We next consider whether the alleged disparities in educational funding and opportunity due to variations in local property wealth give rise to a cause of action under the equal protection clause of our state constitution. [This court has held that the analysis that applies to equal protection claims under the Illinois equal protection clause is the same analysis as that which applies to the federal</p>
<p><a id="page_215" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>215</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">equal protection clause. With that in mind, the first question is whether education is a fundamental right under the Illinois Constitution. “This court has stated that fundamental rights are ‘only those which’ lie at the heart of the relationship between the individual and a republican form of nationally integrated government.” While it is true that education relates to and enhances various forms of citizenship, fundamental rights analysis is concerned with laws that restrain rather than enhance the exercise of rights. Moreover, it is significant that the framers of our constitutional clause refrained from describing the delivery of high-quality education as a goal rather than a right. For these reasons, we find that education is not a fundamental right in Illinois and, thus, apply rational basis review to educational inequalities. Like the Court in <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i>, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the legislature. While the current system of financing schools may be unwise, we cannot say it is irrational.]</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What educational rights and responsibilities, if any, does the Illinois Constitution create? Is there a difference between education as a goal and education as a fundamental right?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What are plaintiffs’ three primary theories of how the state’s financing system violates the state constitution?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Is there a plain meaning of “efficient” that ought to guide the court in Illinois, or is the phrase too ambiguous? What is the court’s rationale as to why the constitutional language regarding an efficient and high-quality education is not implicated by the inequalities and inadequacies among school districts? Does the fact that the legislative framers sought to resolve problems with school boundaries through the efficiency requirement mean that efficiency does not apply to other issues as well? If efficiency does not require equality, what does it require?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Is it plausible to read the constitutional language mandating the provision of “high-quality” education as creating no substantive obligation that the courts can enforce? Even if high quality cannot be precisely defined, would it require, at least, a minimally adequate education, which might be more susceptible to interpretation?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Is there any way to reconcile <i>Edgar</i> with other courts that have answered these questions differently? The court in <i>Edgar</i> says that other courts were legislating under the guise of constrained interpretation. Who is correct?</p>
<p class="indent">6. The court in <i>Edgar</i> distinguishes between (1) rights that would constrain government action that interferes with individuals and (2) rights that place affirmative obligations on government. The court reasons that fundamental rights fall in the former category and nonfundamental rights in the latter. Is this, in fact, the line between fundamental and nonfundamental rights, or does something else distinguish them? Do some fundamental rights place an affirmative obligation on the state? Even if education is not a fundamental right in Illinois, should that automatically lead to the conclusion that rational basis</p>
<p><a id="page_216" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>216</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">applies, or does the explicit constitutional reference to education imply some level of protection beyond rational basis?</p>
<p class="indent">7. The court reasons that educational judgments and the enforcement of them are best left to voters and the political process. Does the court make a valid point? What if the political process is incapable of rational and fair outcomes? When courts recognize school finance claims, their remedial orders are not self-executing but are dependent on the willingness of legislatures to act and their voters to support them. Moreover, in those states where judges are elected, voters are free to unelect those supreme court justices with whom they disagree. On more than one occasion, a state supreme court has found a school finance violation only to later reverse itself after the voters altered the composition of the court. <i>Compare</i> Opinion of the Justices, 624 So. 2d 107, 107-108 (Ala. 1993) (recognizing a constitutional right), <i>with</i> Ex parte James, 836 So. 2d 815 (Ala. 2002) (dismissing plaintiffs’ claims as nonjusticiable); <i>compare</i> DeRolph v. Ohio, 677 N.E.2d 733 (Ohio 1997), <i>with</i> State v. Lewis, 786 N.E.2d 60 (Ohio 2003). Does this counsel against judicial intervention, or is there reason to believe that judicial intervention may still be a necessary step in the overall political process?</p>
<p class="indent">8. The negative decision in <i>Edgar</i> has not deterred advocates from continuing to bring multiple finance cases against the state. The courts, however, have continued to reject these claims. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Carr v. Koch, Dock. No. 113414 (Ill. 2012).</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch79">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">In 1865, the state of North Virginia revised its constitution to provide that “adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform system of free public schools.” In 1868, that education clause was revised to state: “It is the paramount duty of the State to make ample provision for the education of all the children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference. The Legislature shall provide a uniform system of Common schools. Instruction in them shall be free.” In 1878, the clause was again revised and the word “paramount” removed.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1989, plaintiffs filed suit under the education clause challenging the inequitable and inadequate educational opportunities in their schools. The supreme court of North Virginia held that “there are no judicially manageable standards available to determine adequacy and, while uniform can be understood to mean a lack of substantial variation, assessing which variations are relevant would require the court to make educational judgments that would encroach on the legislature’s expertise and authority.”</p>
<p class="indent">After losing the case, education advocates used the initiative and referendum process to amend the constitution. Voters approved an amendment to the state constitution in 1998. The education clause now states: “The education of children is a fundamental value of the people of our state. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the state to make adequate provision for the education of all children residing within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high-quality system of free public</p>
<p><a id="page_217" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>217</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">schools that allows students to obtain a high-quality education. To assure children receive a high-quality education, the legislature shall make adequate provisions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs filed a new lawsuit. The key issues in the case are (1) whether the education clause confers an enforceable right on students; (2) whether the judiciary still lacks manageable standards; (3) whether separation of powers limit the court’s authority to adjudicate the case; (4) whether precedent and findings in other states bear any relevance; and (5) how to define “high-quality education,” especially whether it is different from a basic or an adequate education.</p>
<p class="indent">Assume you are a member of the state supreme court. Outline your response to all of these issues. If you would recognize a cause of action, define the meaning of the clause, paying close attention to how broadly and precisely you define it.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch80">6. <i>State Legislative Process Problems</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The state legislative process and response to a judicial opinion are crucial factors in the final outcome in school finance cases. Regardless of what a court holds, the delivery of a constitutional education depends on the state acquiescing to the court’s order. The provision of a constitutional education requires the state to pass legislation. A court can enjoin or hold in contempt various state actors, but a court cannot craft, nor force a legislature to craft, legislation, much less force a majority of the legislature to vote in favor of such legislation. In this respect, securing an educational remedy is as much a political process as it is a judicial one. A court can articulate legal standards and demand compliance with them, but legislators must find the political will to act. As a result, school finance litigation is often just the first step in a much broader effort to reform education funding and quality.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that courts are irrelevant to the political process or the broader conversation about education. Litigation can stir the public’s consciousness, and a court order can provide a legislature with the political cover to enact legislation that might otherwise be politically impossible. For example, prior to school finance litigation, the state of New Jersey did not have an income tax and was staunchly opposed to it, but following negative decisions in the <i>Robinson v. Cahill</i> litigation, the legislature and governor were able to garner the support to enact an income tax. Sanford Levinson, <i>Courts as Participants in “Dialogue”: A View from American States</i>, 59 <span class="smallcap">U. Kan. L. Rev</span>. 791, 822 (2011).</p>
<p class="indent">Rarely is a single judicial opinion sufficient to generate an effective legislative remedy. More often, school finance litigation leads to several exchanges between the courts and the legislature. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Paul L. Tractenberg, <i>The Evolution and Implementation of Educational Rights Under the New Jersey Constitution of 1947</i>, 29 <span class="smallcap">Rutgers L.J.</span> 827, 917, 892-926 (1998). Some state legislatures are repeatedly recalcitrant and refuse to take any serious action to remedy inadequacies, while others make significant changes to school finance and educational standards, but still fall short of constitutional requirements. Thus, even</p>
<p><a id="page_218" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>218</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">these states necessitate return trips to the courts for additional tweaking. Either way, moving from an educational system riddled with inequities or inadequacies to one that meets constitutional standards tends to occur over a period of years or decades. This long process can resemble a tension-filled dance between unwilling or unmotivated partners, in which the courts are reluctant to demand that their legislatures take big steps because doing so would risk the legislature refusing to dance altogether. Other courts might be more deliberate, but are cognizant that they will have to drag the legislature through each step of the dance. A few courts, however, after growing impatient with legislatures, have made firm demands and indicated they would shut the schools down entirely or fine the state enormous amounts of money if the state did not act immediately. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 441-442 (2009) (discussing lower court’s action to fine state); Robinson v. Cahill, 358 A.2d 457 (N.J. 1976) (enjoining operation of schools).</p>
<p class="indent">The Great Recession only exacerbated and further highlighted these tensions. From 2008 to 2012, nearly every state in the country imposed budget cuts on education. <span class="smallcap">Noelle M. Ellerson, Am. Ass’n of Sch. Admins,</span> <span class="smallcap">A Cliff Hanger: How America’s Public Schools Continue to Feel the Impact of the Economic Downturn</span> 8 (2010). Cuts of more than $1,000 per-pupil in a single year were routine. Some states experienced massive cuts in multiple years. In North Carolina and Florida, for instance, per-pupil funding fell from over $10,000 to the $7,000 range in just a few years. <span class="smallcap">Bruce D. Baker et al., Is School Funding Fair? A National Report Card</span> 8 (2015). These funding cuts affected a wide array of educational services, but the most significant were regarding teachers, who suffered lay-offs, pay cuts, and new high-stakes accountability systems.</p>
<p class="indent">What started as a financial crisis eventually began to look like a convenient rationale to defund public education and disregard constitutional duties. At the same time that states were making cuts to traditional public education, they were enacting huge increases for charter schools and voucher programs. Florida, for instance, was spending $87 million a year on vouchers when the recession began. By 2014, it was spending $344 million. <span class="smallcap">Fla. Dep’t Educ., Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program Fact Sheet</span> (Nov. 2015). Funding for charters, likewise, grew significantly during the recession at the state and federal level. As a result, between 2007 and 2012, the number of charter schools in operation grew from 4,388 to more than 6,000—a nearly 40 percent increase. <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Ctr. for Educ. Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics</span>, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_216.20.asp" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_216.20.asp</a>. The number of students enrolled in charters grew even more, nearly doubling to 2.26 million. <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The recession may have necessitated some cuts and efficiencies in public education, but as each year passes, a significant change in states’ commitment to education becomes clearer. By 2012, state tax revenues rebounded to pre-recession levels. <span class="smallcap">Bruce D. Baker et al., Is School Funding Fair?: A National Report Card</span> 12–13 t.2 (3d ed. 2014). Yet, as of 2015, thirty-one states were still funding education below pre-recession levels. <span class="smallcap">Michael Leachman et al., Ctr. of Budget and Policy Priorities, Most States Have Cut School Funding, and Some Continue Cutting</span> 1 (Dec. 10, 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">The two supreme courts brave enough to call their state to account for these cuts have been all but ignored. John Eligon, <i>Caveat in Courts Budget Adds Fuel to</i></p>
<p><a id="page_219" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>219</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Kansas Feud</i>, <span class="smallcap">N.Y. Times</span>, June 7, 2015, at A23; Kirk Johnson, <i>Washington State Faces $100,000-a-Day Fine Until Schools Plan Is Reached</i>, N.Y. <span class="smallcap">Times</span>, Aug. 14, 2015, at A14. Even more troubling, other supreme courts have tolerated these cuts, sometimes with highly questionable reasoning. <i>See, e.g</i>., Dwyer v. State, 357 P.3d 185 (Co. 2015); Davis v. State, 804 N.W.2d 618 (S.D. 2011); Bonner v. Daniels, 907 N.E.2d 516, 522 (Ind. 2009). Both trends raise the question of whether school finance litigation has entered a new unfavorable era.</p>
<p class="indent">Recessions and crises aside, keen observers of school finance litigation have also noted that the judicial and political battles can involve considerations, illegitimate or not, that reach well beyond issues of educational quality. James Ryan, for instance, has emphasized the role race appears to play in how the public and legislatures respond to judicial orders in school finance litigation. Ryan hypothesizes that states may be more resistant to litigation brought on behalf of minority communities. James E. Ryan, <i>The Influence of Race in School Finance Reform</i>, 98 <span class="smallcap">Mich. L. Rev</span>. 432 (1999). Analogously (though less perniciously), rural, urban, and suburban divisions within a state can play important roles when a remedy would accrue to the benefit of one particular constituency over another. The politics of regional differences, for instance, were quite significant in New York, where the state funding formula had worked to the distinct disadvantage of New York City.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch81">7. <i>Remedies</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Once a court recognizes a cause of action to enforce an educational clause, separation of powers concerns still persist over the implementation of a remedy. As the final arbiters of their state constitutions, courts are generally comfortable with their authority and power to decide whether a particular educational scheme comports with the constitution. But they are less comfortable with ordering specific education policy changes because, as discussed above, state constitutions generally vest the responsibility for providing education in the legislature. The more active courts are in shaping and directing education reforms, the more separation of powers concerns surface because the courts’ remedies will directly affect the legislatures’ expenditures on schools and indirectly affect expenditures on everything else. As a result, courts vary greatly in how they pursue a remedy to a violation of state constitutional law, but they generally choose between taking a deferential or active approach.</p>
<p class="indent">After finding a violation, a court can scale back its involvement in the remedial phase of the litigation by reiterating the basics of a constitutionally required education system and outlining in vague and general terms what would be part of a constitutional scheme. The court can then direct the legislature to develop its own remedy, albeit one that is consistent with the court’s decision. <i>See, e.g.</i>, DeRolph v. State, 677 N.E.2d 733, 745-747 (Ohio 1997) (after fleshing out the meaning of a thorough and efficient system of common schools and the state’s duty to produce such a system, writing that “we do not instruct the General Assembly as to the specifics of the legislation it should enact”). This approach allows courts to skirt problematic questions regarding what type of</p>
<p><a id="page_220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>220</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">financing scheme is most effective or what type of educational programs best promote student learning, leaving the most challenging policy decisions to the legislature and governor. <i>See generally</i> William S. Koski &amp; Henry M. Levin, <i>Twenty-Five Years After</i> Rodriguez: <i>What Have We Learned</i>, 102 <span class="smallcap">Tchrs. C. Rec</span>. 480, 496-497 (June 2002). Once courts back away from directly shaping a remedy, the legislatures rely on government agencies and legislative commissions to formulate specific educational policies and practices that will meet the constitutional standard. During this process, educational researchers and school finance experts may also be hired to assist in developing a remedy. Courts, of course, reserve the right to later review whatever remedy the legislature adopts and decide whether it meets constitutional requirements. In this respect, courts still play a role in shaping the remedy, but it is indirect and limited.</p>
<p class="indent">Courts that choose to take an active approach in the remedy must resolve issues of educational policy, curriculum, research, and financing. Though the form and cost differs, educational experts and social science are also central to judicial remedies. The court in <i>Campbell County School District v. Wyoming</i>, 181 P.3d 43 (Wyo. 2008), provides an example of an initial deferential approach that subsequently became active after the legislature failed to come up with an appropriate remedy on its own. The court afforded the legislature the first opportunity to craft a remedy, Washakie v. Herschler, 606 P.2d 310 (Wyo. 1980), but in its second opinion, the court focused on expert testimony and reports to fashion its own remedy. 907 P.2d 1238, 1277-1280 (Wyo. 1995). The court reviewed, at length, the research and testimony on educational strategies that relate to class size, school size, services for at-risk children, and the individual attention that students receive. <i>Id.</i> at 1251-1255, 1277-1280. Instead of deferring to the legislature, the court actively engaged in determining which pedagogical strategies and funding practices to implement as a remedy. Several similar examples exist in other states. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Ala. Coal. for Equity, Inc. v. Hunt, Civ. A. No. CV-90-883-R, 1993 WL 204083, at *31 (Ala. Cir. Ct. Apr. 1, 1993) (relying on social science in remedy phase); Abbott v. Burke, 710 A.2d 450, 458-459 (N.J. 1998) (offering a prescriptive remedy); Pauley v. Bailey, 324 S.E.2d 128 (W. Va. 1984) (same). In short, the role of experts becomes paramount to remedies regardless of whether a court takes an active approach or the task is left to the legislature.</p>
<p class="indent">Courts and legislatures call on experts to develop specific improvements for various components of the education system. For example, courts or legislatures may seek to improve teacher quality, enrich curriculum content, provide schools with up-to-date technology, or enhance pedagogical strategies that are likely to improve student learning and outcomes, particularly for students who face the greatest educational challenges. Based on educational research, courts and legislatures have implemented, encouraged, or ordered numerous specific education strategies to impact student learning and educational quality, including professional development for teachers, student-tutoring programs, preschool services, and smaller class size. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State, 655 N.E.2d 661, 666 (N.Y. 1995) (requiring adequately trained teachers); Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State, 719 N.Y.S.2d 475 (Sup. Ct. 2001) (focusing on providing resources for students with extraordinary needs and</p>
<p><a id="page_221" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>221</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">expanding programs for at-risk students); DeRolph v. State, 677 N.E.2d 733, 745 (Ohio 1997) (directing the state to ensure an “appropriate student-teacher ratio”); Campbell Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State, 907 P.2d 1238, 1279 (Wyo. 1995) (requiring provisions for at-risk, special problem, and talented students and including smaller classes as a requirement for quality education).</p>
<p class="indent">Implementing a specific remedy can be extremely complex, both from a research and legal perspective. First, courts must sort through and resolve potentially conflicting social science evidence. In some instances, the evidence cannot be reconciled. As a result, a court must resort to burdens of proof, policy judgments, and justice considerations to reach a conclusion. Second, courts must connect the social science and other evidence to the established violation. They are not free to order education programs because they are good policy. Rather, courts’ powers are limited to remedying the constitutional violation.</p>
<p class="indent">The following cases and materials offer an overview of the social science and other evidence on important education reforms and failures relating to high-need districts, increased funding, prekindergarten, and teacher salaries. But whatever the remedy, the question of whether money matters in educational outcomes is ever present. Thus, this section begins with an article addressing this fundamental question. As you read the cases that follow it, ask what role the courts’ positions on this issue—spoken or unspoken—play in their opinions and whether the cases are about money or something more. Also, assess the extent to which the evidence justifies the particular remedies in the cases and what other remedies and reforms might be important to providing equal and adequate educational opportunities.</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch82">a. Money</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch83">Michael A. Rebell, Poverty, “Meaningful” Educational Opportunity, and the Necessary Role of the Courts</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>85 N.C. L. Rev. 1467 (2006)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In the face of the overwhelming reality that the United States has one of the most inequitable education finance systems in the world, the retort of many politicians and pundits is that money really does not matter in education. “Dollar bills don’t educate students,” said President George H.W. Bush in 1991; “[j]ust as more money has not provided a remedy in the past, it will not miraculously do so in the future,” noted the editors of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> nearly a decade later. Many policymakers believe, therefore, that the schools have ample resources, and the reason that large numbers of students in the inner cities, in many rural areas, and in pockets of underachievement in the suburbs are not performing at satisfactory levels is that either they or their teachers are not sufficiently motivated.</p>
<p class="indent">Those with the closest ties to the schools, however, uniformly reject this way of thinking. Certainly, no parent, teacher, or school administrator in any low-wealth school district in the United States—or, for that matter, in any affluent community—genuinely believes that money does not matter in</p>
<p><a id="page_222" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>222</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">education. If money did not matter, wealthy parents would not send their children to private schools with annual tuitions that often exceed $25,000, nor would parents move to wealthy suburbs that spend in excess of $20,000 to educate their students well. As a state court judge in North Carolina bluntly put it after hearing extensive evidence on the subject, “Only a fool would find that money does not matter in education.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">A. The Academic Debate</span></p>
<p class="indent">The “money matters” debate has been carried out in academic circles in recent years through technical discussions of “education production function” analyses. Simply stated, an “education production function” analysis means using a regression analysis to measure the effects of certain “inputs” (such as per pupil funding or teacher salaries or textbooks) on an outcome (such as student achievement, measured in terms of standardized test scores or graduation rates).</p>
<p class="indent">Eric Hanushek, an economist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, has been the leading academic proponent of the use of production function analyses to defend the proposition that money does not matter. He has argued that “key resources—ones that are the subject of much policy attention—are not consistently or systematically related to improved student performance,” and that increases in school funding to needy schools “could actually be harmful” to students. Hanushek’s position was initially based on production function analyses he had undertaken on 187 regressions based on thirty-eight primary studies of the relationship between teacher/student ratios, teacher education, teacher experience, teacher salary, facilities, and other such inputs, with outcomes mostly in terms of standardized test scores, but that also include some instances of “dropout rates, college continuation, student attitudes, or performance after school.”</p>
<p class="indent">Production function analyses generally, and Hanushek’s work in particular, have been widely challenged as being simplistic and misleading because they “do not adequately address serious questions of causation,” and because they do not “adequately account[] for across-district variations” in the costs of educational services (such as teacher salaries), and “in the proportion of students with special needs, who require additional, more costly services.” A related issue is that the production function analyses almost always measure outcomes solely in terms of standardized test scores, which are not complete and accurate measures of meaningful success.</p>
<p class="indent">The most extensive rebuttal of Hanushek’s methodology was undertaken in a series of articles by University of Chicago education researchers Rob Greenwald, Larry Hedges, and Richard Laine. They first closely analyzed the thirty-eight specific studies that Hanushek had identified in his work, rejecting the “vote-counting” approach he used to subjectively decide on the aspects of each study that would be counted in the overall analysis; then, using broader and more precise decision rules for conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis of the relevant literature, they concluded that nine of Hanushek’s basic studies were inappropriate and that thirty-one other studies should have been included.</p>
<p><a id="page_223" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>223</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Analyzing in depth this larger universe, they concluded that “a broad range of school inputs are positively related to student outcomes, and that the magnitude of the effects are sufficiently large to suggest that moderate increases in spending may be associated with significant increases in achievement.” More recent studies concur in the view that educational expenditures are correlated with positive student outcomes,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml?favre=brett#note7" id="Rnote7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> a view that Hanushek himself no longer fully contests.</p>
<p class="indent">The argument that money does not matter has also been fueled by an erroneous view that real education spending has tripled in the past few decades. Richard Rothstein and Karen Hawley Miles, in an extensive analysis of this question, have shown that with inflation adjustment, total real education spending per pupil increased by 61% from 1967 to 1991, and that most of this increase went to funded programs and services for students with disabilities, as mandated by new federal laws granting educational rights to these students and their families. The share of expenditures going to general education during this period dropped from 80% to 59%, and the share going to special education increased from 4% to 17%.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">B. The Courts’ View</span></p>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, the national pattern of gross inequity and inadequacy in school funding has spawned a wave of litigation in the state courts over the past three decades. Since 1973, litigation has been filed in forty-five states, and plaintiffs have prevailed in the majority of the forty-three states where courts have issued decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">The cases clearly demonstrate how inequities in funding cause resource deprivations that directly affect students’ educational opportunities. For example, many high schools in California’s low-income and minority communities do not offer the curriculum students must take just to apply to the state’s public universities. Passing an examination in a laboratory science course is required for high school graduation in New York State, but thirty-one New York City high schools have no science lab. In South Carolina, annual teacher turnover rates exceed 20% in eight poor, rural, mostly minority school districts, and in those districts graduation rates fall between 33% and 57%.</p>
<p class="indent">In most of these litigations, the question of whether “money matters” has been a central legal issue, and extensive expert testimony on “production functions” and other technical economic and social science issues was a critical aspect of the trial. For example, in the recent Kansas litigation, more than half a dozen experts on both sides of the issue presented detailed testimony on whether money matters. After summarizing its findings regarding the detailed testimony,</p>
<p><a id="page_224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>224</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the court concluded that “there is a causal connection between the poor performance of the vulnerable and/or protected categories of Kansas students and the low funding provided their schools. Accordingly, the Court finds as a matter of fact and law that the funding scheme presently in place and as applied in Kansas by its underfunding in general and by its mid and large-school underfunding specifically, clearly and disparately injures vulnerable and/or protected students and thus violates both Article 6 of the Kansas Constitution and the equal protection clauses of both the United States and Kansas Constitutions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, the issue of whether money matters in education was directly considered by the state courts in thirty of these cases. In twenty-nine of them, the courts determined that money does indeed matter. In many of the cases, as in Kansas and New York, experts explicitly testified on the specific issue of whether money matters. In others, the courts implicitly considered this issue in their analyses of whether the guarantee in the state constitution’s education article of an “equal” educational opportunity or of an “adequate” education had been met if children in certain districts were deprived of critical educational resources, such as certified teachers, up-to-date textbooks, and decent facilities. In certain of these situations, the court found that although many aspects of the state’s education finance system met constitutional requirements, additional funding was needed to establish or expand particular programs or resources in order to meet constitutional standards. Some cases emphasize the challenging nature of new state and national standards and hold that additional resources are needed so that children can meet them.</p>
<p class="indent">Significantly, the courts that have found in favor of the defendants in school finance litigations have not done so because they have found that money does not matter, but for other reasons. When defendants’ positions have been upheld in these cases, it generally has been because of either (1) separation of powers principles that hold that these issues should be determined exclusively by the legislative and executive branches, and not by the courts; or (2) the tradition of local control of education. In a number of these cases the district court had specifically found that money does matter only to be overruled by the state’s high court based on justiciability or procedural grounds. Some courts that have found in favor of the defendants have also noted that the state constitution does require a base level of adequate funding, but the plaintiffs in the case had not alleged or proved that current funding was below that level.</p>
<p class="indent">Only one court has clearly held that money does not matter. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island in <i>City of Pawtucket v. Sundlun</i> used a combination of textual interpretation and legislative intent to hold that the education finance system was constitutional. It also relied on a vaguely referenced study that claimed that parental involvement was the most influential aspect of a child’s educational opportunities and that increased spending did not necessarily have an impact on the education a child received. The court did not, however, discuss any specific reasons for rejecting the evidentiary holding of the trial court that there was a clear causal link between insufficient funding and poor student performance.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, all of the elaborate economic production analyses and discussions in the academic literature and in the legal decisions about whether money</p>
<p><a id="page_225" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>225</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">matters really comes down to a basic consensus that, of course, money matters—if it is spent well. Eric Hanushek, historically the chief supporter of the “money doesn’t matter” theory, has himself recently acknowledged that “money spent wisely, logically, and with accountability would be very useful indeed.” There is no doubt that in order to obtain a meaningful educational opportunity, low-income and minority children need qualified teachers, adequate facilities, lower class sizes, more time on task, and sufficient, up-to-date instrumentalities of learning. They also need early childhood education, health services, good nutrition, family support, and other programs and services that can successfully offset the severe effects of poverty. The extent to which legal interventions can ensure adequate funding—and appropriate accountability measures to ensure that the funds are, in fact, used well—will be the subjects of the balance of this Article.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Does the fact that so many courts have concluded that money matters or have ordered monetary remedies provide an answer to the question of whether money matters? Are courts well suited to referee this debate? Is it their responsibility to do so regardless? While Rebell is writing at a high level of generality to support the argument that all courts and fair-minded social scientists agree that money matters, this high level of generality may oversimplify the controversy. The question may not be whether money matters, but rather what should we do with money to make it matter. As Rebell points out, Eric Hanushek rejects the notion that money per se matters, but Hanushek agrees that “money spent wisely, logically, and with accountability would be very useful indeed.” Thus, asking whether money matters would seem to pose a false dichotomy. The more appropriate question is: What should we spend money on, or how can we spend money more efficiently? As to this question, a wide chasm arises over whether classroom size, prekindergarten education, teacher training, tutoring, length of school day, and other reforms produce positive or sufficiently positive results given the cost.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, not all courts that order monetary relief are necessarily convinced that the evidence clearly supports the notion that “money matters.” For instance, the New Jersey Supreme Court expressed ambivalence regarding the causal connection between money and student outcomes, writing that the “research, while promising and constructive, [is] inconclusive,” and “money alone has not worked.” Abbott v. Burke, 575 A.2d 359, 377 (N.J. 1990). The court ultimately ordered a monetary remedy not because the evidence was clear but because students’ affirmative right to education placed the burden on the state to disprove the connection: “while we are unable to conclude from this record that the State is clearly wrong,” denying plaintiffs relief would “strip all notions of equal and adequate funding from the constitutional obligation unless we were convinced that the State was clearly right.” <i>Id.</i> “[E]ven if not a cure, money will help, and these students are constitutionally entitled to that help. If the claim is that additional funding will not</p>
<p><a id="page_226" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>226</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">enable the poorer districts to offer a thorough and efficient education, the constitutional answer is that they are entitled to pass or fail with at least the same amount of money as their competitors.” <i>Id.</i> at 375. Which is more powerful, this court’s reasoning or consensus among social scientists that money matters?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does it matter how much money matters? In other words, would it matter if huge increases in money produce only minor increases in student achievement? Part of the problem of assessing whether or how much money matters is that schools have a different cost basis that depends on any number of factors, including geographic location and the percentage of low-income students, special education students, and English Language Learners (ELLs) they enroll. We can rarely compare “apples to apples.” The largest funding variations tend to exist between “apples and oranges” rather than apples and apples. Moreover, no one would seriously argue that the additional expenditure of $10, $20, or $30 per student would improve educational outcomes. Yet it is hard to deny that an additional $10,000 per student would. The problem is identifying the minimal amount of money that would affect outcomes and what, if any, benefit would be derived from each additional dollar spent above that amount. In short, the effect of money does not always operate on a linear trajectory. Thus, the issue devolves back to the questions in the previous note: What is the money being spent on?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Money, of course, does buy particular resources, such as books, facilities, teacher salaries, and smaller classrooms. Should the inquiry regarding money simply stop at this point under the assumption that, regardless of how well we can measure the impact of these resources on achievement tests, these are core aspects of learning that necessarily impact education? Some courts have opted toward this approach. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Serrano v. Priest, 487 P.2d 1241, 1253 n.16 (Cal. 1971). On the other hand, would it make sense to ensure access to certain resources without concern for their connection to “school quality” or student achievement?</p>
<p class="indent">4. One new research project has reached far more definitive conclusions than any before it. Examining more than three decades of data, C. Kirabo Jackson, Rucker C. Johnson, and Claudia Persico found that a 20 percent increase in per-pupil funding, if maintained over time, results in low-income students completing almost a full additional year’s worth of education. C. Kirabo Jackson et al., <i>The</i> <i>Effects of School Spending on Educational and Economic Outcomes: Evidence from School Finance Reforms</i>, 131 <span class="smallcap">Q. J. Econ. 157</span> (2016). That additional learning eliminates two-thirds of the gap in outcomes between low- and middle-income students. <i>Id</i>. They also found proportionally positive outcomes based on just 10 percent increases in funding across time. <i>Id</i>.</p>

These birth cohorts straddle the period in which most of the major school finance reform litigation accelerated, and thus the cohorts were differentially exposed, depending on place and year of birth.

Event-study and instrumental variable models reveal that a 20 percent increase in per-pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school for children from poor families leads to about 0.9 more completed years of education, 25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty; we find no effects for children from non-poor families. The magnitudes of these effects are sufficiently large to eliminate between two-thirds and all of the gaps in these adult outcomes between those raised in poor families and those raised in non-poor families.

<p class="indent">More than a decade ago, we held that the Education Article of the New York State Constitution requires the State “to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education” [and subsequently found that], [w]hether measured by “inputs” or by “outputs,” [children in New York City were not receiving a sound basic education]. Finally, we concluded that plaintiffs had established the causation element of their claim by showing that increased funding can provide better teachers, facilities and instrumentalities of learning, and that such improved inputs in turn yield better student performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly we directed the State to ensure, by means of “[r]eforms to the current system of financing school funding and managing schools…that every school in New York City would have the resources necessary for providing the opportunity for a sound basic education.” Noting that “the political process allocates to City schools a share of state aid that does not bear a perceptible relation to the needs of City students,” we instructed the State to ascertain the actual cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City, rather than the state as a whole. We also held that “the new scheme should ensure a system of accountability to measure whether the reforms actually provide the opportunity for a sound basic education.”</p>
<p class="indent">Within a matter of weeks, Governor Pataki issued an executive order creating the New York State Commission on Education Reform, charged with recommending, to the Executive and the Legislature, education financing and other reforms that would ensure that all children in New York State have an opportunity to obtain a sound basic education. The Commission, chaired by Frank G. Zarb, published its final report on March 29, 2004.</p>
<p class="indent">The Zarb Commission retained Standard and Poor’s (S &amp; P) School Evaluation Services to calculate the additional spending required to provide a sound</p>
<p><a id="page_228" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>228</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">basic education directing S &amp; P to use a “Successful Schools” model that studies the expenditures of school districts with a proven track record of high student performance. The method had been used by the New York State Board of Regents in its Proposal on State Aid to School Districts for 2004-05.</p>
<p class="indent">Reasoning that not all successful schools operate in a manner that is economical, the Zarb Commission instructed S &amp; P to apply a cost-effectiveness filter: once successful school districts were identified, they were to be ranked according to expenditures and those in the lower-spending half were to be used to create an average.</p>
<p class="indent">Drawing on an extensive review of pertinent research literature, S &amp; P applied three weightings to the resulting base expenditures, in order to take into account the greater spending required for students with special needs. The coefficients by which the base expenditures were multiplied were 2.1 for students with disabilities, 1.35 for economically disadvantaged students, and 1.2 for students with limited English proficiency. S &amp; P cautioned that it was not in a position to recommend explicitly the set of weightings it applied.</p>
<p class="indent">Adjustments were also made to account for the local purchasing power of the dollar, using two, alternative cost indices[: one based on differences in labor market costs and the other based on] the attractiveness of employment within a particular district, one of the key determinants of the cost of providing education.</p>
<p class="indent">S &amp; P thus calculated “sound basic education” spending estimates for each school district, using the two regional cost indices and the criteria for identifying successful school districts. The spending estimates did not include capital, debt or transportation costs. Finally, these figures were compared with amounts actually spent in 2002-2003, in order to identify “spending gaps.”</p>
<p class="indent">Applying the [cost index based on locality attractiveness], the estimated spending gaps for New York City ranged from $1.93 billion to $2.53 billion and the statewide spending gaps from $2.45 billion to $3.39 billion. (New York City’s spending gap thus comprised 74% to 79% of the State’s total gap.) When the [labor cost index] was applied, the estimated spending gaps were larger, ranging from $4.05 billion to $4.69 billion for New York City, and $4.61 billion to $5.57 billion statewide. Governor Pataki convened the Legislature in extraordinary session on July 20, 2004, and proposed a program bill to the Senate, incorporating the Zarb Commission’s methodology. The Senate passed an amended version of the bill. Ultimately, the legislation was not enacted. In both versions of the bill, Governor Pataki and the Senate endorsed the approach that generated a minimum figure of $1.93 billion as the estimated spending gap in operating expenses for New York City. In his State Education Reform Plan, submitted in the course of this litigation, the Governor concluded that “the S &amp; P analysis as adopted by the Zarb Commission and by State defendants determined that $2.5 billion in additional revenues statewide (equating to $1.9 billion in New York City) was a valid determination of the cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City.”</p>
<p class="indent">In his program bill memorandum, Governor Pataki made it clear that he intended New York City schools to receive additional funding that exceeded the minimum cost of a sound basic education. Proposals for a Dedicated State Fund</p>

<p class="noindent">for Sound Basic Education and for a New York City local state aid match would, when coupled with projected increases in state school aid and federal aid, generate “approximately $4.7 billion in additional support over the next five years.” As noted, the proposed legislation was not enacted. The Legislature, however, passed a bill on August 10, 2004, providing $300 million in additional education aid to New York City.</p>
<p class="indent">[Pursuant to the deadline set in our prior decision, the] Supreme Court set out to determine whether the measures we had declared necessary had been carried out. It appointed a blue-ribbon panel of referees “to hear and report with recommendations” on whether the steps taken by the State brought compliance with <i>CFE II</i>. The Referees conducted numerous hearings [and received extensive evidence from various experts and governmental bodies. Ultimately,] they accepted the “successful school districts” methodology of the Zarb Commission, [but] the Referees rejected its cost-effectiveness filter, used a 1.5 weighting for economically disadvantaged students in place of the S &amp; P coefficient of 1.35, and insisted on the use of an updated [locality cost index]. They concluded that the spending gap in New York City was $5.63 billion in 2004-2005 dollars, rejecting the State’s contention that additional funding in the amount of $1.93 billion would ensure the opportunity for a sound basic education in New York City’s public schools.</p>
<p class="indent">The Referees [also] recommend[ed] that the State be required to ensure that $9.179 billion in 2004-2005 dollars would be available as funding for capital improvements over the following five years[, and] that costing-out studies be carried out every four years, “until it becomes clear that reforms to the State’s education finance formulas have rendered such studies no longer necessary to assure all New York City students the opportunity for a sound basic education.”</p>
<p class="indent">[The] Supreme Court confirmed the Judicial Referees’ Report and Recommendations. The Appellate Division vacated that confirmation[, reasoning that so] “…long as the State’s choices remained within the range of professionally accepted practices in determining the costs of a sound basic education, [the] Supreme Court should have left the conclusions for legislative and gubernatorial consideration and determination.”</p>
<p class="indent">Citing Governor Pataki’s proposal to increase funding of the New York City School District by $4.7 billion (over a period of five years), the Appellate Division directed the Governor and Legislature to appropriate at least $4.7 billion in additional operating funds (phased in over four years). The Appellate Division also directed the Governor and Legislature to “implement a capital improvement plan that expends $9.179 billion over the next five years or otherwise satisfies the city schools’ constitutionally recognized capital needs.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs CFE et al. appeal pursuant to CPLR 5601(a) and (b)(1). The state defendants cross-appeal under CPLR 5601(b)(1).</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">The role of the courts is not, as [the] Supreme Court assumed, to determine the best way to calculate the cost of a sound basic education in New York City</p>
<p><a id="page_230" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>230</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">schools, but to determine whether the State’s proposed calculation of that cost is rational. [The] Supreme Court should not have endorsed an examination in which the cost of a sound basic education in New York was calculated anew, when the state budget plan had already reasonably calculated that cost. In this respect, we agree with the Appellate Division. It was error to confirm the Referees’ Report.</p>
<p class="indent">We differ from the Appellate Division, however, in two respects. First, we observe that the state plan found that the cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City was $1.93 billion in additional annual operating funds, and that Governor Pataki’s proposal to provide $4.7 billion in additional funding amounted to a policy choice to exceed the constitutional minimum. Second, in light of recently enacted legislation designed to allow the State to remedy inadequacies in New York City schools facilities, we reject as unnecessary the Appellate Division’s directive regarding capital improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, we modify the order of the Appellate Division, in two ways. We declare that the constitutionally required funding for the New York City School District includes, as demonstrated by this record, additional operating funds in the amount of $1.93 billion, adjusted with reference to the latest version of the [cost index] and inflation since 2004. We vacate the requirement that the Governor and the Legislature implement a capital improvement plan that either expends $9.179 billion over the following five years “or otherwise satisfies the city schools’ constitutionally recognized capital needs.” As modified, we affirm.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">When we remitted in <i>CFE II</i>, we did so in order that Supreme Court would determine, when our deadline had passed, whether the State had implemented the reforms we required—legislation that would ensure that New York City schools have the resources necessary for providing the opportunity for a sound basic education and that would ensure accountability. <i>CFE II</i> called for the State to present evidence of its reforms, both predating <i>CFE II</i> and following <i>CFE II</i>, and for [the] Supreme Court to determine whether they satisfied our directives.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of our language in <i>CFE II</i> and our jurisprudence as a whole concerning deference to the Legislature in matters of policymaking, it was incumbent upon [the] Supreme Court to begin by making a finding as to whether the State’s estimate of the cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City was a <i>reasonable</i> estimate. Then the court should have proceeded to determine whether the state plan, as of July 30, 2004, incorporated that sound basic education expenditure in its proposed budget and would, if enacted, ensure a system of accountability. Supreme Court should not have provided a panel of referees with a mandate to make <i>recommendations</i> as between compliance proposals—the State’s, the plaintiffs’, the City’s, the Regents’. The State, not [the] Supreme Court, was ordered to ascertain the cost of a sound basic education in New York City.</p>
<p><a id="page_231" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>231</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">We do not believe that Governor Pataki’s proposed State Education Reform Plan was unreasonable. In particular, we do not find irrational the Governor’s approach to identifying successful schools, the S &amp; P weightings for students with special needs and the cost-effectiveness filter. As a result, we do not find unreasonable the assertion that “$2.5 billion in additional revenues statewide (equating to $1.9 billion in New York City) was a valid determination of the cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City.” There is substantial record support for that statement.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the use of the cost-effectiveness filter is rationally defensible. The variation in spending between New York school districts is very large. As S &amp; P explained, averaging the expenditures of <i>all</i> successful schools would “mask a considerable range of per-pupil spending among the individual districts. If the concept of ‘adequacy’ means spending no less, but not necessarily more, than is necessary to produce high achievement levels, then there is reasonable cause to adjust the base expenditure by a measure of <i>cost effectiveness.</i> This can be done by ranking the successful districts under each scenario by their base expenditure, and computing the average of the lowest 50% (in terms of spending), which is the same approach used by the New York Board of Regents in its recent study of educational costs. An analysis of the average achievement levels of the lower-spending half of districts shows that they closely resemble the average achievement levels of the upper-spending half of districts.”</p>
<p class="indent">The essential premise of the cost-effectiveness filter is that the higher-spending half of the successful districts is spending more than the constitutional minimum—either because those districts spend less efficiently than some others or because they have chosen to do more for their students than the Constitution requires. The State, in adopting S &amp; P’s approach, implicitly concluded that New York City could attain minimal constitutional standards while spending less than this higher-spending group of successful districts. The premise, and the conclusion, are no doubt debatable, but we cannot say they are irrational, and they are therefore entitled to deference from the courts.</p>
<p class="indent">The S &amp; P weightings for children with special needs also have record support [and were based on] an extensive review of relevant research.</p>
<p class="indent">The S &amp; P calculations—applying a 2.1 weighting for students with disabilities, 1.35 for economically disadvantaged students, and 1.2 for students with limited English proficiency, and reaching the conclusion that the spending gap for the New York City School District is $1.93 billion—were reasonable. Although we recognize that legitimate arguments can be made for raising the coefficient for economically disadvantaged students to 1.5, we do not believe that the figure of 1.35 lacks grounding in prudent reason.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we declare that the constitutionally required funding for the New York City School District includes additional operating funds in the amount of $1.93 billion, adjusted with reference to the latest version of the GCEI and inflation since 2004.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What are the practical and empirical problems that this court reveals in identifying how much money is required to provide a constitutional education? What methods did the legislature, courts, and others use to resolve these issues and determine the cost of a constitutional education?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Is the question of the amount of resources necessary to deliver an adequate education a factual question, a pedagogical question, a judgment question, or a legal question? In other words, who is best suited to decide? It would appear on some level to be a factual question. If so, would the court serve as the final arbiter of how much should be spent on education? What role does the court end up playing in addressing this issue?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court indicates that the state’s estimates of the necessary resources were reasonable. Do plaintiffs have the right to return to court if these estimates later prove to be insufficient, or is it enough that the state acted in good faith or within reason? Is the court indicating that only the state has the authority to enact education policy and budgets, but courts have the right to evaluate, after the fact, whether those budgets meet constitutional standards? The result of this approach can be for the state to repeatedly fail in the first instance and courts to repeatedly repudiate them after the fact. In the meantime, children are perpetually denied a constitutionally adequate education. Does this problem suggest that either the previously described active or deferential judicial approach to remedies is the better option?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Do courts have the institutional capacity and expertise to oversee the details of education finance systems over a period of years? Is there any way to ensure that states do not slip back into earlier patterns of inadequacy or inequity once the spotlight is no longer shining on them? Advocates charge that New York has done a very poor job in continuing the necessary commitments to education, which has resulted in additional litigation. Michael A. Rebell, <i>Safeguarding the Right to a Sound Basic Education in Times of Fiscal Constraint</i>, 75 <span class="smallcap">Alb. L. Rev</span>. 1855, 1896-1905 (2012) (discussing recent litigation in New York).</p>
<p class="indent">5. The methods described by the court do not mention a weighting for concentrated poverty. Is this a fatal flaw, or do other measures indirectly account for it? Do these methods overlook any other important factors?</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch86">c. Prekindergarten Education</p>
<p class="indent">Prekindergarten programs have steadily increased over the past two decades. In 2001, 38 states offered a preschool program of some kind, and 14.8 percent of four-year-olds were enrolled. W. Steven Barnett et al., <i>The State of Preschool: 2003 State Preschool Yearbook 16</i> (2003). By 2010, that number had risen to 28 percent. W. Steven Barnett et al., <i>2011 State Preschool Yearbook</i> 6 (2011). Nearly all of these programs were voluntarily implemented by states and localities based on extensive social science evidence demonstrating that low-income students are not as prepared for kindergarten as their peers, but that high-quality prekindergarten can significantly close the gap. <i>See generally</i> James E. Ryan, </p>
<p><a id="page_233" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>233</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>A Constitutional Right to Preschool?</i>, 94 <span class="smallcap">Cal. L. Rev</span>. 49, 56-57 (2006). The benefits to low-income students can continue to accrue throughout their subsequent school years, improving academic achievement, grade promotion, graduation rates, and employment prospects. <i>Id.</i> The positive student outcomes can also produce a net gain to society by lowering social service costs associated with dropouts and crime. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Implicit in the above statistics, however, is the fact that far too many disadvantaged students do not have access to preschool, and some who do attend preschool attend ones that are not of sufficient quality. Recognizing the important role prekindergarten can play in whether a student succeeds in school, school finance advocates in several states have sought to include prekindergarten within their remedies. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Lake View Sch. Dist. No. 25 v. Huckabee, 91 S.W.3d 472, 500-502 (Ark. 2002); Hancock v. Comm’r of Educ., 822 N.E.2d 1134, 1156-1157 (Mass. 2005); Abbott v. Burke, 693 A.2d 417, 436 (N.J. 1997); Hoke Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. State, 599 S.E.2d 365, 393-394 (N.C. 2004); Order at 2, Abbeville Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State, No. 93-CP-31-0169 (S.C. 3d Jud. Cir. Ct. Com. Pl. Dec. 29, 2005). Thus far, only two state high courts have upheld lower court orders to provide prekindergarten education, <i>Abbott</i>, 693 A.2d at 436, and <i>Hoke Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. State</i>, 731 S.E.2d 691 (N.C. App. 2012), although a leading scholar reasons that this number should increase. Ryan, <i>supra</i>. The following excerpt offers the basic rationale from one of the states that has implemented preschool through school finance litigation.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch87">Abbott v. Burke</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>710 A.2d 450 (N.J. 1998)</i></p>
<p class="indent">This Court has consistently recognized and emphasized that early childhood education is essential for children in the [special needs districts (SNDs). We find that full-day prekindergarten, rather than just half-day kindergarten, is the most cost effective means for lowering drop-out rates and is an essential precursor to delivering a constitutionally mandated thorough and efficient education to at-risk students in elementary grades. Thus, this court orders the immediate implementation of prekindergarten in the plaintiff districts.]</p>
<p class="indent">There is no fundamental disagreement over the importance of pre-school education. The Commissioner proposed half-day pre-school for four-year olds, and the plaintiffs and Dr. Odden recommended full-day pre-school for both three- and four-year olds. As the Commissioner’s research itself demonstrates: “Well-planned, high quality half-day preschool programs…help close the gap between the home and school environments and the educational expectations that lead to academic success.”</p>
<p class="indent">Empirical evidence strongly supports the essentiality of pre-school education for children in impoverished urban school districts. That evidence demonstrates that the earlier education begins, the greater the likelihood that students will develop language skills and the discipline necessary to succeed in school. A review of two major studies on pre-school cited by the parties, the High/Scope Perry Preschool study and the Abecedarian study, also reveals that there is a</p>
<p><a id="page_234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>234</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">strong correlation between the intensity and duration of pre-school and later educational progress and achievement. The Commissioner’s expert on childhood education, Dr. Slavin, noted that “the programs that have shown the greatest success are ones that provide more intensive services” and “start with three-year-olds rather than four-year-olds.” Common experience confirms this empirical evidence that pre-school attendance is linked to success in school.</p>
<p class="indent">A 1996 report by the Carnegie Task Force on Learning in the Primary Grades lends further support to that conclusion. Carnegie Corp. of New York, <i>Years of Promise: A Comprehensive Learning Strategy for America’s Children</i> (1996). The Report recommends that high-quality learning opportunities for children ages three to five be made universally available: “During the preschool years, children make the developmental leaps that form the basis of later achievement. To get all children ready for school and for an education that meets high standards of achievement, the task force recommends that the nation make a commitment to expanded high-quality public and private early care and education programs <i>for children ages three to five</i>, supported by national, state, and local mechanisms that are coordinated to assure adequate financing.”</p>
<p class="indent">Part of the basis of that recommendation is that one-third of children entering elementary school lack basic school-readiness skills. One reason for this deficit is that poor areas suffer from a scarcity of quality, publicly-funded early care and early education for three- to five-year olds.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence also shows that one of the most important functions of early childhood education is language development. At the hearing, evidence was produced showing that children in low income families suffer greatly in language development. Key elements of language development begin when a child is three and four; therefore, opportunities for those children to learn are lost if early childhood education does not begin at those ages.</p>
<p class="indent">The Legislature itself has recognized the necessity of early childhood education for three- and four-year olds in the poorest school districts provides that for districts in which the concentration of low income pupils is greater than 20% but less than 40%, early childhood aid “shall be distributed” for “the purpose of providing full day kindergarten and pre-school classes and other early childhood programs and services.” The statute does not specify whether the pre-school aid should be used for three-year olds or four-year olds or both. For districts in which the concentration of low income pupils is equal to or greater than 40%, the statute directs that additional funds be used “for the purpose of expanding instructional services previously specified [i.e., preschool classes and other early childhood services] to 3 year olds.” For districts, then, with a 40% concentration of poor students, it is mandatory that ECPA funds be expended for the pre-school education of three-year olds. The statute next provides that should extra funds remain, they may be used, “in addition to the instructional services previously specified” [i.e., the just mentioned preschool for three-year-olds and the aforementioned “early childhood programs”], for “the purpose of” providing “transition and social services to primary grade students.” The statute thus contemplates three tiers of funding: (1) undifferentiated funds to be expended on pre-school in Abbott districts with 20% poor (ECPA-1 districts); (2) additional monies that must be spent on pre-school education for</p>
<p><a id="page_235" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>235</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">three-year olds in districts with 40% poor (ECPA-2 districts); and (3) extra funds to be used for services for elementary school students in districts with funds remaining after the mandates of (1) and (2) have been met.</p>
<p class="indent">In the vast majority of [plaintiff] districts, more than 40% of the population is low income. For these ECPA-2 districts, then, pre-school for three-year olds is legislatively mandated. As for the remaining handful of districts where between 20 and 39% of their respective citizens are poor, we note the following. The record is undisputed and, indeed, uncontrovertible that the conditions that work to deprive children of their constitutional entitlement to a thorough and efficient education are pervasive not only in the ECPA-2 districts, but in the ECPA-1 districts as well. The Court concludes that the level of need in the ECPA-1 districts for pre-school programs for three-year olds is comparable to that exhibited by ECPA-2 districts. Given the documented and undisputed similarity of conditions that deleteriously impact the ability of children throughout the [plaintiff] districts to receive a sound education, it would be inconsistent with the legislative mandate underlying CEIFA for the Commissioner not to use his power to direct ECPA-1 districts to restructure their curricula in order to provide pre-school education for three-year olds and to reallocate and apply ECPA funds to the cost of providing pre-school education for three-year olds.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court is convinced that pre-school for three- and four-year olds will have a significant and substantial positive impact on academic achievement in both early and later school years. As the experts described, the long-term benefits amply justify this investment. Also, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that, in the poor urban school districts, the earlier children start pre-school, the better prepared they are to face the challenges of kindergarten and first grade. It is this year-to-year improvement that is a critical condition for the attainment of a thorough and efficient education once a child enters regular public school.</p>
<p class="indent">Stated conversely, because the absence of such early educational intervention deleteriously undermines educational performance once the child enters public school, the provision of pre-school education also has strong constitutional underpinning. In light of our construction of N.J.S.A. 18A:7F-16, however, and the powers of the Commissioner delineated in N.J.S.A. 18A:7F-6b, we need not reach the constitutional issue. The provision in CEIFA for education of three-year-olds is a clear indication that the Legislature understood and endorsed the strong empirical link between early education and later educational achievement.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What rationale justifies mandating that the state offer prekindergarten education? Does this court go too far in its mandate?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Are you convinced of the efficacy of prekindergarten education? How does it compare to other remedies? If the evidence is so compelling, why have so few state courts compelled it?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Does prekindergarten raise any political or social issues, including removing at-risk students from their homes at an earlier age and for longer periods of time? Should the program be voluntary or mandatory for parents?</p>

<p class="indent">4. The trial court in North Carolina’s school finance litigation ordered the state to implement prekindergarten education, but on appeal, the supreme court reversed the order as beyond the court’s authority, reasoning that the state must have the first opportunity to craft a remedy. Hoke Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. State, 599 S.E.2d 365 (N.C. 2004). The state then implemented some prekindergarten services of its own volition, but scaled them back during the recession that began in 2008. Reviewing the basis for withdrawing services from some at-risk students, the trial court indicated the state was now obligated to provide prekindergarten services to at-risk students. Hoke Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. North Carolina, 95-CVS-1158, 2000 WL 1639686 (Sept. 2, 2011). This time North Carolina’s appellate court affirmed the trial court. More recently, a trial court in South Carolina similarly ordered prekindergarten for at-risk children. But the South Carolina Supreme Court implicitly vacated the order when it directed the state and plaintiffs to “identify the problems facing students in the Plaintiff Districts” and “solve those problems through cooperatively designing a strategy to address critical concerns and cure the constitutional deficiency evident in this case.” Abbeville v. State, 767 S.E.2d 157, 180 (2014).</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch88">d. Teacher Salaries</p>
<p class="indent">Teacher salaries receive relatively little treatment in most school finance opinions. Tennessee is the most significant exception. In the first challenge to the state’s financing system, the supreme court held that students have a constitutional right to “substantially equal educational opportunities.” Tenn. Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 851 S.W.2d 139, 151 (Tenn. 1993). The court then found that the state’s financing system caused impermissible disparities throughout the state. <i>Id.</i> In a second opinion, the court reviewed the legislative plan to remedy the disparities. The court found that, while certain aspects of the plan did improve equity, the failure to equalize teacher salaries amounted to a fatal flaw. The court wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Funding based on determined costs is mandated for each component of the basic education plan except teachers’ salaries [in the state’s revised financing scheme]. The allocation for teachers’ salaries to each local system is the product of the amount of the system’s average teacher salary, based on the State salary schedule plus the mandated local supplement, multiplied by the number of [Basic Education Program (BEP)] teacher positions in that local system. Local systems are allowed to use classroom funds for any of the classroom components and they are allowed to use system support funds for any of the system support components. However, they are prohibited from using BEP funds for the purpose of increasing teachers’ salaries. Since the adoption of the BEP, teachers have received the same increases in salaries as other State employees, except the total amount paid teachers has been distributed according to the BEP formula. However, there is no provision in the BEP for increasing teachers’ salaries or equalizing teachers’ salaries.</p>
<p class="indent">The State’s explanation, and justification, for this treatment of the funding of teachers’ salary increases is that historically all funds made available to local systems have been applied to teachers’ salaries, resulting in other needs being neglected. The State takes the position in this case that increasing and equalizing teachers’ salaries is not a component of a basic education, that it “does not affect student performance.” The argument is dramatically weakened by the inclusion of this item in earlier BEP proposals.</p>
<p><a id="page_237" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>237</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The decision by the architects of the BEP to prohibit the use of classroom funds and system support funds to increase teachers’ salaries does not require that funds for teachers’ salary increases be excluded from the plan. Obviously, it can be a separate category of funding, along with classroom components and support system components.</p>
<p class="indent">The omission of a requirement for equalizing teachers’ salaries is a significant defect in the BEP. The rationale supporting the inclusion of the other important factors constituting the plan is equally applicable to the inclusion of teachers’ salaries. Teachers, obviously, are the most important component of any education plan or system, and compensation is, at least, a significant factor determining a teacher’s place of employment. The costs of teachers’ compensation and benefits is the major item in every education budget. The failure to provide for the equalization of teachers’ salaries according to the BEP formula, puts the entire plan at risk functionally and, therefore, legally.</p>

<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Tenn. Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 894 S.W.2d at 734, 738 (Tenn. 1995).</p>
<p class="indent">After this second opinion, the state implemented a “salary equity plan,” but the court also struck it down as deficient in a third opinion. The court found that the state’s revised statutory scheme “does not equalize teachers’ salaries according to the BEP formula and contains no mechanism for cost determination or annual cost review of teachers’ salaries.” Tenn. Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 91 S.W.3d 232 (Tenn. 2002). The court wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">We can think of no rational basis…for structuring a basic education program where all of its components, including salaries for custodians, secretaries, nurses, librarians, social workers, principals and their assistants, assessment personnel, coordinators, supervisors, psychologists, and superintendents, are cost-driven, except for the largest and most important component of all, the cost of providing teachers. It seems to us, as we said in <i>Small Schools II</i>, that the rationale for cost determination and annual review of the BEP components applies with equal if not greater force to teachers’ salaries, for it is undeniable that teachers are the most important component of any effective education plan, and that their salaries, a major item in every education budget, are a significant factor in determining where teachers choose to work. We recognized this fact seven years ago in <i>Small Schools II</i>, and we strongly reiterate it again today.…</p>
<p class="indent">The State’s contention that salaries have been equalized because all public school teachers have a minimum salary based on training and experience factors is unconvincing. Tennessee Code Annotated §49-3-306 has been the law since 1977. Assuming the State has been using the salary schedule mandated by that statute all along, particularly prior to <i>Small Schools II</i>, the State’s reliance on it does little to help its cause. In fact,…we observed in <i>Small Schools I</i> that making adjustments based on training and experience benefitted wealthier school districts because more funds were channeled to districts where better trained and experienced teachers worked. Most importantly, Tennessee Code Annotated §49-3-306 does nothing to address the problem of having an education funding system consisting entirely of cost-driven components except for the most important component of providing teachers.…</p>

<p class="indent">4. Inequality in access to quality teachers for poor and minority students is pervasive. Predominantly poor minority schools, in particular, tend to have less-qualified teachers.

Hanushek et al., <i>Why Public Schools Lose Teachers</i>, 39 <span class="smallcap">J. Hum. Resources</span> 326, 337 (2004). The best teachers often leave high-poverty, high-minority schools as soon as they obtain experience. <i>Id.</i> Predominantly minority schools are then forced to replace the departing teachers with inexperienced and less-qualified teachers. <i>Id.</i> Consequently, predominantly minority schools experience exceptionally high teacher turnover. <span class="smallcap">Educ.

<p class="h4a" id="ch89">e. School Efficiency and Consolidation</p>
<p class="indent">One response to school finance pressures has been to consolidate schools, with the assumption being that consolidating small school districts and/or schools would allow them to share administrative costs and presumably use the new excess funds to make improvements in other aspects of the education process. School closures and consolidations were particularly prevalent during the recent recession. Some districts were bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy and sought refuge from adjoining districts, and underenrolled school buildings were seen as an economic drain even in financially secure districts. <i>See generally</i> Kristi L. Bowman, <i>Before School Districts Go Broke: A Proposal for Federal Reform</i>, 79 <span class="smallcap">U. Cin. L. Rev</span>. 895 (2011). Consolidation, however, does not come without costs. Most obvious are additional transportation costs. Less obvious are potential losses of community support, community values, and close relationships between students, teachers, and staff. The following excerpt from one of West Virginia’s school finance opinions explores both these effects. The narrative following the case further develops the indirect effects.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch90">Pendleton Citizens for Community Schools v. Marockie</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>507 S.E.2d 673 (W. Va. 1998)</i></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">This case arises out of the closing of a small (130 students in grades 7-12) high school program in Circleville, Pendleton County, West Virginia. In 1995, the Pendleton County Board of Education decided to require that Pendleton County students in grades 7-12 who would have attended school in Circleville would instead attend a new, county-wide consolidated high school being built in Franklin, about 17 miles from Circleville. Franklin is the county seat, and has an existing high school, with about 500 students in grades 7-12. The new consolidated high school would have about 650 students.</p>
<p><a id="page_240" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>240</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The appellees made two general contentions in the circuit court. First, appellees contended that the [West Virginia School Building Authority (“SBA”)], which provides money to counties for school construction, ordinarily awards such money only to fund construction at schools that meet minimum “economies of scale” size requirements—for high schools, 200 per grade level.</p>
<p class="indent">This requirement may be waived only when a school will take all of a county’s students at a certain grade level, as is the case for the new consolidated high school in Pendleton County. Without such a “single county high school waiver,” the new high school would have to have 1,200 students—6 grades times 200 students per grade—to achieve “economies of scale.” There are not 1,200 high school students in all of Pendleton County.</p>
<p class="indent">The appellees contend that this SBA funding practice effectively forces county school boards in sparsely populated rural counties to consolidate high schools, regardless of and to the overall educational detriment of the children who have been attending smaller schools. Appellees also contend that school boards, particularly in less prosperous, sparsely populated, rural counties, cannot themselves ordinarily refurbish or replace smaller, non-consolidated high schools like Circleville, without funding assistance from the SBA.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, say appellees, the SBA’s use of “economies of scale” in evaluating requests for funding effectively forces the closure of smaller community high schools that are otherwise efficient and effective in the ways that matter most to their students and communities.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">Rather than taking up the major task of dissecting [the various] disputes about the circuit court’s findings, we take the simpler approach of accepting the circuit court’s findings, for argument’s sake only-insofar as the court found: (1) that SBA and State Board funding policies for school construction and salaries promote and substantially contribute to the closing of smaller high school programs like Circleville High, and drive the establishment of larger, consolidated high schools; and (2) that such high school consolidations, including the Pendleton County high school consolidation at issue in the instant case, have more of an adverse effect on the children whose former school is being closed than on the other children closer to the community where the consolidated school is located—these effects being lengthy travel, difficulties in full participation, etc.—in short, all of the negative effects listed in the circuit court’s factual findings that are quoted <i>supra.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Given these assumed facts, [the primary legal question is whether] the alleged SBA/State Board “bias” in favor of consolidation [is] unconstitutional? We held in <i>Pauley v. Kelly</i>, 255 S.E.2d 859 (1979), that: [1.] The mandatory requirements of “a thorough and efficient system of free schools” found in Article XII, Section 1 of the West Virginia Constitution, make education a fundamental, constitutional right in this State[; and 2.] Because education is a fundamental, constitutional right in this State, under our Equal Protection Clause any discriminatory classification found in the State’s educational financing system cannot stand unless the State can demonstrate some compelling State interest to justify the unequal classification.</p>
<p><a id="page_241" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>241</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Assuming (<i>arguendo</i>) that children who have or would have attended smaller, more local community high schools like Circleville do not do as well in or are not as well served by larger consolidated high schools, and that this disparity is associated with a child’s residence or wealth, the question then is whether such a disparity implicates and violates our state constitutional guarantee of the right of education? This Court has not shied from finding that distinctions and disparities based on wealth or residence may lead to finding a violation of the constitutional right to education. In the instant case, appellees base their argument not on disparities in buildings, books, curricula, or teacher salaries, but on the allegedly inherently harmful effects of taking children on long daily bus rides to a school where they and their families are less able to be involved in a wide range of educational and extra-curricular learning activities. Appellees say that modern facilities and equipment do not and cannot make up for the loss of the more fundamental, human-scale educational virtues of the smaller school that is closed as part of consolidation. In sum, appellees asserted and the circuit court found that the closing of Circleville High would on balance be educationally injurious to the appellees, in a disparate and discriminatory fashion associated with their residence and wealth.</p>
<p class="indent">Did the circuit court properly find such discriminatory and disparate injuries to the appellees? The appellants assert and the appellees do not disagree that no jurisdiction has found that school consolidation and/or a state policy of incentives to consolidate result in disparities and adverse effects that implicate a constitutional right to educational services and opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">If we assume <i>arguendo</i> that the appellees sufficiently proved that the SBA/State Board policies generally and in the instant case create or contribute to adverse educational effects and disparities, based on wealth and residence, that are of constitutional significance—then the issue that immediately follows is whether the challenged actions that create or contribute to such alleged effects and disparities are—under a strict scrutiny review—necessary, reasonable, least restrictive and narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest.</p>
<p class="indent">As to what state interests are served by a policy of promoting or favoring “economies of scale”—that is, high schools of a certain size (or as close thereto as may be achieved in a county)—the appellants advanced several reasons for such a policy, including: (1) the need to spend limited state educational funds economically; (2) the need to see that all students have access to enhanced curricular offerings; (3) the need have modern, safe physical facilities; and (4) the need to balance competing local and regional needs, interests and resources to achieve greater statewide equality and adequacy of educational opportunity. No one disputes that these are compelling state interests.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, the circuit court concluded that none of these (or any other) compelling state interests were served in a necessary, feasible, least restrictive and narrowly tailored fashion by the appellants’ allegedly pro-consolidation bias in the distribution of state funds for school building and personnel salaries. The circuit court concluded generally that the state’s interests could and should be advanced in a less restrictive and more narrowly tailored fashion.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on these conclusions, the circuit court ordered that the County Board’s decision to close Circleville High be set aside. The circuit court also</p>
<p><a id="page_242" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>242</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">ordered the SBA and State Board to modify their policies governing salaries and economies of scale to eliminate any pro-consolidation bias.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the circuit court’s order did not with any degree of specificity identify or evaluate the nature or costs (financial and otherwise) of statewide policies by the SBA and State Board that would not give preference to “economies of scale”—or more particularly, of policies that would if applied fund the continued existence of Circleville High.</p>
<p class="indent">In the instant case, there is no reasonably detailed identification, evaluation or comparison by the circuit court of alternatives to the policies complained of by the appellees. It is not otherwise clear from the record that there are less discriminatory, feasible, more narrowly tailored and less restrictive alternatives to those policies—that are themselves not educationally injurious and discriminatory in other ways of arguably equal importance.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, we will not sustain the circuit court’s conclusion that the SBA/State Board approach to funding school construction and salaries—and the allegedly resulting closing of Circleville High—is not a narrowly tailored, least restrictive method necessary to advance a compelling state interest.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What, if any, are the benefits of school consolidation? What, if any, are the negative effects? What effects are of constitutional significance: standardized test achievement; graduation rates; staffing costs, quality, and feasibility; student and parental satisfaction or comfort level in schools; student participation in extracurricular activities and civic life? If consolidation does not significantly affect student achievement, do students have a legitimate constitutional objection to consolidation?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Assuming educational budgets are extremely limited in some states and communities, is consolidation justified out of necessity, even if it does cause some harm, so long as the benefits outweigh the costs? The South Carolina Supreme Court recently found that many small school districts in the state had “administrative costs which are disproportionate to the number of students served by th[e] district, and which divert precious funding and resources from the classroom.” It suggested these costs might be a factor in the inadequate education in these districts and that the state should consider consolidation. Abbeville v. State, 767 S.E.2d 157, 172-173 (2014).</p>
<p class="indent">3. On what basis does the West Virginia Supreme Court reject plaintiffs’ challenge to school consolidation?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Greg Malhoit and Derek Black note that the number of public schools has declined by 69 percent since 1940 even though the student population has grown by 70 percent. The result has been a huge growth in the size of schools. This growth is premised on cost savings and improved educational opportunities. But in places like West Virginia, the assumptions have not necessarily proven true. “After consolidation, the new larger schools have usually been unable to show any significant savings and, at times, have proven to be more expensive</p>
<p><a id="page_243" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>243</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">because of increases in discipline, drop-outs, and absenteeism. When measured by the cost per graduate, small schools can be cheaper because they have been shown to graduate a higher percentage of their students.…[R]esearch has shown that economies of scale sometimes associated with larger schools are offset once the school’s student population increases to a certain level.” <i>The Power of Small Schools: Achieving Equal Educational Opportunity Through Academic Success and Democratic Citizenship,</i> 82 <span class="smallcap">Neb. L. Rev</span>. 50, 87-88 (2003). Malhoit and Black also emphasize that “[b]y scaling down the size of a school, the school becomes more capable of shaping the types of individualized programs that are necessary for each student to gain an adequate education.…[I]n smaller schools, ‘the learning needs of the students, not the organizational needs of the school, drive school operations.’ Consolidation policies greatly miss the reality and import of this point.” <i>Id</i>. at 90.</p>
<p class="indent">5. The strongest case for small schools may be their ability to generate higher student participation in educational and extracurricular activities. This participatory experience tends to carry over into adulthood. If state educational litigation is not just about test scores but also about producing good citizens, should courts be more attuned to democracy issues and force remedies that ensure more than just positive achievement outcomes? Or is the democratic aspect of education simply aspirational?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Some large schools have tried to create environments analogous to those of small schools by creating schools-within-a-school, whereby students interact and move within only a smaller community in the school. <span class="smallcap">A.M. Burke</span>, <span class="smallcap">Making a Big School Smaller: The School-Within-a-School Arrangement for Middle Level Schools</span> (1987); <span class="smallcap">G.

Way</span>, <span class="smallcap">Evaluation of the School Within a School</span> (1985). While some of these programs have proven effective, they are not as consistently effective as small schools themselves.</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch92">C. CONTINUING INEQUALITIES</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch93">Ross Wiener &amp; Eli Pristoop, How States Shortchange the Districts That Need the Most Help</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>The Education Trust, Funding Gaps (2006)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In 26 of the 49 states studied, the highest poverty school districts receive fewer resources than the lowest poverty districts. [A]cross the country, state and local funds provide $825 per student less in the highest poverty districts than in the most affluent districts. Four states—Illinois, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania—shortchange their highest poverty districts by more than $1,000 per student per year. These states, and others that allow funding gaps to persist, are compounding the disadvantages that low-income students face outside of school and undercutting public education’s ability to act as an engine of social mobility.</p>
<p class="indent">In 28 states, high-minority districts receive less state and local money for each child than low-minority districts. Across the country, $908 less per student is spent on students in the districts educating the most students of color, as compared to the districts educating the fewest students of color.</p>
<p class="indent">[Assessments of equality in terms of] absolute dollar numbers actually understate the inequity suffered by high-poverty districts. To educate children growing up in poverty to common, meaningful standards costs more. Children from low-income families need more instructional time and especially well trained teachers. To provide another way of looking at state funding gaps, we also calculate the gaps with a 40 percent adjustment for educating students growing up in poverty. We use this 40 percent adjustment because it is included in the federal Title I formula to determine whether state funding policies are fair to low-income students. Title I funding to states that do not meet this standard is reduced. Studies that have attempted to quantify the additional costs of educating students growing up in poverty have often produced higher adjustments. Maryland, for example, determined that it would require virtually double the foundation funding to educate low-income students up to its state standards, and phased in a funding formula to meet that goal beginning in 2002. Others, such as Professor Liu, use a 60 percent adjustment.</p>
<p class="indent">Applying the 40 percent adjustment, the number of states that underfund school districts serving large numbers of poor children grows to 34, and the national gap goes from $825 to $1,307. Underneath this national gap lie huge differences among the states. Six states have per-student funding gaps that</p>
<p><a id="page_245" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>245</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">exceed $1,000 between high- and low-poverty districts; once the 40 percent adjustment is applied, Michigan and Montana join the four states that have funding gaps in excess of $1,000 (Illinois, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania).</p>
<p class="indent">A similar analysis based on districts serving students of color finds the same pattern: After the 40 percent adjustment for low-income students is made, school districts serving the largest concentrations of students of color receive $1,213 less per child than school districts serving the fewest children of color every year. (No adjustment is made on the basis of the percent minority enrollment.) Thirty states have funding gaps between their highest and lowest minority districts, and twelve have funding gaps that exceed $1,000 per child (Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).</p>
<p class="indent">Some states demonstrate that equitably funding education is possible. Kentucky and Massachusetts, for example, have targeted more money to high-poverty districts and coupled the monetary resources with meaningful accountability and technical assistance—and real progress has been accomplished. But equitable funding is not a panacea. Washington, for example, does not distribute its money in a particularly unfair way in comparison to other states, but that does not make up for the fact that it simply spends less on education than other states with similar wealth. There are, of course, examples where increased education funding has not translated into commensurate improvements in teaching and learning. We have to confront those issues seriously, but ignoring or condoning funding gaps only makes it harder to tackle the substantive problems.</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">While some meaningful gains in education funding occurred in several states prior to 2008, the Great Recession unraveled most of those gains and worsened inequalities elsewhere. During the recession, nearly every state imposed massive budget cuts to education. Equally problematic, those cuts remained years after the recession ended. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2014, states were “providing less per-pupil funding for kindergarten through 12th grade than they did seven years [earlier]—often far less.” Michael Leachman &amp; Chris Mai, <i>Most States Still Funding Schools Less Than Before the Recession</i>, <span class="smallcap">Ctr. on Budget &amp; Pol’y Priorities</span> (Oct. 16, 2014). Thirty states were spending less per pupil than they were before the recession and, in 14 states, the decrease was substantial. <i>Id</i>. Oklahoma, for instance, was spending almost 25 percent less in 2014 than in 2008. <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Most states have done something to address the problem, but their efforts have been far too modest. By 2012, all but two states had total gross domestic products that met or exceeded 2008 levels, but only 18 states increased their effort to fund education. <span class="smallcap">Bruce D. Baker et al., Is School Funding Fair? A National Report Card</span> 20 (2015). Instead, they placed their priorities elsewhere. The ten states making the biggest cuts in education following the recession continued to rank in the bottom half of the nation in terms of tax effort exerted to fund education. <i>Id</i>. at 19. The Education Law Center’s school funding fairness report</p>
<p><a id="page_246" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>246</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">ranked the funding effort in five of those ten states as an “F.” <i>Id.</i> Some states even continue to decrease their effort as tax revenues improve. <i>Id</i>. at 21, fig. 19. North Carolina, for instance, cut its education budget by 15 percent over the course of and following the recession and, during the same time, gave massive new tax cuts to the state’s highest income earners. <i>See, e.g</i>., Patrick Gleason, <i>North Carolina Lawmakers Build upon Historic Tax Reform</i>, <span class="smallcap">Forbes</span> (June 10, 2015); Michael Leachman &amp; Michael Mazerov, <i>State Personal Income Tax Cuts: Still a Poor Strategy for Economic Growth</i>, <span class="smallcap">Ctr. on Budget &amp; Pol’y Priorities (May 14, 2015).</span> The state maintained those education cuts in subsequent years notwithstanding the fact that by 2015 the state brought in nearly half a billion dollars in surplus revenues.

Office of the Governor, <i>Governor McCrory Praises $445 Million Revenue Surplus</i> (July 28, 2015), https://governor.nc.gov/press-release/governor-mccrory-praises-445-million-revenue-surplus.</p>
<p class="indent">In some states, these cuts were seemingly directed at the most needy districts. In Nevada, for instance, the gap between districts serving predominantly poor students and districts serving predominantly middle-income students grew dramatically during the recession. By 2012, the state was funding districts serving predominantly poor students at an astonishingly low rate compared to other districts—just 48 percent of the funding that the most advantaged districts received. <span class="smallcap">Baker</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 9. Likewise, in Georgia, the state cut $112 million from the education fund specifically designed to help close the gap between wealthier and poorer districts. <span class="smallcap">Nicholas Johnson et al., Ctr. on Budget &amp; Pol’y Priorities, An Update on State Budget Cuts: Governors Proposing New Round of Cuts for 2011: At Least 45 States Have Already Imposed Cuts That Hurt Vulnerable Residents</span> 11 (2010); Memorandum from Jeffery C.

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What do these continuing inequalities suggest about school finance litigation: that more must be filed, that it is ineffective, or that courts need to adopt better remedial strategies? Given what you have learned thus far, what should states, localities, and the federal government do to address these problems? The authors of this report point out that “states vary dramatically in the extent to which local taxes fund schools—from a low of 13 percent in New Mexico to a</p>
<p><a id="page_247" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>247</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">high of 60 percent in Connecticut.” <span class="smallcap">The Enduring Legacy of <i>Rodriguez</i>: Creating New Pathways to Equal Educational Opportunity</span> (Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. &amp; Kimberly Jenkins Robinson, eds. 2015) offers a variety of answers to these questions, critiquing past school finance litigation and proposing new strategies.</p>
<p class="indent">2. What, if anything, does an average gap of $825 per pupil between high-poverty and wealthy districts mean in real-world terms for students? Do we need more definitive answers to the questions of whether and how much money matters, or is this gap large enough to be problematic on its face? In an average elementary school of 400 students, a per-pupil gap of $825 amounts to a total gap of $330,000 per year. In many localities, that amount of money could pay the salary of 5 to 7 additional teachers. If the school previously had a teacher-to-student ratio of 1 to 25, those teachers would reduce that number to 1 to 17. Or that same amount of money could be used to drastically increase salaries and put the school in the position to upgrade the qualifications of its teachers, buy a new fleet of school buses, extend the school year by two months and enrich the quality of the curriculum throughout the year, provide after school tutoring to all at-risk students, and/or renovate a portion of the school building each year.</p>

<p class="indent">4. During and immediately following the recession, courts appeared reluctant to enforce constitutional rights, potentially fearing that legislatures would disregard their orders. In fact, in the two states in which courts did forcefully uphold constitutional rights and duties in education, the legislatures were particularly recalcitrant. <i>See, e.g</i>., David Sciarra &amp; Wade Henderson, <i>What’s the Matter with Kansas’ Schools</i>, N.Y.

<p class="noindent">How to measure funding gaps and their importance has been a point of disagreement, even among school funding advocates. In addition to Education Trust, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and <i>Education Week</i> regularly publish reports on funding inequality. A report by the Education Law Center, a leader in school finance litigation, points out limitations in the methodology used in these other studies. The Education Law Center argues that:</p>

<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The NCES per-pupil revenue measure masks differences in school funding within states, differences that can be as large as—or larger than—differences across states. This measure also does not account for differences in education costs within and across states and regions, and across labor markets, nor does it capture variations in student need and the variations in the resources needed to ensure that students with differing needs are able to meet common achievement and outcome standards, both within states and across states and regions. The NCES measure ignores the increased needs and costs of educating low-income students, especially those in concentrated poverty.</p>
<p><a id="page_248" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>248</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">While the Ed Week and Education Trust measures attempt to recognize differences in student need, particularly with regard to low-income students, they assign different and imprecise values—or “weights”—to account for those differences. In fact, one assigns a value nearly twice as large as the other, and neither is based on research on what it would actually take to close achievement gaps between poor and non-poor children.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither Ed Week nor Education Trust accounts for the large differences in state and local revenues that exist in very small, sparse rural districts versus larger urban and suburban districts.</p>
<p class="indent">The imprecise methods used by Ed Week and Education Trust lead to strikingly different and inconsistent rankings between the two measures.</p>

<span class="smallcap">Bruce D. Baker et al.</span>, <span class="smallcap">Is School Funding Fair? A National Report Card</span> 5-6 (2010).</p>
<p class="indent">The Education Law Center articulates its own solution to these flaws and starts with the question “What is fair school funding?” It defines it “as a state finance system that ensures equal educational opportunity by providing a sufficient level of funding distributed to districts within the state to account for additional needs generated by student poverty.” <i>Id.</i> Its methodology for measuring fairness is built on six principles: (1) “Varying levels of funding are required to provide equal educational opportunities to children with different needs”; (2) “The costs of education vary based on geographic location and other factors, particularly regional differences in teacher salaries, school district size, population density, and various student characteristics”; (3) “The level of funding should increase relative to the level of concentrated student poverty”; (4) “State finance systems should deliver greater levels of funding to higher-poverty versus lower-poverty settings, while controlling for differences in other cost factors”; (5) “While the distribution of funding to account for student poverty is crucial, the overall level of funding still matters—greatly.…If the overall level of funding generated by the state system is woefully inadequate, it is of little consolation that students in high-poverty districts receive more resources than those in lower-poverty districts”; (6) “The sufficiency of the overall funding level in any given state can be assessed based on comparisons with other states, particularly those in the same region with similar conditions and characteristics.” <i>Id.</i> at 7-8. Based on these principles, the report analyzes and grades state finance systems on four different measures: funding levels in comparison to other states, the extent to which funding within states is distributed to meet student need, the amount of effort states exert relative to their fiscal capacity, and the proportion of students attending public rather than private school.</p>
<p class="indent">This more sophisticated analysis produces instructive findings. It identifies a few states that are doing a relatively good job of driving additional funding to the highest-need districts. But it shows most states are not. In fact, some do the opposite by driving more funds to those districts that need it the least. The report, however, also shows that about three-quarters of the states are underfunding education as a general matter, regardless of whether they are distributing the funds they have fairly, which corresponds with relatively low effort in raising education funds even when states have the capacity to do so. Tennessee provides an example of this ironic complexity. Tennessee is one of the most progressive states in funding its high-need districts, but its actual per-pupil expenditures ranked last in the nation and its funding effort was nearly the same. <i>Id.</i> at 15, 18, 27.</p>
<p><a id="page_249" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>249</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">What none of these studies do is attempt to measure actual educational quality or its correlation with money. Of course, that is the key question. As revealed in various sections of this chapter, school finance and quality litigation has regularly relied on student achievement on standardized tests as a rough indicator of school quality or deficiency. Student achievement is far from conclusive as to any legal inquiry of equity or quality, but student achievement provides a relevant data point to examine when comparing and assessing schools.</p>
<p class="indent">These data points, regardless of their cause, are troubling in several respects. As measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2009, only one out of three eighth-grade students is “proficient” in reading. The results are similar in math. The numbers are less shocking when measuring whether students are achieving at a “basic level,” but about a quarter of students still achieve below basic in math and reading. The statistics are even worse for minority students. African American students’ achievement on the national assessment lags 27 scaled points behind whites in reading and 31 points in math. This achievement gap is equivalent to two to three years of learning. Thus, African American eighth graders are earning scores equivalent to sixth-grade white students.</p>
<p class="indent">Minority students, however, are not the only ones left behind. Students, regardless of race, are also disadvantaged based on the state in which they happen to live. For instance, no more than one out of four students achieve at or above proficiency in fourth-grade math in Alabama, Mississippi, and the District of Columbia, whereas over half of the students in Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Jersey achieve at or above proficiency. Various scholars argue that NAEP overstates education shortcomings because the test is too exacting and not precisely tailored to what state curricula dictate that students should learn.

<p class="h5a"><i>In The Price We Pay: Economic and Social Consequences of Inadequate Education (Clive R. Belfield &amp; Henry M. Levin eds., 2007)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An excellent education for all of America’s children has benefits not only for the children themselves but also for the taxpayer and society. A copious body of research literature has established that poor education leads to large public</p>
<p><a id="page_250" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>250</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and social costs in the form of lower income and economic growth, reduced tax revenues, and higher costs of public services such as health care, criminal justice, and public assistance. Therefore we can view efforts to improve educational outcomes for at-risk populations as public investments that may yield benefits considerably in excess of investment costs.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1970 the Select Senate Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity commission[ed] a study [to] provide at least an estimate of the benefits to the taxpayer of reducing the magnitude of inadequate education.</p>
<p class="indent">[The study] estimated that $237 billion in lifetime income in 1970 dollars (about $1.2 trillion in 2004 dollars) was lost by failing to ensure that all persons attained a minimum of high school completion, including about $71 billion ($350 billion in 2004 dollars) in government revenues. The effects of inadequate education on public assistance and crime and their costs were also reviewed, as well as evidence on the effects of poor education on reduced political participation and intergenerational mobility and higher health costs. Because of data shortcomings, however, these estimates were highly speculative.</p>
<p class="indent">The study assumed that educational investments in compensatory resources would have to increase by 50 percent for every year of schooling, elementary through high school, in order to provide the resources that would lead to graduation. The overall cost of providing these additional resources for the dropout cohort that was analyzed was estimated at about $40 billion in 1970 dollars (about $200 billion in 2004 dollars). When this figure was compared with just the benefits of higher tax revenues from increased high school completion, the benefits were almost twice the costs. Under a substantial range of assumptions it appeared that investing in reducing the number of poorly educated people in the population would have public benefits well in excess of the costs.</p>
<p class="indent">[A similar study “of Texas ninth graders in 1982-83” estimated that “a dropout prevention program” would save the state $17.5 billion “in public assistance, training and adult education, crime and incarceration, and unemployment insurance and placement and to higher earnings associated with the additional high school graduates,” while the cost of the program was “slightly less than $2 billion, for a benefit to cost ratio of nine to one.” All past research, however,] has serious shortcomings because of the early vintage of the research. Only recently have detailed data that enable the linking of educational levels to participation in crime, health, public assistance, and tax revenues become available.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Inadequate Education Today</span></p>
<p class="indent">[R]oughly three of every ten students in the United States are not graduating from high school on time. There are significant differences in dropout rates by race and by gender. The black male public high school graduation rate is 42 percent, in comparison with 48 percent for Hispanic males and 71 percent for white males. The disparities are smaller for females, but they follow the same pattern: black females graduate at a rate of 56 percent, Hispanic females at 59 percent, and white females at 77 percent. The overall male dropout rate is 23 percent.</p>
<p><a id="page_251" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>251</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Overall, a significant number of persons entering the labor market lack an adequate education. Although there are about 800,000 noncompleters, we assume that the 709,000 who have succeeded in reaching at least tenth grade might be considered prospects for high school graduation. This subgroup of persons might become graduates if effective educational interventions were implemented.</p>
<p class="indent">Increasing the numbers of people graduating from high school will also enable and motivate more of them to attend college. These may be the same new graduates or they may be people who would have graduated in the absence of new interventions but were motivated by the programs to attend college and to raise their employment prospects. Raising educational standards in high school would mean more college education, resulting in additional economic benefits. To capture these effects we can conceive of an “expected high school graduate,” a person who is a new high school graduate and in addition now has some probability of progressing to college and completing a degree.</p>
<p class="indent">Approximately 80 out of 100 new high school graduates are expected to terminate their education after high school, and of the remainder, three-quarters are likely to attend but not complete college. Nevertheless, for all groups it is likely that inducing expected dropouts to graduate will yield a further upgrading of education into college. This upgrading effect must also be counted in examining the cost to the nation of inadequate education.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Aggregate Effects of Raising the Number of High School Graduates</span></p>
<p class="indent">Aspirationally, we wish to find ways for all students to graduate from high school and to receive an excellent education. The literature on the causes of dropping out, however, suggests that this will not be accomplished by even the most promising educational interventions. Both statistical studies and surveys of dropouts suggest that the quality or type of education received is not a sole factor. Family problems, frequent residential moves and school mobility, limited cognitive or physical abilities, psychological problems, pregnancies, and financial constraints all exert pressure on students to drop out.</p>
<p class="indent">Realistically, we might expect a reduction of the dropout rate by up to 50 percent for persons who currently have a ninth to eleventh grade education—that is, those on the margin of graduation. [E]ach effective intervention typically raises the number of on-time high school graduates by 10 out of 100 students, and school officials are not restricted to applying only one intervention per student. Moreover, we believe other strategies can further reduce dropout rates, although they will draw more heavily upon policies for providing support and resources to families and communities in conjunction with schools.</p>
<p class="indent">[R]educing the dropout rate by 50 would mean 354,030 new high school graduates. Most of them would terminate their education after high school, but 50,000 would progress to some college education, and 20,000 would obtain a four-year college degree. Ensuring an adequate education for this number of persons would yield a significant economic gain for taxpayers and society.</p>
<p class="indent">The additional tax payments received from high school graduates as opposed to high school dropouts are substantial, and they are even greater for</p>
<p><a id="page_252" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>252</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">people who undertake some postsecondary education as a consequence of high school graduation. Even the completion of one more year of schooling by age 20 yields to the government the present-value equivalent of $50,000.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to paying less in taxes, high school dropouts are costlier to society because of their dependence on publicly subsidized health care. Peter Muennig estimates that each additional high school graduate would save the government the present-value equivalent of $39,000 over his or her lifetime from age 20. [Likewise, d]ropouts are incarcerated at rates twice those of high school graduates, leading to much greater public spending on policing, the court system, and the prison system. Moretti finds that a one-year increase in average schooling reduces murder and assault by almost 30 percent, motor vehicle theft by 20 percent, arson by 13 percent, and burglary and larceny by about 6 percent. Increasing the high school completion rate by just 1 percent for all men ages 20-60 could save the United States more than $1 billion a year in the costs of criminal justice.</p>
<p class="indent">[P]oor education [also] raises the probability that a person is on welfare, directly increasing the costs of providing public assistance. For example, single-mother high school graduates are from 24 to 55 percent less likely to be dependent on assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program than are high school dropouts.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he best solution would be to invest in educational interventions that ensure that as many students as possible graduate from high school, with an increasing portion of these proceeding to postsecondary education. By focusing resources on students who are receiving inadequate education, it is possible to obtain benefits far in excess of the costs of those investments. Increases in tax revenues and reductions in taxes paid into public health, criminal justice, and public assistance would amount to many billions of dollars a year in excess of the costs of educational programs that could achieve these results. Even these benefits of more and better education as a good investment do not include the gains in political participation or civic engagement that are also causally influenced by education. Effective investments to ensure high school graduation therefore produce high yields from the taxpayer’s perspective.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. With the need for economic efficiency during the recent recession, the notion that improving education would save society money became a particular point of advocacy for some groups. For instance, thousands of police chiefs, sheriffs, district attorneys, other law enforcement leaders, and violence survivors came together to form an organization called Fight Crime: Invest in Kids. The organization released a report in 2013 that advocated for more public investment in prekindergarten education as a way to reduce later criminal justice and social costs.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The cost of the state-federal partnership [to provide prekindergarten to low- and moderate-income children] is $75 billion over 10 years–a smart move when you consider the fact that</p>
<p><a id="page_253" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>253</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">we currently spend $75 billion every year on corrections nationwide to incarcerate over 2 million criminals.</p>
<p class="indent">By one estimate, this 10-year investment in preschool will produce over 2 million additional high school graduates. And if we can reduce the number of young people who commit felonies and the number who are incarcerated by 10 percent each—roughly half the reduction achieved by the Chicago Child-Parent Center program—we can reduce the number of individuals who are locked up by 200,000 each year. The resulting savings—$75 billion over the 10-year investment—could pay the federal costs of the preschool program.</p>
<p class="indent">These benefits have a tremendous bottom-line economic impact. An independent analysis of over 20 preschool programs demonstrated that quality preschool returned an average “profit” (economic benefits minus costs) to society of $15,000 for every child served, by cutting crime and the cost of incarceration, and reducing other costs such as special education and welfare. The state-federal proposal also offers states and communities resources for voluntary home visiting programs to coach new parents and for improving the quality of child care. One home visiting program, the Nurse-Family Partnership, cut abuse and neglect in half and cut later criminal convictions of participating children by more than half.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, <i>I’m the Guy You Pay Later: Sheriffs, Chiefs and Prosecutors Urge America to Cut Crime by Investing Now in High-Quality Education and Care</i> (2013). Even more boldly, Goldman Sachs and Pritzker Group invested their own private money to fund Salt Lake City, Utah’s prekindergarten education. Goldman Sachs’ was explicitly a financial venture. It lent the school district $4.6 million in return for an agreement that the city would repay the loan plus 40 percent of any savings that the district would reap over the next six years of those prekindergarten students’ education from reduced special education and other costs. Derek Black, <i>The Cost Savings of Pre-K: Who Should Reap the Reward?</i>, <span class="smallcap">Education Law Prof Blog</span>, June 17, 2013, <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2013/06/is-pre-k-a-good-business-investment.html" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2013/06/is-pre-k-a-good-business-investment.html</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">2. If these studies’ and ventures’ findings and conclusion are accurate, why have legislatures failed to make the appropriate investments in education?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Are the social costs of poor education relevant to school finance litigation or judicial reasoning? The findings of these studies are directly analogous to the Supreme Court’s reasoning in <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, in which the Court held that Texas’s denial of education to the children of undocumented immigrants was irrational because it would create a permanent underclass that would exact any number of financial and social costs on the state. 457 U.S. 202, 230 (1982).</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Belfield and Levin study is careful to note that some students will drop out of school regardless of how much we spend on education. Thus, increased expenditures may have no effect on that social phenomena. Why is that? What percentage of the dropouts could we reasonably expect to prevent? Interestingly, President Obama proposed mandating that students remain enrolled in school until they are 18 years old, rather than 16. Tamar Lewin, <i>Obama Wades into Issue of Raising Dropout Age</i>, <span class="smallcap">N.Y. Times</span>, Jan. 26, 2012, at A17.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Belfield and Levin do not calculate the cost of an adequate education. Is a high school diploma alone, regardless of its indication of educational quality or learning, really going to make a difference in a student’s earning capacity? Would high school graduates who are still destitute of basic skills find gainful employment, or just add to the number of unemployed graduates? Regardless, at</p>

<p class="noindent">a minimum, continued progress toward graduation would necessarily avoid the social ills that accompany dropping out of school, such as juvenile delinquency. Moreover, research indicates that dropping out of school leads to juvenile delinquency, which leads to long-term criminal activity that otherwise would not have occurred if students had simply remained in school. <i>See generally</i> Katayoon Majd, <i>Students of the Mass Incarceration Nation</i>, 54 <span class="smallcap">How.

<p class="h5a"><i>109 Yale L.J. 249 (1999)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The goal of school finance litigation, generally speaking, is to increase the amount and equalize the distribution of educational resources and, in so doing, to improve the academic opportunities and performance of students disadvantaged by existing finance schemes. Such litigation is not targeted to assist only minority students, but rather is designed to assist all “poor” students. School finance litigation is thus often depicted both as a means of moving beyond race as the salient issue in education reform and as an effective way to achieve educational equity and adequacy for disadvantaged students from all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Concomitantly, from its inception thirty years ago to the present, such litigation has been seen as either a supplement to or a substitute for desegregation litigation.</p>
<p class="indent">School finance litigation began in the late 1960s, at a time when civil rights advocates were growing disillusioned with the pace and progress of desegregation. More and more, one [currently] hears calls that desegregation is not the answer, that the NAACP may have erred in pushing for integration rather than for equalization, and that poor, urban, minority schools would succeed if only reform x, y, or z were adopted. Most of these reforms require funding, often funding above and beyond current levels, which naturally increases the importance of school finance schemes. School finance litigation, meanwhile, continues apace. Indeed, while desegregation is entering its twilight phase, school finance litigation shows no signs of abating.</p>
<p class="indent">It thus seems an appropriate time to consider school finance litigation and desegregation in tandem and to compare, before we turn our backs completely on desegregation, the relative benefits of school finance reform and desegregation. Surprisingly, such an examination has rarely occurred: Very little scholarly attention has been devoted to the relationship between school finance and desegregation or to the role that race plays in school finance reform. [But] one cannot fully understand the dynamics and limitations of school finance reform without considering the dynamics of race and school desegregation. Indeed, far from moving beyond race, school finance reform has been hamstrung by the obstacles created by poor race relations and the Court’s desegregation jurisprudence. [R]esidential segregation and the limited reach of school</p>
<p><a id="page_255" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>255</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">desegregation have helped to create and maintain schools that are isolated not simply by race but also by socioeconomic status. The effects of racial and socioeconomic isolation cannot be adequately addressed by school finance reform, because students in schools with high concentrations of poverty need more than increased funding to improve their achievement. Increasing expenditures in racially isolated schools, moreover, cannot replicate the social benefits of racially integrated schools. By helping to isolate not simply minority students, but poor minority students, race has played a critical role in creating and maintaining schools that appear to be beyond the reach of school finance reform.</p>
<p class="indent">To put the argument simply: Although it is possible that school finance reform could have been a helpful supplement to desegregation, it is a poor substitute. Despite the hopes of early school finance advocates, we should not expect school finance reform to solve the problems created by the failure to desegregate many urban schools. Indeed, not only [has] school finance reform done little to improve academic performance, it may be a costly distraction from the more productive policy of racial and socioeconomic integration.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III. The Creation and Consequences of Ghetto Schools</span></p>
<p class="indent">The schools that have been shaped by race and racial politics and that may be beyond the reach of school finance reform are mostly urban. Roughly two-thirds of black students attend elementary and secondary school in central-city districts. These central-city schools, in turn, are populated primarily by minority students—both African-American and Hispanic. [R]esidential segregation and the Court’s desegregation jurisprudence, which themselves are at least partially the product of poor race relations, have combined to create urban schools that are isolated by race and poverty. Such schools are more expensive to run and, at the same time, suffer from problems that money seems unable to solve. In this way, race has played a pivotal role in creating schools whose problems seem irremediable by school finance reform and increased expenditures.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Urban Schools: The Numbers</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Four general characteristics set urban schools apart from their suburban counterparts: student composition, student poverty, student performance, and dropout rates. Urban public schools are attended primarily by African-American and Hispanic students. [E]ducational opportunities are shaped by the second factor that sets urban schools apart from their suburban counterparts: Students in urban districts are disproportionately poor. Over half of the students in the largest urban districts were eligible for a free or reduced lunch in 1990-1991. The schools that have the highest minority enrollment also have the highest incidence of student poverty.</p>
<p class="indent">The third factor that sets urban schools apart is closely related to the second: Urban school students generally do not perform as well on standardized tests as students in either rural or suburban schools, and black students in particular do not perform as well as white students. More than half of fourth- and eighth-grade students attending urban schools do not even reach the most basic</p>
<p><a id="page_256" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>256</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">proficiency level on national tests in such subjects as reading, math, and science, which means that they likely cannot do grade-level work. In schools where a majority of the students are poor, the percentage of students who do not perform at even the basic level on national tests rises to at least two-thirds. In non-urban schools, by contrast, the figure is nearly the opposite: Two-thirds of the students score at least at the basic level on national tests.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, dropout rates for urban schools are dramatically higher than they are for non-urban schools. Dropout rates in all large, central-city school districts significantly exceed the national average of 11%. Among the nation’s forty-seven largest school districts, the average dropout rate is nearly twice the national average. In New Jersey, dropout rates in urban high schools reached as high as 47%. In Chicago, the dropout rate for children who begin their education in certain elementary schools has climbed to as high as 86%.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. Creating Ghetto Schools: Residential Segregation and Milliken I</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Today’s urban schools are not the product of accident, unadulterated preference, or simple economics. Rather, urban schools have been largely shaped by two complementary forces: residential segregation and the Court’s decision in <i>Milliken I.</i> Residential segregation and particularly the exodus of middle-class whites from central cities have served not only to isolate African-American students, but also to concentrate the effects of poverty in densely populated urban neighborhoods. <i>Milliken I</i> essentially immunized suburban schools from the reach of desegregation plans, thereby cutting off access to wealthier school systems and providing a “safe” haven for middle-class families seeking to exit urban schools.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C. The Costs of Isolation</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[T]he concentration of poverty within urban schools has significant consequences for school financing and educational achievement, for several reasons. First, students from impoverished backgrounds have greater needs and thus cost more to educate. Schools filled with impoverished students, therefore, generally will be costlier to run than schools filled with middle- and upper-income students. Second, the difficulties created by concentrated poverty in schools may not be best addressed, and are perhaps irremediable, by increased expenditures. There are theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Third, the fact that the schools themselves are located in poor neighborhoods seems to exert a deleterious influence on the administration of the school districts and to create a dynamic in which the schools are seen as jobs programs as much as academic institutions. The maladministration of schools makes implementing reforms and spending money wisely more difficult, which ironically both casts doubt on the accuracy of the argument that money does not matter (because it is hard to know if money matters when it is not spent properly) and gives great political and popular strength to the same argument (because many urban schools provide glaring examples of the apparent inefficacy of increased expenditures).</p>
<p><a id="page_257" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>257</b></a></p>
<p class="h10b"><i>1. Monetary Costs</i></p>
<p class="indent">Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds come to school with greater needs than their more advantaged peers. Such students suffer more from malnutrition and poor health care; lack of parental involvement and a nurturing, stimulating home environment; frequent changes of residence; and exposure to violence and drug use. As a result of these obstacles, “[m]any poor children start school with an approximately two-year disadvantage compared to many suburban youngsters. This two-year disadvantage often increases when urban students move through the educational system without receiving special attention.” Greater needs require greater resources: Disadvantaged students simply cost more to educate, requiring additional educational programs and non-academic services such as health care and counseling. It follows that schools with large concentrations of impoverished students will face the greatest educational costs.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>2. Nonmonetary Costs and the Limited Efficacy of Increased Expenditures</i></p>
<p class="indent">The second cost of racially isolated schools is more complex, and it is not one that money seems capable of addressing. The cost stems from the influence of peers. It is intuitive to any parent, as well as to those who remember their own experience in elementary and secondary school, that a student’s peers will exert a strong influence on the student’s attitude toward and behavior in school. Intuition in this instance coincides with social science evidence, which demonstrates not only that a student’s peers affect behavior, but that they also affect academic achievement. James Coleman’s famous, mammoth, and controversial 1966 report, entitled Equality of Educational Opportunity, found that “student body characteristics” account for “an impressive percent of variance” in student achievement, and that the influence appears greatest on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Numerous studies since the Coleman report have reached similar conclusions, and there now exists a well-developed body of research that indicates that achievement levels depend not only on a student’s own socioeconomic status but also on the status of his or her peers.</p>
<p class="indent">To the extent that a student’s peers and the culture of a school exert demonstrable influence on student achievement, simply increasing expenditures in schools populated by poor students will not necessarily affect achievement. The stronger the influence of peers on performance, the less likely it is that money will make much of a difference—and the more likely it is that changing the composition of the school will make a difference. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, no experiments exist in which this specific hypothesis has been tested to determine whether negative peer influences, at some point, could be overcome by increased expenditures. There is, however, some empirical evidence that suggests that even substantial increases in school expenditures have little effect on student achievement when the student composition remains predominantly poor.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, one potential explanation for the apparent lack of relationship between spending and achievement is that money is not being spent effectively. This point is made by researchers who suggest that money spent wisely does</p>
<p><a id="page_258" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>258</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">matter. [Yet, the] debate over the extent to which “money matters” will not likely be resolved soon. It is sufficient for now to make two observations. First, it is fairly clear that increased expenditures in racially isolated and high-poverty schools have not yet led to significant improvements in student achievement. Second, the studies support the intuitive position that money spent poorly will not translate into academic gains, while money spent wisely may indeed accomplish some academic improvement—although just how much gain one can reasonably expect is far from clear. In short, the evidence indicates that increasing expenditures in racially and socioeconomically isolated schools has not in the past been a very effective strategy for assisting students; whether it will be in the future is at best debatable and depends on whether the resources are spent wisely.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D. A Reprise</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Race plays an important, if not paramount, role in keeping certain school districts beyond the reach of school finance reform. [T]o the extent that race relations are responsible for the concentration of poor minority students in urban public schools, education policies that hold some promise of improving race relations may be more effective in the long run than policies that intentionally or unintentionally avoid the issue. School finance reform seems to fall squarely in the latter category because it operates from a premise that accepts rather than challenges the fact that most urban schools are isolated by race and poverty. Insofar as it is the very fact of isolation that must be overcome in order to improve substantially the opportunities of students attending urban schools, alternatives (or at least additions) to school finance litigation deserve to be considered—or reconsidered.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Do you agree that school finance reforms are unlikely to or cannot deliver quality educational opportunities to urban students? Would it be more accurate to say that the cost of delivering an adequate education to students in concentrated poverty is simply too high and hard to reasonably expect that states will do so? Is it any more reasonable to believe that schools will make systemic reforms that produce more integration?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Ryan also implies an economic argument: that the cost of educating students in concentrated poverty is inefficient. If a state had no choice but to deliver an adequate education to urban students, would the economic inefficiency of doing so create an incentive for integration that does not currently exist? If so, is the first step to push as hard as possible on adequately funding segregated schools until the state sees the error in its ways?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If states, even after school finance reform, are providing inadequate funds for urban schools, should individual students have some remedy other than waiting for the state to allocate sufficient resources? What would that remedy be?</p>
<p><a id="page_259" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>259</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">4. Scholars, including Ryan, have argued for a fourth wave of school finance litigation that would not demand more financial resources but more changes to student assignment policies. <i>See</i> Christopher E. Adams, <i>Is Economic Integration the Fourth Wave in School Finance Litigation?</i>, 56 <span class="smallcap">Emory L.J</span>. 1613, 1627-1631 (2007). Thus far, the Connecticut Supreme Court is the only state court to recognize such a claim under a state constitution. If money is insufficient to deliver equal or adequate opportunities to urban schools, does it follow that a constitutional right to education includes the right to a different school environment, such as an economically integrated one, or is it sufficient that the state makes its best effort to provide a good education in neighborhood schools?</p>
<p class="indent">5. In a second article, Ryan argues that, while race is not explicitly at issue in most school finance cases, race plays an implicit role in how the public and institutional stakeholders respond to demands for reform. James E. Ryan, <i>The Influence of Race in School Finance Reform</i>, 98 <span class="smallcap">Mich. L. Rev</span>. 432 (1999). He points out that the only two studies available on public attitudes found that white citizens “inaccurately perceived school finance reform as primarily benefiting blacks” and that “the level of support among whites depended as much upon racial attitudes as it did upon self-interest.” <i>Id.</i> at 432-433. Ryan himself then attempts to assess whether race has played a role in how courts and legislatures respond to school finance litigation. Based on his review of litigation and legislative outcomes, he found</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">that minority school districts—particularly urban minority districts—do not fare as well as white districts in school finance litigation. More precisely, minority districts do not win school finance cases nearly as often as white districts do, and in the few states where minority districts have successfully challenged school finance schemes, they have encountered legislative recalcitrance that exceeds, in both intensity and duration, the legislative resistance that successful white districts have faced. As this and additional evidence suggests, there are strong reasons to believe that the racial composition of the school district plays an influential role in determining its success or failure in school finance litigation and legislative reform.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Id.</i> at 433-434. Ryan admits to painting with a “broad brush” and that various factors might explain the results, but of the 18 successful school finance cases decided at that time, only 1 was brought on behalf of predominantly minority urban school districts. <i>Id.</i> at 435, 451. In contrast, of the 19 unsuccessful cases, 7 were on behalf of urban minority districts. <i>Id.</i> at 453. “In sum, predominantly minority districts have won only three of the twelve school finance challenges (25%) in which they were plaintiffs. Predominantly white districts, by contrast, have won eleven of fifteen cases (73%) if one excludes the cases involving large coalitions of districts.” <i>Id.</i> at 455. Moreover, if one looks only at districts that are both predominantly minority and urban, the success rate was only 12.5 percent. <i>Id.</i> And while as a general principle “court decisions declaring school finance systems un-constitutional typically provoke some controversy and legislative opposition,” the few minority districts that secured court victories have “faced protracted legislative battles that were more intense and longer-lasting than those typically faced by successful white districts.” <i>Id.</i> at 457-458.</p>
<p><a id="page_260" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>260</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">What other factors might explain these results: more political power in suburban and rural districts (who look out for themselves), the level of need in high-poverty minority districts, or something else?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Thus far, neither desegregation nor school finance litigation has garnered effective and lasting success for minority students. Should advocates refocus on desegregation, continue with school finance, blend the two into a single strategy, or embark on other reforms? For a discussion of potential new strategies, see <span class="smallcap">The Enduring Legacy of <i>Rodriguez</i>: Creating New Pathways to Equal Educational Opportunity</span> (Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. &amp; Kimberly Jenkins Robinson, eds. 2015).</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="noindent">Advocates did eventually challenge segregation as a violation of equality and adequacy within the context of school finance theories. As described in the second chapter, mandatory school desegregation was waning in several respects due to unfavorable Supreme Court precedent. At the same time, school finance litigation was gaining momentum and establishing crucial legal principles: an affirmative right to education and state responsibility for delivering it. These two principles would potentially allow advocates to avoid the difficulties presented in proving intentional discrimination, interdistrict violations, and state responsibility, all of which had served to drastically limit desegregation in federal court. The first and most significant attempt to take advantage of more favorable state precedent was in Connecticut.</p>

<p class="indent">The public elementary and high school students in Hartford suffer daily from the devastating effects that racial and ethnic isolation, as well as poverty, have had on their education. Federal constitutional law provides no remedy for their plight. The principal issue in this appeal is whether, under the unique provisions of our state constitution, the state, must take further measures to relieve the severe handicaps that burden these children’s education. The issue is as controversial as the stakes are high. We hold today that the needy schoolchildren of Hartford have waited long enough. The constitutional imperatives of our state constitution entitle the plaintiffs to relief. At the same time, the constitutional imperative of separation of powers persuades us to afford the legislature, with the assistance of the executive branch, the opportunity, in the first instance, to fashion the remedy that will most appropriately respond to the constitutional violations that we have identified.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Statewide, in the 1991-92 school year, children from minority groups constituted 25.7 percent of the public school population. In the Hartford public</p>
<p><a id="page_261" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>261</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school system in that same period, 92.4 percent of the students were members of minority groups, including, predominantly, students who were either African-American or Latino. Fourteen of Hartford’s twenty-five elementary schools had a white student enrollment of less than 2 percent. The Hartford public school system currently enrolls the highest percentage of minority students in the state. In the future, if current conditions continue, the percentage of minority students in the Hartford public school system is likely to increase rather than decrease. Since 1980, the percentage of African-Americans in the Hartford student population has decreased, while the percentage of Latinos has increased. Although enrollment of African-American students in the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns has increased by more than 60 percent from 1980 to 1992, only seven of these school districts had a minority student enrollment in excess of 10 percent in 1992. Because of the negative consequences of racial and ethnic isolation, a more integrated public school system would likely be beneficial to all schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="indent">A majority of the children who constitute the public school population in Hartford come from homes that are economically disadvantaged, that are headed by a single parent and in which a language other than English is spoken. The percentage of Hartford schoolchildren at the elementary level who return to the same school that they attended the previous year is the lowest such percentage in the state. Such socioeconomic factors impair a child’s orientation toward and skill in learning and adversely affect a child’s performance on standardized tests. The gap in the socioeconomic status between Hartford schoolchildren and schoolchildren from the surrounding twenty-one suburban towns has been increasing. The performance of Hartford schoolchildren on standardized tests falls significantly below that of schoolchildren from the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns.</p>
<p class="indent">Directly or indirectly, the state has always controlled public elementary and secondary education in Connecticut. The legislature directs many aspects of local school programs, including courses of study and curricula, standardized testing, bilingual education, graduation requirements and school attendance. Since 1941, as a result of a state statute[,] the public school district boundaries in Hartford have been coterminous with the boundaries of the city of Hartford. Since at least 1909, as a result of another state statute[,] schoolchildren have been assigned to the public school district in which they reside.</p>
<p class="indent">The legislature provides substantial support to communities throughout the state to finance public school operations. State financial aid is distributed so that the neediest school districts receive the most aid[, which significantly benefits Hartford].</p>
<p class="indent">The state has not intentionally segregated racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. Except for a brief period in 1868, no students in Connecticut have intentionally been assigned to a public school or to a public school district on the basis of race or ethnicity. There has never been any other manifestation of de jure segregation either at the state or the local level. In addition to various civil rights initiatives undertaken by the legislature from 1905 to 1961 to combat racial discrimination, the state board of education was reorganized, during the 1980s, to concentrate on the needs of urban</p>
<p><a id="page_262" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>262</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">schoolchildren and to promote diversity in the public schools. Since 1970, the state has supported and encouraged voluntary plans for increasing interdistrict diversity.</p>
<p class="indent">The state has nonetheless played a significant role in the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. Although intended to improve the quality of education and not racially or ethnically motivated, the districting statute that the legislature enacted in 1909 is the <i>single most important factor</i> contributing to the present concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The districting statute and the resultant school district boundaries have remained virtually unchanged since 1909. The districting statute is of critical importance because it establishes town boundaries as the dividing line between all school districts in the state.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Article eighth, §1, and article first, §§1 and 20, impose on the legislature an <i>affirmative</i> constitutional obligation to provide schoolchildren throughout the state with a substantially equal educational opportunity. It follows that, if the legislature fails, for whatever reason, to take action to remedy substantial inequalities in the educational opportunities that such children are being afforded, its actions and its omissions constitute state action.</p>
<p class="indent">The affirmative constitutional obligation that we recognized in <i>Horton v. Meskill</i>, 376 A.2d 359 (Conn. 1977), and <i>Horton v. Meskill</i>, 486 A.2d 1099 (Conn. 1985), was not premised on a showing that the legislature had played an active role in <i>creating</i> the inequalities that the constitution requires it to redress. In <i>Horton I</i>, we determined that the state’s educational financing scheme was unconstitutional even though it was facially nondiscriminatory and even though the disparities resulting therefrom had not been created intentionally by the legislature. In declaring this statutory scheme unconstitutional in <i>Horton I</i>, and in requiring further remedial action in <i>Horton III</i>, we necessarily determined that the state’s failure adequately to address school funding inequalities constituted the state action that is the constitutional prerequisite for affording judicial relief.</p>
<p class="indent">The claims now before us likewise implicate the legislature’s affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to all of the state’s schoolchildren. The plaintiffs document the existence of an extensive statutory system developed in response to the legislature’s plenary authority over state public elementary and secondary schools. As a general matter, the plaintiffs challenge the failure of the legislature to address continuing unconstitutional inequities resulting, de facto, from that scheme. In addition, and more specifically, they point to two statutes that directly impact on their claims of constitutional deprivation. State law sets the borders of school districts to coincide with town boundaries; and requires all children to attend public school within the district in which they reside. The trial court expressly found that the enforcement of these statutes constitutes the “single most important factor” creating the present racial and ethnic imbalance in the Hartford public</p>
<p><a id="page_263" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>263</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school system. The failure adequately to address the racial and ethnic disparities that exist among the state’s public school districts is not different in kind from the legislature’s failure adequately to address the “great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education” that made the statutory scheme at issue in <i>Horton I</i> unconstitutional in its application.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he defendants urge us to follow federal precedents that concededly require, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that claimants seeking judicial relief for educational disparities pursuant to the equal protection clause of the United States constitution must prove intentional governmental discrimination. For two reasons, we are not persuaded. First and foremost, the federal cases start from the premise that there is no right to education under the United States constitution. <i>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</i>, 411 U.S. 1 (1973). Our Connecticut constitution, by contrast, contains a fundamental right to education and a corresponding affirmative state obligation to implement and maintain that right. Second, the federal cases are guided by principles of federalism. Principles of federalism, however, do not restrict <i>our</i> constitutional authority to enforce the constitutional mandates contained in article eighth, §1, and article first, §§1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">[U]nder our law, which imposes an affirmative constitutional obligation on the legislature to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity for all public schoolchildren, the state action doctrine is not a defense to the plaintiffs’ claims of constitutional deprivation. The state had ample notice of ongoing trends toward racial and ethnic isolation in its public schools, and indeed undertook a number of laudable remedial efforts that unfortunately have not achieved their desired end. The fact that the legislature did not affirmatively create or intend to create the conditions that have led to the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford public school system does not, in and of itself, relieve the defendants of their affirmative obligation to provide the plaintiffs with a more effective remedy for their constitutional grievances.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims. No statute, no common law precedent, no federal constitutional principle provides this state’s schoolchildren with a right to a public education that is not burdened by de facto racial and ethnic segregation. The plaintiffs make no such claim. The issue that they raise is whether they have stated a case for relief under our state constitution, which was amended in 1965 to provide both a right to a free public elementary and secondary education; Conn. Const., art. VIII, §1; and a right to protection from segregation. Conn. Const., art. I, §20. This issue raises questions that are difficult; the answers that we give are controversial. We are, however, persuaded that a fair reading of the text and the history of these amendments demonstrates a deep and abiding constitutional commitment to a public school system that, in fact and in law, provides Connecticut schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. A significant component of that substantially equal educational opportunity is access to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation.</p>
<p><a id="page_264" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>264</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Our analysis of this issue has three parts. First, what are the constituent elements of the affirmative constitutional mandate to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity in the context of alleged racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities? Second, does the plaintiffs’ complaint encompass these elements? Third, have the plaintiffs proven their claim?</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Since <i>Horton I</i>, it is common ground that the state has an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. Any infringement of that right must be strictly scrutinized.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue presented by this case is whether the state has fully satisfied its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity if the state demonstrates that it has substantially equalized school funding and resources. The defendants urge us to adopt such a limited construction of our constitution. The plaintiffs, to the contrary, urge us to adopt a broader formulation. They argue that the combination of “racial segregation, the concentration of poor children in the schools, and disparities in educational resources…deprive [Hartford schoolchildren] of substantially equal educational opportunities.” We agree with the plaintiffs in part. We need not decide, in this case, the extent to which substantial socioeconomic disparities or disparities in educational resources would themselves be sufficient to require the state to intervene in order to equalize educational opportunities. For the purposes of the present litigation, we decide only that the scope of the constitutional obligation expressly imposed on the state by article eighth, §1, is informed by the constitutional prohibition against segregation contained in article first, §20. Reading these constitutional provisions conjointly, we conclude that the existence of extreme racial and ethnic isolation in the public school system deprives schoolchildren of a substantially equal educational opportunity and requires the state to take further remedial measures.</p>
<p class="indent">Two factors persuade us that it is appropriate to undertake a conjoint reading of these provisions of our state constitution. One is the special nature of the affirmative constitutional right embodied in article eighth, §1. The other is the explicit prohibition of segregation contained in article first, §20.</p>
<p class="indent">The affirmative constitutional obligation of the state to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity, which is embodied in article eighth, §1, differs in kind from most constitutional obligations. Organic documents only rarely contain provisions that explicitly require the state to act rather than to refrain from acting. As we observed, however, in <i>Horton I</i> “educational equalization cases are ‘in significant aspects sui generis’ and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional tests or the application of mechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute.” Nothing in the description of the relevant legal landscape in any of</p>
<p><a id="page_265" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>265</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">our cases suggests that the constitutional right that we articulated in <i>Horton I</i> was limited to school financing.</p>
<p class="indent">For Connecticut schoolchildren, the scope of the state’s constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity is informed and amplified by the highly unusual<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml?favre=brett#note8" id="Rnote8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> provision in article first, §20, that prohibits segregation not only indirectly, by forbidding discrimination, but directly, by the use of the term “segregation.” The section provides in relevant part: “No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law <i>nor be subjected to segregation</i> or discrimination…because of…race [or]…ancestry.…”</p>
<p class="indent">The express inclusion of the term “segregation” in article first, §20, has independent constitutional significance. Fundamental principles of constitutional interpretation require that “[e]ffect must be given to every part of and each word in our constitution.”</p>
<p class="indent">The issue before us, therefore, is what specific meaning to attach to the protection against segregation contained in article first, §20, in a case in which that protection is invoked as part of the plaintiff school-children’s fundamental affirmative right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. In concrete terms, this issue devolves into the question of whether the state has a constitutional duty to remedy the educational impairment that results from segregation in the Hartford public schools, even though the conditions of segregation that contribute to such impairment neither were caused nor are perpetuated by invidious intentional conduct on the part of the state.</p>
<p class="indent">Linguistically, the term “segregation” in article first, §20, which denotes “separation,” is neutral about segregative intent. The section prohibits segregation that occurs “<i>because of</i> religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability” without specifying the manner in which such a causal relationship must be established.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever this language may portend in other contexts, we are persuaded that, in the context of public education, in which the state has an affirmative obligation to monitor and to equalize educational opportunity, the state’s awareness of existing and increasing severe racial and ethnic isolation imposes upon the state the responsibility to remedy “segregation…because of race [or]…ancestry.…” We therefore hold that, article eighth, §1, as informed by article first, §20, requires the legislature to take affirmative responsibility to remedy segregation in our public schools, regardless of whether that segregation has occurred de jure or de facto.</p>
<p class="indent">The history of the promulgation of article eighth, §1, and article first, §20, supports our conclusion. First, it is undisputed that the duty to provide a public education contained in article eighth, §1, and the prohibition against segregation contained in article first, §20, were proposed to and adopted by the voters of this state in response to the constitutional convention of 1965. When the convention delegates debated the desirability of both amendments to our state constitution, they recognized and endorsed the landmark decision in <i>Brown v. Board</i></p>
<p><a id="page_266" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>266</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>of Education</i> (1954). The primary motivation for the addition of article eighth, §1, to the constitution in 1965 appears to have been [to] provide [an] express right to public elementary and secondary education in its constitution. The delegates’ expectation that the proposed amendments to the constitution would secure interrelated constitutional rights was underscored by [one delegate’s] remark that article first, §20, was intended to be applied in the context of the “rights of freedom in education.”</p>
<p class="indent">Second, it is significant that the debate over the amendment of article first, §20, manifested the intention of the convention delegates to extend broad protection to all persons from all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination and segregation. The debate over the express inclusion of the term “segregation” focused not on whether including such a term might reach too far, but rather on whether it might invite too narrow a construction of the prohibition against discrimination. [T]he convention delegates inserted into article first, §20, constitutional language that was intended to prohibit not only discrimination, but also segregation on the basis of race or ethnicity.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the convention delegates’ manifest intent that article first, §20, by prohibiting segregation, should provide “total protection against discrimination” supports our conclusion that they intended to encompass de facto segregation in the circumstances presented by the present case. If significant racial and ethnic isolation continues to occur within the public schools, for which the legislature has an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity, no special showing of an invidious segregative intent is required.</p>
<p class="indent">It would be illogical not to prohibit all such segregation in light of the legislature’s otherwise comprehensive assumption of responsibility for the education of Connecticut schoolchildren. The legislature has created the current school districts, has required students to attend school and has determined which students will attend a particular school district. The state cannot now avoid its responsibilities by invoking constitutional restraints articulated for different purposes under different constitutional provisions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sound principles of public policy support our conclusion that the legislature’s affirmative constitutional responsibility for the education of all public schoolchildren encompasses responsibility for segregation to which the legislature has contributed, even unintentionally. The parties agree, as the trial court expressly found, that racial and ethnic segregation is harmful, and that integration would likely have positive benefits for all children and for society as a whole. Further, as the trial court also expressly found, the racial and ethnic isolation of children in the Hartford schools is likely to worsen in the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Racial and ethnic segregation has a pervasive and invidious impact on schools, whether the segregation results from intentional conduct or from unorchestrated demographic factors. “[S]chools are an important socializing institution, imparting those shared values through which social order and stability are maintained.” Schools bear central responsibility for “inculcating [the] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.” When children attend racially and ethnically isolated schools, these</p>
<p><a id="page_267" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>267</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">“shared values” are jeopardized: “If children of different races and economic and social groups have no opportunity to know each other and to live together in school, they cannot be expected to gain the understanding and mutual respect necessary for the cohesion of our society.” “[T]he elimination of racial isolation in the schools promotes the attainment of equal educational opportunity and is beneficial to all students, both black and white.” Our state constitution, as amended in 1965, imposes on the state an affirmative obligation to respond to such segregation.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The final issue before us is whether the plaintiffs have proven a violation of their fundamental right, under the state constitution, to a substantially equal educational opportunity that is free from substantial racial and ethnic isolation. We conclude that they have done so.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs have shown, and the defendants do not contest, that the disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of public schools in Hartford and the surrounding communities are more than de minimis. [T]he Hartford public school system currently enrolls the highest percentage of minority students in the state, and this percentage is likely to become even higher in the future, if current conditions continue. These disparities jeopardize the plaintiffs’ fundamental right to education.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants stress that the trial court also made extensive findings about the significant role that adverse socioeconomic conditions play in the difficulties encountered by Hartford schoolchildren. [These findings] do not undermine the plaintiffs’ claim. The trial court’s findings simply demonstrate that Hartford’s schoolchildren labor under a dual burden: their poverty <i>and</i> their racial and ethnic isolation. These findings regarding the causal relationship between the poverty suffered by Hartford schoolchildren and their poor academic performance cannot be read in isolation. They do not diminish the significance of the stipulations and undisputed findings that the Hartford public school system suffers from severe and increasing racial and ethnic isolation, that such isolation is harmful to students of all races, and that the districting statute codified at §10-240 is the single most important factor contributing to the concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The fact that, as pleaded, the plaintiffs’ complaint does not provide them a constitutional remedy for one of their afflictions, namely, their poverty, is not a ground for depriving them of a remedy for the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The uncontested evidence of the severe racial and ethnic isolation of Hartford’s schoolchildren demonstrates that the state has failed to fulfill its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all of the state’s schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. [T]he disparity in access to an unsegregated educational environment in this case arises out of state action and inaction that, prima facie, violates the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, although that segregation has occurred de facto rather than de jure.</p>
<p class="indent">[The court addresses the remedy in subsequent portions of the opinion.]</p>
<p><a id="page_268" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>268</b></a></p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The court writes that the “failure adequately to address the racial and ethnic disparities that exist among the state’s public school districts is not different in kind from the legislature’s failure adequately to address the ‘great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education.’ ” Are these two things, in fact, constitutionally the same?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the Connecticut Supreme Court hold that students have an affirmative right to integrated schools, to be free from segregation, to be free from the negative effects of segregation, or something else? Where does it find this right in the state constitution? Is the court persuasive?</p>

In a deleted portion of this opinion, the court specifically refrained from addressing whether segregated schools deprive students of an adequate education because plaintiffs had not properly raised it below.

<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">While Connecticut courts were considering <i>Sheff</i>, similar litigation was initiated in Minnesota. In fact, two different parties filed suit against the state of Minnesota. Those cases (<i>Xiong v. State</i> and <i>NAACP v. Minnesota</i>) were subsequently consolidated into a single case, No. 95-14800 (Minn. Dist. Ct. filed 1995), as both charged that concentrated poverty and racial segregation in schools interfere with the state’s delivery of a constitutionally adequate education. The plaintiffs emphasized that “68 percent of Minneapolis students were</p>
<p><a id="page_269" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>269</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">students of color and 66 percent were eligible for free or reduced price lunch, compared with a statewide population that was 14 percent minority and 26 percent FARM eligible.” <span class="smallcap">Richard D. Kahlenberg</span>, <span class="smallcap">All Together Now</span> 176 (2001). To substantiate their claim that segregation in Minneapolis schools was inhibiting their ability to obtain an adequate education, plaintiffs also cited research that indicated low-income students were twice as likely to achieve at high levels in suburban schools. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Based on the Minnesota Supreme Court’s holding in <i>Skeen v. State</i>, 505 N.W.2d 299, 313 (Minn. 1993), that education was a fundamental right and places a duty on the state legislature “to establish a general and uniform system of public schools,” M.S.A. Const. art. 13, §1, the plaintiffs alleged that the currently existing segregated education constituted a per se violation of the Minnesota Constitution’s education and equal protection clauses. NAACP Compl. at 13, 17-19; Xiong Compl. at 2, 18-20. The state moved to dismiss the case on more than one occasion, but the trial court denied its motions. After the Minnesota Supreme Court refused to hear the state’s appeal, the trial court ordered the case to proceed to trial. On the eve of trial, the state settled the case by promising to implement an interdistrict transfer program that would allow students formerly trapped in high-poverty and high-minority schools to attend school in the surrounding school districts. <span class="smallcap">Kahlenberg</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 176. Thus, the Minnesota courts never reached a definitive decision on whether segregation interferes with students’ ability to receive a constitutional education, but they did hold that education is a fundamental right, permitted plaintiffs to proceed on their segregation claim, and approved a settlement agreement that afforded students a remedy to de facto segregated education.</p>
<p class="indent">The Minneapolis litigation was followed by similar litigation in New York. In <i>Paynter v. State</i>, 797 N.E.2d 1225 (N.Y. 2003), the plaintiffs argued that the high-poverty concentration in the Rochester City School District led to widespread academic failure in contrast to the surrounding districts, and that this failure demonstrated students were receiving inadequate educational opportunities. Compl. at 2, <i>Paynter</i>, 797 N.E.2d 1225. New York’s highest court rejected this argument and found that “allegations of academic failure alone, without allegations that the State…[does not] provide minimally acceptable educational services, are insufficient to state a cause of action under the Education Article.” <i>Paynter</i>, 797 N.E.2d at 1229. The court, ironically, delivered its opinion on the same day that it upheld a school finance claim on behalf of New York City’s predominantly poor and minority students in <i>Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State</i>, 801 N.E.2d 326 (N.Y. 2003).</p>
<p class="indent">The claims in <i>Campaign for Fiscal Equity</i> were distinct from <i>Paynter</i>. The claim of inadequate education in <i>Campaign for Fiscal Equity</i> was premised on insufficient financial support from the state, which allowed the plaintiffs to meet the court’s required showing of both inadequate inputs and outputs, and the interconnection between the two. <i>Id.</i> at 332 n.3. New York’s highest court has tended to conceptualize inputs as tangible resources such as buildings, books, teachers, and services. Finance claims fall squarely within this approach, whereas exposure to concentrated poverty does not because the claim is not necessarily one of resource deprivation. Consequently, the court interpreted the claim in <i>Paynter</i> as implicating demographic patterns that are disconnected from state policy and</p>
<p><a id="page_270" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>270</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">resources. Even if the plaintiffs established inadequate education in Rochester, they did not connect the inadequacy to a resource deprivation attributable to the state.</p>
<p class="indent">After a decade of dormancy, litigants in Minneapolis are once again reviving this state-based antisegregation theory. In 2015, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the state, alleging that the racial and poverty segregation in the metropolitan area violates the state constitution’s education clause, equal protection clause, and due process clause, as well as the Minnesota Human Rights Act. <i>See</i> Derek Black, <i>Can Plaintiffs’ Educational Adequacy Challenge to the Growing Hypersegregation in Minneapolis Reinvigorate a National Movement?</i>, <span class="smallcap">Education Law Prof Blog</span>, Dec. 3, 2015, <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/12/can-plaintiffs-educational-adequacy-challenge-to-the-growing-hypersegregation-in-minneapolis-reinvig.html" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/12/can-plaintiffs-educational-adequacy-challenge-to-the-growing-hypersegregation-in-minneapolis-reinvig.html</a>. They emphasized that in the metropolitan area segregation dramatically increased in recent years, with little or no effort by the state to abate it. “[T]he public schools of the City of Minneapolis are approximately 66 percent children of color and 64 percent free or reduced lunch; and the public schools of the City of Saint Paul are 78 percent children of color and 72 percent free or reduced lunch,” whereas the adjoining surrounding school districts are “overwhelmingly white” and predominantly middle income. <i>Id</i>. Within the city school districts themselves, the state created predominantly white and middle-income schools alongside hypersegregated poor and minority schools. Plaintiffs alleged that “[t]he segregation and hyper-segregation [in these schools] have been the result of boundary decisions by the Minneapolis and Saint Paul School Districts, made with the knowledge and consent of defendants, which have had both the purpose and effect of creating and increasing segregation of the Minneapolis and Saint Paul public schools by race and socioeconomic status.” Plaintiffs alleged that the state’s charter school laws have made matters worse. At the time of the complaint,</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The Twin Cities metropolitan area now contains 131 charter schools, over 80 percent of which are segregated by race, socioeconomic status, or both. [Nearly seventy charter schools] are either more than 95 percent students of color or more than 80 percent white students. Nearly a third (42 of 131) of charters in the Twin Cities are more than 95 percent students of color. In addition, there is a growing pattern in the suburbs of predominantly white charter schools locating near more racially diverse traditional schools. In 2013, 67 percent of suburban charters (32 out of 48 schools) were predominantly white (defined as more than 80 percent white students) compared to just 44 percent of traditional schools in the suburbs. More than half of predominantly white suburban charters were located in the attendance areas of traditional schools that were significantly more racially diverse. This figure has nearly tripled in the previous five years.</p>

Are the principles of equity and adequacy embodied in the various education clauses sufficient?

Educ. &amp; L.J</span>. 435 (2010).</p>
<p class="h6a" id="ch99"><i>Economic Efficiency and Segregation</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Segregated schools may also raise issues under state constitutions that mandate an efficient education or system of schools because the cost of delivering a quality education in high-poverty schools can be inordinately high. Rather than suggesting that minority students cannot receive a quality education in high-poverty schools, many integration supporters would instead argue that delivering a quality education in high-poverty schools requires enormous resources. Moreover, the cost is far more per pupil than would otherwise be necessary in an integrated school. <i>See generally</i> Christopher E. Adams, <i>Is Economic Integration the Fourth Wave in School Finance Litigation?</i>, 56 <span class="smallcap">Emory L.J</span>. 1613, 1627-1631 (2007). First, because poor students are already at risk of academic failure and that risk is further increased by attending a high-poverty school, these schools need the best, not the worst, teachers. <span class="smallcap">Charles Clotfelter et al.</span>, <span class="smallcap">High-Poverty Schools and the Distribution of Teachers and Principals</span> 4 (2007). Yet, as discussed earlier, it costs significantly more to lure high-quality teachers to high-minority, high-poverty schools. Second, for various practical reasons, high-poverty schools cost more to keep safe than other schools. <i>See generally</i> Michelle Parthum, <i>Using Litigation to Address Violence in Urban Public Schools</i>, 88 <span class="smallcap">Wash. U. L. Rev</span>. 1021, 1031-1037 (2011). Third, the need for intensive instructional and social service programs tends to be significantly higher in high-poverty schools. Of course, socioeconomically integrated schools must also provide supplemental services for at-risk children, but they do not bear the other, sometimes exponentially, higher costs that are associated with high-poverty schools.</p>
<p class="indent">Federal legislation and studies explicitly recognize these realities. The federal government estimates that the cost of educating low-income students is approximately 40 percent more than middle-income students and that the per-pupil costs rise exponentially as both the percentage and overall number of poor students in a district increases. 20 U.S.C. §§6335(c)(1)(B), 6335(c)(2)(B),</p>
<p><a id="page_272" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>272</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">6337(d)(1)(A), 6337(d)(1)(B) (2006); Education Finance Incentive Grant Program, Pub. L. No. 107-110, §1125(A), 115 Stat. 1425, 1525 (2002) (codified at 20 U.S.C. §6337); <span class="smallcap">Nat’l Ctr. for Educ. Stats., U.S. Dep’t of Educ.</span>, <span class="smallcap">Inequalities in Public School District Revenues</span> 62 (1998). Federal funding for low-income students, however, only offsets a portion of these additional costs. In short, the cost of delivering adequate education in segregated schools where poverty is concentrated is extremely high and economically inefficient.</p>
<p class="indent">The higher cost of educating students in concentrated poverty presents both constitutional and practical problems. As is implicit in most of the foregoing cases and materials, the unfortunate truth is that districts and states rarely have the resources and/or the will to fund quality education in high-poverty school districts. The prospects can be even worse during times of economic crises. During the recession that began in 2008, schools across the board experienced huge cuts in their state funding and their local revenues. <i>See</i> Nicholas Johnson et al., <i>An Update on State Budget Cuts</i>, <span class="smallcap">Ctr. Budget &amp; Policy Priorities</span> (Feb. 9, 2011); Tamar Lewin &amp; Sam Dillon, <i>With Revenue Cut, Schools Are Warning of Huge Layoffs</i>, <span class="smallcap">N.Y. Times</span>, Apr. 21, 2010, at A12; Leslie A. Maxwell, <i>School Funding on Block Again as States’ Fiscal Pain Continues with Budget Gaps Growing, About Half Expect K-12 Cuts</i>, <span class="smallcap">Educ. Wk.</span>, Mar. 3, 2010. While some jurisdictions may have the capacity to raise taxes or absorb the losses without affecting educational quality, property-poor districts’ revenue generation tends to be maxed out even during times of prosperity. Thus, they have no excess to draw on or to cut during crisis. <i>See generally Tenn. Small Sch. Sys.</i>, 851 S.W.2d at 143, 144 (Tenn. 1993); <span class="smallcap">Comm’n on Educ. Fin., Nat’l Res. Council</span>, <span class="smallcap">Making Money Matter: Financing America’s Schools</span> 46-47? (Helen F. Ladd &amp; Janet Hansen eds., 1999). Economic hardship can inevitably force them to diminish the quality of their educational offerings below already insufficient levels. <i>See, e.g.</i>, David Harrison, <i>New Budget Cuts Threaten School Funding Settlements</i>, <span class="smallcap">Stateline</span>, Dec. 6, 2010. During the recession, class sizes steadily grew, teacher quality began to decline, and by 2015 an extreme nationwide teacher shortage hit many of the most disadvantaged states and districts, although few were entirely immune. <i>See generally</i> Motoko Rich, <i>Across Country, A Scramble Is on to Find Teachers</i>, N.Y. T<span class="smallcap">imes</span>, Aug. 10, 2015, at A1. In short, the practical reality has been a choice between two options: providing poor and minority students a quality education within an integrated environment or offering them a low-quality education elsewhere. Unfortunately, the frequent choice is a segregated education that lacks the resources necessary for quality education, yet still costs more than integrated education. The economic cost of educating students in high-poverty schools when other options are available raises constitutional concerns. Most obviously, low-quality education, regardless of its cause, is a problem in any state where students have a right to an adequate education. But in those states whose constitutions mandate an efficient education or prohibit waste, economically inefficient segregated education is arguably a direct violation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Rose v. Council for Better Educ., 790 S.W.2d 186 (Ky. 1989); Pauley v. Kelly, 255 S.E.2d 859 (W. Va. 1979); <i>see also</i> Derek W. Black, <i>Middle Income Peers as Educational Resources and the Constitutional Right to Equal Access</i>, 53 <span class="smallcap">B.C. L. Rev</span>. 373 (2012).</p>

<p class="h7" id="ch100">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Revisit your state education clause and any court opinions interpreting it. In addition, identify any state constitutional clauses relating to equal protection and equity, along with any seminal holdings of your state courts interpreting these clauses. Can you make an argument that your state constitution would prohibit segregation under some circumstances? Would it prohibit intentional racial segregation, de facto racial segregation, high-poverty schools, or high-poverty minority schools? Could you make a more compelling argument that it requires educational environments that incorporate diversity (even if they are not “integrated” in the sense that federal desegregation law previously contemplated)? Finally, even if your state does not provide a plausible argument for integrating or diversifying schools, consider whether a student attending a high-poverty and consistently low-performing school could, pursuant to your state’s laws, demand admission to a better school outside his or her neighborhood?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch101">F. THE FEDERAL ROLE IN SCHOOL FINANCE EQUITY</p>
<p class="noindent">The largely undiscussed factor in school finance thus far is federal policy. Starting primarily with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), the federal government began investing in public schools and has gradually increased its investment over the years. On average, federal funds account for less than 10 percent of school budgets. But in schools with high percentages of low-income, special education, or ELL students, that percentage is significantly higher. Moreover, the funds are large enough on a statewide basis that the federal government is able to push various policy agendas. A discussion of those policy agendas is largely reserved for <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/24_ELEFR_Chapter_12.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapters 12</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/25_ELEFR_Chapter_13.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a>, which address federal reforms such as the Every Student Succeeds Act, No Child Left Behind Act, Race to the Top, teacher assessments, and charter schools. Relevant to this chapter is the extent to which federal policy reduces funding inequities and inadequacies.</p>
<p class="indent">For the past decade, Congress has spent roughly $15 billion a year on primary and secondary schools through the ESEA. Congress has occasionally made other investments in public schools, but those have tended to be temporary. For instance, during the recession that began in 2008, Congress allotted an additional $87 billion for public schools, most of which was designed to replace the diminishing local revenues available to schools and avoid massive teacher layoffs. Joseph P. Viteritti, <i>The Federal Role in School Reform: Obama’s “Race to the Top,”</i> 87 <span class="smallcap">Notre Dame L. Rev</span>. 2087 (2012). Those funds, however, did not flow through the ESEA, but rather were distributed per their own one-time rules. Regardless, ESEA remains the primary and most consistent funding and regulation mechanism at the federal level.</p>
<p><a id="page_274" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>274</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The primary purpose of ESEA funding is to supplement the local money available to meet the special needs of poor and disadvantaged children. Accepting the money also obligates schools to comply with various nondiscrimination and equality statutes. ESEA includes various different titles, but the most relevant to poor children is Title I.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress initially enacted the ESEA in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty and to create financial incentives for schools to desegregate. Its focus was on schools serving poor children living in areas of concentrated poverty. <span class="smallcap">Office of Educ., U.S. Dep’t of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare</span>, <span class="smallcap">History of Title I ESEA</span> 17 (1969). By accepting federal funds, the schools became subject to various conditions embodied in federal statutes. Most important among these conditions was compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination in federally funded programs and directed federal agencies to implement regulations to enforce Title VI.</p>
<p class="indent">As discussed in the previous chapter, federal funds in combination with Title VI were instrumental in increasing desegregation. Within just a few years, however, Congress suspected that schools were spending the funds irresponsibly. Some wasted the money on frivolous things while others simply used federal dollars to replace state dollars. Phyllis McClure, Ctr. for Am. Progress, <i>The History of Educational Comparability in Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965</i>, in <span class="smallcap">Ensuring Equal Opportunity in Public Education: How Local School District Funding Practices Hurt Disadvantaged Students and What Federal Policy Can Do About It</span> 9, 13 (2008). Either way, Congress’s goal of providing extra resources for low-income students was undermined. In response, Congress imposed additional conditions and restrictions on the receipt of Title I funds.</p>
<p class="indent">First, Congress conditioned the receipt of Title I funds on the concept of comparability, requiring that the state and local funding at Title I schools be comparable to that at non–Title I schools. 84 Stat. 121, 124 (1970). Thus, spending $2,000 per pupil in state and local funds at a non–Title I school while spending only $1,500 per student at a Title I school would be a violation, even if the federal funds were sufficient to bring the Title I school up to $2,000. Congress’s second related condition was that school districts use federal funds to supplement those funds that they were already spending, rather than using federal dollars to replace or supplant existing funds. <i>Id.</i> This condition also operates across time and attempts to prevent schools from reducing local spending gradually over the course of several years.</p>
<p class="indent">The effectiveness of these conditions on federal funds, unfortunately, has diminished significantly over time. Because education budgets have become larger and more complex, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the supplement, not supplant, standard has become almost impossible to enforce and should be eliminated. <span class="smallcap">GAO, Disadvantaged Students: Fiscal Oversight of Title I Could Be Improved</span> 24-26 (2003). The Department of Education implicitly concedes as much by making little effort to enforce it.</p>
<p class="indent">The best way to address the problem would be through the maintenance-of-effort standard, <i>id.</i> at 24-25, but Congress gradually loosened the requirements of this measure, making it relatively pointless. For the past few decades, the maintenance-of-effort standard has only required that school districts</p>
<p><a id="page_275" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>275</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">maintain their funding at 90 percent of the previous year. Every Student Succeeds Act, Public Law 114-95, December 10, 2015, 129 Stat. 1802 §§1017, 8019; 20 U.S.C. §§6321(a), 7901 (2006). This standard was previously 95 percent. 45 C.F.R. §116.19 (1977). Under the current standard, most districts can easily swap their own funds for federal funds without violating the maintenance-of-effort requirement. A study by Ross Wiener suggests this may be occurring all too often. He found that in Texas and Colorado schools, “federal and other categorical funds, which were intended to provide additional opportunities, are used to fill in for inequitable distribution of [state and local] foundational funds.” <i>Strengthening Comparability: Advancing Equity in Public Education</i>, in <span class="smallcap">Ensuring Equal Opportunity</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 40.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress and the Department of Education likewise have increased flexibility in the comparability standards to the point that they provide little check on inequity. Initially, the ESEA and its implementing regulations required that the expenditures at Title I schools be within 5 percent of the expenditures of other schools within a district. 45 C.F.R. §116.26 (1972); 45 C.F.R. §116a.26 (1977). That number was later changed to 10 percent and eventually abandoned altogether. 45 C.F.R. §116 (1978). Under the No Child Left Behind Act, Title I schools needed only to be “substantially comparable” to other schools in the district, which is based on school services “as a whole.” 20 U.S.C. §6321(c)(1)(b) (2006). That language was so vague and forgiving that it did not require any meaningful equity between schools. In fact, the statute specifically indicated that “[n]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to mandate equalized spending per pupil for a state, local educational agency, or school.” <i>Id.</i> §6576. To make matters worse, teacher salaries were exempted from any comparability analysis, even though they regularly comprise 80 to 90 percent of school budgets. <i>Id.</i> §6321(c)(2)(B). This was not the case with earlier versions of ESEA and its regulations. Rather than fix these problems, the 2015 reauthorization of ESEA eliminated the substantial comparability provision from the relevant section of the Act altogether. Every Student Succeeds Act, Public Law 114-95, December 10, 2015, 129 Stat. 1802 §1012.</p>
<p class="indent">The point of Title I funds, of course, is to offset the disadvantages that poorer districts suffer. During the 1960s and 1970s, Congress directed Title I funds to only the most racially isolated and poverty-stricken districts. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">History of Title I ESEA</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 17. As a result, they had the maximum impact. Today, however, more than 90 percent of school districts and 58 percent of schools receive Title I funds. C. Joy Farmer, <i>The No Child Left Behind Act: Will It Produce a New Breed of School Financing Litigation?</i>, 38 <span class="smallcap">Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs</span>. 443, 456 (2005). The problem is that the threshold for eligibility is a mere 2 percent of students below the poverty level in the school district. 34 C.F.R. §200.71 (2008). As a result, Title I funds go to a wide cross-section of schools, relatively few of which are predominantly poor schools. The effect is twofold: to limit the impact of the funds in those schools that receive them and to divert needed funds away from the poorest schools to others. In fairness, federal funding routinely makes up more than 10 percent of the budget of the neediest school districts, but the amount still falls far short of a 40 percent supplement that the federal government estimates is optimal. Moreover, the poorest schools often must stretch</p>
<p><a id="page_276" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>276</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">their Title I dollars further than wealthier schools. As Goodwin Liu notes, the average Title I aid per student in schools that have low levels of poor students is $773, while that number is only $475 in schools with the highest levels of poor students. Goodwin Liu, <i>Improving Title I Funding Equity Across States, Districts and Schools</i>, 93 <span class="smallcap">Iowa L. Rev</span>. 973, 1010 (2008). Thus, Title I funds are sometimes lower in the schools that need them the most.</p>
<p class="indent">These counterintuitive results stem from the fact that Congress distributes Title I funds through no less than four different funding formulas and grants, some of which work against one another or have problematic built-in biases. One problem is that the formulas include a statutory minimum that provides a base level of funding to all states, regardless of their need, poverty, or locality costs. <i>See, e.g.</i>, 20 U.S.C. §§6333(d), 6334(b). This results in states with small populations, like South Dakota and Rhode Island, receiving a disproportionately large amount of money that bears no relation to the number of poor students they serve. <span class="smallcap">Educ. Trust</span>, <span class="smallcap">Funding Gaps 2006</span>, at 3 tbl. 1, 4 tbl. 2 (2006). In fact, because they have so few poor students, their Title I funding per student exceeds the amount that two-thirds of the other states receive. <i>Id.</i> Likewise, Wyoming and Vermont receive the highest per-pupil allotments of Title I funds in the country at nearly $3,000 per pupil, but have the fewest number of poor children in the country. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">In addition, Title I places significant weight on district size. 20 U.S.C. §6335(c)(2)(C). Title I per-pupil allotments increase as the size of the school district increases. The assumption is that school district size corresponds with differing population density and geographic location costs. While this is the case in some instances, data shows that school district size does not closely correspond with population density or with city versus rural school districts. Liu, <i>supra</i>, at 1003. Instead, school district size is generally random. For instance, small districts are just as likely to be found in rural Alabama as they are in the New York City metropolitan area. Derek W. Black, <i>How the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Undermines Equal Protection and Congress’s Duty to Remedy It</i>, 90 <span class="smallcap">B.U. L. Rev</span>. 313, 347 (2010).</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, Title I’s funding formulas may exacerbate funding inequalities between states by basing Title I funding on the amount the state already spends on education. 20 U.S.C. §§6333(a)(1)(B), 6334(a)(2)(B), 6335(b)(1)(B), 6337(b)(1)(A)(i). Two premises motivate this practice: that the state expenditures reflect the varying cost of education among states and that basing Title I funds on state expenditures will create an incentive for states to increase their own expenditures. Unfortunately, neither has proven accurate. Data shows that the variances in state contributions do not closely correlate with varying geographic costs. Rather, in many instances, state funds vary based on the local commitment to education. <span class="smallcap">Educ. Trust</span>, <i>supra</i>. Theoretically, basing federal funds on local effort and commitment creates an incentive for states, but as Liu points out, a state like Mississippi would need to increase its local funding by $54 million to get a mere $3 million increase from Title I. Liu, <i>supra</i>, at 985. In short, for every extra dollar that Mississippi might spend on education, it would receive less than six cents from Title I. Thus, it offers no real incentive. Commentators conclude that basing Title I grants on the amount that states spend has</p>
<p><a id="page_277" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>277</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the perverse effect of penalizing poor states and rewarding wealthy ones. Black, <i>supra</i>; Liu, <i>supra</i>. For this and other reasons, the GAO has also recommended eliminating state expenditures as a weighting factor in Title I funding formulas. <span class="smallcap">GAO, Title I Funding: Poor Children Benefit Though Funding Per Poor Child Differs</span> 33 (2002).</p>
<p class="indent">While the 2015 reauthorization of the ESEA did not eliminate any of these structural inequities, Congress did, for the first time in decades, implicitly acknowledge that serious problems exist. Congress offered no mandated solutions, but created programs designed to potentially stimulate future change. First, the 2015 reauthorization required that states assess and address resource inequity in those schools that fall in the bottom 5 percent of the states’ academic performance standards. States could then use some of their ESEA set-aside funds to redress those resource inequities. Every Student Succeeds Act, Public Law 114-95, December 10, 2015, 129 Stat. 1802 §1005 (d)(2)(C). Second, Congress included funding for a pilot program to support districts that want to adopt weighted student funding formulas. <i>Id</i>. at §1501. Third, while Congress left Title I’s irrational funding formulas in place, it funded a professional evidence-based study of the formulas to determine who they advantage and disadvantage, and to propose changes to the formula if necessary. <i>Id</i>. at §9211.</p>
<p class="indent">The details of each of these provisions reveal that they are very narrow in scope and rely on voluntary acquiescence by states and local districts. In this respect, they offer no guarantee or expectation of substantive change. On the other hand, each of these provisions was a huge ideological step for Congress, which had completely ignored these problems for decades. These specific programs are consistent with the notion that Congress is slowly appreciating the nuances of school funding and the unfairness of a happenstance approach to those nuances.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The federal role and mission in education has changed over time. A later chapter on federal policy will discuss a shift in focus to achievement test scores and achievement gaps and away from funding and equity. Is this simply a change in the way we now perceive the issue of equity, skepticism toward the relevance of money, or a political unwillingness to challenge a pattern of funding inequity?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What federal standards might be effective in addressing educational inequities? Do you see any practical or political barriers to instituting more effective standards?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If Title I formulas are irrational, as this section suggests, why does Congress structure them this way?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Some argue that Title I actually makes funding inequities worse, particularly by basing Title I funds largely on the level of funds a state already spends. Is this a fair criticism, or does Title I simply fail to help as much as it could?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Title I does have a weighting for concentrated poverty that, for instance, provides more money per pupil to a district with 28 percent poverty than it does</p>
<p><a id="page_278" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>278</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to a district with 14 percent poverty. This additional weighting, however, flattens at a relatively low level, so that a district with 75 percent poverty would receive the same funding per pupil as a district with 30 percent poverty. Scholars have criticized this as failing to fully account for the impacts of concentrated poverty. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Black, <i>supra</i>, at 344-346.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch102">G. THE FUTURE OF EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch103">1. <i>Opportunity to Learn Measures</i></p>
<p class="noindent">In an effort to reframe the debate regarding school funding and education reform, some civil rights and education reform groups have begun to argue for opportunity to learn standards. Their premise is that certain educational resources are key to positive education outcomes. Students denied these resources are denied opportunities to learn or, at least, see their opportunities diminished. They assert that students must be guaranteed an opportunity to learn, which includes “(i) high-quality, early childhood education; (ii) highly effective teachers; (iii) a broad, college-bound curriculum that will prepare all students to participate effectively in our democracy; and (iv) equitable instructional resources.” Lawyers’ Comm. for Civ. Rts. under Law, NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Nat’l Council for Educating Black Children, Nat’l Urb. League, Rainbow PUSH Coal., &amp; Schott Found. for Pub. Educ., <i>Framework for Providing All Students an Opportunity to Learn through Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i> (July 2010). Focusing on these measures, a recent report by the Schott Foundation found that poor, minority, and other disadvantaged students have just 51 percent of the opportunity to learn as white students do. The report argues that we cannot begin a serious or realistic discussion of other attempts to improve school quality and the achievement gap until we first secure equal opportunities to learn for all students. <span class="smallcap">Schott Found. for Pub. Educ.</span>, <span class="smallcap">Lost Opportunity: A 50 State Report on the Opportunity to Learn in America</span> (2009).</p>
<p class="indent">Casting educational rights in terms of these specific opportunities to learn has both benefits and limitations. First, legislation focused on the opportunity to learn would treat education as an affirmative right rather than a negative one. Students would not need to demonstrate that the deprivation of these rights caused a change in their achievement or was discriminatory. It would be enough that a student was deprived of an opportunity. On the other hand, framing education in these terms would place a huge onus on policymakers and advocates to ensure they have identified the important aspects of an opportunity to learn, as other inequities will likely be ignored. If equitable instructional resources, for instance, do not significantly impact student outcomes, then including them in the key components of an opportunity to learn would only distract efforts away from more important opportunities. Likewise, the failure to include an opportunity, such as quality facilities or modern technologies, might undermine efforts in that area. Finally, overly broad articulations of the key</p>
<p><a id="page_279" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>279</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">opportunities to learn would render the right unenforceable and irrelevant, while definite standards run the risk of being both under- or overinclusive.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1994 reauthorization of the ESEA actually included opportunity to learn standards. The problem was that those standards were both voluntary and vague. States were free to reject the nationally proposed standards and adopt their own, and no meaningful constraints were placed on states in creating their own standards. The legislation vaguely provided that the standards were “the criteria for, and the basis of, assessing the sufficiency or quality of the resources, practices, and conditions necessary at each level of the education system…to provide all students with the opportunity to learn the material in voluntary national content standards or State content standards.” Nonetheless, these standards were still seen by many as intruding on the province of state and local educators. Consequently, they were removed from the Act just months later when the majority in Congress shifted from Democrats to Republicans. Michael Rebell, <i>Poverty, “Meaningful” Educational Opportunity, and the Necessary Role of the Courts</i>, 85 <span class="smallcap">N.C. L. Rev</span>. 1467, 1517 (2006).</p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTION</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Does framing the conversation as “opportunity to learn” have any advantage, or is it just another way of making decades-old arguments? Does it still involve the same troubling social science issues we have seen elsewhere?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch104">2. <i>Constitutional and Statutory Amendments</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Others have called for a federal constitutional amendment. One proposed amendment simply provides: “All persons shall enjoy the right to a public education of equal high quality” and “Congress shall have power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.” H.J.R. 29 (introduced Mar. 3, 2009, by Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr.). The Southern Education Foundation more recently released a detailed argument and strategy for adopting a constitutional amendment to protect education. <span class="smallcap">No Time to Lose: Why America Needs an Education Amendment to the US Constitution to Improve Public Education</span> (2009). The report indicates that</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[a]n effort to amend the US Constitution in relation to education would: 1) underscore the importance of the public schools to the preservation of democratic values and national security; 2) draw attention to the question of whether the current system of resource allocation for public schools is sufficient to meet the needs of the 21st century; 3) remind Americans that the quality of education now depends extensively on venue—where a child lives—and that inequality is built into the current system; 4) lead to consideration of whether the federal government should be obliged to help schools that serve students in low resource states or districts gain access to more funding and resources; and 5) create ‘space’ for intermediate measures to reduce inequality by legislation or the reform of practice.</p>

<p><a id="page_280" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>280</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The report further noted that even a failed effort at a constitutional amendment might yield significant benefits:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">One of the lessons of the unsuccessful effort to enact the Equal Rights Amendment is that it mobilized public awareness of the reality of gender-based discrimination, encouraged creative and voluntary responses to it, created a focal point for the development of public policy related to diverse manifestations of gender-based discrimination, and mobilized key constituencies to use political processes to secure redress of grievances. There is general consensus today that though the ERA was unsuccessful, many of the aims to which the amendment was devoted have been achieved, at least to a degree.</p>

<i>Id.</i> at 33.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, there have been constitutional movements at the state level. Most notable, the citizens of Florida amended their educational constitutional clause via referendum in 1998 after the Florida Supreme Court rejected a school finance claim. Coal. for Adequacy &amp; Fairness in Sch. Funding, Inc. v. Chiles, 680 So. 2d 400, 407-408 (Fla. 1996). The new constitutional amendment includes some of the strongest language of any state: “The education of children is a fundamental value of the people of the State of Florida. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the state to make adequate provision for the education of all children residing within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools that allows students to obtain a high quality education.…” <span class="smallcap">Fla. Const</span>. art. IX, §1.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is a federal constitutional amendment necessary to improve education? Does Congress already have all the authority it needs to remedy educational inadequacy and inequality? Are there any benefits to maintaining a local system that would be lost with a federal system? <i>See</i> Michael Heise, <i>The Political Economy of Education Federalism</i>, 56 <span class="smallcap">Emory L.J.</span> 125 (2006).</p>
<p class="indent">2. What are the chances of success for a constitutional amendment? Public polling, including during the 2008 presidential elections, consistently shows that a strong majority of voters rate education as a very important issue and expect government to address failings in public education. <span class="smallcap">No Time to Lose,</span> <i>supra</i>, at 31, 32.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Rather than focus on a constitutional amendment, some have proposed federal statutory solutions. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">Congressman Chaka Fattah, Student Bill of Rights</span>, <i>available at</i> http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=51&amp;section tree=4,51; H.R. 2373, 110th Congress (2007-2008) (defining fundamental educational opportunity, requiring states to deliver it, and providing students a federal cause of action for violations); Fiscal Fairness Act, H.R. 1294, 112th Congress (2011) (proposing that federal education funds be conditioned on states ensuring equitable finance distribution schemes).</p>
<p class="indent">4. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education established a commission to study educational inequality. That commission issued its final report in 2013. It</p>
<p><a id="page_281" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>281</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">made five broad recommendations: (1) restructuring finance systems to focus on equitable resources and their cost-effective use; (2) ensuring all students have access to high-quality teachers, school leaders, and instructional opportunities; (3) providing high-quality early learning for all children, but especially for low-income children; (4) increasing supports outside the classroom through parental engagement, “access to health and social services, and extended instructional time and assistance for at-risk groups”; and (5) making improvements in educational accountability and governance. <span class="smallcap">The Equity and Excellence Commission, For Each and Every Child: A Strategy for Equity and Excellence</span> 16 (2013).</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch105">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Assume members from a well-organized community group in your state walk into your office. The state went through extensive school finance litigation a few years ago. The state supreme court’s first opinion held that students have a right to an adequate education and that the state’s financing system is failing to provide several districts with the resources necessary to deliver it. After protracted litigation in the lower courts and two trips back to the state supreme court, the state reformed its school finance formulas to drive significant additional resources to needy districts. While they have received additional funds, four years into this new formula, urban school districts have yet to see the improvement they had expected. The parents in the community group believe their schools are still beset with large numbers of inexperienced or low-quality teachers, subject to ever-changing teaching strategies, and lack the financial and nonfinancial resources necessary for their children to receive a quality education. What strategy would you propose: new school finance litigation, a different state constitutional theory, legislative change at the state level, federal litigation, federal legislation, a federal constitutional amendment, or something else?</p>
