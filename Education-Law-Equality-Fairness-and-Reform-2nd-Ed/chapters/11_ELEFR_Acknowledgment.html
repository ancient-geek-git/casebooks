<p class="noindent">I am grateful to the many people who made this book possible. First, I am grateful to the people who encouraged and inspired me to write it. When the notion of an education law casebook was a distant idea, Mark Dann, Cynthia Mabry, and Warner Lawson told me I could do it. Before I knew what education law was, Professor Jack Boger introduced me to it and brought it alive. He then set me on the road to a rewarding career as an education law attorney and professor.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, numerous people at Aspen Publishers helped me get started and finished. Richard Mixter helped me see the short-term and long-term vision of a casebook. Carolyn Czick assured me that I was not wasting my time and others out there would use the book. John Devins walked me through external reviews and how to respond. John, along with an excellent production team, Troy Froebe and Tony Levenstein, carried the first edition of this book carefully to the finish line. Cindy Uh and Patrick Cline did the same with the second edition.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, I am grateful to the law schools that supported me along the way. I began this project while at Howard University, dove into it during a visit at the University of North Carolina, returned to Howard to complete the first two-thirds of the book, and finished it at the University of South Carolina. The deans at each school, Kurt Schmoke, Jack Boger, and Rob Wilcox, supported me with research assistants, summer stipends, and various sorts of administrative support. From contract to print, the first edition of the casebook took two and a half years. Without the support of my deans, I can only imagine how long it would have taken.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, friends and colleagues provided excellent comments and suggestions. Some even "play-tested" the book prior to publication. Kimberly Robinson, Sylvia Lazos, Phillip Peters, and Rob Garda each were gracious enough to try out drafts on their students and provide invaluable feedback. Various reviewers, who remain anonymous to me, also provided important comments that led to changes in the book. I sincerely appreciate them. Eloise Pasachoff was particularly helpful with the second edition, suggesting several important improvements for the chapter on race.</p>
<p class="indent">Fifth, I had a wonderful group of students and staff members who played important roles in this book. The possibility for mistakes in a casebook are countless and I know many surely survive in this edition, but I am confident</p>
<p><a id="page_xxxii" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>xxxii</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that none are attributable to Donna Tillis, my research assistant. Her attention to detail never ceased to amaze. With both editions of this book, I turned over all my electronic documents to Vanessa Byars. She guarded them as though they were her own and did an amazing job of proofreading, formatting, and providing overall quality control. She could run her own production house. Carol Young and Inge Lewis also joined the project, adding another level of quality control and helping complete substantial portions of the indexes and tables. Eric Post provided immense help at the beginning of the project. The chapter on gender would not have been possible without his initial work to pull together and cull cases and excerpts, pose questions, and do in-depth research on discrete topics. The depth of the final chapter is a product of his front-end work.</p>
<p class="indent">Sixth, Rob Garda, John Taylor, and Emily Gold Waldman put a tremendous amount of thought and work into their chapters. I started the book without them, but as drafting the chapters on special education, speech, and religion drew near, I recognized that I no longer had the energy and probably never had the expertise to write those incredibly complex chapters. They made it seem easy and produced products that I am proud to include in the book. I cannot imagine what this book would have been without them.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I want to thank my family: my wife, Claire Raj, and my son, Rohan. This book was more their sacrifice than mine, but they never wavered in their support.</p>
