<p class="h3" id="ch208">A. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch209">1. <i>Notice and the Opportunity to Respond</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The procedures that schools follow when disciplining, suspending, and expelling students vary among states and school districts. This variance is largely due to the Supreme Court’s holding in <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>. In <i>Goss</i>, the Court established the foundational constitutional parameters for the imposition of school discipline. But recognizing the breadth of its application, the Court chose to set a relatively minimal constitutional standard. In most instances, a school district need only provide a student with oral notice of the charges against him and a brief chance to respond. Districts are free to offer more elaborate processes—and many do—but the Constitution does not require it unless the district intends to impose a more serious long-term suspension. Even there, the process for suspending or expelling a student for a long period of time need not mirror the types of formal processes found in legal or administrative proceedings outside of schools.</p>
<p class="indent">While minimal due process requirements seem routine today and set relatively few limits on schools’ disciplinary power, prior to <i>Goss</i>, schools essentially operated their own fiefdoms in which they could discipline students however they saw fit. As noted in <i>Goss</i>, the state of Ohio had authorized principals to suspend students for up to ten days without offering them any process. Thus, even the most rudimentary process would have been a new imposition on some school districts. As you read <i>Goss</i>, consider whether the Court goes too far or not far enough in protecting students’ rights. Also, consider whether the Court’s wide deference to school administrators is appropriate. Avoid casting school districts as students’ enemies, but also remember that school administrators are no more perfect than other governmental decision makers, and a primary purpose of process is to reduce mistakes.</p>

<p class="h5" id="ch210">Goss v. Lopez</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>419 U.S. 565 (1975)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Mr. Justice White</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">[The issue in this case is whether the Columbus, Ohio, Public School System’s (CPSS) temporary suspension of students “without a hearing either prior to suspension or within a reasonable time thereafter” violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.]</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Ohio law provides for free education to all children between the ages of six and 21. Section 3313.66 of the Code empowers the principal of an Ohio public school to suspend a pupil for misconduct for up to 10 days or to expel him. In either case, he must notify the student’s parents within 24 hours and state the reasons for his action. A pupil who is expelled may appeal the decision to the Board of Education and in connection therewith shall be permitted to be heard at the board meeting. The Board may reinstate the pupil following the hearing. No similar procedure is provided for a suspended student. Aside from a regulation tracking the statute, at the time of the imposition of the suspensions in this case the CPSS itself had not issued any written procedure applicable to suspensions. Nor, so far as the record reflects, had any of the individual high schools involved in this case. Each, however, had formally or informally described the conduct for which suspension could be imposed.</p>
<p class="indent">The nine named appellees, each of whom alleged that he or she had been suspended from public high school in Columbus for up to 10 days without a hearing, filed an action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Columbus Board of Education and various administrators of the CPSS. The complaint sought a declaration that §3313.66 was unconstitutional in that it permitted public school administrators to deprive plaintiffs of their rights to an education without a hearing of any kind, in violation of the procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment. It also sought to enjoin the public school officials from issuing future suspensions pursuant to §3313.66 and to require them to remove references to the past suspensions from the records of the students in question.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">At the outset, appellants contend that because there is no constitutional right to an education at public expense, the Due Process Clause does not protect against expulsions from the public school system. This position misconceives the nature of the issue and is refuted by prior decisions. The Fourteenth Amendment forbids the State to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Protected interests in property are normally “not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined” by an independent source such as state statutes or rules entitling the citizen to certain benefits.</p>
<p><a id="page_549" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>549</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, a state employee who under state law, or rules promulgated by state officials, has a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment absent sufficient cause for discharge may demand the procedural protections of due process. So may welfare recipients who have statutory rights to welfare as long as they maintain the specified qualifications. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).</p>
<p class="indent">Here, on the basis of state law, appellees plainly had legitimate claims of entitlement to a public education. [Ohio statutes] direct local authorities to provide a free education to all residents between five and 21 years of age, and a compulsory-attendance law requires attendance for a school year of not less than 32 weeks. It is true that §3313.66 of the Code permits school principals to suspend students for up to 10 days; but suspensions may not be imposed without any grounds whatsoever. All of the schools had their own rules specifying the grounds for expulsion or suspension. Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of appellees’ class generally, Ohio may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct absent, fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Ohio may not be constitutionally obligated to establish and maintain a public school system, it has nevertheless done so and has required its children to attend. Those young people do not “shed their constitutional rights” at the schoolhouse door. Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). “The Fourteenth Amendment, as now applied to the States, protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures—Boards of Education not excepted.” West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637 (1943). The authority possessed by the State to prescribe and enforce standards of conduct in its schools, although concededly very broad, must be exercised consistently with constitutional safeguards. Among other things, the State is constrained to recognize a student’s legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause and which may not be taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by that Clause.</p>
<p class="indent">The Due Process Clause also forbids arbitrary deprivations of liberty. “Where a person’s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him,” the minimal requirements of the Clause must be satisfied. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437 (1971); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. at 573. School authorities here suspended appellees from school for periods of up to 10 days based on charges of misconduct. If sustained and recorded, those charges could seriously damage the students’ standing with their fellow pupils and their teachers as well as interfere with later opportunities for higher education and employment. It is apparent that the claimed right of the State to determine unilaterally and without process whether that misconduct has occurred immediately collides with the requirements of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants proceed to argue that even if there is a right to a public education protected by the Due Process Clause generally, the Clause comes into play only when the State subjects a student to a “severe detriment or grievous loss.” The loss of 10 days, it is said, is neither severe nor grievous and the Due Process</p>
<p><a id="page_550" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>550</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Clause is therefore of no relevance. Appellants’ argument is again refuted by our prior decisions; for in determining “whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the ‘weight’ but to the <i>nature</i> of the interest at stake.” Appellees were excluded from school only temporarily, it is true, but the length and consequent severity of a deprivation, while another factor to weigh in determining the appropriate form of hearing, “is not decisive of the basic right” to a hearing of some kind. The Court’s view has been that as long as a property deprivation is not de minimis, its gravity is irrelevant to the question whether account must be taken of the Due Process Clause. A 10-day suspension from school is not de minimis in our view and may not be imposed in complete disregard of the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p class="indent">A short suspension is, of course, a far milder deprivation than expulsion. But, “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” and the total exclusion from the educational process for more than a trivial period, and certainly if the suspension is for 10 days, is a serious event in the life of the suspended child. Neither the property interest in educational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation, which is also implicated, is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by any procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">“Once it is determined that due process applies, the question remains what process is due.” We turn to that question, fully realizing as our cases regularly do that the interpretation and application of the Due Process Clause are intensely practical matters and that “[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.” We are also mindful of our own admonition: “Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint .…By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities.” Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968).</p>
<p class="indent">There are certain bench marks to guide us, however. Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950), said that “[m]any controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.” “The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard,” a right that “has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to…contest.” At the very minimum, therefore, students facing suspension and the consequent interference with a protected property interest must be given some kind of notice and afforded some kind of hearing. “Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.”</p>
<p class="indent">It also appears from our cases that the timing and content of the notice and the nature of the hearing will depend on appropriate accommodation of the</p>
<p><a id="page_551" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>551</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">competing interests involved. The student’s interest is to avoid unfair or mistaken exclusion from the educational process, with all of its unfortunate consequences. The Due Process Clause will not shield him from suspensions properly imposed, but it disserves both his interest and the interest of the State if his suspension is in fact unwarranted. The concern would be mostly academic if the disciplinary process were a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and never unfair. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and no one suggests that it is. Disciplinarians, although proceeding in utmost good faith, frequently act on the reports and advice of others; and the controlling facts and the nature of the conduct under challenge are often disputed. The risk of error is not at all trivial, and it should be guarded against if that may be done without prohibitive cost or interference with the educational process.</p>
<p class="indent">The difficulty is that our schools are vast and complex. Some modicum of discipline and order is essential if the educational function is to be performed. Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action. Suspension is considered not only to be a necessary tool to maintain order but a valuable educational device. The prospect of imposing elaborate hearing requirements in every suspension case is viewed with great concern, and many school authorities may well prefer the untrammeled power to act unilaterally, unhampered by rules about notice and hearing. But it would be a strange disciplinary system in an educational institution if no communication was sought by the disciplinarian with the student in an effort to inform him of his dereliction and to let him tell his side of the story in order to make sure that an injustice is not done. “[F]airness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights….” “Secrecy is not congenial to truth-seeking and self-righteousness gives too slender an assurance of rightness. No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.”</p>
<p class="indent">We do not believe that school authorities must be totally free from notice and hearing requirements if their schools are to operate with acceptable efficiency. Students facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for protection of the Due Process Clause, and due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.</p>
<p class="indent">There need be no delay between the time “notice” is given and the time of the hearing. In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred. We hold only that, in being given an opportunity to explain his version of the facts at this discussion, the student first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is. Lower courts which have addressed the question of the nature of the procedures required in short suspension cases have reached the same conclusion. Since the hearing may occur almost immediately following the misconduct, it follows that as a general rule notice</p>
<p><a id="page_552" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>552</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and hearing should precede removal of the student from school. We agree with the District Court, however, that there are recurring situations in which prior notice and hearing cannot be insisted upon. Students whose presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process may be immediately removed from school. In such cases, the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="indent">In holding as we do, we do not believe that we have imposed procedures on school disciplinarians which are inappropriate in a classroom setting. Instead we have imposed requirements which are, if anything, less than a fair-minded school principal would impose upon himself in order to avoid unfair suspensions. Indeed, according to the testimony of the principal of Marion-Franklin High School, that school had an informal procedure, remarkably similar to that which we now require, applicable to suspensions generally but which was not followed in this case. Similarly, according to the most recent memorandum applicable to the entire CPSS, school principals in the CPSS are now required by local rule to provide at least as much as the constitutional minimum which we have described.</p>
<p class="indent">We stop short of construing the Due Process Clause to require, countrywide, that hearings in connection with short suspensions must afford the student the opportunity to secure counsel, to confront and cross-examine witnesses supporting the charge, or to call his own witnesses to verify his version of the incident. Brief disciplinary suspensions are almost countless. To impose in each such case even truncated trial-type procedures might well overwhelm administrative facilities in many places and, by diverting resources, cost more than it would save in educational effectiveness. Moreover, further formalizing the suspension process and escalating its formality and adversary nature may not only make it too costly as a regular disciplinary tool but also destroy its effectiveness as part of the teaching process.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, requiring effective notice and informal hearing permitting the student to give his version of the events will provide a meaningful hedge against erroneous action. At least the disciplinarian will be alerted to the existence of disputes about facts and arguments about cause and effect. He may then determine himself to summon the accuser, permit cross-examination, and allow the student to present his own witnesses. In more difficult cases, he may permit counsel. In any event, his discretion will be more informed and we think the risk of error substantially reduced.</p>
<p class="indent">Requiring that there be at least an informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian, preferably prior to the suspension, will add little to the factfinding function where the disciplinarian himself has witnessed the conduct forming the basis for the charge. But things are not always as they seem to be, and the student will at least have the opportunity to characterize his conduct and put it in what he deems the proper context.</p>
<p class="indent">We should also make it clear that we have addressed ourselves solely to the short suspension, not exceeding 10 days. Longer suspensions or expulsions for the remainder of the school term, or permanently, may require more formal procedures. Nor do we put aside the possibility that in unusual situations,</p>
<p><a id="page_553" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>553</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">although involving only a short suspension, something more than the rudimentary procedures will be required.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Ohio statute that creates the right to a “free” education also explicitly authorizes a principal to suspend a student for as much as 10 days. Thus the very legislation which “defines” the “dimension” of the student’s entitlement, while providing a right to education generally, does not establish this right free of discipline imposed in accord with Ohio law. Rather, the right is encompassed in the entire package of statutory provisions governing education in Ohio—of which the power to suspend is one.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court thus disregards the basic structure of Ohio law in posturing this case as if Ohio had conferred an unqualified right to education, thereby compelling the school authorities to conform to due process procedures in imposing the most routine discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">But however one may define the entitlement to education provided by Ohio law, a deprivation of not more than 10 days’ suspension from school, imposed as a routine disciplinary measure, does not assume constitutional dimensions. Contrary to the Court’s assertion, our cases support rather than “refute” appellants’ argument that “the Due Process Clause…comes into play only when the State subjects a student to a ‘severe detriment or grievous loss.’” Recently, the Court reiterated precisely this standard for analyzing due process claims: “Whether any procedural protections are due depends on the extent to which an individual will be ‘condemned to suffer grievous loss.’”</p>
<p class="indent">The Ohio suspension statute allows no serious or significant infringement of education. It authorizes only a maximum suspension of eight school days, less than 5% of the normal 180-day school year. Absences of such limited duration will rarely affect a pupil’s opportunity to learn or his scholastic performance. Indeed, the record in this case reflects no educational injury to appellees. Each completed the semester in which the suspension occurred and performed at least as well as he or she had in previous years. Despite the Court’s unsupported speculation that a suspended student could be “seriously damage[d],” there is no factual showing of any such damage to appellees.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court also relies on a perceived deprivation of “liberty” resulting from any suspension, arguing—again without factual support in the record pertaining to these appellees—that a suspension harms a student’s reputation. In view of the Court’s decision in <i>Board of Regents v. Roth</i>, I would have thought that this argument was plainly untenable. Underscoring the need for “serious damage” to reputation, the <i>Roth</i> Court held that a nontenured teacher who is not rehired by a public university could not claim to suffer sufficient reputational injury to require constitutional protections. Surely a brief suspension is of less serious consequence to the reputation of a teenage student.</p>
<p><a id="page_554" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>554</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the divergent and even sharp conflict of interests usually present where due process rights are asserted, the interests here implicated—of the State through its schools and of the pupils—are essentially congruent.</p>
<p class="indent">The State’s interest, broadly put, is in the proper functioning of its public school system for the benefit of all pupils and the public generally. Few rulings would interfere more extensively in the daily functioning of schools than subjecting routine discipline to the formalities and judicial oversight of due process. Suspensions are one of the traditional means—ranging from keeping a student after class to permanent expulsion—used to maintain discipline in the schools. It is common knowledge that maintaining order and reasonable decorum in school buildings and classrooms is a major educational problem, and one which has increased significantly in magnitude in recent years. Often the teacher, in protecting the rights of other children to an education (if not his or their safety), is compelled to rely on the power to suspend. [I]f hearings were required for a substantial percentage of short-term suspensions, school authorities would have time to do little else.</p>
<p class="indent">The State’s generalized interest in maintaining an orderly school system is not incompatible with the individual interest of the student. Education in any meaningful sense includes the inculcation of an understanding in each pupil of the necessity of rules and obedience thereto. This understanding is no less important than learning to read and write. One who does not comprehend the meaning and necessity of discipline is handicapped not merely in his education but throughout his subsequent life. When an immature student merits censure for his conduct, he is rendered a disservice if appropriate sanctions are not applied or if procedures for their application are so formalized as to invite a challenge to the teacher’s authority—an invitation which rebellious or even merely spirited teenagers are likely to accept.</p>
<p class="indent">The lesson of discipline is not merely a matter of the student’s self-interest in the shaping of his own character and personality; it provides an early understanding of the relevance to the social compact of respect for the rights of others. The classroom is the laboratory in which this lesson of life is best learned.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What are the personal interests at stake in <i>Goss</i> that trigger due process protections? The dissent argues that students’ educational interests are not absolute but explicitly limited by a statute that authorizes a principal to suspend students without hearings. Who has the better argument, the majority or dissent? Both agree, however, that state law is the source for determining whether a student has an underlying right to which federal due process attaches.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Is there any inconsistency between the Court’s willingness to find an educational interest sufficient to trigger due process here and its refusal in <i>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</i> to recognize an educational interest sufficient to trigger anything more than the most minimal level of equal protection scrutiny?</p>
<p><a id="page_555" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>555</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">3. What are the key elements of due process that schools must provide? Is that process sufficient to ensure accurate results? When must the process occur? Is there any exception to a school’s responsibility to provide that process or to do so in a timely manner?</p>
<p class="indent">4. What is the purpose of providing students this process: to ensure accuracy, fairness, or something else?</p>
<p class="indent">5. What is the Court’s rationale for requiring a relatively minimal and informal amount of process? What, if anything, justifies deference toward schools and a relaxation of due process in the administration of discipline? Do the due process standards adopted in <i>Goss</i> provide too much deference to schools? Too little? Or do they strike the right balance between students’ rights and the practicalities of running a school? Will due process protections seriously undermine the efficiency of schools, as the dissent argues?</p>
<p class="indent">6. One reason for deference to schools was the notion that discipline is not necessarily meant to punish the student, but rather is a teaching tool. In this respect, school discipline is distinct from criminal punishment. School administrators are not necessarily “out to get” students in the same way a criminal prosecutor might be out to get criminals. Instead, school administrators may still be looking out for the best interests of the student they are seeking to discipline. Whatever the case may have been at the time of <i>Goss</i>, do these characterizations of discipline fit the modern context? If not, does the nature of due process afforded to kids need to change accordingly? Many scholars and studies suggest that a significant change occurred in school philosophy toward discipline in the late 1980s and 1990s. As a result of the high-profile nature of some school-related violence and the war on drugs, school and federal policy shifted toward quick and severe reactions to potential threats to the school environment. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Derek W. Black, Ending Zero Tolerance: The Crisis of Absolute School Discipline</span> 29-46 (NYU Press 2016) (tracing discipline policy from its <i>in loco parentis</i> origins through desegregation tensions and zero tolerance); Alicia C. Insley, Comment, <i>Suspending and Expelling Children from Educational Opportunity: Time to Reevaluate Zero Tolerance Policies</i>, 50 <span class="smallcap">Am. U. L. Rev.</span> 1039, 1043-1051 (2001). In the last few years, in response to grassroots advocacy, a few educators have begun to revisit this approach and scale back the application of zero tolerance. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Advancement Project, Test, Punish, and Push Out: How “Zero Tolerance” and High-Stakes Testing Funnel Youth into the School-to-Prison Pipeline</span> 34-37 (2010).</p>
<p class="indent">7. The Court indicates that some deprivations of education are de minimus and thus would not trigger due process protections. What sorts of deprivations or punishments might fall in this category? In contrast, the Court indicates that suspensions of ten days and longer are significant and require more than just basic oral notice and a chance to respond. What makes ten days the tipping point? Is there any argument that education has sufficiently changed since <i>Goss</i> that shorter suspensions warrant more process as well?</p>
<p class="indent">8. As detailed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>, students’ right to education is no longer statutory but is constitutional and includes a qualitative component in many states. Does the fact that a student’s constitutional right to education is at stake dictate that a student should be entitled to more care and process in a decision as to whether to restrict that right?</p>
<p><a id="page_556" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>556</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">9. The Court in <i>Goss</i> indicated that students’ reputational liberty interests warranted due process as well, but one year later in <i>Paul v. Davis</i>, 424 U.S. 693 (1976), the Court held, in a noneducational context, that harm to reputation, by itself, is not a deprivation of liberty that requires due process. The Court specifically distinguished <i>Goss</i>, noting that <i>Goss</i> involved harm to both reputation and property. Lower courts have thus subsequently held that students are not entitled to due process when the only harm of discipline is reputational. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Edwards v. Rees, 883 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1989); Casey v. Newport Sch. Comm., 13 F. Supp. 2d 242 (D.R.I. 1998). Students, however, have often been able to identify some harm beyond reputation to justify their claim, <i>see</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, Brookhart v. Illinois, 697 F.2d 179, 184-185 (7th Cir. 1983), or proceeded under substantive due process instead.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch211">2. <i>Determining the Amount of Process That Is Due:</i> Mathews v. Eldridge <i>Balancing Test</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The opinion in <i>Goss</i> established the principle that students have a right to due process and articulated the broad parameters of what that process looks like, but it left open several important questions regarding the specific types of process due, including whether students have a right to submit evidence, have a record prepared, appeal the initial decision, have a decision maker unconnected to the events in question present, and, in formal hearings, have an attorney present and call and cross-examine witnesses. The Supreme Court has never revisited any of these questions in the context of elementary and secondary education.</p>
<p class="indent">While lower courts have taken up these questions, few hard and fast rules exist as to whether a student can demand a particular type of process. As to less burdensome types of process, such as the level of formality required in notices or who amounts to an impartial decision maker, courts have sometimes been inconsistent in their results. Lower courts generally have reached consistent results as to the more formalized types of process, finding that cross-examination and advocacy by an attorney are too burdensome. But even with these more formalized processes, courts have recognized exceptional circumstances that warrant a different conclusion. In short, the process due is generally highly dependent on the punishment to be imposed, the factual dispute at issue, and the perceived burden of the process.</p>
<p class="indent">This highly contextualized response to due process stems from the balancing test the Court adopted the year after <i>Goss</i> in <i>Mathews v. Eldridge</i>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). <i>Mathews</i> did not involve education, but announced the generally applicable standard for assessing whether a particular process is required under due process. A court must balance four factors to determine whether a particular process is appropriate: the private interest that will be affected; the risk of an erroneous deprivation of interest under the current process; the value, if any, of additional process in reducing error; and the burden on the state of providing the additional process. For instance, the opportunity to present witnesses or have an attorney present arguably might be required when expulsion is at stake. The</p>
<p><a id="page_557" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>557</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">private interest is high, the burden on the school relatively low, and the potential for improving outcomes at least marginally higher. But neither witness nor an attorney would seem necessary if the punishment at stake is one-day or after-school detention. To the extent detention occurs more frequently, the burden on the state is higher and the interest of the students relatively low. Moreover, forgoing the procedures is unlikely to risk any serious likelihood of error.</p>
<p class="indent">Because questions of the appropriate process vary based on the allegations and punishment at stake, lower court decisions can appear at odds when, in fact, they are simply addressing distinct circumstances. More often than not, there is a paucity of judicial opinions regarding a particular process for a particular offense rather than a direct conflict among courts. The paucity of case law also stems from the nature and frequency of cases that make it to court. Short-term suspensions were the primary focus of the Court’s opinion in <i>Goss</i> and make up the majority of discipline that schools hand out. But short-term suspensions, as well as less serious punishments, rarely reach courts because the loss students suffer is relatively low and the cost of challenging the loss is relatively high. Most students are likely to accept these punishments regardless of the process under which the punishments were imposed, whereas students are more likely to challenge long-term suspensions and expulsions because the stakes are so high. Fortunately, these serious punishments do not occur as often. Thus, there are still relatively few cases dealing with long-term suspensions and expulsions. The overall result of these inapposite motivations and costs is very little case law on day-to-day discipline and sporadic case law on more serious discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">Definitive rules of law can also be difficult to extrapolate from the cases that courts do decide because the decisions are often based on a mix of state and federal law. <i>Goss</i> sets only the bare minimum for due process; states are free to provide additional protections. In fact, several states’ statutes establish explicit process rights in regard to notice of charges, appeals, and expulsions that may exceed <i>Goss</i>’s requirements. When a student challenges a punishment in such a state, he or she is generally making a statutory and constitutional claim. When courts sustain those claims, it is not always clear whether the process was insufficient under constitutional law, state law, or both.</p>
<p class="indent">Real-world situations, however, demand answers rather than rules of thumb. The purpose of the subsequent cases and materials is to provide a basic framework for approaching these cases and issues. As emphasized in <i>Goss</i>, the major demarcating line regarding what process is required is whether the student is facing routine discipline that does not lead to suspension, a short-term suspension, or a long-term suspension. This line is the key basis on which to categorize and compare cases.</p>
<p class="indent">One approach is to assess what other courts have said about a particular process, regardless of the punishment at stake, and then assign additional weight to or discount the decision depending on the seriousness of the punishment. For instance, if various courts reject cross-examination as a necessary process in expulsion hearings, it is highly unlikely a court would require cross-examination in a one-day suspension under any circumstances. Likewise, if courts have permitted students to bring advocates with them to a short-term suspension,</p>
<p><a id="page_558" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>558</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">they would almost certainly permit the same in an expulsion, and might also be inclined to go one step further by allowing a student to be represented by an attorney. Finally, where no significant case law speaks toward a particular process, the most valuable approach may be to assess the burden of the process and compare it to case law as to more and less onerous processes.</p>
<p class="indent">With that framework in mind, the following case takes up the issues of cross-examination of students and administrators, the impartiality of decision makers, and the ex parte consideration and presentation of evidence in the context of long-term suspensions. As you read the case, consider its implications in other discipline contexts. Also, consider whether the court’s reasoning regarding why some processes are not necessary is compelling or would be subject to challenge in other analogous contexts.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch212">Newsome v. Batavia Local School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>842 F.2d 920 (6th Cir. 1988)</i></p>
<p class="indent">On appeal, [Arthur] Newsome argues that the district court erred in holding that the procedures employed by Batavia School District in expelling him did not violate his right to procedural due process of law. The procedural defects alleged by Newsome involve the denial of his request to cross-examine the witnesses against him, the denial of his right to an impartial tribunal, and the consideration, by that tribunal, of evidence not made available to Newsome.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">On November 3, 1986, Newsome was summoned to the office of the principal, Daniel Swart, and accused of possessing and offering a marijuana cigarette for sale on high school property. Newsome denied the charges and asked the source of the accusations. The principal then informed him that the information had been obtained through interviews with two students but refused to identify them.</p>
<p class="indent">[A week later,] a suspension hearing was held before Batavia School Superintendent James Fite. The principal recounted the substance of the student accusations. At no time were the names of the student accusers disclosed. Apparently, at some point, the superintendent privately interviewed the two students. [Juvenile Court officers testified that] a urinalysis which Newsome had taken was negative for drug use [and] recommended that Newsome be immediately returned to school. [T]he superintendent and principal adjourned to discuss the case. [T]he superintendent decided to [offer] Newsome a clean disciplinary record if he would accept transfer to [a vocational school]. Newsome declined this offer [and] was expelled for the remainder of the fall semester.</p>
<p class="indent">On November 24, 1986, the School Board met to consider Newsome’s appeal. Newsome was represented by counsel during this hearing. The principal and superintendent [began] by recounting the statements of the two accusing students. Again, they did not disclose the names of these students but affirmed their belief that the students were telling the truth. [T]he superintendent stated</p>
<p><a id="page_559" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>559</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that his decision to expel Newsome was based solely on the statements of the two student informants. Newsome’s attorney requested an opportunity to cross-examine the principal and superintendent, but this request was denied. The meeting concluded with Newsome’s testifying that he did not possess or offer to sell marijuana on school property. Newsome’s attorney then was allowed a closing argument.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he school board, together with the principal and superintendent, reviewed the evidence [in private, and the school board unanimously affirmed the expulsion].</p>
<p class="indent">On December 10, 1986, Newsome filed this action. On December 22, 1986, the district court conducted a self-styled “nonevidentiary hearing” to garner additional information. In response to questioning from the court, the superintendent disclosed for the first time that he presented evidence to the school board during their closed deliberations that he had not disclosed during his testimony at the open hearing. [He told the school board that an alcoholism counselor, Jean Wessler, had told him that Newsome confessed his drug possession to her. After learning this, Newsome’s attorney approached Wessler. Wessler executed an affidavit denying that Newsome made a confession or that she had disclosed any confession to the superintendent.]</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[II]</span></p>
<p class="indent">[W]hile the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of what process is due public school students in <i>short suspension</i> cases, <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>, the Court has specifically left open the question of what process is due in long-term suspensions (suspensions exceeding ten days) and expulsion cases. In the Court’s words, “We should also make it clear that we have addressed ourselves solely to the short suspension, not exceeding ten days. Longer suspensions <i>or expulsion for the remainder of the school term</i>, or permanently, <i>may</i> require more formal procedures.”</p>
<p class="indent">Without the aid of Supreme Court authority directly on point, we are left with resolving the procedural due process issues presented in this appeal under the more general rubric of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). <i>Mathews</i> provides for a flexible, policy-oriented analysis of procedural due process issues in which three competing factors are balanced against each other. These factors are: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the government’s interest, including the fiscal and administrative burden that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, our analysis of Newsome’s procedural due process claims will focus on the inquiry: “Is the probable value of the additional, pre-expulsion, procedural safeguards proposed by Newsome to protect his important interest in a free public education outweighed by the burden that would be placed upon the school district by the additional safeguards?” After careful inquiry, we conclude that Newsome was denied due process by the superintendent’s disclosure to the school board of Jean Wessler’s alleged statement to him when such statement had not been introduced during the open hearing, but that he was not denied</p>
<p><a id="page_560" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>560</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">due process by not being permitted to cross-examine or to know the names of his student accusers, by not being permitted to cross-examine the school principal and superintendent, and by not being permitted to be present at the school board’s closed deliberations even though the school principal and superintendent were allowed to attend.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Newsome first contends that he was denied due process of law at the school board hearing when the board denied his request for permission to cross-examine his student accusers or to at least know their identities. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">The value of cross-examination to the discovery of truth cannot be overemphasized. “Cross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.” In the instant case, allowing Newsome, through his attorney, to cross-examine his student accusers, or even merely to know their names, would have afforded Newsome the opportunity to challenge the students’ credibility. For example, a prior altercation of some sort between Newsome and his accusers might have been brought to light through cross-examination or by disclosure of their identities.</p>
<p class="indent">The value of cross-examining student witnesses in school disciplinary cases, however, is somewhat muted by the fact that the veracity of a student account of misconduct by another student is initially assessed by a school administrator—in this case, the school principal—who has, or has available to him, a particularized knowledge of the student’s trustworthiness. The school administrator generally knows firsthand (or has access to school records which disclose) the accusing student’s disciplinary history, which can serve as a valuable gauge in evaluating the believability of the student’s account. Additionally, the school administrator often knows, or can readily discover, whether the student witness and the accused have had an amicable relationship in the past. Consequently, the process of cross-examining the student witness may often be merely duplicative of the evaluation process undertaken by the investigating school administrator.</p>
<p class="indent">The value of cross-examining student witnesses in pre-expulsion proceedings must be set against the burden that such a practice would place upon school administration. Today’s public schools face severe challenges in maintaining the order and discipline necessary for the impartation of knowledge. A recent study shows that today’s schoolteachers are concerned with drug abuse, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, arson, and bombings. Indeed, a recent Supreme Court decision noted that “drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems.” New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 339 (1985).</p>
<p class="indent">In this turbulent, sometimes violent, school atmosphere, it is critically important that we protect the anonymity of students who “blow the whistle” on their classmates who engage in drug trafficking and other serious offenses. Without the cloak of anonymity, students who witness criminal activity on school property will be much less likely to notify school authorities, and those who do will be faced with ostracism at best and perhaps physical reprisals. Giving due weight to the important interest a student accused of serious</p>
<p><a id="page_561" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>561</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">misconduct has in his public education, we conclude that the necessity of protecting student witnesses from ostracism and reprisal outweighs the value to the truth-determining process of allowing the accused student to cross-examine his accusers.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Newsome’s second allegation of procedural due process deprivation concerns the board’s denial of his attorney’s request to cross-examine the school principal and superintendent. Newsome postulates that, had he been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the two school administrators, flaws in their investigation of the alleged drug trafficking incident, as well as personal animus against Newsome, might well have surfaced. We do not take issue with Newsome’s claim that cross-examination would have improved the fact-finding process, particularly since, in his case, cross-examination of the school superintendent during the school board hearing may well have brought out the superintendent’s erroneous reliance on Wessler’s purported statement concerning Newsome’s alleged confession.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, however, <i>Mathews</i> instructs us to balance the benefit that would be derived from the cross-examination of school authorities during pre-expulsion proceedings, together with the important interest that a public school student has in his education, against the burden that cross-examination would place on the school board or other decisionmaker. We hold that the burden of cross-examination on the administration of school discipline outweighs the benefits to be derived from that procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">School boards and administrators are charged with a variety of responsibilities critical to the effective operation of our public schools. These responsibilities include, not only meting out disciplinary punishment for student infractions of school rules, but also hiring and firing teachers and other school personnel, planning curricula, meeting the dietary and health needs of the student population, assisting in college and vocational placement, supplying and maintaining the school buildings, providing challenging and rewarding extra-curricular activities, and doing all the above often within an increasingly tighter budget. School boards and administrations are not quasi-judicial [like other governmental bodies]. To saddle them with the burden of overseeing the process of cross-examination (and the innumerable objections that are raised to the form and content of cross-examination) is to require of them that which they are ill-equipped to perform. The detriment that will accrue to the educational process in general by diverting school board members’ and school administrators’ attention from their primary responsibilities in overseeing the educational process to learning and applying the common law rules of evidence simply outweighs the marginal benefit that will accrue to the fact-finding process by allowing cross-examination.</p>
<p class="indent">[We, like other courts, acknowledge there “is a seductive quality to the argument” that more formalized hearings and adherence to evidentiary rules are just as necessary to protect students’ important interests in education as they are to protect welfare benefits. But to accede to this argument would move the schools’ disciplinary process just one step closer to criminal trials.</p>
<p><a id="page_562" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>562</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Important as educational rights are, they can be fairly adjudicated based on hearsay evidence school administrators collect in investigating the incidents. “‘We decline to place upon a board of laymen the duty of observing and applying the common-law rules of evidence.’”]</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Newsome’s third allegation of due process deprivation involves the participation of the school principal and the superintendent in the closed deliberations of the school board when Newsome and his counsel were not allowed to attend. Newsome contends that such participation by the principal, who investigated the allegations of Newsome’s drug trafficking and who recommended suspension, and the superintendent, who ordered Newsome expelled from school for the remainder of the fall semester, biased the school board and deprived him of his right to an impartial decisionmaker. We disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">We note initially that the principal and superintendent were nonvoting participants in the board’s deliberation process whose involvement was limited to participating in the board’s discussion. Although we recognize that participation by the investigating administrators in the deliberation process of the fact-finders is an open invitation for the administrators to bring up evidence of the student’s guilt which had not been disclosed to the student as required by <i>Goss</i>, we cannot say that, as a general matter, it is a violation of due process for investigating administrators to participate in the deliberation process.</p>
<p class="indent">In Brewer v. Austin Indep. School Dist., 779 F.2d 260 (5th Cir. 1985), the Fifth Circuit, in a case involving the expulsion of a high school student for possession of marijuana, pointed out that: “A school administrator involved in the initiation and investigation of charges is not thereby disqualified from conducting a hearing on the charges, although the facts of an occasional case may demonstrate that a school official’s involvement in an incident created a bias ‘such as to preclude his affording the student an impartial hearing.’” In the instant case, then, not only was it permissible for the school principal and superintendent to participate in the school board’s deliberations, it would not be a denial of due process for them to have voted with the board, or even to have held the pre-expulsion hearing themselves and reached the final, binding decision concerning Newsome’s expulsion.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note29" id="Rnote29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> A student faced with expulsion has the right to a pre-expulsion hearing before an impartial trier-of-fact—he does not have the right to a full-blown administrative appellate process.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Newsome last complains that he was denied procedural due process when the superintendent disclosed to the school board, during their closed</p>
<p><a id="page_563" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>563</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">deliberations, new evidence which had not been presented during the open hearing. We agree.</p>
<p class="indent">While <i>Goss</i> specifically limited itself to “the short suspension, not exceeding ten days,” it nevertheless establishes the <i>minimum</i> requirements for long-term expulsions as well. The minimum requirements established for school expulsions in <i>Goss</i> are “oral and written notice of the charges against [the student] and, if he denies them, <i>an explanation of the evidence the authorities have</i> and an opportunity to present his side of the story.” In the instant case, Newsome received written notice of the charge that he had possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute, and he denied the allegation. Consequently, it was incumbent upon the school officials who possessed evidence of Newsome’s alleged involvement in the marijuana incident to inform Newsome, during the school board hearing, of their evidence so that he would have an opportunity to rebut the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The superintendent failed to comply with this minimum procedural safeguard required by <i>Goss</i> during the school board hearing. Rather than disclosing to Newsome during the open hearing before the school board that Jean Wessler had informed him that Newsome had confessed to her his involvement in the marijuana incident so that Newsome would have an opportunity to rebut this item of evidence, the superintendent waited until the closed deliberation session to apprise the school board of this information. Such a tactic completely deprived Newsome of any opportunity to rebut the evidence and amounted to a clear deprivation of his right to procedural due process of law.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">For the forgoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded to the district court to determine whether Newsome is entitled to the injunctive and compensatory relief he seeks. To the extent that Newsome seeks money damages to compensate him for the violation of his fourteenth amendment right, he must demonstrate, on remand, that he suffered <i>actual</i> injury (such as mental and emotional distress) caused by the violation. To the extent that Newsome seeks reparative relief aimed at restoring him to the position he would have occupied but for the due process violation, he is entitled to such relief unless the <i>school district</i> can prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, even had it not deprived Newsome of his right to procedural due process, he would have still rightfully been expelled. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978).</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What standard does the court use to evaluate whether each of the processes in question are constitutionally required? Why does this court find that the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and administrators is not required? If this case had not involved a serious charge like drug possession and the potential for appraisals against the accusers, would cross-examination have</p>
<p><a id="page_564" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>564</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">been appropriate? Why was the superintendent’s private presentation of evidence to the board problematic when no other procedural flaws were?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The court places significant faith in the administrator’s ability to arrive at the truth without following any special procedures, emphasizing that administrators have access to information, records, and other student history that gives them a special ability to assess a student witness’s trustworthiness. If discipline is such a frequent and pressing problem, is it realistic to assume that administrators have the time to consult records of the personal relationship with students that assures trustworthiness of witnesses or knowledge of private disputes between friends that might taint reliability?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court indicates that allowing for cross-examination would place administrators in a situation where they would be expected to know rules of evidence and respond to objections. Would it be possible to allow for cross-examination without burdening administrators with rules of evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Without the benefit of cross-examination, is it likely that a student would be able to uncover biases and inappropriate behavior on the part of his accusers? Without advance knowledge of the bias, is it likely that a student would even bother suing (because he knows he has no claim on the cross-examination issues)? Here, Newsome’s discovery was fortuitous. The information was not disclosed until the judge held an evidentiary hearing and questioned the superintendent. Yet, if one were to assume that schools reach the correct result in most cases without cross-examination, allowing for cross-examination would impose a significant burden. Are there reasons we might tolerate a higher error rate in schools when we will not tolerate it in other contexts? Is there any way to protect future students without overburdening schools?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The constitutional problem in <i>Newsome</i> was that the superintendent presented evidence to the board that was not available to Newsome. Does allowing single individuals to participate at all levels of the investigation and decision-making process increase the risk that information that is not disclosed to students will be considered against them? Do the practicalities of operating a school and the good faith of administrators make this a risk the law must tolerate?</p>
<p class="indent">6. If a school or state extends students procedural protections beyond what federal due process requires but then fails to follow its own rules in regard to a particular student, should the failure amount to a violation of due process?</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch213">a. Impartial Decision Makers</p>
<p class="indent">Courts agree with <i>Newsome</i> that a due process hearing officer need not be a third party akin to a judge. A hearing officer may be a teacher or an administrator who works for the school, so long as he or she acts in an unbiased capacity. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Jennings v. Wentzville R-IV Sch. Dist., 397 F.3d 1118, 1125 (8th Cir. 2005). Moreover, familiarity with the facts of the case before the hearing takes place, or an administrator’s role as an investigator before sitting as a decision maker, does not necessarily preclude the person from later serving as an adjudicator. Generally, courts presume that the decision maker hearing the student’s case is impartial. The burden rests on the student to demonstrate actual bias if he or</p>
<p><a id="page_565" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>565</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">she believes that the hearing officer is not neutral. <i>See</i> Hortonville Joint Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville Educ. Ass’n, 426 U.S. 482, 497 (1976) (referring to the “presumption of honesty and integrity” of decision makers in school board hearings); <i>Jennings</i>, 397 F.3d at 1125 (same). Although a court will not presume bias, students can point to the decision maker’s prior involvement in the incident as potential evidence of bias. Brewer v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 779 F.2d 260, 264 (5th Cir. 1985); deKoevend v. Bd. of Educ. of W. End Sch. Dist. RE-2, 688 P.2d 219 (Colo. 1984). As one court put it, “[w]hile the Constitution does not guarantee a decision maker free from the appearance of bias, it does require one who is free of actual bias. Due process violations may therefore occur when the principal is biased or ‘in any way unable to function fairly as a trier of fact.’” Riggan v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 86 F. Supp. 2d 647, 656-657 (W.D. Tex. 2000) (quoting Murray v. W. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 472 F.2d 438, 443 (5th Cir. 1973)). For a more detailed overview of who can and cannot serve as a hearing officer, see Larry Bartlett &amp; James McCullagh, <i>Exclusion from the Educational Process in the Public Schools: What Process Is Now Due</i>, 1993 B.Y.U. <span class="smallcap">Educ.</span> &amp; L.J. 1, 24 (1993).</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch214">b. Burden of Proof</p>
<p class="indent">The court in <i>Newsome</i> did not mention it, but the value of cross-examination presumably varies depending on the substance of the testimony against a student and the weight of the collective evidence. Various courts have indicated that administrators need substantial evidence to justify their decision to punish a student. Johnson v. Collins, 233 F. Supp. 2d 241, 248 (D.N.H. 2002); Carey <i>ex rel.</i> Carey v. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 17, 754 F. Supp. 906, 919 (D. Me. 1990); Bd. of Educ. of Monticello Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Comm’r of Educ., 91 N.Y.2d 133, 140-141 (1997); <i>see also</i> Mills v. Bd. of Educ. of D.C., 348 F. Supp. 866, 882 (D.D.C. 1972) (presumption of innocence). Where the only evidence on point is conflicting, a substantial evidence standard ought to increase the value of cross-examination or require the decision maker to collect additional outside evidence. Evidence relied on in disciplinary decisions need not meet the level of reliability required in court. For instance, hearsay evidence is entirely appropriate, so long as it is “competent and substantial” evidence of the student’s participation in the conduct charged. <i>Monticello Cent. Sch. Dist.</i>, 91 N.Y.2d at 141. Moreover, the decision maker is free to draw reasonable inferences based on the hearsay evidence. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch215">c. Appeals</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Newsome</i>, the district afforded the student a right of appeal to the school board. With suspensions of ten days or less, courts tend to treat the appeal as gratuitous since students are not even entitled to a formal hearing. <i>See</i> Heyne v. Metro. Nashville Pub. Schs., 655 F.3d 556, 569 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing various sources). With long-term suspensions and expulsions, appeals are commonly</p>
<p><a id="page_566" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>566</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">offered, but whether they are constitutionally required is less clear. Given that not all students will appeal their punishment, the administrative burden of providing appeals for long-term suspensions is lower and the student interest necessarily involves a severe loss of education rights. Both factors would balance the scales toward requiring an appeal. However, because so many state statutes and local district policies provide for an appeal in long-term suspensions, courts have not frequently had occasion to consider the issue. More often, litigation in regard to an appeal involves a dispute over what process was afforded at the appeal. As the court in <i>Newsome</i> found, the student would have no right to a “full-blown” appeal. Should appeals involve a de novo review of the administrator’s decision or a presumption that the punishment was appropriate? While it is often unclear because formal procedural rules do not apply, among those cases that make it to court, most school boards and appellate officers seem to extend substantial deference to whomever made the initial determination of discipline. With that said, if a district affords a student a well-organized and fair appeal, the appeal potentially renders any deficiencies in the initial hearing process moot.</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch216">d. Cross-Examination</p>
<p class="indent">A few courts have disagreed with <i>Newsome</i> and found that cross-examination was warranted in long-term suspension hearings or when witnesses’ statements were inconsistent. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Dillon v. Pulaski Cty. Special Sch. Dist., 594 F.2d 699 (8th Cir. 1979) (required in expulsion); <i>Carey</i>, 754 F. Supp. at 906; DeJesus v. Penberthy, 344 F. Supp. 70, 76 (D. Conn. 1972); Colquitt v. Rich Twp. High Sch. Dist. No. 227, 699 N.E.2d 1109, 1115-1116 (Ill. Ct. App. 1998); <i>In re</i> E.J.W., 632 N.W.2d 775 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001) (required in expulsion). One can imagine, however, situations where the accusations are numerous, a student has confessed, a student wants to cross-examine his accusers just for the sake of intimidation, or the student is simply trying to force an administrator to build a case in a normal prosecutorial sense. In such instances, courts reject demands for cross-examination. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Newsome v. Batavia Local Sch. Dist., 842 F.2d 920 (6th Cir. 1988) (prevent witness intimidation); Dornes v. Lindsey, 18 F. Supp. 2d 1086 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (protect whistleblower); <i>Carey</i>, 754 F. Supp. at 919 (after indicating cross-examination is generally necessary, finding no constitutional violation because student had confessed to accusations).</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch217">e. Right to Counsel</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to <i>Goss</i>, circuit courts reached varying outcomes regarding whether students are entitled to have counsel present in formal school disciplinary proceedings. More recent cases have sought a middle ground whereby students might have the right to have counsel present to advise them, but that right would not include permitting the attorney to act in the traditional role of</p>
<p><a id="page_567" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>567</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">representing and speaking on behalf of a student or cross-examining witnesses. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Osteen v. Henley, 13 F.2d 221, 225 (7th Cir. 1993); <i>Newsome</i>, 842 F.2d at 925-926; Gorman v. Univ. of R.I., 837 F.2d 7, 16 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that unless a student is facing criminal charges, representation by counsel is not necessary at disciplinary hearings). As with all aspects of a disciplinary proceeding, courts focus on the administrative burden that requiring counsel would have on the day-to-day operation of the school in determining the necessity of allowing students access to counsel.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch218">f. Detailed Notice</p>
<p class="indent">With relatively minor punishments or short-term suspension, basic verbal notice of the allegations is sufficient. Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975). With long-term suspensions, more formal notice is required. That notice ought to include more than just a conclusory statement that a violation has occurred. Without some specific details, a student cannot fully respond or prepare an effective defense. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Bd. of Educ. of Monticello Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Comm’r of Educ., 91 N.Y.2d 133, 139 (1997). With that said, notice does not have to take the form of a criminal indictment and need not include every factual allegation or every detail of every charge. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Arrington v. Eberhart, 920 F. Supp. 1208, 1219 (M.D. Ala. 1996). In short, the key requirement of constitutional notice is not its form but its function. The question is whether a student receives some form of notice sufficient to permit the student to respond to the charges. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Riggan v. Midland Indep. Sch. Dist., 86 F. Supp. 2d 647 (W.D. Tex. 2000). In applying this principle, courts have split over whether a student must be given notice of the potential witnesses who might testify against him at the hearing. Several courts reason that notice of these witnesses is required, but others reason that notice is not required so long as it does not materially prejudice the student’s defense at the hearing. <i>Compare</i> Keough v. Tate Cty. Bd. of Educ., 748 F.2d 1077, 1081-1082 (5th Cir. 1984); Warren Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Wilkinson, 500 So. 2d 455, 460-461 (Miss. 1986), <i>with</i> Nash v. Auburn Univ., 812 F.2d 655, 663 (11th Cir. 1987); Whiteside v. Kay, 446 F. Supp. 716, 721 (W.D. La. 1978). Regardless, some state statutes mandate specific forms of notice to students facing expulsion or long-term punishment.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch219">g. Transcripts</p>
<p class="indent">Courts generally refrain from requiring transcripts or recordings of a hearing so long as some other record of the proceedings is kept (written notes or summary). While favoring some form of a record, they have not, however, specifically held it to be constitutionally required. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Flaim v. Med. Coll. of Ohio, 418 F.3d 629, 636 (6th Cir. 2005); Escatel v. Atherton, 1997 WL 264345, at *2 (N.D. Ill. May 8, 1997). Some state statutes require a record of the proceedings in some form. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">Tenn. Stat. Ann.</span> §49-6-3401(c)(6) (2012).</p>

<p class="h7" id="ch220">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Alvin and Simon are sophomores at Clinton High School. They have been best friends for years. One day during the fall semester, they were talking in hushed tones between classes in front of Alvin’s locker. Ted had never cared much for either Alvin or Simon and attempted to listen in on their conversation from a few lockers down. Ted could not make out the entire conversation, but believes he heard the word “marijuana” at one point and shortly thereafter heard “let’s put it in here.” He then saw Alvin bend down and appear to stuff a package into his locker. Ted relayed this story to the principal, Mr. Smith, although Ted did not express any uncertainty about what he heard or saw. Smith sent Ted back to class and called Alvin and Simon to his office. Smith questioned them extensively. They both denied any connection to drugs. A search of their lockers did not reveal any drugs, but Smith believes Alvin and Simon are lying and intends to expel them. He had heard another similar rumor about them last year.</p>
<p class="indent">Has Smith afforded the boys sufficient due process at this point? Has he collected sufficient evidence? If not, what other processes are the boys due, and what evidence is necessary?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch221">3. <i>Determining What Interests Require Due Process</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The previous cases address the topic of what process is due, as they all involve some underlying deprivation of education that demands due process. A preliminary question, however, is often whether there is an underlying interest at stake that even requires due process. For instance, when a school punishes student misbehavior by withdrawing privileges to ride the bus, excluding a student from extracurricular activities, or requiring a student to stay after school, the student may not suffer a loss that implicates constitutional protection. Or a student may have engaged in academic rather than behavioral misconduct, and the consequences at issue are academic rather than suspension. Likewise, some schools continue to use corporal punishment as a form of discipline. With corporal punishment, bodily integrity, rather than an educational interest, is at stake. Does the loss of privileges, academic discipline, or physical punishment warrant due process? If so, should the process be distinct from the process required for suspension and expulsion? The following cases and materials address these questions.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch222">a. In-School Suspensions</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch223">Laney v. Farley</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>501 F.3d 577 (6th Cir. 2007)</i></p>
<p class="indent">An in-school suspension could, but does not necessarily, deprive a student of educational opportunities in the same way an out-of-school suspension</p>
<p><a id="page_569" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>569</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">would: “Under certain circumstances, in-school isolation could well constitute as much deprivation of education as at-home suspension. In other words, a student could be excluded from the educational process as much by being placed in isolation as by being barred from the school grounds. The primary thrust of the educational process is classroom instruction; in both situations the student is excluded from the classroom. This is not to say that any in-school detention would necessarily be equivalent to a suspension; it would depend on the extent to which the student was deprived of instruction or the opportunity to learn.” Cole v. Newton Special Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 676 F. Supp. 749, 751-752 (S.D. Miss. 1987), <i>aff’d</i>, 853 F.2d 924 (5th Cir.1988).</p>
<p class="indent">[In the instant case, the student’s] in-school suspension was unlike the out-of-school suspensions discussed in <i>Goss.</i> Tennessee students assigned to in-school suspension remain in the school setting and are expressly “required to complete academic requirements.” A student under in-school suspension is “recorded as constituting a part of the public school attendance in the same manner as students who attend regular classes.” Unlike students in out-of-school suspensions, students under in-school suspensions are not denied all educational opportunities, even though they are removed from their classrooms.</p>
<p class="indent">Other courts encountering the issue under similar circumstances have reached the sensible conclusion that in-school suspensions do not implicate a student’s property interest in a public education. The Eighth Circuit stated as much when a special education student received a three-day in-school suspension due to tardiness and was isolated in a special classroom. <i>See Wise,</i> 855 F.2d at 563 n.3. The student completed all his assigned work during the suspension and did not fall behind in his school work. The <i>Wise</i> court said, “we do not believe…that the <i>Goss</i> decision requires adherence to the strictures of procedural due process in the context of a temporary in-school suspension…. In-school suspension does not exclude the student from school and consequently a student’s property interest in a public education is not implicated.” <i>See also Fenton v. Stear</i>, 423 F. Supp. 767, 772 (W.D. Pa. 1976) (three-day in-school suspension not sufficient to constitute a deprivation of a property interest); <i>Dickens v. Johnson County Bd. of Educ</i>., 661 F. Supp. 155 (E.D. Tenn. 1987) (holding that interference with educational opportunity was trivial and property interest was not implicated [by]”timeout” in a three-sided cardboard carton for as long as four and one-half hours on six consecutive days). We agree with these views.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, [the school board] analogizes the in-school suspension with an imposition of attendance at an alternative school. This Court has suggested that an imposition of a ten-day attendance at an alternative school may not give rise to procedural due process, “absent some showing that the education received at the alternative school is significantly different from or inferior to that received at his regular public school.” <i>Buchanan v. City of Bolivar</i>, 99 F.3d 1352, 1359 (6th Cir. 1996). No such argument could be made on our facts. We conclude, therefore, that [a] one-day in-school suspension does not implicate a property interest in public education.</p>
<p><a id="page_570" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>570</b></a></p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. <i>Goss</i> held that due process applied because there was both an educational interest and a liberty interest at stake. Is it possible that Laney’s reputation is sufficiently damaged by in-school suspension (ISS) that due process ought to apply? This court and others have said no. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Laney v. Farley, 501 F.3d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 2007); Fenton v. Stear, 423 F. Supp. 767, 773 (W.D. Pa. 1976). In fact, after <i>Goss</i>, courts shied away from requiring due process for an injury that was only reputational and, instead, suggested that due process applies only when there is some injury beyond just reputation. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226 (1991); Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710 (1976); <i>see also</i> Lee E. Teitelbaum, <i>School Discipline Procedures: Some Empirical Findings and Some Theoretical Questions</i>, 58 <span class="smallcap">Ind. L.J.</span> 547, 586 (1983).</p>
<p class="indent">2. The court in <i>Laney</i> cites to various other courts treating in-school suspension of a couple of days as insufficient to warrant due process. In another unpublished opinion, the Sixth Circuit also held that a ten-day ISS did not require due process either, reasoning that the student was still in school and had not lost educational benefits. Wayne v. Shadowen, 15 F. App’x 271, 290 (6th Cir. Ky. 2001). In terms of the low-level infractions that land students in ISS, ISS is certainly less serious than out-of-school suspension. But some schools allow suspended students to complete their work assignments from home. In terms of the educational opportunities that students receive, does ISS substantively differ from out-of-school suspension (other than the fact that ISS involves on-campus study and has minimal reputational effects)? Are the courts correct that students do not suffer an educational loss in ISS? What if a student were repeatedly assigned to ISS during the course of the year or for extremely long periods? Given the low-level infractions that lead to ISS, would requiring due process hearings impose a burden on schools? Some courts have left open the possibility that classroom exclusion could eventually amount to the equivalent of suspension. <i>But see</i> Coutre v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 535 F.3d 1243, 1257 (10th Cir. 2008) (finding that twelve total hours of timeout over the course of two and a half months was not equivalent to suspension).</p>
<p class="indent">As a less severe punishment than ISS, teachers or administrators may also exclude students from class by temporarily sending them into the hallway, to timeout, or to some other place of isolation. Courts have found this educational deprivation de minimus and insufficient to invoke due process. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Coutre</i>, 535 F.3d at 1243; Hassan v. Lubbock Indep. Sch. Dist., 55 F.3d 1075, 1080-1081 (5th Cir. 1995); Dickens v. Johnson Cty. Bd. of Educ., 661 F. Supp. 155 (E.D. Tenn. 1987).</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch224">b. Assignment to Alternative School</p>
<p class="indent">The court in <i>Laney</i> cites to its previous decision in <i>Buchanan v. City of Bolivar</i>, which suggested that assignment to an alternative school would not trigger due process protection absent a showing that the education delivered there was significantly inferior. Other courts have reached similar conclusions or alluded</p>
<p><a id="page_571" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>571</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to the same outcome. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Nevares v. San Marco Consol. Ind. Sch. Dist., 111 F.3d 25, 26-27 (5th Cir. 1997); C.B. v. Driscoll, 82 F.3d 383, 389 n.5 (11th Cir. 1996); Doe v. Bagan, 41 F.3d 571, 576 (10th Cir. 1994); Zamora v. Pomeroy, 639 F.2d 662, 669-670 (10th Cir. 1981). Many of these decisions preceded the rapid expansion of alternative schools in recent decades and may not take into serious account the prevailing circumstances in many alternative schools. First, while it is true that alternative schools in contrast to long-term suspension do not deprive students of all education, alternative schools are often the punishment for the most serious types of infractions a student might commit. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Langley v. Monroe Cty. Sch. Dist., 264 F. App’x 366 (5th Cir. 2008) (alcohol on campus); <i>see also</i> Elbert H. Aull IV, <i>Zero Tolerance, Frivolous Juvenile Court Referrals, and the School-to-Prison Pipeline: Using Arbitration as a Screening-Out Method to Help Plug the Pipeline</i>, 27 <span class="smallcap">Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol.</span> 179 (2012) (characterizing alternative schools as a means to deal with students who traditionally would have been suspended). Second, consistent with the first point, rather than expel a student and limit all educational opportunity, some districts send students to alternative school in conjunction with expelling them from the general schools. Aull, <i>supra</i>, at 194 (“[S]ome students who are transferred to alternative schools in conjunction with excessive zero tolerance penalties decide to seek GEDs, or simply drop out of school, instead of attending the nontraditional program.”). Third, school districts can and do assign students to alternative schools for extended periods of time, including for the remainder of the school year. Fourth and most important, the education delivered at alternative schools is generally different from, and qualitatively inferior to, regular school. As a general matter, students from various grades attend the same alternative school and sit in the same classroom. A single teacher may be responsible for “teaching” the students all of the subject areas. Because the student enrollment is smaller at alternative schools, these schools may also lack the capacity to deliver consistent special education services to the students who are entitled to them. As one report charges, “many alternative schools are no more than holding pens for children considered to be troublemakers.” <span class="smallcap">Advancement Project, Opportunities Suspended: The Devastating Consequences of Zero-Tolerance and School Discipline</span> 14 (2000). <i>But see</i> Marner v. Eufaula City Sch. Bd., 204 F. Supp. 2d 1318, 1324 (M.D. Ala. 2002) (indicating that while students did not receive “classical instruction” in alternative school, students did have access to one-on-one assistance and instruction that permitted some students to improve their grades). Should the burden be on students to demonstrate inferior educational opportunities, or should schools shoulder the burden of due process before sending students to alternative schools?</p>
<p class="indent">One commentator, Maureen Carroll, cautions against placing too much weight in negative decisions and suggests courts have taken note of the prevailing realities of alternative school. She writes:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">In other circuits, the absence of explicit holdings on the issue should not be interpreted as agreement that disciplinary transfer plaintiffs must meet a high injury threshold in order to establish a greater than de minimis interference with the protected interest in receiving a public education. To the contrary, many courts have set a low threshold for disciplinary</p>
<p><a id="page_572" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>572</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">transfer claims precisely by not addressing the question explicitly. In decisions issued by the Ninth Circuit and district courts in the Second and Seventh Circuits, courts have treated an involuntary removal from a particular school as an expulsion even though an alternative educational program was provided. Requiring the full due process protections associated with expulsion in disciplinary transfer cases amounts to an acknowledgement that a disciplinary transfer not only implicates a student’s constitutionally protected interest in receiving a public education, but involves significant harm to that interest.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Maureen Carroll, <i>Racialized Assumptions and Constitutional Harm: Claims of Injury Based on Public School Assignment</i>, 83 <span class="smallcap">Temp. L. Rev.</span> 903, 914 (2011). Carroll also notes that some state statutes have implicitly recognized as much by providing hearings prior to alternative school assignment, which in those states eliminates due process challenges that students might otherwise have raised in regard to alternative school assignments. <i>Id.</i> Carroll also points out that the Supreme Court found a sufficient injury in school assignments in <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District</i>, 551 U.S. 701 (2007), to trigger equal protection analysis, even though there was no showing of inequality between the schools themselves. Carroll, <i>supra</i>, at 915.</p>
<p class="indent">In those states where courts have held that students have a constitutional right to qualitative or equitable education, transfers to alternative schools may invoke a more rigorous analysis. That issue is taken up later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch225">c. Removal from Charter Schools</p>
<p class="indent">While still enrolling a relatively small portion of public school students nationally, charter schools are growing exponentially in many locations. A full discussion of charter schools is in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/25_ELEFR_Chapter_13.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 13</a>. For now, it is important to note the different approach many charters take to discipline, the legal leeway that some courts have afforded them, and the potential effect this has had on the instances of discipline in charter schools. First, several charter schools are premised on a stricter form of discipline, which produces school exclusions far beyond the average in traditional public schools. Carver Collegiate Charter School in New Orleans, for instance, operates on a demerit system. When students accumulate too many demerits, they are suspended. According to a complaint filed by civil rights advocates, the school’s out-of-school suspension rate is 68.85 percent. The behavior leading to demerits and suspensions, however, would go completely unnoticed in almost all traditional public schools, even those employing the harshest zero-tolerance policies.</p>
<p class="indent">The civil rights complaint offered this summary of discipline policies at Carver Collegiate and two other charter schools in New Orleans:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">These schools feature a culture of hyper-discipline that is punitive and demeaning to students. The schools demand a uniformity among the students and enforce it with harsh discipline for petty matters such as: (1) requiring all students to firmly shake the hands of their teachers and administrators at the beginning of each day and before each class; (2) walking straight on a line; (3) being required to be silent “at level zero” in the hallways, often at lunchtime or whenever a teacher demands; (4) being required to sit in an upright position all day, hands folded on the desk, feet planted firmly on the floor, and looking</p>
<p><a id="page_573" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>573</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">straight ahead; (5) being required to raise their hand in lock-elbow position in class or receive demerits if their arm is not straight; (6) being suspended for minor misbehaviors like laughing too much, inappropriate displays of affection such as hugging a friend, and most commonly for being “disrespectful.”</p>

Schools</i>, <span class="smallcap">Louisiana Weekly</span>, April 21, 2014.</p>
<p class="indent">A recent national study of the discipline data thus far released on charter schools was consistent with these anecdotes. The study found that “in 2011-12, of the charter schools educating at least 50 students, 374 suspended at least 25% of all their student body. About one-fifth of these schools (68) had overall suspension rates of 50% or more.…[T]his means that more than half of all the enrolled students in 68 charter schools were suspended at least once. Perhaps most shocking is the fact that 235 charter schools suspended more than 50% of their enrolled students with disabilities.” <span class="smallcap">Daniel J. Losen et al., The Civil Rights Project, Charter Schools, Civil Rights and School Discipline: A Comprehensive Review 6 (2016).</span></p>
<p class="indent">Second, the extent to which students are excluded from charters without due process is unclear, but some courts have made it relatively easy for charters to do so. For instance, in <i>Scott B. v. Board of Trustees of Orange County High School of Arts,</i> 158 Cal. Rptr. 3d 173 (Ct. App. Cal. 2013), a charter school student in California challenged his dismissal. As in charter schools in New Orleans and elsewhere, the student had accumulated too many demerits under the school code of conduct (although he appeared to have engaged in serious misconduct at the end that may have made his removal inevitable). He appealed his dismissal to the school board, but was denied a hearing. On that basis, he argued he was denied due process under a state statute. The appellate court rejected his claim, reasoning, that:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Dismissal from a charter school does not implicate [due process] concerns to the same degree as expulsion. Unlike public schools generally, “OCHSA is a school of choice. No student is required to attend.” When a student is dismissed from OCHSA, the student is free to immediately enroll in another school without the loss of classroom time. Thus, dismissal from OCHSA need not and should not delay Scott’s education. The May 16, 2011 letter informing Scott’s mother of his dismissal instructed her to immediately enroll Scott in another school. Scott’s transcripts from OCHSA were attached to the letter. The parties have not cited us to any statute requiring a new school be notified of a dismissal from a charter school.</p>

<p class="indent">Should due process apply to suspension and exclusion from a charter school?</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h4a" id="ch226">d. Exclusion from Athletic and Extracurricular Activities</p>
<p class="indent">The traditional approach to participation in extracurricular activities and athletics is that students do not have a property interest in them and thus due process does not apply. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Todd v. Rush Cty. Schs., 133 F.3d 984, 986 (7th Cir. 1998); Palmer v. Merluzzi, 868 F.2d 90, 95-96 (3d Cir. 1989); Davenport v. Randolph Cty. Bd. of Educ., 730 F.2d 1395, 1397 (11th Cir. 1984); Herbert v. Ventetuolo, 638 F.2d 5 (1st Cir. 1981); Smith v. Chippewa Falls Area Unified Sch. Dist., 302 F. Supp. 2d 953, 957 (W.D. Wis. 2002) (collecting cases); Mazevski v. Horseheads Cent. Sch. Dist., 950 F. Supp. 69, 72 (W.D.N.Y. 1997). Several courts have reasoned that athletics and extracurricular activities are but a single component of education and that total exclusion from education is necessary to invoke due process. Several also reason that participation in athletics and extracurricular activities is, at best, a privilege, not a right. However, given the prominent role that sports play in our culture and the emphasis that many young people place on them, parents and students have continued to press their claims in court. Some have found inroads.</p>
<p class="indent">A few courts have placed significant weight in local school board policies or statutes governing athletics and find that students do have some protected interest in participation. These courts emphasize that extracurricular activities, albeit only a part of education, are an integral part of the total educational experience. These courts sometimes note that, in addition to a property interest, exclusion from athletics can implicate reputational interests. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Butler v. Oak Creek-Franklin Sch. Dist., 116 F. Supp. 2d 1038 (E.D. Wis. 2000); Boyd v. Bd. of Directors of McGehee Sch. Dist. No. 17, 612 F. Supp. 86, 93 (E.D. Ark. 1985); Davis v. Cent. Dauphin Sch. Dist. Sch. Bd., 466 F. Supp. 1259, 1263 (M.D. Pa. 1979); Duffley v. N.H. Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, 446 A.2d 462 (N.H. 1982).</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch227">e. Exclusion from School Buses</p>
<p class="indent">Exclusion from a school bus, on its face, seems like no more of a deprivation than exclusion from extracurricular activities. However, for some students, exclusion from a bus may make it impossible for them to attend school and</p>
<p><a id="page_575" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>575</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">thus can be the equivalent of a school suspension. Moreover, even if exclusion is not equivalent to a suspension, some state and local laws and policies may create an entitlement to ride the bus. Thus, deprivation necessarily triggers due process. By this reasoning, a hearing would seem necessary. Yet, misbehavior on a bus poses more safety concerns than most any other type of behavior in which a student might engage. On this basis, a pre-suspension hearing seems unnecessarily burdensome. <i>See</i> Rose v. Nashua Bd. of Educ., 506 F. Supp. 1366 (D.N.H. 1981) (given the potential danger, “we are not persuaded that the risk of inherent error is such as to mandate a pre-suspension hearing”); E.W. v. Wake Cty. Bd. of Educ., 2010 WL 1286215, at *8-*9 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 16, 2010) (finding no procedural violation in the immediate removal from school bus without a hearing).</p>

<p class="h4a" id="ch228">f. Corporal Punishment</p>
<p class="indent">While most schools use one of the forgoing forms of punishment to discipline students, some continue to rely on corporal punishment. In fact, corporal punishment was once a primary method of discipline. The Court’s application of constitutional protections to suspensions suggested the Court might do the same with corporal punishment. Litigants reasoned that if the loss of a few days of school was sufficient to invoke due process protection, surely the imposition of physical pain and the loss of bodily integrity would warrant due process protection. Litigants also argued that corporal punishment was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and ought to be banned as a general matter. The Court took up both questions in <i>Ingraham v. Wright</i> just two years after <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>. As you read <i>Ingraham</i>, consider the various ways in which corporal punishment is distinct from suspension, asking yourself which is the more serious punishment, which has the most significant educational consequences, whether either serves a pedagogical purpose, and whether any of these differences warrant a different constitutional approach.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch229">Ingraham v. Wright</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>430 U.S. 651 (1977)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Mr. Justice Powell</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">This case presents questions concerning the use of corporal punishment in public schools: First, whether the paddling of students as a means of maintaining school discipline constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; and, second, to the extent that paddling is constitutionally permissible, whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">In addressing the scope of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment this Court has found it useful to refer to “[t]raditional common-law concepts,” and to the “attitude[s] which our society has</p>
<p><a id="page_576" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>576</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">traditionally taken.” So, too, in defining the requirements of procedural due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court has been attuned to what “has always been the law of the land” and to “traditional ideas of fair procedure.” We therefore begin by examining the way in which our traditions and our laws have responded to the use of corporal punishment in public schools.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of corporal punishment in this country as a means of disciplining school children dates back to the colonial period. Despite the general abandonment of corporal punishment as a means of punishing criminal offenders, the practice continues in the public education of school children in most parts of the country. [W]e can discern no trend toward its elimination.</p>
<p class="indent">[S]ince before the American Revolution[, the common law has provided that] [t]eachers may impose reasonable but not excessive force to discipline a child. The basic doctrine has not changed. The prevalent rule in this country today privileges such force as a teacher or administrator “reasonably believes to be necessary for (the child’s) proper control, training, or education.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §147(2) (1965). To the extent that the force is excessive or unreasonable, the educator in virtually all States is subject to possible civil and criminal liability.</p>
<p class="indent">Against this background of historical and contemporary approval of reasonable corporal punishment, we turn to the constitutional questions before us.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">An examination of the history of the Amendment and the decisions of this Court construing the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment confirms that it was designed to protect those convicted of crimes. Petitioners urge nonetheless that the prohibition should be extended to ban the paddling of schoolchildren, lest we afford greater protection to criminals than to schoolchildren. It would be anomalous, they say, if schoolchildren could be beaten without constitutional redress, while hardened criminals [cannot] under the Eighth Amendment. Whatever force this logic may have in other settings, we find it an inadequate basis for wrenching the Eighth Amendment from its historical context and extending it to public schools.</p>
<p class="indent">The prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration. The prisoner’s conviction entitles the State to classify him as a “criminal,” [deprive him of freedom and, at times, subject him to extreme treatment that borders on brutality. The Eighth Amendment serves as a check on the realistic prospect of “‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’” during incarceration. In contrast, schoolchildren have “little need for the protection of the Eighth Amendment.”] The public school remains an open institution. [T]he child is not physically restrained from leaving school during school hours; and at the end of the school day, the child is invariably free to return home. Even while at school, the child brings with him the support of family and friends and is rarely apart from teachers and other pupils who may witness and protest any instances of mistreatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which the Eighth</p>
<p><a id="page_577" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>577</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Amendment protects the prisoner. [T]hese safeguards are reinforced by the legal constraints of the common law. Public school teachers and administrators are privileged at common law to inflict only such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary; any punishment going beyond the privilege may result in both civil and criminal liability. As long as the schools are open to public scrutiny, there is no reason to believe that the common-law constraints will not effectively remedy and deter excesses such as those alleged in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">We conclude that when public school teachers or administrators impose disciplinary corporal punishment, the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable. The pertinent constitutional question is whether the imposition is consonant with the requirements of due process.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Due process is required only when a decision of the State implicates [a life, liberty or property] interest within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. And “to determine whether due process requirements apply in the first place, we must look not to the ‘weight’ but to the nature of the interest at stake.”</p>
<p class="indent">[Liberty interests] always have been thought to encompass freedom from bodily restraint and punishment. It is fundamental that the state cannot hold and physically punish an individual except in accordance with due process of law.</p>
<p class="indent">This constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake in this case. There is, of course a de minimis level of imposition with which the Constitution is not concerned. But at least where school authorities, acting under color of state law, deliberately decide to punish a child for misconduct by restraining the child and inflicting appreciable physical pain, we hold that Fourteenth Amendment liberty interests are implicated.</p>
<p class="indent">“[T]he question remains what process is due.” Were it not for the common-law privilege permitting teachers, to inflict reasonable corporal punishment on children in their care, and the availability of the traditional remedies for abuse, the case for requiring advance procedural safeguards would be strong indeed. But here we deal with a punishment paddling within that tradition, and the question is whether the common-law remedies are adequate to afford due process.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>[A]</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Under the common law, an invasion of personal security gave rise to a right to recover damages in a subsequent judicial proceeding. But the right of recovery was qualified by the concept of justification. Thus, there could be no recovery against a teacher who gave only “moderate correction” to a child. To the extent that the force used was reasonable in light of its purpose, it was not wrongful, but rather “justifiable or lawful.”</p>
<p class="indent">The concept that reasonable corporal punishment in school is justifiable continues to be recognized in the laws of most States. It represents “the balance struck by this country” between the child’s interest in personal security and the traditional view that some limited corporal punishment may be necessary. Under that longstanding accommodation of interests, there can be no</p>
<p><a id="page_578" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>578</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">deprivation of substantive rights as long as disciplinary corporal punishment is within the limits of the common-law privilege.</p>
<p class="indent">This is not to say that the child’s interest in procedural safeguards is insubstantial. The school disciplinary process is not “a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and never unfair….” Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 579-580 (1975). In any deliberate infliction of corporal punishment on a child who is restrained for that purpose, there is some risk that the intrusion on the child’s liberty will be unjustified and therefore unlawful. In these circumstances the child has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment and provide for the resolution of disputed questions of justification.</p>
<p class="indent">We turn now to a consideration of the safeguards that are available under applicable Florida law.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>[B]</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Under Florida law the teacher and principal of the school decide in the first instance whether corporal punishment is reasonably necessary under the circumstances in order to discipline a child who has misbehaved. But they must exercise prudence and restraint. For Florida has preserved the traditional judicial proceedings for determining whether the punishment was justified. If the punishment inflicted is later found to have been excessive not reasonably believed at the time to be necessary for the child’s discipline or training the school authorities inflicting it may be held liable in damages to the child and, if malice is shown, they may be subject to criminal penalties.</p>
<p class="indent">In those cases where severe punishment is contemplated, the available civil and criminal sanctions for abuse considered in light of the openness of the school environment afford significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment. Teachers and school authorities are unlikely to inflict corporal punishment unnecessarily or excessively when a possible consequence of doing so is the institution of civil or criminal proceedings against them.</p>
<p class="indent">It still may be argued, of course, that the child’s liberty interest would be better protected if the common-law remedies were supplemented by the administrative safeguards of prior notice and a hearing. We have found frequently that some kind of prior hearing is necessary to guard against arbitrary impositions on interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. But where the State has preserved what “has always been the law of the land,” the case for administrative safeguards is significantly less compelling.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>[C]</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">But even if the need for advance procedural safeguards were clear, the question would remain whether the incremental benefit could justify the cost. Acceptance of petitioners’ claims would work a transformation in the law governing corporal punishment in Florida and most other States. Given the impracticability of formulating a rule of procedural due process that varies with the severity of the particular imposition, the prior hearing petitioners seek would have to precede any paddling, however moderate or trivial.</p>
<p><a id="page_579" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>579</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Such a universal constitutional requirement would significantly burden the use of corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure. Hearings even informal hearings require time, personnel, and a diversion of attention from normal school pursuits. School authorities may well choose to abandon corporal punishment rather than incur the burdens of complying with the procedural requirements. Teachers, properly concerned with maintaining authority in the classroom, may well prefer to rely on other disciplinary measures which they may view as less effective rather than confront the possible disruption that prior notice and a hearing may entail.</p>
<p class="indent">“At some point the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected…and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 348. We think that point has been reached in this case. In view of the low incidence of abuse, the openness of our schools, and the common-law safeguards that already exist, the risk of error that may result in violation of a schoolchild’s substantive rights can only be regarded as minimal. Imposing additional administrative safeguards might reduce that risk marginally, but would also entail [significant burdens]. We conclude that the Due Process Clause does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in the public schools.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Does it make sense to say the Eighth Amendment protects criminals from cruel and unusual punishment but not students? How does the Court resolve any incongruence?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The point of the Eighth Amendment, in many instances, is to protect prisoners from certain excesses of the public. Do students need protection in some communities, or do benevolent societal approaches to children guard against societal excess?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Lower courts have held that substantive due process limits corporal punishment that is extremely severe. The standard in these cases is “‘whether the force applied caused injury so severe, was so disproportionate to the need presented, and was so inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.’” Garcia by Garcia v. Miera, 817 F.2d 650, 655 (10th Cir. 1987) (quoting Hall v. Tawney, 621 F.2d 607, 613 (4th Cir. 1980)). To meet this standard, a “plaintiff must demonstrate a degree of outrageousness and a magnitude of potential or actual harm that is truly conscience shocking.” Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567, 574 (10th Cir. 1995). This standard by implication means that these courts do not believe less severe corporal punishment implicates substantive due process.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Both <i>Goss</i> and <i>Ingraham</i> find a liberty interest that triggers due process protections, but the Court in <i>Ingraham</i> concludes that corporal punishment, unlike suspension or expulsion, does not require a hearing prior to imposing the punishment. Does the Court persuasively justify this inconsistency? Is a</p>
<p><a id="page_580" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>580</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">hearing prior to corporal punishment any more burdensome than a hearing prior to <i>suspension</i>? Is the risk of error any less with corporal punishment than with suspension?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The Court reasons that private civil remedies are sufficient to afford students adequate due process and protection against unjustified corporal punishment. The Court may be correct as to some students, but are there other students for whom civil remedies provide no protection?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Today, most jurisdictions have abolished corporal punishment at either the state or local level. For a listing of those jurisdictions banning and allowing corporal punishment, see <span class="smallcap">Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, Progress Towards Prohibiting All Corporal Punishment in North America</span> 3-5 (2011). The practice, however, remains common in many other communities. In fact, every state in the Southeast permits corporal punishment, and many schools there frequently impose it. Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas all paddled more than thirty thousand students in the 2006-2007 school year. In Mississippi, 7.5 percent of the student population was paddled each year. <span class="smallcap">Human Rights Watch, A Violent Education: Corporal Punishment of Children in U.S. Public Schools</span> 42-43 (2008).</p>
<p class="indent">7. Putting aside the educational effects, opponents of corporal punishment cite to its serious negative psychological, emotional, and physical effects. <i>Id</i>. at 50-59. Students have reported bruising of the buttocks and injuries to their hands when they attempted to defend themselves. <i>Id.</i> at 50-52. Studies also find that corporal punishment can lead to depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and antisocial behavior. <i>Id.</i> at 54-55.</p>
<p class="indent">8. The decision in <i>Ingraham</i> was 5-4, with Justices White, Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens dissenting. Given the societal changes discussed in the previous notes, if the issue of corporal punishment returned to the Court today, would it reach the same conclusion?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch230">4. <i>Academic Discipline and Dismissal</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Academic discipline and an academic judgment that a student has failed to meet an educational standard raise different issues than behavioral discipline. In particular, the assessment of whether a student has met an academic standard involves a qualitative judgment that is almost solely within the purview of educators. Moreover, academic discipline or judgments may not involve accusations and disputes over facts, but rather may come down to no more than a faculty member’s assessment of a student’s work. For these reasons, courts are very reluctant to intervene in, much less second-guess, academic decisions. Two Supreme Court cases dealing with students challenging academic decisions in higher education provide the defining standards in this area.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v. Horowitz</i>, 435 U.S. 78 (1978), the university dismissed a medical student for failing to meet its academic standards. During her final year of medical school, which consisted of clinical rotations, the school placed the student on academic probation based on her unsatisfactory performance the prior year. Like all other students, an</p>
<p><a id="page_581" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>581</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">external committee of doctors evaluated her work. The committee was dissatisfied with her performance and indicated that if she did not show progress she would not graduate. In an attempt to allow her to improve, the school permitted her to undergo further supervision and examination by practicing physicians. Only two of the seven physicians recommended her for graduation. Consequently, the original committee reaffirmed its position and ultimately recommended her dismissal, which the faculty and dean affirmed. She appealed to the provost, who also affirmed.</p>
<p class="indent">Consistent with <i>Goss</i>, the Court indicated that a student must be given “oral or written notice of the charges” and, if she denies them, an opportunity to respond. But the Court emphasized that due process is a flexible concept that varies based on context, and that academic matters differ significantly:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Academic evaluations of a student, in contrast to disciplinary determinations, bear little resemblance to the judicial and administrative fact-finding proceedings to which we have traditionally attached a full-hearing requirement. In <i>Goss</i>, the school’s decision to suspend the students rested on factual conclusions that the individual students had participated in demonstrations that had disrupted classes, attacked a police officer, or caused physical damage to school property. The requirement of a hearing, where the student could present his side of the factual issue, could under such circumstances “provide a meaningful hedge against erroneous action.” The decision to dismiss respondent, by comparison, rested on the academic judgment of school officials that she did not have the necessary clinical ability to perform adequately as a medical doctor and was making insufficient progress toward that goal. Such a judgment is by its nature more subjective and evaluative than the typical factual questions presented in the average disciplinary decision. Like the decision of an individual professor as to the proper grade for a student in his course, the determination whether to dismiss a student for academic reasons requires an expert evaluation of cumulative information and is not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Bd. of Curators of Univ. of Mo.</i>, 435 U.S. at 89-90.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking these factors into account, the Court found that Horowitz had “been awarded at least as much due process as the Fourteenth Amendment <i>requires</i>.” She had been given extensive notice of her deficiencies through committee reviews and faculty interaction, and she had been given a chance to respond to and remedy their concerns. <i>Id.</i> at 84-85. The Court did not specify the exact process required in the future, but indicated that academic dismissal requires “far less stringent procedural requirements” than disciplinary dismissal, and refused to “formalize the academic dismissal process by requiring a hearing.” <i>Id.</i> at 86, 89.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing</i>, 474 U.S. 214 (1985), the Court took a similar approach regarding a student placed on leave and eventually dismissed from medical school for poor grades. The school gave him the opportunity to appeal his dismissal to a review board and explain his problems, which he did, but the board affirmed his dismissal. The Court wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">When judges are asked to review the substance of a genuinely academic decision…, they should show great respect for the faculty’s professional judgment. Plainly, they may not override [the faculty’s decision] unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted</p>
<p><a id="page_582" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>582</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Ewing</i>, 474 U.S. at 225. As one commentator writes, “[w]ithout a finding that an administrator or faculty member failed to exercise professional judgment or acted arbitrarily and capriciously, courts presume the administrators and faculty members have acted within the bounds of their academic freedom, and, therefore, will grant the decision-makers academic deference.” Joseph M. Flanders, <i>Academic Student Dismissals at Public Institutions of Higher Education: When Is Academic Deference Not an Issue?</i>, 34 <span class="smallcap">J. Coll. &amp; Univ. L.</span> 19 (2007).</p>
<p class="indent">This precedent has relatively little import in elementary and secondary schools because, with the exception of certain competitive or specialized programs, they do not dismiss students for poor performance. Students have a right to attend school regardless of their performance. The relevance of <i>Horowitz</i> and <i>Ewing</i> is largely limited to issues of graduation, grade retention, grade promotion, and possibly access to particular courses. In these contexts, students face the same initial hurdle as <i>Horowitz</i> and <i>Ewing</i>. A refusal to promote a student, for instance, does not involve a denial of educational opportunity, and thus the property interest at stake is not obvious. Courts have generally indicated that students lack a property interest in promotion. Killion v. Burl, 860 F.2d 306 (8th Cir. 1988); Hartfield v. East Grand Rapids Pub. Schs., 960 F. Supp. 1259 (W.D. Mich. 1997); <i>see also</i> Sandlin v. Johnson, 643 F.2d 1027, 1029 (4th Cir. 1981) (refusing to review challenge to school decision to retain student); Obersteller for Obersteller v. Flour Bluff Indep. Sch. Dist., 874 F. Supp. 146 (S.D. Tex. 1994) (concluding that students also lack a property interest in the individual grades teachers award).</p>
<p class="indent">Courts have intimated, however, that there may be situations where a state statute or policy explicitly creates a property interest in specific courses, graduation, or promotion. As the Fifth Circuit wrote, “If, for example, plaintiff had alleged that she was gifted with extraordinary musical talents and that a Georgia statute or regulation required local school boards to provide special education for such gifted students, plaintiff might then be able to state a claim for relief on the basis that state officials had denied her an entitlement under state law.” Arundar v. DeKalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 620 F.2d 493, 494-495 (5th Cir. 1980). Graduation or receipt of a diploma may fall in this category as well. <i>See, e.g</i>., Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 403-444 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, even if a student has a property interest or the court assumes one for the purposes of analysis (which tends to be the case with promotion challenges), courts hold that a student is not entitled to a hearing of the sort involved with discipline. Rather, due process would be met by notice from the school that a student is not performing well and the opportunity to remedy one’s performance.</p>
<p class="indent">The primary check that due process places on academic decisions and discipline may be with regard to notice. In most cases, notice is irrelevant because students are well aware of the academic standards they must meet; their complaint is that they have actually met the standard or deserve another opportunity to meet it. But when students have not been apprised of the standards they must meet for major academic milestones or those standards change</p>
<p><a id="page_583" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>583</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">after students have begun their education, courts may be willing to intercede. Insofar as a property interest, such as a diploma, is affected, <i>Debra P.</i> held that schools must provide students advance notice of academic graduation standards and time to adjust to significant changes in the standards. <i>Id.</i> at 404 (holding that imposing a new graduation requirement on students in their final year of high school violated due process); <i>see also id.</i> (holding students accountable for material not taught violates the fundamental fairness required by due process).</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch231">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">John is a senior at Hammond, a public high school. When he arrived at school on March 1, Mr. Smith, a teacher, believed he smelled alcohol on his breath and confronted John. John denied having alcohol in his system. Mr. Smith sent John to the principal’s office. The principal believed he smelled alcohol as well. John denied having drunk any and asserted the smell might be from his mouthwash or aftershave. The principal suspended John for five days.</p>
<p class="indent">The school’s discipline code states that for each day that a student is absent from a class due to suspension, his or her semester grade will be reduced by 2 percent. Per this rule, John’s grades were reduced by a total of 10 percent. This grade loss will make it impossible for John to graduate with honors, which he probably would have done otherwise. John appealed his suspension to the school board, which refused to offer him an in-person discussion but allowed him to submit a written appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">In the appeal, John argued (1) that he should not have been suspended without a further investigation into the allegations; and (2) that he missed no graded assignments during his five-day suspension and that the work he has submitted in his class warrants a higher grade than what he will now receive under the school’s policy. In a written letter, the board rejected the first argument, indicating the principal had a reasonable basis for suspending him. The board refused to entertain the second argument, indicating that the grade reduction policy applied without exception.</p>
<p class="indent">Did the school owe John any due process prior to or after suspending him and, if so, was the process afforded constitutionally adequate? Is his grade reduction a constitutionally permissible punishment? What if his grades were lowered to a point that he does not graduate? Would he be entitled to any particular due process in either instance?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch232">B. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS</p>
<p class="noindent">This chapter has, thus far, developed the law of procedural due process. Procedural due process addresses the issue of what process a school must follow before punishing a student. It protects the right to procedures designed to deliver notice and a chance to respond. Procedural due process, however, is neutral as to</p>
<p><a id="page_584" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>584</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the final outcome so long as those processes are followed. Thus, procedural due process does not question whether a particular punishment is appropriate or whether a school has the authority to punish a student in a particular manner. Students seeking protection from overly harsh discipline must assert other claims.</p>
<p class="indent">Substantive due process offers some hedge against disciplinary outcomes. Certain punishments are simply so irrational in relation to the underlying infraction that substantive due process prohibits schools from subjecting a student to them, regardless of the amount of notice and opportunity the school afforded a student. Imagine, for instance, that a student violated a school rule against cursing, and the punishment was that the student must stand in the front of the classroom for five minutes while the rest of the class taunted the student with names and paper wads. Or imagine that the punishment was a one-year expulsion. Even if the district held a formal hearing and established beyond a shadow of a doubt that the student had cursed, the ten minutes of taunting would likely violate substantive due process because the punishment subjects the student to humiliation that bears no rational relationship to the underlying offense. A one-year suspension might violate due process for a different reason: its severity is wildly out of proportion to the underlying offense.</p>
<p class="indent">Hopefully, wild punishments of these sorts are unusual. Regardless, substantive due process has taken on added importance in recent years due to “zero-tolerance policies.” Pursuant to these policies, administrators automatically suspend and expel students for long periods of time for infractions such as alcohol and drug possession, weapons, and fighting. These policies, however, sometimes have broader applicability and extend to less serious behavior like disrespect or bringing so-called weapons and drugs like fingernail clippers and Tylenol to school. The following cases address whether examples of this sort raise substantive due process claims.</p>

<p class="indent">[On October 30, a friend of Seal’s named Ray Pritchert started carrying around a hunting knife after his involvement in an out-of-school dispute. The next day, Seal, Pritchert, and David Richardson drove Seal’s car to Seal’s girlfriend’s house. Pritchert had the knife with him and placed it on the backseat</p>
<p><a id="page_585" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>585</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">floorboard. While Seal went into his girlfriend’s house, Richardson placed the knife in the car’s glove compartment.</p>
<p class="indent">The next day, Seal drove his girlfriend and Pritchert to their high school. Inside the school, the band director asked if Pritchert and Seal had been drinking. Pritchert said that they had not. A subsequent consensual search of the car by the vice-principal ensued. The search did not turn up alcohol, but it did turn up “two cigarettes in a crumpled pack in the back of the car, a bottle of amoxicillin pills (an antibiotic for which Seal had a prescription), and Pritchert’s knife in the glove compartment.” The vice-principal then took Seal to the office and directed him to write out a statement that explained why the knife was in the car. At the vice-principal’s behest, Seal wrote “‘Went to Roach’s office because he thought or had been told that we had a flask and had been drinking, so we went and Mr. Mashburn searched the car. He found a knife and 2 cigs. The knife was there because Ray’s ex-girlfriend’s boyfriend had been following us around with a few of his friends so we were a little uneasy.’” A disciplinary hearing before the high school’s principal followed. The principal took no action against Seal for the cigarettes or pills, but “she suspended Seal pending expulsion for possession of a knife.”</p>
<p class="indent">A second hearing took place before the school board’s hearing authority officer. The testimony of three witnesses at the hearing established that Seal knew Pritchert had the knife on his person on October 31, but that Seal did not know the knife was in his car the next day when the principal found it. Nonetheless, the hearing officer upheld the suspension pending expulsion by the board, reasoning that the knife was in his car while on school property and “[p]ossession of a weapon on school property is a violation of Knox County Policy.”</p>
<p class="indent">In a third hearing before the board, “Seal was represented by counsel, who forcefully argued that Seal had no idea that the knife was in [the] car.” In response to questioning by the board, Seal admitted he knew Pritchert had the knife on him the previous day, but stated he thought Pritchert had taken it with him and that he had never seen the knife in the car. A member of the board then stated the board had to send clear messages to students about weapons, and that students have to be responsible for what is in their cars. The board then voted unanimously to uphold the recommendation to expel Seal.]</p>
<p class="indent">Knox County Board of Education policy provides that students may not “possess, handle, transmit, use or attempt to use any dangerous weapon [including knives] in school buildings or on school grounds at any time” and that students who are found to have violated the policy “shall be subject to suspension and/or expulsion of not less than one…year.” The policy also provides that the Superintendent “shall have the authority to modify this suspension requirement on a case-by-case basis,” although Superintendent Morgan has argued that it is “not clear” whether he has the power to modify a suspension or expulsion once it has been finally approved by the Board.</p>
<p class="h6b"><span class="smallcap">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="indent">Due process has two components. The first [is] procedural due process (often summarized as “notice and an opportunity to be heard”). [Seal] does not really</p>
<p><a id="page_586" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>586</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">argue that the Board used unfair procedures before expelling him. Rather, his complaint is with the substantive result—the ultimate decision to expel him. His argument is thus one of substantive due process, the other component of due process. In essence, Seal argues that the Board’s ultimate decision was irrational in light of the facts uncovered by the procedures afforded him.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he right to attend public school is not a fundamental right for the purposes of due process analysis. Government actions that do not affect fundamental rights or liberty interests and do not involve suspect classifications will be upheld if it they are rationally related to a legitimate state interest. In the context of school discipline, a substantive due process claim will succeed only in the “rare case” when there is “no ‘rational relationship between the punishment and the offense.’” <i>Rosa R. v. Connelly</i>, 889 F.2d 435, 439 (2d Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="indent">That said, suspending or expelling a student for weapons possession, even if the student did not knowingly possess any weapon, would not be rationally related to any legitimate state interest. No student can use a weapon to injure another person, to disrupt school operations, or, for that matter, any other purpose if the student is totally unaware of its presence. Indeed, the entire concept of possession—in the sense of possession for which the state can legitimately prescribe and mete out punishment—ordinarily implies knowing or conscious possession.</p>
<p class="indent">We would have thought this principle so obvious that it would go without saying. The Board, however, devotes a great deal of the discussion in its briefs to arguing that “scienter” is not required by its “Zero Tolerance Policy,” and that the criminal law requirement that possession of a forbidden object be knowing or conscious possession is a “technicality” that should not be “transported into school suspension cases.” Frankly, we find it difficult to understand how one can argue that the requirement of conscious possession is a “technicality.”</p>
<p class="indent">We asked counsel at oral argument whether the Board was seriously arguing that it could expel a student for unconsciously possessing a dangerous weapon, posing a hypothetical example involving a high-school valedictorian who has a knife planted in his backpack without his knowledge by a vindictive student. The question was whether the valedictorian would still be subject to mandatory expulsion under the Board’s Zero Tolerance Policy, even if the school administrators and the Board members uniformly believed the valedictorian’s explanation that the knife had been planted. Counsel for the Board answered yes. After all, counsel argued, the Board’s policy requires “Zero Tolerance,” and the policy does not explicitly <i>say</i> that the student must know he is carrying a weapon. Only after the Board’s counsel sensed—correctly—that this answer was very difficult to accept did counsel backtrack, suggesting that perhaps an exception could be made for our unfortunate hypothetical valedictorian. We find it impossible to take this suggestion seriously, however, and not simply because counsel had just finished arguing the opposite. The suggestion is totally inconsistent with the Board’s position in this case, which is that the Zero Tolerance Policy uniformly requires expulsion whenever its terms are violated.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to the Board’s assertion, the criminal law requirement that possession of contraband must be conscious or knowing is neither arcane nor unsettled[, and the cases upon which the Board relies do not establish the principles</p>
<p><a id="page_587" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>587</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">for which it forwards them. At best, the cases establish] that the government would not need to prove that the defendant knew he was violating the law, or that the weapon possessed the attributes that make it a specific type of weapon—an assault weapon or machine gun, for example—that is likely the subject of heavy regulation or prohibition. But nothing in [the cases the Board cites] even remotely suggests that a defendant can be convicted for the unknowing possession of an item that is later revealed to be a statutory “assault weapon” or “machine gun.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Board is, of course, correct when it observes that this is not a criminal case, and that its decision to expel Seal is not vulnerable to a substantive due process attack unless it is irrational. We believe, however, that the Board’s Zero Tolerance Policy would surely be irrational if it subjects to punishment students who did not knowingly or consciously possess a weapon. The hypothetical case involving the planted knife is but one illustration of why.</p>
<p class="indent">A student who knowingly possesses a weapon and is caught with it can, of course, be lying when he or she claims not to have known of its existence. Simply because a student may lie about what he knew, however, does not mean that it is unnecessary to address the question of what he knew before meting out punishment. The Board, for its part, freely concedes that “the record does not reflect what the Board did or did not consider with respect to [Seal’s] knowledge,” [and the] Board’s attorney has insisted that Seal’s knowledge was completely irrelevant, and that the Board’s Zero Tolerance Policy required Seal’s expulsion regardless of whether he knew the knife was in his car. At the Board meeting during which the Board voted to expel Seal, Board Member Sam Anderson, who as far can be determined from the record is the only person having anything to do with the decision to expel Seal who even considered the question of what Seal did or did not know, suggested that it would send a “confusing message” to do anything besides expel Seal, regardless of whether Seal had any idea that the knife was in his car. Then again, he also apparently thought that Seal could have been expelled just as easily for having a prescription antibiotic in his car.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on the evidence of record, it appears that nothing that Seal could have said at any of [his] hearings would have made one bit of difference. Because there was no dispute that the knife was in Seal’s car when on school property, the Board insists that it was required under its Zero Tolerance Policy to expel Seal, whether or not he had any idea that the knife was in his car. We are prepared to take the Board at its word.</p>
<p class="indent">A school board can, of course, disbelieve the student’s explanation and conclude that the student knowingly violated school policies. If that occurs, due process would be satisfied as long as the procedures afforded the student were constitutionally adequate and the conclusion was rational. The Board argues that the district court “erred by substituting its own view of the facts for that of the Hearing Officer and the Board of Education.” Again, this begs the question—which nothing in the record answers—of what the views of the hearing officer and the Board were. Did the Board expel him because it disbelieved Seal’s explanation, did it expel him despite believing his explanation completely, or did it expel him without deciding the issue, in the belief that Seal’s knowledge was simply irrelevant to the decision? Of these possibilities,</p>
<p><a id="page_588" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>588</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the first one would have been permissible if rationally supported by the record, but the other two would not have been.</p>
<p class="indent">It may be correct, as the Board argues, that as a matter of “state law, case law or its own rules,” the Board is not required to make formal findings of fact in expulsion cases. As a matter of federal constitutional law, however, the Board may not expel students from school arbitrarily or irrationally. To accept the Board’s argument would be to allow it to effectively insulate itself even from rational basis review, as long as the decision the Board reached <i>might</i> have been rational. What is at issue in the present case, however, is not whether the Board <i>could</i> have made a decision that would have been rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, but whether it actually did so.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that we must defer to the Board’s rational decisions in school discipline cases does not mean that we must, or should, rationalize away its irrational decisions. And when it is not clear that the Board’s decision was rational, because it is impossible to conscientiously determine from the record what the Board’s actual decision was, then the Board, as well as other school boards with similar “Zero Tolerance” policies, should not be entitled to summary judgment in civil rights actions arising from their decisions to impose long-term suspensions and expulsions.</p>
<p class="indent">On the basis of the record presented, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Seal was expelled for a reason that would have to be considered irrational. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly denied the Board’s motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">[W]e cannot accept the Board’s argument that because safety is important, and because it is often difficult to determine a student’s state of mind, that it need not make any attempt to ascertain whether a student accused of carrying a weapon knew that he was in possession of the weapon before expelling him.</p>
<p class="indent">The decision to expel a student from school is a weighty one, carrying with it serious consequences for the student. We understand full well that the decision not to expel a potentially dangerous student also carries very serious potential consequences for other students and teachers. Nevertheless, the Board may not absolve itself of its obligation, legal and moral, to determine whether students intentionally committed the acts for which their expulsions are sought by hiding behind a Zero Tolerance Policy that purports to make the students’ knowledge a non-issue. We are also not impressed by the Board’s argument that if it did not apply its Zero Tolerance Policy ruthlessly, and without regard for whether students accused of possessing a forbidden object knowingly possessed the object, this would send an inconsistent message to its students. Consistency is not a substitute for rationality.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What is the standard a student must meet to establish that his punishment violates substantive due process?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How are schools to ascertain the truth in situations such as this without exerting an enormous amount of effort? Given the limited tools at their disposal,</p>
<p><a id="page_589" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>589</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">can schools assess subjective intent any more reliably than courts? If not, is reading a scienter element into the disciplinary code problematic?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The weakness in the board’s argument, on appeal, is that it does not indicate it thought Seal was lying. Thus, the board implies it may have believed him. The court indicates that the board would have been free to discipline him had he asserted his innocence, but the board disbelieved him, so long as that conclusion was rational. Because there is no clear explanation of the thoughts of the principal and hearing officer on Seal’s credibility, it is possible that they did not fully believe his story. Should the court have been more deferential to the administration and board and given them the benefit of the doubt? If it had, what set of facts would be necessary to show a substantive due process violation?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Seal admits that he knew Pritchert had been carrying a knife and indicates he did not see the knife in the car on the day in question, but is Seal’s explanation of the facts sufficiently vague that maybe Seal did have reason to know that the knife was in the car? With whom should the burden of proof rest on such issues? Would there have been sufficient evidence to disbelieve him? On a set of facts analogous to <i>Seal</i>, the Tenth Circuit upheld a student’s suspension. The student denied knowledge of a weapon, but the court reasoned:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Contrary to the Butlers’ allegations and the district court’s decision, the School in this case did not suspend Mr. Butler for “unknowingly” bringing a knife onto school property. Although the hearing officer initially found only that Mr. Butler possessed weapons on school property in violation of school policy, the school board later concluded “[Mr.] Butler should have known, as the driver of the vehicle, that he was in possession of and transporting a weapon onto school grounds.” This was because “the knife was in plain view and readily identifiable as a knife to persons standing outside the vehicle looking in.” The board also concluded “[Mr.] Butler knew, or should have known that he was responsible for the vehicle he brought onto school property and the contents thereof.”</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Butler v. Rio Rancho Pub. Schs. Bd. of Educ., 341 F.3d 1197, 1201 (10th Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="indent">5. The board’s motivation here appears to be its desire to draw a line in the sand regarding drugs and weapons, and its fear that the board will have difficulty maintaining that line if it is flexible in any way or inquires into intent. Would such a motivation be well founded? Rather than asserting that intent is irrelevant, could a district instead indicate that it will make the reasonable presumption of intent based on possession? Would this policy be rational? Could the school have disciplined Seal under such a policy without violating substantive due process, notwithstanding an assertion of innocent intent? Could a school discipline a student under this policy when a student alleged that the weapon must have been intentionally planted on him?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Courts, including <i>Seal</i>, routinely emphasize that overturning school discipline based on substantive due process occurs only “in a rare case where there was no ‘rational relationship between the punishment and the offense.’” Brewer v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 779 F.2d 260, 264 (5th Cir. 1985). Thus, many courts tend to diverge from <i>Seal</i>’s approach to zero-tolerance policies and the level of scrutiny it applied to the district. For instance, in <i>Butler</i>, the court refused to even address the question of whether intent is required because it</p>
<p><a id="page_590" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>590</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">found that intent existed based on possession. 341 F.3d at 1201. A Texas district court went even further and explicitly rejected the court’s rationale in <i>Seal</i> and held that intent is not a necessary element in prohibitions on possession. Bundick v. Bay City Indep. Sch. Dist., 140 F. Supp. 2d 735, 740 (S.D. Tex. 2001).</p>
<p class="indent">7. In <i>Wood v. Strickland</i>, 420 U.S. 308 (1975), the Supreme Court described the role of a federal court in assessing a substantive due process challenge as a limited one, writing:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">It is not the role of the federal courts to set aside decisions of school administrators which the court may view as lacking a basis in wisdom or compassion. Public high school students do have substantive and procedural rights while at school.…But §1983 does not extend the right to relitigate in federal court evidentiary questions arising in school disciplinary proceedings or the proper construction of school regulations. The system of public education that has evolved in this Nation relies necessarily upon the discretion and judgment of school administrators and school board members and §1983 was not intended to be a vehicle for federal court correction of errors in the exercise of that discretion which do not rise to the level of violations of specific constitutional guarantees.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Id.</i> at 326. Did the court in <i>Seal</i> cross this line?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The opinion in <i>Seal</i> addressed the unusual situation where the student may not have knowingly done anything wrong. <i>Seal</i> did not address the situation where a student has knowingly engaged in misconduct and the school seemingly overreacts with an extremely harsh punishment. While the deferential standard requiring a rational relationship between the infraction and punishment governs all substantive due process claims for discipline, it would seem to apply differently to claims of overly harsh discipline as opposed to claims of innocence. The claim of innocence might warrant close analysis of facts at times, whereas claims of overly harsh discipline might not.</p>
<p class="indent">Some courts, including those rejecting <i>Seal</i>, may miss or reject such a distinction, focusing instead on deference to schools and overstating the general principle that only punishments that “shock the conscience” violate substantive due process. As a general principle, suspending a student for one day is not so harsh that it would shock the conscience regardless of how minor the infraction a student committed. But if a student is suspended for a single day for something he or she clearly did not do, that punishment would bear absolutely no rational relationship to the student’s conduct or any legitimate interest of the school and, on that basis, ought to shock the conscience, even though the punishment itself is minor. Thus, the fact that a punishment might be minor should not end the analysis if the student asserts innocence or raises a factual anomaly related to innocence.</p>
<p class="indent">If, however, a student admits to violating a school policy and his claim is that the punishment is too harsh, substantive due process would limit only the most egregious instances of discipline. Various advocates and victims assert that zero-tolerance policies fall into this category when schools impose extreme punishments like expulsion for possession of so-called weapons like fingernail</p>
<p><a id="page_591" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>591</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">clippers or letter openers, or when schools impose automatic punishments with no consideration of the individual facts or student. The level at which one approaches the issue of zero tolerance is likely to dictate whether one deems punishments pursuant to zero tolerance as irrational. Taken from the perspective of an individual student and set of facts, some punishments pursuant to zero tolerance are irrationally severe, such as suspending a kindergarten student for making a threatening statement as part of his role-playing of cops and robbers during recess. <i>See, e.g.</i>, S.G. <i>ex rel.</i> A.G. v. Sayreville Bd. of Educ., 333 F.3d 417 (3d Cir. 2003). Yet, from the perspective of the school, it is entirely rational to say all threats will be sanctioned with suspension and, if something amounts to a threat, there is no need for further inquiry. Of course, some would respond that the role-playing statements of a kindergartner should not be deemed real threats, but can one say that a school is legally irrational for treating them as such?</p>
<p class="indent">Relying on the Supreme Court’s statement in <i>Wood</i> that it is not the role of courts to substitute their judgments for the schools’ as to appropriate punishments, courts routinely have upheld extreme discipline for what was arguably innocent or relatively minor behavior. <i>S.G.</i>, 333 F.3d at 425 (upholding three-day suspension of kindergarten student who stated “I’m going to shoot you” in the context of playing cops and robbers on the playground); Piekosz-Murphy v. Bd. of Educ. of Cmty. High Sch. Dist. No. 230, 858 F. Supp. 2d 952 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (upholding discipline of student who was present at an off-campus party where alcohol was present, but which he did not consume); Vann <i>ex rel.</i> Vann v. Stewart, 445 F. Supp. 2d 882 (E.D. Tenn. 2006) (upholding one-year suspension for possession of pocket knife). When students have received particularly harsh punishment in comparison to other students who previously engaged in similar conduct, courts have still upheld the punishment, finding that the current punishment is rationally related to the infraction regardless of how other students have been treated. Smith <i>ex rel.</i> Smith v. Severn, 129 F.3d 419, 429 (7th Cir. 1997); <i>Vann</i>, 445 F. Supp. 2d at 882. The only exception would be if the student could show intentional discrimination. Heyne v. Metro. Nashville Pub. Schs., 655 F.3d 556 (6th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch234">Ratner v. Loudoun County Public Schools</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>16 F. App’x 140 (4th Cir. 2001)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Per Curium</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">In October 1999, Benjamin Ratner, age 13, was in the eighth grade at Blue Ridge Middle School in Loudoun County, Virginia. On October 8, 1999, a schoolmate told Ratner that she had been suicidal the previous evening and had contemplated killing herself by slitting her wrists. She also told Ratner that she inadvertently had brought a knife to school in her binder that morning. Ratner had known her for two years, was aware of her previous suicide attempts, and feared for her safety. Thus, he took the binder from her and put it in his locker. He did not tell school authorities about the knife, but he intended to tell</p>
<p><a id="page_592" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>592</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">both his and her parents after school. By lunchtime that day, Roberta Griffith, Assistant Principal at the school, had learned that the girl might have given a knife to Ratner.</p>
<p class="indent">Eventually, Fanny Kellogg, Dean at the school, summoned Ratner to her office and asked him about the knife. Ratner admitted that he had it, and at Kellogg’s direction he went alone to his locker, retrieved the binder, and gave it to Kellogg. Kellogg acknowledged that she believed Ratner acted in what he saw as the girl’s best interest and that at no time did Ratner pose a threat to harm anyone with the knife.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, Ratner was then suspended by Griffith for 10 days for possessing a knife on school grounds in violation of school board policy. [Shortly thereafter, the school district held a hearing and, on the recommendation of the superintendent, suspended Ratner for the remainder of the school term.] Ratner filed suit[, asserting] that his suspension under what is called a zero tolerance policy<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note30" id="Rnote30" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> amounted to violations of Ratner’s Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection and his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court dismissed Ratner’s complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In its memorandum opinion, the district court concluded Ratner’s claim was, in essence, a claim of due process violations. The district court also concluded, correctly, that the school officials gave Ratner constitutionally sufficient, even if imperfect, process in the various notices and hearings it accorded him, and we agree.</p>
<p class="indent">However harsh the result in this case, the federal courts are not properly called upon to judge the wisdom of a zero tolerance policy of the sort alleged to be in place at Blue Ridge Middle School or of its application to Ratner. Instead, our inquiry here is limited to whether Ratner’s complaint alleges sufficient facts which if proved would show that the implementation of the school’s policy in this case failed to comport with the United States Constitution. We conclude that the facts alleged in this case do not so demonstrate.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Hamilton</span>, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>
<p class="indent">I write separately to express my compassion for Ratner, his family, and common sense. Each is the victim of good intentions run amuck. Ratner’s complaint alleges that school suspensions for possession of a weapon on Loudoun County school property are imposed automatically, pursuant to a zero-tolerance policy that precludes consideration of the facts and circumstances of a particular student’s conduct in determining a violation of stated policy and the resulting student punishment. There is no doubt that this zero-tolerance/automatic</p>
<p><a id="page_593" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>593</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">suspension policy, and others like it adopted by school officials throughout our nation, were adopted in large response to the tragic school shootings that have plagued our nation’s schools over the past several years. Also, no doubt exists that in adopting these zero-tolerance/automatic suspension policies, school officials had the noble intention of protecting the health and safety of our nation’s school children and those adults charged with the profound responsibility of educating them. However, as the oft repeated old English maxim recognizes, “the road to hell is paved with good intentions.” The panic over school violence and the intent to stop it has caused school officials to jettison the common sense idea that a person’s punishment should fit his crime in favor of a single harsh punishment, namely, mandatory school suspension. Such a policy has stripped away judgment and discretion on the part of those administering it; refuting the well-established precept that judgment is the better part of wisdom.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, a young man, Ratner, took a binder containing a knife from a suicidal fellow student in an effort to save her life. He put the binder in his locker without even opening it. Indeed, at all times, Ratner never saw the knife. Further, the facts do not offer even the hint of a suggestion that Ratner ever intended to personally possess the knife or harm anyone with it. In fact, the first school official on the scene reported that at no time did Ratner intend to harm anyone with the knife. Yet, based on the school’s zero-tolerance/automatic suspension policy, Ratner was suspended from school for nearly four months.</p>
<p class="indent">School officials should, without doubt, punish a student for knowingly and intentionally bringing a dangerous weapon on school property. But the question raised by the facts of Ratner’s case is one of degree and the law must be flexible enough so that school officials may intrude upon the right to a free appropriate public education <i>only</i> in the most justifiable circumstances. Under a facts/circumstances-sensitive examination of this case, Ratner’s nearly four-month suspension from middle school is not justifiable. Indeed, it is a calculated overkill when the punishment is considered in light of Ratner’s good-faith intentions and his, at best, if at all, technical violation of the school’s policy. Suffice it to say that the degree of Ratner’s violation of school policy does not correlate with the degree of his punishment. Certainly, the oft repeated maxim, “there is no justice without mercy” has been defiled by the results obtained here. But alas, as the opinion for the court explains, this is not a federal constitutional problem.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. While there is some ambiguity regarding whether Ratner explicitly alleged a substantive due process violation or only a procedural due process, the Fourth Circuit intuited a substantive due process challenge to his suspension, but rejected his claim on the basis that it could not “judge the wisdom of a zero tolerance policy” or “its application” to Ratner. Can <i>Ratner</i> be reconciled with <i>Seal</i>? If not, which approach is correct? As a matter of lower court precedent, the notes following <i>Seal</i> would indicate that <i>Seal</i>, rather than <i>Ratner</i>, is the outlier. For more on the argument that the <i>Ratner</i> approach misreads the</p>

<p class="indent">2. Do the Loudon Schools have a legitimate interest in suspending Ratner for the remainder of the school term? Is his exclusion rationally related to achieving that interest? In other words, to what extent does his exclusion further a legitimate goal of the school?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If Ratner’s punishment does not fit the crime, is not justifiable, and amounts to calculated overkill—as Judge Hamilton states—why does Judge Hamilton conclude that it is not prohibited by the Constitution? Should the Constitution be this deferential in requiring schools to justify suspensions and expulsions or did the Fourth Circuit abdicate its judicial role in this case? If courts do not engage in any more substantive scrutiny than this, does the Constitution actually protect against irrational and unjustified exclusions?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Two paragraphs of procedure and a few citations were deleted in the above printed version of the case, but otherwise, this reprint represents the entirety of the analysis devoted to the issues. The district court provided a similarly sparse explanation of its rationale for dismissing the case. One scholar argues that a major flaw in cases like <i>Ratner</i> is that courts do not give the constitutional issues serious consideration and falsely assume, without actually going through the analysis, that school exclusions pass substantive due process scrutiny.

He further argues that “certain processes, principles, and considerations are so inherent in due process that schools cannot legitimately levy punishment without them, even if doing so might have some administrative benefit for schools.” <i>Id</i>. at 829. He cites a long line of general due process cases outside the context of schools that have required the consideration of particular facts so as to ensure a fair and individualized approach to punishment. Based on that precedent, he argues that discipline policies that ignore significant distinctions between students—such as their intent, culpability, and the harm their behavior poses—is irrational. <i>Id</i>. at 866-900. For instance, it would be irrational to punish a student who accidentally brought a cough drop to school as harshly as one who sold marijuana at school. Do you agree that discipline policies that ignore these factors are irrational or fail to further a legitimate government interest?</p>

<p class="h5a"><i>81 Wash. U. L.Q. 65 (2003)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Expulsions and suspensions were once imposed only for either the most serious offenses or repeat offenders. The new zero tolerance policy imposes expulsion or suspension for a wide range of other conduct that previously would have been dealt with through after-school detentions, withdrawal of privileges, counseling, mediation, and other methods. By making removal from school a mandatory sanction in all these cases, zero tolerance renders</p>
<p><a id="page_595" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>595</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school personnel helpless to craft that response most suited to the situation and also narrows the disciplinary inquiry to the single issue of whether the student committed the infraction. Off the table are such significant factors as why the student committed the offense, whether it was intentional, whether the student has a prior history of infractions or achievements, and the student’s personal circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial impetus for mandatory expulsions and suspensions came from Congress, which in 1994 enacted the Gun Free Schools Act. This law conditions federal aid on a state’s adoption of two zero tolerance regulations, one mandating a one-year expulsion for students who bring certain kinds of weapons to school and another requiring referral of these students to law enforcement. Soon after passage, all fifty states enacted the required zero tolerance policies, but a large majority of states chose to go further by requiring the expulsion of students who commit drug, alcohol, and other school infractions, as well. According to one study, by 1998, 79% of public schools had zero tolerance policies for tobacco, 87% for alcohol, and 88% for drugs. Such policies can produce highly disproportionate and destructive punishments, such as the two-year expulsion applied to a first offender caught with marijuana in a Milwaukee school. Some states also require suspension or expulsion for infractions committed off school grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">The consequence of these mandatory sanctions is that, although school crime rates have remained roughly stable for the last two decades, the use of suspension has almost doubled. More than 3.1 million students were suspended (about half for a substantial period) and 87,000 students expelled during the 1998 school year. Whether these students continued to receive some form of education depended on geography: twenty-six states require school districts to provide alternative schools for these students, but eighteen states give individual school districts discretion to determine whether to provide alternative education, and many of these offer no educational program at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Zero tolerance regimes typically ignore the most basic of distinctions among offenses: how dangerous was it? Minor incidents that would have been handled quickly and informally by school officials are now the subject of disciplinary hearings and even reports to the district attorney for prosecution. In many schools, zero tolerance sanctions are applied equally against weapons and alcohol offenses, drug sale and possession offenses, and assault and disorderly offenses. They also may apply against such infractions as tardiness, disrespect, and defiance, which, in addition to increasing the numbers, allow bias to creep into the decision to discipline. It is estimated that the vast majority of expulsions and suspensions are imposed for noncriminal, nonviolent minor offenses, such as smoking cigarettes and truancy. The rest range from minor to trivial, and according to media reports include such infractions as possession of such “weapons” as key chains, staplers, and geometry compasses; and such “drugs” as lemon drops, asthma inhalers, Midol, and Advil.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">The Rationale and Reality of Zero Tolerance Regimes</span></p>
<p class="indent">Zero tolerance in public education constitutes a form of triage: it attempts to protect and better educate one group of children by identifying and excising</p>
<p><a id="page_596" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>596</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">another. The latter children may be viewed as “superpredators,” delinquents, or merely potential troublemakers, but in any event they are regarded as more dangerous, more hopeless, and more dispensible than their counterparts were a decade ago. The new disciplinary approach therefore largely eschews educational and rehabilitative measures for these students. They are instead to be handled and defused through the incapacitative and deterrent effects of suspensions, expulsions, and referrals to the criminal system.</p>
<p class="indent">We have noted that today’s students are in fact no more violent than in prior decades, and there is good reason to doubt that they are any more incorrigible than their predecessors. Even so, weapons, drug abuse, and violence to any degree threaten both the safety and well-being of students, and disruptions in class undermine the learning process. The salient policy question about zero tolerance is whether it provides an effective method for dealing with these problems.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Deterrence</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In an ideal world, zero tolerance policies would constitute so powerful and efficient a deterrent that almost all students would be well behaved, and very few would suffer sanctions or the destructive consequences of educational deprivation. Of course, this has not happened; the number of suspensions and expulsions has skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="indent">It is more difficult to say whether zero tolerance policies are serving as a deterrent to some degree by making rules violations too costly for some students. Government statistics report that juvenile violent crime did fall in the 1990s, but this reduction occurred both on and off school grounds. In high schools, the number of students threatened or injured with a weapon on school property remained constant from 1993 to 1999, during which time zero tolerance policies were widely adopted in the wake of the 1994 federal zero tolerance weapons requirement.</p>
<p class="indent">What these figures prove is unclear because of our inability to control for extraneous factors. Those experts who have attempted to isolate the impact of zero tolerance discipline have found little evidence that these sanctions are substantially influencing student behavior. One reason may be that, although the expulsion sanction is severe, the likelihood of its application to any individual violator is quite low: except for highly visible infractions like fighting in class, few violators are caught. Two scholars who have written widely on the issue report that schools substantially relying on zero tolerance policies “continue to be less safe than schools that implement fewer components of zero tolerance.”</p>
<p class="indent">However, a conception of deterrence that encompasses only the “scare” factor associated with tough sanctions may be too crude to capture the full impact zero tolerance could have on student behavior over a longer period. Arguably, zero tolerance might also exert a slower and more subtle influence by incrementally increasing the reputational and social costs (and not simply the punitive consequences) of troublemaking.</p>
<p class="indent">The hope is that by drawing a clear line, giving no quarter to disruption or disrespect, and setting high expectations, schools will instill the obedient and</p>
<p><a id="page_597" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>597</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">cooperative values of a former era. It is undoubtedly true that how a public school responds to infractions by its students conveys messages that influence student norms and culture. We believe, however, that the messages are more varied and complicated. Consider mandatory expulsions for drug use as an example. We cannot assume, as [zero tolerance] theorists do, that official intolerance of disorder necessarily engenders peer intolerance, so that using drugs becomes repugnant rather than “cool”—as thirty years of a zero tolerance drug policy at the national level, and before that prohibition, have demonstrated. A zero tolerance policy for all drug violations is more likely to have disparate and varied effects: for some students, zero tolerance will help mitigate peer pressure by affording them an acceptable excuse to wield against classmates offering drugs, while others may be driven to identify with an “outlaw” culture. Some students may hear the literal, and potentially dangerous, message that hard and soft drugs are indistinguishable. Others who know they are not will learn to dismiss or ridicule authority. Most students do know that sharing a Tylenol is not as culpable as sharing a joint, which in turn is not as dangerous as selling cocaine. Should we really believe that these students will develop a new-found respect for teachers who treat all three with the same zero tolerance expulsion? Teenagers, after all, are exceptionally quick to discern and resent unfair treatment from adults, and research suggests that undifferentiated sanctions in public schools are promoting alienation and even disobedience among many students.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, some students will hear a message about law and justice, one that corrodes rather than strengthens one of our essential cultural legacies. “One size fits all” punishments dispense with the elementary inquiries into blameworthiness or harm that are inseparable from our traditional understandings of fairness, liberty, and equality. Such sanctions teach a lesson that the Supreme Court famously warned against long ago: “That [schools] are educating the young for citizenship,” the Court explained, “is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. Incapacitation</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">To the degree that deterrence fails, zero tolerance expulsions are supposed to provide schools with a second line of defense—a form of incapacitation. Removing troublesome students from the classroom should reduce disruptions and enhance safety in that school, assuming all other factors remain unchanged. Yet the statistics to date do not show significant success on this front either. Were such a strategy working, the initial jump in zero tolerance removals would fall off as troublemakers were expelled. Instead, schools are expelling and suspending ever larger numbers of students.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the prospects of identifying and removing disruptive students, it is important to understand how severely limited the incapacitation claim is: it considers short-term consequences in the classroom only, ignoring highly negative effects both outside school and in school over the longer term. But</p>
<p><a id="page_598" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>598</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">such costs must be counted in order to assess both the impact of zero tolerance removals and the relative merits of alternative disciplinary approaches that do not withdraw educational services. Suspended or expelled students do not simply disappear, of course. They embark on an inauspicious trajectory that is more likely to endanger themselves and others when compared with students who continue to attend their schools. This trajectory begins by dissolving the bonds with the teachers and counselors who would be most able to provide help to troubled students. It leads to greatly increased chances of permanently dropping out of school and of joblessness. Another correlation exists between the lack of secondary education and criminal behavior, a correlation aggravated by expulsions that produce unsupervised free time for many who can least handle it, bleak future prospects, and feelings of unjust treatment. One study concludes that, absent alternative education for removed students, “school personnel may simply be dumping problem students out on the streets, only to find them later causing increased violence and disruption in the community.…[W]e face serious questions about the long-term negative effects of one of the cornerstones of zero tolerance, school exclusion.”</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Does the decrease in criminal activity at the same time that school suspensions and expulsions have increased suggest that schools are doing something right or that they are overreacting to student misbehavior? Is it indicative of irrationality? Should these facts give courts pause in their deference to school administrators, or do schools remain in the best position to exercise judgment?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The authors indicate that some schools have extended zero-tolerance policies to minor misbehaviors such as disobedience and defined Tylenol as a drug, with the rationale being that an absolutist approach will result in deterrence and students self-policing and strictly adhering to the rules. The article indicates, however, that students have not stopped engaging in inappropriate behavior in school. Are we punishing students for otherwise normal adolescent, albeit inappropriate, behavior? Is there anything unfair or irrational in severely punishing students for behavior we should expect? On the other hand, schools should model good behavior, and infractions cannot be ignored. What options do schools have that neither overreact to nor ignore inappropriate behavior?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What messages do schools intend to send to students with their zero-tolerance policies? Is it possible that they are teaching students the wrong lesson?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Scholars and advocates frequently point out that, even if harsh discipline policies are rational in the sense that they punish inappropriate behavior and protect innocent students from that misbehavior, harsh discipline policies have serious consequences for the students who are punished and, as a side effect, schools and society as a whole. First, due to the perceived unfairness of zero-tolerance policies, students who are subject to zero tolerance frequently feel</p>
<p><a id="page_599" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>599</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">alienated from their schools and become more likely to use drugs, resort to violence, and engage in other harmful behaviors. In this respect, zero tolerance replicates the disease it seeks to cure. Zachary W. Best, <i>Derailing the Schoolhouse-to-Jailhouse Track: Title VI and a New Approach to Disparate Impact Analysis in Public Education</i>, 99 <span class="smallcap">Geo. L.J.</span> 1671, 1679 (2011). Second, zero tolerance negatively affects educational outcomes. Students are subject to more and longer suspensions, which deprive them of educational opportunity, decrease achievement scores, and increase the likelihood of a student dropping out by fivefold. <i>Id.</i> at 1679-1680. Third, suspension and expulsion make students more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system both in the short and long term. <i>Id.</i> at 1680.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Schools may have no choice other than to exclude some students, but if a student is not a serious threat to others or a significant disruption to the learning environment, what is the justification for excluding the student from school, given what we know to be the serious risks to the excluded student?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch236">C. RACIAL DISPARITIES</p>
<p class="noindent">Zero-tolerance and harsh disciplinary policies have a particularly negative impact on minority students. A study by the Advancement Project reported that in 2006 to 2007 every state in the country suspended black students at a higher rate than white students. “The worst disparities were in Wisconsin, where Black students were over seven times more likely to be suspended than their White peers. [In] Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Pennsylvania,…Black students were between four-and-a-half and six times as likely to be suspended as White students.” <span class="smallcap">Advancement Project, Test, Punish, and Push Out: How “Zero Tolerance” and High-Stakes Testing Funnel Youth into the School-to-Prison Pipeline</span> 21 (2010). Disparities were not as high for Latino students, but still existed in 40 states. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">The seminal study of discriminatory discipline practices is <span class="smallcap">Russell J. Skiba et al., The Color of Discipline: Sources of Racial and Gender Disproportionality in School Punishment</span> (2000). Skiba writes: “Studies of school suspension have consistently documented disproportionality by socioeconomic status. Students who receive free school lunch are at increased risk for school suspension. [A prior study] also found that students whose fathers did not have a full-time job were significantly more likely to be suspended than students whose fathers were employed full-time.” <i>Id.</i> at 1. Skiba’s study took into account socioeconomic differences between racial groups and found “that significant racial disparities in school discipline remain even after controlling for socioeconomic status.” <i>Id.</i> at 15. In fact, “an index of socioeconomic status had virtually no effect when used as a covariate in a test of racial differences in office referrals and suspensions. Indeed, disciplinary disproportionality by socioeconomic status appear[ed] to be a somewhat less robust finding than gender or racial disparity.” <i>Id.</i> Interestingly, “race disparities in school suspension” did not principally stem</p>
<p><a id="page_600" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>600</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">from differential decisions made by principals at the office, but from “differences in the rate of initial referral to the office for black and white students.” <i>Id.</i> A higher rate of misbehavior by African Americans, however, was unlikely to be the explanation for a higher rate of referral.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[T]he disproportionate discipline for boys appears to be an appropriate response to higher rates of disruptive behavior among boys. There is no such support for a similar racial hypothesis. Neither these nor any previous results we are aware of provide any evidence that racial discrepancies in school punishment can be accounted for by disproportionate rates of misbehavior. Rather African American students are referred for and subjected to more severe consequences for less serious and more subjective reasons. Thus, of the three dimensions tested in this study—gender, race, and socioeconomic status—only disparities due to race persist regardless of level of analysis. Absent support for any plausible alternative explanation, these data lend support to the conclusion that racial disproportionality in school discipline, originating at the classroom level, is an indicator of systematic racial discrimination.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id.</i> at 16. Skiba has continued to document extensive racial disparities in discipline in various subsequent studies. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Russell Skiba et al., <i>Race Is Not Neutral: A National Investigation of African American and Latino Disproportionality in School Discipline</i>, 40 <span class="smallcap">Sch. Psychol. Rev.</span> 85 (2011); Russell Skiba et al., <i>African American Disproportionality in School Discipline: The Divide Between Best Evidence and Legal Remedy</i>, 54 N.Y.L. <span class="smallcap">Sch. L. Rev.</span> 1071 (2010); Russell Skiba et al., <i>Unproven Links: Can Poverty Explain Ethnic Disproportionality in Special Education</i>, 39 <span class="smallcap">J. Special Educ.</span> 130 (2005). Do you agree that these disparities are indicative of discrimination? Is there any other explanation? If not, how should the education system respond?</p>
<p class="indent">Based on studies like these, along with the growing social science consensus that harsh discipline does not make schools safer but instead undermines educational outcomes, the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice issued joint policy guidance in 2016. The guidance was designed to reduce racial discrimination and inequality in discipline, but also to prompt districts to adopt more effective approaches to student misbehavior.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch237">U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division &amp; U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>Jan. 8, 2014</i></p>
<p class="noindent">[D]isparities in student discipline rates in a school or district may be caused by a range of factors. However, research suggests that substantial racial disparities are not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color. Although statistical and quantitative data would not end an inquiry under Title IV or Title VI, significant and unexplained racial disparities in student discipline give rise to concerns that schools may be engaging in racial discrimination that violates the Federal civil rights laws. For instance, statistical</p>
<p><a id="page_601" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>601</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">evidence may indicate that groups of students have been subjected to different treatment or that a school policy or practice may have an adverse discriminatory impact. Indeed, the Departments’ investigations, which consider quantitative data as part of a wide array of evidence, have revealed racial discrimination in the administration of student discipline. For example, in our investigations we have found cases where African-American students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race than similarly situated white students. In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem.</p>
<p class="indent">The data also show that an increasing number of students are losing important instructional time due to exclusionary discipline. The increasing use of disciplinary sanctions such as in-school and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, or referrals to law enforcement authorities creates the potential for significant, negative educational and long-term outcomes, and can contribute to what has been termed the “school to prison pipeline.” Studies have suggested a correlation between exclusionary discipline policies and practices and an array of serious educational, economic, and social problems, including school avoidance and diminished educational engagement; decreased academic achievement; increased behavior problems; increased likelihood of dropping out; substance abuse; and involvement with juvenile justice systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, fair and equitable discipline policies are an important component of creating an environment where all students feel safe and welcome. Schools are safer when all students feel comfortable and are engaged in the school community, and when teachers and administrators have the tools and training to prevent and address conflicts and challenges as they arise. Equipping school officials with an array of tools to support positive student behavior—thereby providing a range of options to prevent and address misconduct—will both promote safety and avoid the use of discipline policies that are discriminatory or inappropriate. The goals of equity and school safety are thus complementary, and together help ensure a safe school free of discrimination.</p>
<p class="h10">A. <span class="smallcap">Legal Framework</span></p>
<p class="indent">When schools respond to student misconduct, Titles IV and VI [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note31" id="Rnote31" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></sup>] require that the school’s response be undertaken in a racially nondiscriminatory manner. These statutes cover school officials and everyone school officials exercise some control over, whether through contract or other arrangement, including school resource officers. Schools cannot divest themselves of responsibility for the nondiscriminatory administration of school safety measures and student discipline by relying on school resource officers, school district police officers, contract or private security companies, security guards or other contractors, or law enforcement personnel.</p>
<p class="indent">Titles IV and VI protect students over the entire course of the disciplinary process, from behavior management in the classroom, to referral to an authority</p>
<p><a id="page_602" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>602</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">outside the classroom because of misconduct to resolution of the discipline incident. [T]he initial referral of a student to the principal’s office for misconduct is a decision point that can raise concerns, to the extent that it entails the subjective exercise of unguided discretion in which racial biases or stereotypes may be manifested. If a school refers students for discipline because of their race, the school has engaged in discriminatory conduct regardless of whether the student referred has engaged in misbehavior. And even if the referrals do not ultimately lead to the imposition of disciplinary sanctions, the referrals alone result in reduced classroom time and academic instruction for the referred student. Furthermore, if a sanction from a discriminatory referral becomes part of the student’s school record, it could potentially enhance the penalty for subsequent misconduct and follow the student throughout the student’s academic career.</p>
<p class="indent">The administration of student discipline can result in unlawful discrimination based on race in two ways: first, if a student is subjected to different treatment based on the student’s race, and second, if a policy is neutral on its face—meaning that the policy itself does not mention race—and is administered in an evenhanded manner but has a disparate impact, i.e., a disproportionate and unjustified effect on students of a particular race. Under both inquiries, statistical analysis regarding the impact of discipline policies and practices on particular groups of students is an important indicator of potential violations. In all cases, however, the Departments will investigate all relevant circumstances, such as the facts surrounding a student’s actions and the discipline imposed.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>1. Different Treatment</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Both Title IV and Title VI prohibit schools from intentionally disciplining students differently based on race. The clearest case of intentional discrimination would be a policy that was discriminatory on its face: one that included explicit language requiring that students of one race be disciplined differently from students of another race, or that only students of a particular race be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="indent">More commonly, however, intentional discrimination occurs when a school has a discipline policy that is neutral on its face (meaning the language of the policy does not explicitly differentiate between students based on their race), but the school administers the policy in a discriminatory manner or when a school permits the ad hoc and discriminatory discipline of students in areas that its policy does not fully address.</p>
<p class="indent">Such intentional discrimination in the administration of student discipline can take many forms. The typical example is when similarly situated students of different races are disciplined differently for the same offense. Students are similarly situated when they are comparable, even if not identical, in relevant respects. For example, assume a group of Asian-American and Native-American students, none of whom had ever engaged in or previously been disciplined for misconduct, got into a fight, and the school conducted an investigation. If the school could not determine how the fight began and had no information</p>
<p><a id="page_603" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>603</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">demonstrating that students behaved differently during the fight, e.g., one group used weapons, then the school’s decision to discipline the Asian-American students more harshly than the Native-American students would raise an inference of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Selective enforcement of a facially neutral policy against students of one race is also prohibited intentional discrimination. This can occur, for example, when a school official elects to overlook a violation of a policy committed by a student who is a member of one racial group, while strictly enforcing the policy against a student who is a member of another racial group. It can occur at the classroom level as well. The Departments often receive complaints from parents that a teacher only refers students of a particular race outside of the classroom for discipline, even though students of other races in that classroom commit the same infractions. Where this is true, there has been selective enforcement, even if an administrator issues the same consequence for all students referred for discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">Intentional discrimination also occurs when a school adopts a facially neutral policy with the intent to target students of a particular race for invidious reasons. This is so even if the school punishes students of other races under the policy. For example, if school officials believed that students of a particular race were likely to wear a particular style of clothing, and then, as a means of penalizing students of that race (as opposed to as a means of advancing a legitimate school objective), adopted a policy that made wearing that style of clothing a violation of the dress code, the policy would constitute unlawful intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, intentional discrimination could be proven even without the existence of a similarly situated student if the Departments found that teachers or administrators were acting based on racially discriminatory motives. For example, if a school official uttered a racial slur when disciplining a student, this could suggest racial animus, supporting a finding that the official intended to discriminate based on a particular student’s race.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the Departments find that a school has engaged in intentional discrimination will be based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular discipline incident. Evidence of racially discriminatory intent can be either direct or circumstantial. Direct evidence might include remarks, testimony, or admissions by school officials revealing racially discriminatory motives. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that allows the Departments to infer discriminatory intent from the facts of the investigation as a whole, or from the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Absent direct evidence of intentional discrimination based on race, the Departments examine the circumstantial evidence to evaluate whether discrimination has occurred. The Departments typically ask the following questions to determine whether a school intentionally discriminated in the administration of student discipline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did the school limit or deny educational services, benefits, or opportunities to a student or group of students of a particular race by treating them differently from a similarly situated student or group of students
<p><a id="page_604" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>604</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of another race in the disciplinary process? If no, then the Departments would not find sufficient evidence to determine that the school has engaged in intentional discrimination. If the students are similarly situated and the school has treated them differently, then:</p></li>
<li>Can the school articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the different treatment? If not, the Departments could find that the school has intentionally discriminated on the basis of race. If yes, then:</li>
<li>Is the reason articulated a pretext for discrimination? Some of the circumstances where the Departments may find that the school’s stated reason is a pretext—in other words, not the true reason for the school’s action—are: the asserted reason does not explain the school’s actions; witnesses contradict the school’s stated reason for the disparity, exposing such reason as false; students of other races have received different sanctions for similar instances of misbehavior; or the sanctions imposed do not conform to the school’s permitted discipline sanctions in its written discipline policy. If the nondiscriminatory reason offered by the school is found to be pretextual, the Departments would find that the school had engaged in intentional discrimination.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">In evaluating claims under this analysis, the Departments may also consider other circumstantial evidence to determine whether there was discriminatory intent underlying a school’s administration of discipline. Such circumstantial evidence may include, but is not limited to, whether the impact of a disciplinary policy or practice weighs more heavily on students of a particular race; whether there is a history of discriminatory conduct toward members of a student’s race; the administrative history behind a disciplinary policy or decision; and whether there had been inconsistent application of disciplinary policies and practices to students of different racial backgrounds.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>2. Disparate Impact</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Schools also violate Federal law when they evenhandedly implement facially neutral policies and practices that, although not adopted with the intent to discriminate, nonetheless have an unjustified effect of discriminating against students on the basis of race. The resulting discriminatory effect is commonly referred to as “disparate impact.”</p>
<p class="indent">In determining whether a facially neutral policy has an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of race, the Departments will engage in the following three-part inquiry.</p>
<ol>
<li>Has the discipline policy resulted in an adverse impact on students of a particular race as compared with students of other races? For example, depending on the facts of a particular case, an adverse impact may include, but is not limited to, instances where students of a particular race, as compared to students of other races, are disproportionately: sanctioned at higher rates; disciplined for specific offenses; subjected to
<p><a id="page_605" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>605</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">longer sanctions or more severe penalties; removed from the regular school setting to an alternative school setting; or excluded from one or more educational programs or activities. If there were no adverse impact, then, under this inquiry, the Departments would not find sufficient evidence to determine that the school had engaged in discrimination. If there were an adverse impact, then:</p></li>
<li>Is the discipline policy necessary to meet an important educational goal? In conducting the second step of this inquiry, the Departments will consider both the importance of the goal that the school articulates and the tightness of the fit between the stated goal and the means employed to achieve it. If the policy is not necessary to meet an important educational goal, then the Departments would find that the school had engaged in discrimination. If the policy is necessary to meet an important educational goal, then the Departments would ask:</li>
<li>Are there comparably effective alternative policies or practices that would meet the school’s stated educational goal with less of a burden or adverse impact on the disproportionately affected racial group, or is the school’s proffered justification a pretext for discrimination? If the answer is yes to either question, then the Departments would find that the school had engaged in discrimination. If no, then the Departments would likely not find sufficient evidence to determine that the school had engaged in discrimination.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Examples of policies that can raise disparate impact concerns include policies that impose mandatory suspension, expulsion, or citation (e.g., ticketing or other fines or summonses) upon any student who commits a specified offense—such as being tardy to class, being in possession of a cellular phone, being found insubordinate, acting out, or not wearing the proper school uniform; corporal punishment policies that allow schools to paddle, spank, or otherwise physically punish students; and discipline policies that prevent youth returning from involvement in the justice system from reenrolling in school. Additionally, policies that impose out-of-school suspensions or expulsions for truancy also raise concerns because a school would likely have difficulty demonstrating that excluding a student from attending school in response to the student’s efforts to avoid school was necessary to meet an important educational goal.</p>
<p class="h10">B. <span class="smallcap">Information the Departments Consider</span></p>
<p class="indent">During an investigation, the Departments will examine facts and information related to a school’s discipline approach. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the types of information the Departments have examined when investigating the possibility of discriminatory discipline: written policies (such as student codes of conduct, parent handbooks, and teacher manuals) and unwritten disciplinary practices (such as exercises of discretion by teachers and school administrators); data indicating the number of referrals to administrators charged with implementing student discipline and/or to law enforcement</p>
<p><a id="page_606" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>606</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">authorities; discipline incident reports; copies of student discipline records and discipline referral forms; school discipline data disaggregated by subgroup, offense, other relevant factors (such as the time of incident, place of incident, whether more than one student was involved in an incident, the students’ prior disciplinary infractions, the person(s) who referred a student for discipline); and interviews with students, parents, administrators, teachers, counselors, school resource officers and other law enforcement officers, relevant contractors, and support staff. The Departments also will review and analyze information provided by schools [through federal data collection] and other relevant data.</p>
<p class="indent">The Departments will look carefully at, among other things, a school’s definitions of misconduct to ensure they are clear and nondiscriminatory, the extent to which disciplinary criteria and referrals are made for offenses that are subjectively defined (e.g., disrespect or insubordination), and whether there are safeguards to ensure that discretion is exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner. In addition to establishing a system for monitoring all disciplinary referrals, the school should have a system in place to ensure that staff who have the authority to refer students for discipline are properly trained to administer student discipline in a nondiscriminatory manner. Schools should thus take steps to monitor and evaluate the impact of disciplinary practices to detect patterns that bear further investigation.</p>

<p class="indent">2. The Departments have required districts to adopt various remedies for violations, but the most important may be those requiring a change in approach to discipline itself. The Departments suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing and implementing strategies for teaching, including the use of appropriate supports and interventions, which encourage and reinforce positive student behaviors and utilize exclusionary discipline as a last resort;</li>
<li>providing training for school personnel on revised discipline policies and classroom management techniques;</li>

<p class="h7" id="ch238">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="noindent">A school district’s discipline code allows for a one-day suspension of all students who commit the offense of “acting in a threatening manner.” Statistical data demonstrate that under this provision of the code, a school in the district suspends African American students disproportionately relative to their enrollment at the school. During the investigation, the Departments find that the discipline code provision lacks a clear definition of the prohibited conduct, and that the school has suspended African American students under the provision for a broad range of actions, including congregating in groups in the hallways, talking too loudly, or talking back when admonished by the teacher. Further, the evidence indicates that white students engaging in comparable conduct are more likely to be charged with lower-level violations of the discipline code, such as “no hall pass” and “classroom disruption.” These offenses do not lead to suspension and are more likely to result in after-school detention.</p>
<p class="indent">Apply the legal framework from the Dear Colleague Letter and determine whether the district can defend its policy and practices.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch239">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="noindent">You are a member of the Hamilton County School Board. The board adopted a zero-tolerance policy that calls for long-term suspension or expulsion in response to various infractions: (1) any acts of violence or physical aggression on school campus, (2) possession of any drugs or alcohol, (3) attending school with unprescribed drugs or alcohol in one’s system, (4) possession of weapons, (5) defiance on more than three occasions in a semester, and (6) off-campus behavior that results in criminal charges. Since adopting this policy, the number of expulsions and long-term suspensions have quadrupled and student achievement has decreased. Moreover, the number of expulsions and suspensions shows no sign of decreasing soon. These problems are particularly true for African American students. You are now having second thoughts about the policy. Does the law, as you understand it, require that you make any changes? Regardless, would you propose a different policy to replace the old one? Pay close attention to whether you would eliminate zero tolerance completely or maintain a zero-tolerance policy, but simply narrow its application. What, if any, steps could you take to reduce racial disparities?</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch240">D. DUE PROCESS WHEN EDUCATION IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT</p>
<p class="noindent">When the Supreme Court decided <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>, almost no state courts had held that students have a constitutional right to education under their state constitutions. Consequently, the Court in <i>Goss</i> analyzed education as merely a statutory property right. As such, a school need not articulate any significant governmental interest to exclude a student from school nor follow procedures beyond basic notice and an opportunity to respond. The numerous state supreme court opinions discussed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a> that recognize students’ constitutional or fundamental right to an equal or adequate education potentially change this analysis. Infringements of federal fundamental rights are subject to strict scrutiny and require relatively significant governmental interests and careful procedures. But federal courts have yet to take state developments in the constitutional right to education into account in analyzing school discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">State courts have begun to address the question, but have afforded it varying degrees of attention and reached conflicting results. Some state courts indicate that the constitutional right to education has little effect on the disciplinary process, as the right to education is subject to students’ good behavior. Others have suggested that the existence of a fundamental or constitutional right demands strict scrutiny. Concerned that strict scrutiny might impose significant burdens on schools that legitimately need to exclude and discipline students with efficiency, the North Carolina Supreme Court took an intermediate route. As you read the next case, consider which of the three positions is the most legally defensible and which makes the most sense as a practical educational matter.</p>
<p class="indent">Also, note that the precise issue in the case is not what process the school affords a student, but whether the school must provide a student an alternative education once the school excludes the student. The rise of expulsions and suspensions makes the provision of alternative education a crucial right. Additional process may be of little import to the vast number of students who are excluded for uncontested misbehavior, but some form of continuing education can be the difference between the possibility of continued educational progress and starting down a path that leads to premature termination of education and entry into the criminal justice system.</p>

<p class="h5a"><i>364 N.C. 368 (2010)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Martin</span>, Justice.</p>
<p class="indent">This case presents the question of whether the Beaufort County School Board violated state law by denying Viktoria King (plaintiff) access to alternative education during her long-term suspension from school. After considering longstanding precedent affording school officials discretion in administering student</p>
<p><a id="page_609" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>609</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">disciplinary codes and recent cases recognizing a state constitutional right to a sound basic education, we hold that defendants must articulate a reason for denying plaintiff access to alternative education during her long-term suspension.</p>
<p class="indent">[As punishment for her involvement in a fight,] the Beaufort County Superintendent, Jeffrey Moss, adopted the principal’s recommendation and suspended plaintiff for the remainder of the school year without offering her alternative education. A panel of central office administrators upheld the decision.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff alleges that defendants’ denial of alternative education during her long-term suspension is a violation of the state constitution. Before this Court plaintiff repeatedly emphasized the importance of requiring defendants to articulate a reason for denying her access to alternative education. While the state constitution requires defendants to provide a reason for refusing alternative education to plaintiff, we decline plaintiff’s invitation to create a constitutional right to alternative education for students who violate lawful school rules.</p>
<p class="indent">The General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme specifying the powers and duties of local school boards and school officials in connection with school discipline and alternative education. The statute vests school officials with the authority to issue long-term suspensions to students “who willfully violate[] the policies of conduct established by the local board of education.” [Other statutory sections create a “comprehensive scheme” that] grants long-term suspended students a statutory right to receive alternative education when feasible and appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">In acknowledging a statutory right to alternative education, we stress that a fundamental right to alternative education does not exist under the state constitution. Nevertheless, insofar as the General Assembly has provided a statutory right to alternative education, a suspended student excluded from alternative education has a state constitutional right to know the reason for her exclusion. This right arises from the equal access provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. Because exclusion from alternative education potentially infringes on a student’s state constitutional right to equal educational access, school administrators must articulate a reason when they exclude a long-term suspended student from alternative education.</p>
<p class="indent">Having observed that our holding does not recognize a state constitutional right to alternative education, we consider the standard of review to be applied when a suspended student is denied access to alternative education. The present case requires us to harmonize the rational basis test employed in school discipline cases with the strict scrutiny analysis that formed a part of this Court’s constitutional holding in school funding cases. The tension between these differing standards of review must be resolved in a manner that (1) protects student access to educational opportunities, while (2) preserving the discretion of school officials to maintain safe and orderly schools.</p>
<p class="indent">North Carolina courts have historically accorded school administrators great deference in the exercise of their disciplinary authority. For instance, in <i>Coggins ex rel. Coggins v. Board of Education</i>, we noted that “the local board is the final authority so long as it acts in good faith and refrains from adopting</p>
<p><a id="page_610" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>610</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">regulations which are clearly arbitrary or unreasonable.”[In <i>In re Jackson</i>, the Court of Appeals correctly] observed that “a student may be constitutionally suspended or expelled for misconduct whenever the conduct is of a type the school may legitimately prohibit.”</p>
<p class="indent">Despite this well-established precedent, plaintiff urges this Court to adopt strict scrutiny for school disciplinary determinations. Most courts, however, review school disciplinary decisions using a more deferential standard. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Tucson Pub. Sch. v. Green</i>, 495 P.2d 861, 864 (1972); <i>Satan Fraternity v. Bd. of Pub. Instruction</i>, 22 So.2d 892, 893 (1945); <i>Wilson v. Hinsdale Elementary Sch. Dist.</i>, 810 N.E.2d 637, 642 (2004); <i>S. Gibson Sch. Bd. v. Sollman</i>, 768 N.E.2d 437, 442 (Ind. 2002); <i>Davis v. Hillsdale Cmty. Sch. Dist.</i>, 573 N.W.2d 77, 79 (1997) (per curiam); <i>Busch v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist.</i>, 623 N.W.2d 672, 677 (2001); <i>Hamilton v. Unionville-Chadds Ford Sch. Dist.</i>, 714 A.2d 1012, 1014 (1998). Even the Supreme Court of Wyoming, one of the few state courts to apply strict scrutiny in this context, acknowledges that “school districts are in the best position to judge the student’s actions in light of all the surrounding circumstances and tailor the appropriate punishment to fit the unique circumstances of each student’s situation.” <i>In re R.M.</i>, 102 P.3d 868, 876 (Wyo. 2004). Put simply, “the special context of public schools requires a more lenient approach to reviewing the decisions of school officials.” At the same time, we have held strict scrutiny applicable to some educational issues. In <i>Leandro v. State</i>, this Court applied strict scrutiny to the question of whether the state had failed to provide students in low-income districts “a sufficient education to meet the minimal standard for a constitutionally adequate education.” Within the context of school funding, the Court concluded that [the North Carolina Constitution guarantees] “every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools.” In contrast to our school discipline cases, <i>Leandro</i> placed the burden on the state “to establish that [its] actions denying this fundamental right [were] ‘necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.’”</p>
<p class="indent">But <i>Leandro</i> does not immunize students from the consequences of their own misconduct. A critical distinction exists between the state uniformly denying students in low-income districts access to a sound basic education and the state offering all students a sound basic education but temporarily removing students who engage in misconduct that disrupts the sound basic education of their peers. As we have said, “The right to attend school and claim the benefits afforded by the public school system is the right to attend subject to all lawful rules and regulations prescribed for the government thereof.” School administrators undeniably possess both freedom and flexibility to punish students who disrupt the educational process or endanger other students. <i>See Goss v. Lopez</i>, 419 U.S. 565, 580 (1975).</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the long history of judicial deference to the disciplinary determinations of school administrators, plaintiff argues that her <i>Leandro</i> right to a sound basic education requires us to apply strict scrutiny to defendants’ decision to deny her alternative education. [A]doption of strict scrutiny to review disciplinary determinations would necessarily require judges to routinely substitute their own views for those of school administrators [and mandate alternative education under circumstances that the General Assembly</p>
<p><a id="page_611" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>611</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">has been unwilling to]. We agree with amicus that adoption of strict scrutiny for disciplinary and alternative education decisions by school officials would render “long-term suspension practically unusable as a form of student discipline and flood[] the courts with litigation regarding a myriad of discretionary administrative decisions.” In each case in which a school administrator determines that an alternative education placement is inappropriate, the school must prove its disciplinary decision is narrowly tailored to effectuate a compelling interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of the unworkable burdens it imposes on school administrators, applying strict scrutiny to long-term suspensions jeopardizes the safety of the greater school community and impedes the educational progress of the suspended student’s peers. In contrast to regulatory statutes and criminal codes enacted by legislative bodies, school disciplinary rules [need not be] drafted to withstand strict scrutiny in courts of law. <i>See Bethel v. Fraser</i>, 478 U.S. 675 (1986) (“Given the school’s need to be able to impose disciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, <i>the school disciplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code</i> which imposes criminal sanctions.” (emphasis added)). Consequently, application of strict scrutiny to the student disciplinary process operates to the detriment of our public school communities.</p>
<p class="indent">Rational basis review, on the other hand, does not adequately protect student access to educational opportunities or guard against arbitrary decisions or inadvertent errors by school officials. Under this standard, “[i]t is not necessary for courts to determine the actual goal or purpose of the government action at issue; instead, <i>any conceivable legitimate purpose</i> is sufficient.” As applied to alternative education determinations, rational basis review undoubtedly upholds administrative decisions even in the absence of a proffered reason, as plaintiff experienced in the present case. But this Court’s previous recognition of state constitutional rights to equal educational access and a sound basic education compels more exacting review.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we hold that alternative education decisions for students who receive long-term suspensions are reviewed under the state constitutional standard of intermediate scrutiny. Under the state intermediate scrutiny standard, school administrators must articulate an important or significant reason for denying students access to alternative education. In the school disciplinary context, intermediate scrutiny strikes a practical balance between protecting student access to educational opportunities and empowering school officials to maintain safe and orderly schools.</p>
<p class="indent">State law requires local boards of education to establish at least one alternative learning program and create strategies for assigning long-term suspended students to it when feasible and appropriate. Since the General Assembly has chosen to grant this statutory right to long-term suspended students, school administrators cannot arbitrarily deny access without violating the state constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">School administrators are not required to provide alternative education to every suspended student, especially those students who forfeit this statutory right through their own misbehavior. Because the safety and educational interests of all students receiving alternative education must be protected, students</p>
<p><a id="page_612" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>612</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">who exhibit violent behavior, threaten staff or other students, substantially disrupt the learning process, or otherwise engage in serious misconduct may be denied access. For these students, school officials will have little or no difficulty articulating an important or significant reason for denying access to alternative education under the state standard of intermediate review.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, defendants did not articulate any reason for denying plaintiff access to alternative education during her semester-long suspension. The record indicates only that plaintiff participated in “a fight involving numerous students.” Because the people of North Carolina “have a right to the privilege of education,” N.C. Const. art. I, §15, the requirement that school administrators articulate an important or significant reason for denying educational services is not unduly burdensome.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though defendants may have concluded plaintiff’s violent behavior made her a threat to students and staff if she were placed in an alternative learning facility, it is not the role of this Court to speculate why plaintiff was denied alternative education. Nevertheless, when defendants suspended plaintiff for misbehavior they did not have the benefit of this Court’s harmonization of our decision in <i>Leandro</i> with the standards of review applicable to school discipline cases. Accordingly, on remand, defendants should be afforded the opportunity to explain why they denied plaintiff access to alternative education.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversed and remanded.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice</span> <span class="smallcap">Timmons-Goodson</span>, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p class="indent">I disagree with the majority’s application of intermediate scrutiny. The North Carolina Constitution and precedent from this Court firmly establish for every child of this state a constitutionally-rooted fundamental right to the opportunity for a sound basic education. Accordingly, a purported violation of this right, including the cessation of all state-funded educational services, should be strictly scrutinized.</p>
<p class="indent">And until today, the Court has never parsed this right to give it varying levels of protection depending on the context. Thirty years ago, this Court concluded that “equal access to participation in our public school system is a <i>fundamental right</i>, guaranteed by our state constitution and protected by considerations of procedural due process.” We reaffirmed this right in <i>Leandro v. State</i>, declaring that the North Carolina Constitution confers upon “every child…<i>a fundamental right to a sound basic education</i> which would prepare the child to participate fully in society as it existed in his or her lifetime.”</p>
<p class="indent">None of [our precedent] contains any suggestion that the fundamental right to the opportunity for a sound basic education is limited to any particular context. As a result, I would hold this right to protect students from a complete termination of state-funded educational services during long-term suspensions. To hold otherwise would allow schools to grant every child an equal opportunity to enter school and then deprive them of all public education when it is less than necessary to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">No participant in this appeal suggests that local boards of education lack a compelling interest in ensuring safe and orderly schools. No one disputes that this compelling governmental interest operates in every long-term suspension</p>
<p><a id="page_613" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>613</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">or expulsion for fighting, other violent behavior, or any conduct that threatens the orderly administration of the schools. Accordingly, strict scrutiny only requires school administrators to consider whether a long-term suspension or expulsion <i>without some alternative educational option</i> is necessary to achieve safety and order. If denial of an alternative education program is not necessary to further a compelling state interest, then such action is not narrowly tailored and must be reversed.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, if it is possible to provide a student who has infringed a school rule with some form of education without jeopardizing the safety of others, then that opportunity should be provided. If a safe and orderly school environment can be maintained without barring a student from every single state-funded educational service, then such a barrier should not be erected.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The court begins with the premise that an alternative education is a statutory right rather than a constitutional one. Is this statutory response a constitutional necessity given that, in the absence of an alternative education, an expulsion would be an absolute deprivation of a North Carolina student’s constitutional right to a sound basic education? What level of scrutiny would the absolute deprivation of a sound basic education require? As the court points out, the challenge is harmonizing the rational basis review generally applied to discipline with the stricter scrutiny applied in school finance cases.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The court attempts to harmonize these conflicting standards by indicating that a student’s right to attend school is subject to their compliance with “all lawful rules and regulations.” Where the school has substantial evidence of a rule violation, this principle justifies the school removing students from school under some circumstances. Does this resolve the issue of what misbehavior justifies removing a student? Does this resolve the question of what process a student would be due before exclusion from school?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court implies that limiting schools’ ability to impose long-term suspensions and expulsion is a bad thing. Given that schools are adjudicating students’ constitutional rights rather than the statutory right at stake in <i>Goss</i>, is the court’s assumption correct? Likewise, the North Carolina Supreme Court cites to the U.S. Supreme Court for the propositions that (1) schools require flexibility in discipline and (2) student codes of conduct need not be overly detailed. While such propositions are obviously true as a matter of federal law—where education is not a fundamental right—are those propositions equally relevant to state questions? If education is a fundamental right under state law, does that eliminate the rationale for flexibility and leniency in school discipline or must the fundamental right still be tailored to the practicalities of running a school?</p>
<p class="indent">4. After arguing that strict scrutiny places too great of a burden on schools, the court argues that rational basis review offers students too little protection. Its solution is intermediate scrutiny. Is that the correct solution? What must a</p>
<p><a id="page_614" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>614</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school do as a practical matter to meet intermediate scrutiny in expelling a student?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The theory that a constitutional right to education changes discipline and expulsion standards has been met with mixed results in other states. In Massachusetts and Nebraska, the highest courts reasoned that, although the state has a constitutional obligation to provide students with an education, the obligation is limited or conditional in certain respects. In Massachusetts, the court wrote that, while the state has an obligation to deliver an adequate education, “a student’s interest in a public education can be forfeited by violating school rules.” Doe v. Superintendent of Sch., 653 N.E.2d 1088, 1096 (Mass. 1995). Consistent with this premise, both states’ highest courts applied only rational basis review to student expulsions and the failure to provide alternative education. <i>Id.</i>; Kolesnick <i>ex rel.</i> Shaw v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., 558 N.W.2d 807, 813 (Neb. 1997).</p>
<p class="indent">Courts in three states besides North Carolina, however, have found that the state’s duty to offer an adequate education places limits on expulsions and requires the provision of alternative education. Mississippi applied intermediate scrutiny to an expulsion and found that, even where expulsion was justified, a student was entitled to alternative education. Board of Trs. v. T.H., III, 681 So. 2d 110, 115-117 (Miss. 1996). West Virginia’s Supreme Court went even further, recognizing that education was a fundamental right. Phillip Leon M. v. Greenbrier Cty. Bd. of Educ., 484 S.E.2d 909, 914, 916 n.12 (W. Va. 1996). Thus, deprivations of that right through discipline are subject to strict scrutiny. The court found that removing an extremely dangerous student from school might be a compelling interest, but narrowly tailoring prevents the state from depriving a student of all education and requires the provision of an alternative education. <i>Id.</i> at 915-916. Relying on the constitutional right to education, a lower court adopted a similar approach in New Jersey. State <i>ex rel.</i> G.S., 749 A.2d 902, 908 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 2000).</p>
<p class="indent">Wyoming’s Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny to an expulsion, but inexplicably found that expulsion was a narrowly tailored response to meet the state’s goal of safety in schools. <i>In re</i> R.M., 102 P.3d 868, 876 (Wyo. 2004). Thus, it did not require the provision of alternative education. Scholars, however, have sharply criticized the rationale of courts that have refused to take school exclusions more seriously in light of school finance precedent. <i>See, e.g</i>., Robyn K. Bitner, <i>Exiled from Education</i>: Plyler v. Doe<i>’s Impact on the Constitutionality of Long-Term Suspensions and Expulsions</i>, 101 <span class="smallcap">Va. L. Rev.</span> 763 (2015); Amy P. Meek, <i>School Discipline “As Part of the Teaching Process”: Alternative and Compensatory Education Required by the State’s Interest in Keeping Children in School</i>, 28 <span class="smallcap">Yale L. &amp; Pol’y Rev.</span> 155, 179-180 (2009).</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless, one point entirely unaddressed by prior cases is the connection between school quality and disciplinary practices. Empirical evidence indicates that schools struggle to consistently deliver equal and adequate education opportunities without also ensuring effective discipline policy. In other words, in some schools, ineffective discipline policies may be a primary cause of the</p>
<p><a id="page_615" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>615</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">inadequate and unequal education that students in those schools receive. In fact, recent studies have connected a large portion of the racial achievement gap to the fact that minority students disproportionately attend schools with dysfunctional disciplinary environments. Richard Arum &amp; Melissa Velez, <i>Class and Racial Differences in U.S. School Disciplinary Environments</i>, <i>in</i> <span class="smallcap">Improving Learning Environments: School Discipline and Student Achievement in Comparative Perspective</span> 298-302 (Richard Arum &amp; Melissa Velez eds., 2012); Edward W. Morris &amp; Brea L. Perry, <i>The Punishment Gap: School Suspension and Racial Disparities in Achievement</i>, 63 <span class="smallcap">Soc. Probs</span>. 68 (2016). In disorderly or dysfunctional environments, all students in the school are harmed—both the misbehaving student and the innocent bystanders. Just as plaintiffs have demonstrated that inadequate teaching and funding are violations of the education rights and duties covered in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>, so too might a plaintiff argue that some discipline policies and practices deprive students of the constitutionally required education. For more on the connection between school quality and discipline and the constitutional implications, see Derek W. Black, <i>Reforming School Discipline</i>, 111 <span class="smallcap">Nw. U. L. Rev.</span> (forthcoming 2016).</p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What effect should students’ misbehavior have on their right to education? Should the forfeiture of education require some significant level of misbehavior, or should schools have discretion as to this question? The original debates surrounding the various education articles generally focused on higher level and aspirational issues rather than detailed questions regarding the forfeiture of educational rights. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Inst. for Educ. Equity &amp; Opportunity, Education in the 50 States: A Deskbook of the History of State Constitutions and Laws About Education</span> (2009). What, if any, constitutional or legal rationale would support the forfeiture of a constitutional right, and would adjudication of that forfeiture allow for localized discretion or require a formalized process? Are there analogies in other areas of law that might provide guidance as to when one might forfeit constitutional or other significant rights?</p>
<p class="indent">2. If disciplinary deprivations of education are subject to strict scrutiny, what justifications amount to compelling interests, and what are the least restrictive means for accomplishing the deprivations?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Which argument is the most persuasive: that school exclusion triggers strict scrutiny or that a dysfunctional discipline environment deprives students of their constitutional right to education? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch242">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Your state supreme court has just held, in its first school finance case, that education is a fundamental right. Your state currently has no statutory framework that prescribes any particular process for short- or long-term suspensions,</p>

<p class="noindent">School administrators often learn of or confirm student misbehavior by searching students’ personal items or body. Sometimes, a search may be necessary for a school to have a sufficient basis to discipline a student. These searches raise two fundamental questions. First, are searches by school administrators subject to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant and reasonableness requirements? Second, if school searches are subject to the Fourth Amendment, do they require a level of suspicion equivalent to the criminal justice context? The Supreme Court answered these questions in <i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.</i> in 1985. The case, however, left open several other important questions, including whether the standard applicable to school administrators changes when they turn over the evidence to police officers, whether the standard normally applicable to police officers changes when they are acting at the behest of school administrators, and whether routine searches of the entire school or groups of students implicate a different analysis than searches of individual students based on individualized suspicion. These second generation questions are taken up in the cases and materials that follow <i>T.L.O</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">On March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, N.J., discovered two girls smoking in a lavatory. One of the two girls was the respondent T.L.O. Because smoking in the lavatory was a violation of a school rule, the teacher took the two girls to the Principal’s office, where they</p>
<p><a id="page_617" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>617</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. [There,] T.L.O.’s companion admitted that she had violated the rule. T.L.O., however, denied that she had been smoking in the lavatory and claimed that she did not smoke at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Choplick asked T.L.O. to come into his private office and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held before T.L.O. as he accused her of having lied to him. As he reached into the purse for the cigarettes, Mr. Choplick also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers. In his experience, possession of rolling papers by high school students was closely associated with the use of marihuana. Suspecting that a closer examination of the purse might yield further evidence of drug use, Mr. Choplick proceeded to search the purse thoroughly. The search revealed a small amount of marihuana, a pipe, a number of empty plastic bags, a substantial quantity of money in one-dollar bills, an index card that appeared to be a list of students who owed T.L.O. money, and two letters that implicated T.L.O. in marihuana dealing.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Choplick turned the evidence of drug dealing over to the police. At the request of the police, T.L.O.’s mother took her daughter to police headquarters, where T.L.O. confessed that she had been selling marihuana at the high school. [T]he State brought delinquency charges against T.L.O. [She] moved to suppress the evidence found in her purse [as an unconstitutional search under the Fourth Amendment]. The Juvenile Court denied the motion to suppress.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">[W]e are faced initially with the question whether [the Fourth] Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials. We hold that it does.</p>
<p class="indent">It is now beyond dispute that “the Federal Constitution, by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers.” Equally indisputable is the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of students against encroachment by public school officials[.]</p>
<p class="indent">These two propositions might appear sufficient to [establish that the Fourth Amendment prohibits] unreasonable searches by school officials[, but] the State of New Jersey has argued that the Fourth Amendment was intended to regulate only searches and seizures carried out by law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="indent">It may well be true that the evil toward which the Fourth Amendment was primarily directed was the resurrection of the pre-Revolutionary practice of using general warrants or “writs of assistance” to authorize searches for contraband by officers of the Crown. But this Court has never limited the Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures to operations conducted by the police. Rather, the Court has long spoken of the Fourth Amendment’s strictures as restraints imposed upon “governmental action”—that is, “upon the activities of sovereign authority.” [Thus, we have applied the Fourth Amendment to various civil governmental officers, including building inspectors, health inspectors, and “even firemen entering privately owned premises to battle a fire.”]</p>
<p><a id="page_618" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>618</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment, a few courts have concluded that school officials are exempt from the dictates of the Fourth Amendment [because they “act <i>in loco parentis</i>” based on the authority granted to them by parents].</p>
<p class="indent">Such reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the teachings of this Court. We have held school officials subject to the commands of the First Amendment, see <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</i>, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see <i>Goss v. Lopez</i>, 419 U.S. 565 (1975). If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of their students. More generally, the Court has recognized that “the concept of parental delegation” as a source of school authority is not entirely “consonant with compulsory education laws.” Today’s public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary policies. In carrying out searches and other disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot claim the parents’ immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">To hold that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such searches. Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness governing any specific class of searches requires “balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.” On one side of the balance are arrayed the individual’s legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security; on the other, the government’s need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order.</p>
<p class="indent">We have recognized that even a limited search of the person is a substantial invasion of privacy. <i>Terry v. Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1967). We have also recognized that searches of closed items of personal luggage are intrusions on protected privacy interests. <i>United States v. Ross</i>, 456 U.S. 798, 822-823 (1982). A search of a child’s person or of a closed purse or other bag carried on her person,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note32" id="Rnote32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></sup> no less than a similar search carried out on an adult, is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy.</p>
<p><a id="page_619" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>619</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the Fourth Amendment does not protect subjective expectations of privacy that are unreasonable or otherwise “illegitimate.” To receive the protection of the Fourth Amendment, an expectation of privacy must be one that society is “prepared to recognize as legitimate.” The State of New Jersey has argued that because of the pervasive supervision to which children in the schools are necessarily subject, a child has virtually no legitimate expectation of privacy in articles of personal property “unnecessarily” carried into a school. This argument has two factual premises: (1) the fundamental incompatibility of expectations of privacy with the maintenance of a sound educational environment; and (2) the minimal interest of the child in bringing any items of personal property into the school. Both premises are severely flawed.</p>
<p class="indent">Although this Court may take notice of the difficulty of maintaining discipline in the public schools today, the situation is not so dire that students in the schools may claim no legitimate expectations of privacy. We have recently recognized that the need to maintain order in a prison is such that prisoners retain no legitimate expectations of privacy in their cells, but it goes almost without saying that “[t]he prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circumstances, separated by the harsh facts of criminal conviction and incarceration.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nor does the State’s suggestion that children have no legitimate need to bring personal property into the schools seem well anchored in reality. Students at a minimum must bring to school not only the supplies needed for their studies, but also keys, money, and the necessaries of personal hygiene and grooming. In addition, students may carry on their persons or in purses or wallets such nondisruptive yet highly personal items as photographs, letters, and diaries. Finally, students may have perfectly legitimate reasons to carry with them articles of property needed in connection with extracurricular or recreational activities. In short, schoolchildren may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items merely by bringing them onto school grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">Against the child’s interest in privacy [is] the substantial interest in maintaining discipline on school grounds. Maintaining order in the classroom has never been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have become major social problems. Even in schools that have been spared the most severe disciplinary problems, the preservation of order and a proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren. “Events calling for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require immediate, effective action.” Accordingly, we have recognized that maintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">How, then, should we strike the balance between the schoolchild’s expectations of privacy and the school’s need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place? [T]he school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before searching a child suspected of an infraction of</p>
<p><a id="page_620" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>620</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">school rules (or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools. [Because] “the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search,” we hold today that school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority.</p>
<p class="indent">The school setting also requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search. Ordinarily, a search must be based upon “probable cause” to believe that a violation of the law has occurred. However, “probable cause” is not an irreducible requirement of a valid search. The fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and although “both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search,…in certain limited circumstances neither is required.” Thus, we have in a number of cases recognized the legality of searches and seizures based on suspicions that, although “reasonable,” do not rise to the level of probable cause.</p>
<p class="indent">We join the majority of courts that have examined this issue in concluding that the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause. Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search. Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a twofold inquiry: first, one must consider “whether the…action was justified at its inception,” second, one must determine whether the search as actually conducted “was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.” Under ordinary circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other school official<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note33" id="Rnote33" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></sup> will be “justified at its inception” when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#note34" id="Rnote34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></sup> Such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.</p>
<p class="indent">This standard will, we trust, neither unduly burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools nor authorize unrestrained intrusions upon the privacy of schoolchildren. By focusing attention on the question</p>
<p><a id="page_621" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>621</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of reasonableness, the standard will spare teachers and school administrators the necessity of schooling themselves in the niceties of probable cause and permit them to regulate their conduct according to the dictates of reason and common sense. At the same time, the reasonableness standard should ensure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Our review of the facts surrounding the search [in this case] leads us to conclude that the search was in no sense unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes. The incident that gave rise to this case actually involved two separate searches, with the first—the search for cigarettes—providing the suspicion that gave rise to the second—the search for marihuana. Although it is the fruits of the second search that are at issue here, the validity of the search for marihuana must depend on the reasonableness of the initial search for cigarettes, as there would have been no reason to suspect that T.L.O. possessed marihuana had the first search not taken place. Accordingly, it is to the search for cigarettes that we first turn our attention.</p>
<p class="indent">The New Jersey Supreme Court pointed to two grounds for its holding that the search for cigarettes was unreasonable[: (1) “that possession of cigarettes was not in itself illegal or a violation of school rules” and, thus, provided “no reason to search her purse”; and (2) Mr. Choplick only had “‘a good hunch’” to “suspect that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse,” but no reasonable grounds.]</p>
<p class="indent">Both these conclusions are implausible. T.L.O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the accusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did not smoke at all. Surely it cannot be said that under these circumstances, T.L.O.’s possession of cigarettes would be irrelevant to the charges against her or to her response to those charges. T.L.O.’s possession of cigarettes would both corroborate the report that she had been smoking and undermine the credibility of her defense. To be sure, the discovery of the cigarettes would not prove that T.L.O. had been smoking in the lavatory; nor would it, strictly speaking, necessarily be inconsistent with her claim that she did not smoke at all. But it is universally recognized that evidence, to be relevant to an inquiry, need not conclusively prove the ultimate fact in issue, but only have “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Fed. Rule Evid. 401. The relevance of T.L.O.’s possession of cigarettes to the question whether she had been smoking and to the credibility of her denial that she smoked supplied the necessary “nexus” between the item searched for and the infraction under investigation. Thus, if Mr. Choplick in fact had a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. had cigarettes in her purse, the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute “mere evidence” of a violation.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the New Jersey Supreme Court also held that Mr. Choplick had no reasonable suspicion that the purse would contain cigarettes. This conclusion is puzzling. A teacher had reported that T.L.O. was smoking in the lavatory.</p>
<p><a id="page_622" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>622</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Certainly this report gave Mr. Choplick reason to suspect that T.L.O. was carrying cigarettes with her; and if she did have cigarettes, her purse was the obvious place in which to find them. Mr. Choplick’s suspicion that there were cigarettes in the purse was not an “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch,’”; rather, it was the sort of “common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior” upon which “practical people”—including government officials—are entitled to rely. Of course, even if the teacher’s report were true, T.L.O. <i>might</i> not have had a pack of cigarettes with her. But the requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: “sufficient probability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment….” Accordingly, it cannot be said that Mr. Choplick acted unreasonably.</p>
<p class="indent">[This] brings us to the question of the further search for marihuana [after discovering the rolling papers]. T.L.O. contend[s] that the scope of the search Mr. Choplick conducted exceeded permissible bounds when he seized and read certain letters that implicated T.L.O. in drug dealing. This argument, too, is unpersuasive. The discovery of the rolling papers concededly gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that T.L.O. was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse. This suspicion justified further exploration of T.L.O.’s purse, which turned up more evidence of drug-related activities: a pipe, a number of plastic bags of the type commonly used to store marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a fairly substantial amount of money. Under these circumstances, it was not unreasonable to extend the search to a separate zippered compartment of the purse; and when a search of that compartment revealed an index card containing a list of “people who owe me money” as well as two letters, the inference that T.L.O. was involved in marihuana trafficking was substantial enough to justify Mr. Choplick in examining the letters to determine whether they contained any further evidence. In short, we cannot conclude that the search for marihuana was unreasonable in any respect.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the search resulting in the discovery of the evidence of marihuana dealing by T.L.O. was reasonable, the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision to exclude that evidence from T.L.O.’s juvenile delinquency proceedings on Fourth Amendment grounds was erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is reversed.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Brennan</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Marshall</span> joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p class="indent">Today’s decision sanctions school officials to conduct full-scale searches on a “reasonableness” standard whose only definite content is that it is <i>not</i> the same test as the “probable cause” standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by precedent nor even by a fair application of the “balancing test” it proclaims in this very opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">Three basic principles underly this Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. First, warrantless searches are <i>per se</i> unreasonable, subject only to a few</p>
<p><a id="page_623" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>623</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">specifically delineated and well-recognized exceptions. Second, full-scale searches—whether conducted in accordance with the warrant requirement or pursuant to one of its exceptions—are “reasonable” in Fourth Amendment terms only on a showing of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime will be found in the place to be searched. Third, categories of intrusions that are substantially less intrusive than full-scale searches or seizures may be justifiable in accordance with a balancing test even absent a warrant or probable cause, provided that the balancing test used gives sufficient weight to the privacy interests that will be infringed.</p>
<p class="indent">Assistant Vice Principal Choplick’s thorough excavation of T.L.O.’s purse was undoubtedly a serious intrusion on her privacy. Unlike the searches in <i>Terry v. Ohio</i> or <i>Adams v. Williams</i>, 407 U.S. 143 (1972), the search at issue here encompassed a detailed and minute examination of respondent’s pocketbook, in which the contents of private papers and letters were thoroughly scrutinized. Wisely, neither petitioner nor the Court today attempts to justify the search of T.L.O.’s pocketbook as a minimally intrusive search in the <i>Terry</i> line. To be faithful to the Court’s settled doctrine, the inquiry therefore must focus on the warrant and probable-cause requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court’s decision jettisons the probable-cause standard—the only standard that finds support in the text of the Fourth Amendment—on the basis of its Rohrschach-like “balancing test.” Use of such a “balancing test” to determine the standard for evaluating the validity of a full-scale search represents a sizable innovation in Fourth Amendment analysis. This innovation finds support neither in precedent nor policy and portends a dangerous weakening of the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect the privacy and security of our citizens. Moreover, even if this Court’s historic understanding of the Fourth Amendment were mistaken and a balancing test of some kind were appropriate, any such test that gave adequate weight to the privacy and security interests protected by the Fourth Amendment would not reach the preordained result the Court’s conclusory analysis reaches today. Therefore, because I believe that the balancing test used by the Court today is flawed both in its inception and in its execution, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Stevens</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Marshall</span> joins, and with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Brennan</span> joins as to Part I, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p class="indent">The “limited search for weapons” in <i>Terry</i> was justified by the “immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.” When viewed from the institutional perspective, “the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools” is no less acute. Violent, unlawful, or seriously disruptive conduct is fundamentally inconsistent with the principal function of teaching institutions which is to educate young people and prepare them for citizenship. When such conduct occurs amidst a sizable group of impressionable young people, it creates an explosive atmosphere that requires a prompt and effective response.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, warrantless searches of students by school administrators are reasonable when undertaken for those purposes. But the majority’s statement of the</p>
<p><a id="page_624" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>624</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">standard for evaluating the reasonableness of such searches is not suitably adapted to that end. The majority holds that “a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be ‘justified at its inception’ when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence <i>that the student has violated or is violating</i> either the law or <i>the rules of the school.</i>” This standard will permit teachers and school administrators to search students when they suspect that the search will reveal evidence of even the most trivial school regulation or precatory guideline for student behavior. The Court’s standard for deciding whether a search is justified “at its inception” treats all violations of the rules of the school as though they were fungible. For the Court, a search for curlers and sunglasses in order to enforce the school dress code is apparently just as important as a search for evidence of heroin addiction or violent gang activity.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority, however, does not contend that school administrators have a compelling need to search students in order to achieve optimum enforcement of minor school regulations. To the contrary, when minor violations are involved, there is every indication that the informal school disciplinary process, with only minimum requirements of due process, can function effectively without the power to search for enough evidence to prove a criminal case. In arguing that teachers and school administrators need the power to search students based on a lessened standard, the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> relies heavily on empirical evidence of a contemporary crisis of violence and unlawful behavior that is seriously undermining the process of education in American schools. A standard better attuned to this concern would permit teachers and school administrators to search a student when they have reason to believe that the search will uncover <i>evidence that the student is violating the law or engaging in conduct that is seriously disruptive of school order, or the educational process.</i></p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Should the Fourth Amendment apply to searches of students by school administrators? Did the Court start down a road of applying basic constitutional rights to students in <i>Goss v. Lopez</i> and <i>Tinker v. Des Moines</i> from which it could not reasonably reverse, or is there some basis on which the Court could have distinguished Fourth Amendment protections from First and Fourteenth Amendment protections? The Court’s opinion is conflicted on this score. It holds that the Fourth Amendment applies to school searches, but also holds the general standard of probable cause would be too burdensome for schools. What legal rationale does the Court offer for a lower standard in schools? Is the dissent correct that the majority fails to articulate a full justification for departing from probable cause?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Do minors actually have an expectation of privacy in schools? Do you agree with the Court’s balancing of the students’ interests against those of schools? Have privacy expectations today, in any way, diminished below those described by the Court? Does invading students’ privacy without a significant justification send them the wrong messages: that their rights are not important and that they will not necessarily be treated fairly?</p>
<p><a id="page_625" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>625</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Empirical research by Jason Nance indicates that schools may often conduct searches that violate students’ rights. Jason P. Nance, <i>Random, Suspicionless Searches of Public School Students’ Belongings: A Legal, Empirical, and Normative Analysis</i>, 84 <span class="smallcap">U. Colo. L. Rev.</span> 367 (2013). In fact, unconstitutional searches appear to happen so frequently that students may no longer hold a subjective expectation of privacy. Nance also surveys additional research showing that invasive or unjustified searches can lead to counterproductive school cultures in which students are defiant, disillusioned, and/or complacent. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">3. The Court reasons that “the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness in <i>T.L.O.</i>, under all the circumstances, of the search.” Notice that the Court adopts a two-pronged inquiry for evaluating searches for reasonableness: whether the search “was justified at its inception” by reasonable grounds for suspecting the search will turn up evidence of a rule or law violation and whether the search conducted “was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.” The Court also emphasizes that this analysis is applied to each step of the search, as each step can justify the next. Is the dissent correct that this standard is too broad and flexible and allows the school too much discretion? Is such a standard inherently necessary given the broad array of circumstances schools address?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Court adds that a reasonable basis or justification for a search does not mean an absolute certainty the search will turn up evidence of a violation, but rather “sufficient probability” is all that is required. What level of probability should be necessary: more likely than not, a substantial possibility, or some other standard? In the next case, <i>Safford v. Redding</i>, the Supreme Court will describe it as a “moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.”</p>
<p class="indent">5. As the dissent points out, the Court does not distinguish between minor and major infractions. Thus, this standard would permit the search for evidence of any infraction. Should the right to search based on mere reasonable suspicion be dependent on the seriousness of what is being searched for? Is a school’s interest in securing, for instance, a stolen pencil sufficient to justify a search of a student’s personal belongings? Had the Court attempted to draw a line between major and minor infractions, where could it have drawn the line?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Do schools actually need the evidence that they seek in these cases? Under the liberal rules in <i>Goss</i>, would testimony or other circumstantial evidence against a student be sufficient to discipline him? Could the school have suspended T.L.O. without ever having found the cigarettes?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Are other forms of searches in schools, such as metal detectors and dog sniffing, sufficiently intrusive to implicate Fourth Amendment protections?</p>
<p class="indent">8. In <i>Riley v. California</i>, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014), the Supreme Court held that police officers, save special circumstances, must obtain a search warrant to search the digital information on a person’s cellphone or smartphone. The Court emphasized that searching a smartphone implicates “privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse.” <i>Id</i>. at 2488-2489. While not a school case, this recognized privacy interest may have significant implications for students and their pervasive use of smartphones. <i>Riley</i>’s warrant requirement is in tension with the deferential</p>

<p class="h7" id="ch246">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Cross, a middle school English teacher, left her classroom to use the restroom. When she returned, Cross noticed that some small items were missing from her desk, including a paper weight that her mother had given her for Christmas. She became very upset and demanded that the guilty person or persons give it back immediately, but no one did. “Fine,” she stated, “everyone in the first row line up.” She then proceeded to pat down and search every student in the front row. The search included placing her hands in their pockets and going through their book bags. Finding nothing, she searched everyone in the second row. As they were sitting down and the third row was standing up, she heard some items hit the floor. She then saw Dan Brown reaching down toward the items.</p>
<p class="indent">“Dan, you should be ashamed of yourself. Go to the office,” she stated. Dan attempted to assert his innocence and explain, but Cross cut him off, saying she did not want to hear it. “You had your chance to speak up when I first came back in the room.” She sent Dan to the office with a note indicating that he had stolen some items from her desk. When Dan got to the office, Principal Clark read the note and shook his head in disgust. “Dan, I thought you had more sense than to do something like this.” Dan protested he had done nothing, but Clark responded that “Ms. Cross said you did.” Per the school handbook’s penalty for theft, Clark suspended Dan for five days.</p>
<p class="indent">Did Ms. Cross’s search of the students comport with constitutional requirements? Would it matter whether the last time she had seen the missing items was the previous school period? Was Dan’s suspension constitutional?</p>

<p class="indent">In <i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</i> the Court raised, but did not answer, three crucial issues in the footnotes: (1) whether students have a legitimate expectation of privacy in lockers, desks, or other school property; (2) what standard would</p>
<p><a id="page_627" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>627</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">apply if some other party, such as the police, conducted the search at the behest of a school official; and (3) “whether individualized suspicion is an essential element of the reasonableness standard” for school searches. The issue of suspicionless searches is taken up in the next section in the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Vernonia v. Acton</i>. The Court, however, has yet to resolve questions relating to police searches and expectations of privacy in lockers and analogous areas. Thus, these issues have been left to legislatures and lower courts.</p>
<p class="indent">In applying the <i>T.L.O.</i> framework, a few courts have found or assumed that students have an expectation of privacy in their lockers, desks, and other areas in school where they might store personal items. S.C. v. State, 583 So. 2d 188 (Miss. 1991); <i>In re</i> Dumas, 515 A.2d 984 (Pa. 1986); Commonwealth v. Cass, 666 A.2d 313 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1995); State v. Joseph T., 336 S.E.2d 728 (W. Va. 1985). They reason that, if a student has an expectation of privacy for a personal item, the expectation is not lost simply because the student places the item in a locker. Most courts, however, have reached the opposite conclusion, particularly in regard to lockers and desks. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Shoemaker v. State, 971 S.W.2d 178, 182 (Tex. App. 1998); <i>In re</i> Patrick Y., 358 Md. 50, 61 (2000). The rationale of these latter courts is further bolstered by states and localities that have enacted policies or statutes explicitly indicating that the lockers and desks are school property, and thus students have no expectation of privacy in them. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <span class="smallcap">Ark. Code Ann.</span> §6-21-608 (1987); <span class="smallcap">Minn. Stat. Ann.</span> §121A.72 (1998); 105 <span class="smallcap">Ill. Comp. Stat.</span> 5/10-22.6 (2013); <span class="smallcap">Ohio Rev. Code Ann.</span> §3313.20 (1995).</p>
<p class="indent">Insofar as students are on notice of their lack of privacy and it has a legitimate statutory basis, Supreme Court guidance may not be urgent. But the stakes are much higher and the opinions much more varied as to the legal standard that applies to invasive searches on school grounds conducted by someone other than a teacher or an administrator. The police presence and role in schools has grown exponentially since the Court’s decision in <i>T.L.O.</i> Students now are routinely subject to any number of searches that do not fall squarely within the doctrine articulated for searches by school administrators. <i>See generally</i> Nance, <i>supra</i>. In the absence of Supreme Court guidance or lower court consensus, students in different jurisdictions are subject to different rules.</p>
<p class="indent">The lack of consensus is somewhat understandable given the numerous different circumstances under which a search might occur. In general, lower courts have attempted to distinguish among (1) searches by school administrators who are enforcing discipline policies, (2) searches by school administrators who are assisting criminal enforcement officers, (3) searches by school resources officers or police who work for the school, and (4) searches by police officers who are carrying out criminal justice objectives. The following article offers a practical and legal overview.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch247">Lisa H. Thurau &amp; Johanna Wald, Controlling Partners: When Law Enforcement Meets Discipline in Public Schools</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>54 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 977 (2009/10)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In the past decade, police have moved into public schools in unprecedented numbers. Often referred to as “School Resource Officers,” (“SROs”) they have</p>
<p><a id="page_628" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>628</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">assumed a variety of roles that range from strict enforcers of rules and laws, to surrogate parents, to counselors and coaches, and to “an extra pair of hands” for school administrators. [But a] decade after police have become ubiquitous presences in schools across the country, the day-to-day activities and responsibilities of SROs still remain shrouded in mystery, are poorly understood by the public, parents, students, and even the courts, and are often subject to very different interpretations by police and school officials in each district.</p>
<p class="indent">Across the country, the issue of the legality of the use of police powers by administrators arises most regularly in the context of searches of students’ persons or possessions. Overall, state courts do not protect youth from searches by administrators. State courts do, however, offer administrators immunity from most claims that students’ Fourth Amendment rights have been violated. The “substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school grounds” is based on the consensus of parents and prosecutors alike that meeting the need for school safety justifies such incursions on students’ privacy.</p>
<p class="indent">With the passage of the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, the merging of school administrators and police as forces of law and order within schools led to complex arrangements, including the delegation and division of authority and labor. The result has been confusion among police and administrators that continues to this day. This confusion focuses on where administrators’ disciplinary roles stop and police powers begin, what conduct should be handled exclusively by school disciplinarians, and what conduct becomes an arrestable offense. Students, parents, teachers, the courts, and legislatures experience this confusion.</p>
<p class="indent">When police are introduced into these situations and are seen consulting with school administrators about whether and when to arrest, the administrators’ power is clearly enhanced. Police may not <i>explicitly</i> direct, control, or otherwise initiate or influence school administrators to undertake searches, but <i>implicitly</i>, this appears to occur. The access to SROs for consultation on whether an act is an arrestable offense increases the likelihood that school administrators will use such information for police functions. The result of these decisions suggests that school administrators’ roles in searches have usurped that of SROs; SROs instead play a more ministerial role, deciding how to use the information they obtain and whether to teach or punish youth.</p>
<p class="indent">Even a cursory review of hundreds of state court decisions shows courts’ disparate views of both the role of police in schools and the extent of police powers in the schools. This growing array of decisions manifests the degree to which the issue remains in flux in the courts—as well as in the schools—and the absence of a standard by which officers, police departments, school administrators, and youth advocates can chart their respective courses.</p>
<p class="indent">In case law, the scope of SROs’ rights has been explored with contradictory results. Factors including who <i>pays</i> the officer—the school or the police department—have been determinants in court decisions about the scope of power and obligations of SROs. In <i>People v. Dilworth</i>, an Illinois court ruled that the SRO, hired by an alternative school, could conduct searches of students for contraband in furtherance of school safety on a lesser Fourth Amendment standard of suspicion and without obligation to <i>Miranda</i>-ize the students</p>
<p><a id="page_629" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>629</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">searched. And in other decisions, the mere fact of being a police officer in the school was viewed as sufficient justification to reduce the standard of suspicion from probable cause to reasonable suspicion—the level of suspicion a school administrator needs to conduct and justify a search.</p>
<p class="indent">A line of cases now differentiates between SROs and “outside” officers. For SROs stationed in schools, Indiana and Tennessee courts have ruled that it is permissible to use a reasonable suspicion standard, while “outside” officers must abide by the probable cause standard. Another line of cases holds that if a police officer is doing what a school administrator would have done, the special powers and authority of the officer should not require special due process protections for students because the powers of the administrator and officer are equivalent. Similarly, if police support a search initiated by a school official <i>outside</i> of school, the reasonableness standard prevails because the state’s interest in keeping youth safe trumps youths’ due process protections.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall effects of these decisions must be confusing for America’s fifty-four million public school students. The bottom line looks like this: Administrators perform the duties of law enforcement, but retain the power of a school administrator. SROs may act like teachers and counselors, but they have the power and authority of law enforcement agents. SROs may become confidants of students, yet anything SROs hear, find, or receive from an administrator may be used to prosecute students. An officer dressed in uniform has the same rights of search and seizure as a school administrator and is not hired to handle disciplinary issues, yet the officer can arrest a student for disrespectful and disruptive conduct. A school administrator can ask students for information, which students must provide or face suspension. The school administrator may then give that information to the police who can arrest students.</p>
<p class="indent">This confusion becomes even more problematic when one recognizes that the presence of police in schools rests on the presumption that youth understand what conduct may be corrected as a disciplinary matter and what conduct will lead to arrest. Yet, if adults are experiencing difficulty distinguishing between the appropriate and inappropriate characterizations of such behaviors, it is certain that youth will be similarly or more confused. To be sure, youth are aware that fighting, hurting, and stealing are wrong and can sometimes lead to arrest. But most are unaware of some of the more nuanced aspects of the law, or the extent of an officer’s discretion, which can result in charges for less overt wrongdoing or passive participation leading to joint venture charges, disorderly conduct, simple assault, and resisting arrest.</p>
<p class="indent">The principle that “ignorance of the law will not excuse” is deep in our law, as is the principle that of all the powers of local government, the “police power is one of the least limitable.” But due process places some limits on its exercise. Engrained in our concept of due process is the requirement of notice. “Notice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty or forfeiture might be suffered….”</p>
<p class="indent">If notice is core to procedural and substantive due process rights, student handbooks are not sufficient. In schools where SROs work, rigorous effort on the part of school administrators and police officers to fully disclose and explain to youth—a group entitled to special treatment and protection under the law—the</p>
<p><a id="page_630" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>630</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">consequences of their misconduct would appear to be a core due process obligation.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is there a reason to treat searches by, at the behest of, or for the benefit of police differently from searches by educators and for educational and safety purposes? From the student’s perspective, does it matter who is searching them or what the purpose of the search is?</p>
<p class="indent">2. In dissent in <i>T.L.O.</i>, Justice Brennan argued that the Court had gone astray in justifying its reasonableness standard by balancing students’ interests in privacy against the governmental interest in the search. He argued that probable cause is the general standard and can be lowered only based on a few well-justified exceptions, one of which could have been for school discipline. Would this approach have resolved the uncertainties that have arisen with police and other searches in school?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Should police officers be present in school, or are schools places that should be reserved for students and educators? Does introducing noneducational officials, particularly law enforcement officers, undermine the sense of community, safety, and freedom that students might otherwise have, or is their presence necessary to protect these very things?</p>
<p class="indent">4. For a discussion of various other issues that <i>T.L.O.</i> raised but did not answer, see Barry C.

<p class="indent">Flooding schools with police officers has the direct effect of pushing children toward the track to prison. For many nonwhite students, school criminalization reflects the racial profiling, police harassment, and disproportionate incarceration that they see in their communities. When many [already] associate young, black men more with prisons than with higher education, [turning predominantly black schools into places that “resemble a prison…has a crushing effect,” particularly on students who have in the past been “traumatized by school police practices”]. Officers in criminalized schools have imposed harsh discipline for relatively minor infractions, causing irreparable harm to youths, who, because of their age, are particularly deserving of the opportunity to improve their behavior and achieve social and economic mobility.</p>
<p class="indent">By making punishment and suspicion constant elements of school life, police exacerbate the already troubling trend of disproportionately frequent</p>
<p><a id="page_631" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>631</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">discipline for nonwhite students. Racial disparities in school discipline, which have been documented for at least thirty-five years, are stark. For example, black students make up 34 percent of nationwide suspensions despite comprising 17 percent of the school population. Nonwhite students are far more likely than white students to be arrested, suspended, expelled, or exposed to corporal punishment for the same type of conduct. Such disparities cannot be considered rational, as nonwhite students do not misbehave with any greater frequency than white students. These trends are particularly troubling in the New York City school system, where, between 1999 and 2009, black students made up one-third of the student population but over half of all suspensions, and where nearly half of all offenses listed in the Discipline Code, including lateness and wearing a hat, can result in “removal from classroom” or suspension.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Normalizing Expectations of Prison</span></p>
<p class="indent">Given that one in nine black men aged 20-34 is incarcerated, and one in three “young black males live under some form of criminal justice control,” prison is likely something that black students are reminded of on a regular basis. Routine police contact in many nonwhite communities, combined with students in schools that resemble prisons, creates a culture of low expectations and fatalist attitudes. The constant police presence in criminalized schools represents to students that the school’s priority is controlling, not educating, them, and that prison is a normal and expected outcome. This message is reinforced by the merger of the criminalized culture students see inside their schools and the mass incarceration they see in their communities.</p>
<p class="indent">For some, school criminalization begs the question of when a school crosses over into being a “school” in name only. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant [sees a] merger between American prisons and urban ghettos:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent">Like inmates, these children are herded into decaying and overcrowded facilities built like bunkers, where undertrained and underpaid teachers, hampered by a shocking penury of equipment and supplies—many schools have no photocopying machines, library, science laboratory, or even functioning bathrooms, and use textbooks that are thirty-year-old rejects from suburban schools—strive to regulate conduct so as to maintain order and minimize violent incidents. The physical plant of most establishments resembles fortresses, complete with concertina wire on outside fences, bricked up windows, heavy locks on iron doors, metal detectors at the gates and hallways patrol[l]ed by armed guards who conduct spot checks and body searches between buildings. Over the years, essential educational programs have been cut to divert funds for more weapons scanners, cameras, emergency telephones, sign-in desks, and security personnel, whose duty is to repel unwanted intruders from the outside and hem students inside the school’s walls.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">These schools, already severely lacking in resources and student services, further hamper their students with the stigma of criminalization and, often, tainted academic and criminal records. In these mostly nonwhite schools, the prison track has become the norm, and academic achievement the aberration.</p>
<p><a id="page_632" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>632</b></a></p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Are there academic and educational costs of heavily policing schools? Do the costs of current discipline policy and the presence of police in schools outweigh the benefits, particularly for minority students? Can we keep schools safe without turning them into “prisons”?</p>
<p class="indent">2. What message does heavily policing students in school send to students? Does this message and treatment actually perpetuate behavior that then feeds negative stereotypes of minority students?</p>
<p class="indent">3. If schools are going to be heavily policed, should the Constitution mandate a more detailed student discipline code than the one envisioned by the Court in <i>Goss</i>? Have the assumptions that underpinned <i>Goss</i>’s more deferential approach to school administrators eroded?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">Almost 25 years passed before the Supreme Court took up its second case addressing a school search based on individualized suspicion. As discussed in the forgoing materials, the flexibility afforded schools in <i>T.L.O.</i> and other cases permitted schools to aggressively enforce school disciplinary policies. Since <i>T.L.O.</i>, many charge that some schools have taken their efforts too far. In the case below, the Court evaluated a particularly intrusive search of a student and found that it was unconstitutional. The Court reiterates its holding from <i>T.L.O.</i>, but is more skeptical of the school’s search and more concerned with the invasion of privacy. As you read the case, consider whether <i>Safford v. Redding</i> simply raises an egregious set of facts or signals that the Court is now willing to temper some of the discretion it previously afforded schools in discipline matters.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch249">Safford v. Redding</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>557 U.S. 364 (2009)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Souter</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student’s Fourth Amendment right was violated when she was subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by school officials acting on reasonable suspicion that she had brought forbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school. Because there were no reasons to suspect the drugs presented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we hold that the search did violate the Constitution.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The assistant principal of [Stafford Middle School], Kerry Wilson, came into [13-year-old Savana Redding’s math class] and asked Savana to go to his office. There, he showed her a day planner [containing] several knives, lighters, a permanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana whether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a few days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa Glines. Savana stated that none of the items in the planner belonged to her.</p>
<p><a id="page_633" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>633</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription-strength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter blue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflammation but banned under school rules without advance permission. He [questioned her about the pills and the report that she had been giving them to other students]. Savana [denied the report and said she knew nothing about the pills. She then consented to a search of her belongings by Wilson and Helen Romero, an administrative assistant. Upon finding nothing,] Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana to the school nurse’s office to search her clothes for pills. Romero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to remove her jacket, socks, and shoes, [and then asked her to remove her clothes]. Finally, Savana was told to pull her bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.</p>
<p class="indent">Savana’s mother filed suit against Safford Unified School District, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for conducting a strip search in violation of Savana’s Fourth Amendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of qualified immunity. The District Court granted the motion, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc reversed. We granted certiorari and now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Fourth Amendment “right of the people to be secure in their persons…against unreasonable searches and seizures” generally requires a law enforcement officer to have probable cause for conducting a search. In <i>T.L.O.</i>, we recognized that the school setting “requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search”[.] We have thus applied a standard of reasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school administrator’s search of a student, and have held that a school search “will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction”[.]</p>
<p class="indent">A number of our cases on probable cause have an implicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of reasonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the knowledge component by looking to the degree to which known facts imply prohibited conduct, the specificity of the information received, and the reliability of its source. At the end of the day, however, we have realized that these factors cannot rigidly control, and we have come back to saying that the standards are “fluid concepts that take their substantive content from the particular contexts” in which they are being assessed.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the required knowledge component of probable cause for a law enforcement officer’s evidence search is that it raises a “fair probability” or a “substantial chance” of discovering evidence of criminal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could as readily be described as a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p><a id="page_634" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>634</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In this case, the school’s policies strictly prohibit the nonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds, including “‘[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter drug, except those for which permission to use in school has been granted pursuant to Board policy.’” A week before Savana was searched, another student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the school’s administrative assistant), told the principal and Assistant Principal Wilson that “certain students were bringing drugs and weapons on campus,” and that he had been sick after taking some pills that “he got from a classmate.” On the morning of October 8, the same boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa Glines had given him. He told Wilson that students were planning to take the pills at lunch.</p>
<p class="indent">Wilson learned from the school nurse, that the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by prescription. [Wilson then went to Marissa’s classroom and, within her reach, found the day planner and the contraband inside it.] Wilson escorted Marissa back to his office.</p>
<p class="indent">In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested Marissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet. Marissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade. [Marissa stated that she had gotten the ibuprofen from Savana Redding. She, however, denied knowing anything about the contents of the planner.] Wilson did not ask Marissa any follow-up questions to determine whether there was any likelihood that Savana presently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received the pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding them.</p>
<p class="indent">[Through a poison control hotline Wilson determined that the blue pill was] an anti-inflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available over the counter. At Wilson’s direction, Marissa was then subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Romero and Schwallier, as Savana was later on. The search revealed no additional pills.</p>
<p class="indent">Wilson [then] called Savana into his office and showed her the day planner. Their conversation established that Savana and Marissa were on friendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contraband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and that she had lent it to Marissa. Wilson had other reports of their friendship from staff members, who had identified Savana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group at the school’s opening dance in August, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls’ bathroom. Wilson had reason to connect the girls with this contraband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the principal that before the dance, he had been at a party at Savana’s house where alcohol was served. Marissa’s statement that the pills came from Savana was thus sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution.</p>
<p class="indent">This suspicion of Wilson’s was enough to justify a search of Savana’s backpack and outer clothing. If a student is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in the carryall that has become an item of student uniform in most places today. If Wilson’s reasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not understood</p>
<p><a id="page_635" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>635</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth making. And the look into Savana’s bag, in her presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson’s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero’s subsequent search of her outer clothing.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana’s claim that extending the search to the point of making her pull out her underwear was constitutionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step in the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a fair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed Savana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and then “pull out” her bra and the elastic band on her underpants. Although Romero and Schwallier stated that they did not see anything when Savana followed their instructions, we would not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment consequences in a way that would guarantee litigation about who was looking and how much was seen. The very fact of Savana’s pulling her underwear away from her body in the presence of the two officials who were able to see her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.</p>
<p class="indent">Savana’s subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her expectation (required by the Fourth Amendment standard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other young people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure [(citing various studies)]. The common reaction of these adolescents simply registers the obviously different meaning of a search exposing the body from the experience of nakedness or near undress in other school circumstances. Changing for gym is getting ready for play; exposing for a search is responding to an accusation reserved for suspected wrongdoers and fairly understood as so degrading that a number of communities have decided that strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have banned them no matter what the facts may be.</p>
<p class="indent">The indignity of the search does not, of course, outlaw it, but it does implicate the rule of reasonableness as stated in <i>T.L.O.</i>, that “the search as actually conducted [be] reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.” The scope will be permissible, that is, when it is “not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.”</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills were prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter naproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil, or one Aleve. He must have been aware of the nature and limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for, and while just about anything can be taken</p>
<p><a id="page_636" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>636</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">in quantities that will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual students were receiving great numbers of pills.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners suggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that “students…hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,” and cite a smattering of cases of students with contraband in their underwear. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness of a search down to the body of an adolescent requires some justification in suspected facts, general background possibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous school contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of any general practice among Safford Middle School students of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was doing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that Wilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even determined when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the pills on her person, much less in her underwear.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that pointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity, and any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills in her underwear. We think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the assistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his motive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school and protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone through. Parents are known to overreact to protect their children from danger, and a school official with responsibility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is that the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official, even with the high degree of deference that courts must pay to the educator’s professional judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">We do mean, though, to make it clear that the <i>T.L.O.</i> concern to limit a school search to reasonable scope requires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing before a search can reasonably make the quantum leap from outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate parts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demanding its own specific suspicions.</p>

<p class="indent">The strip search of Savana Redding was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are nevertheless protected from liability through qualified immunity [because the law was not sufficiently clear to put them on notice of potential liability prior to our decision in this case]. Our conclusions here do not resolve, however, the question of the liability of petitioner Safford Unified School District under </p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.</i>, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not address. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is remanded for consideration of the <i>Monell</i> claim.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What is it about this particular search that makes it constitutionally too invasive: the presence of multiple people while it was taking place, her youth and vulnerability, the intimate bodily invasion, a combination of these factors, or something else?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The Court finds that the school officials had reasonable suspicion to search Savana’s backpack and outer clothing, but the search of her undergarments was unreasonable in scope. If, however, the officials had reasonable suspicion that drugs were on her, does the failure to discover them in her backpack or outer clothing lead to the reasonable suspicion that they were hidden in her undergarments? Would such reasoning lead to extensive searches in most situations? Was <i>T.L.O.</i>’s analysis of the scope of a search distinct from <i>Safford</i>?</p>
<p class="indent">3. In finding the search unreasonable, the Court also dismisses the notion the contraband would be stashed in undergarments. Are undergarments natural places to hide contraband, particularly now that the Court has indicated searches of them are invasive and more likely to be unreasonable?</p>
<p class="indent">4. In <i>T.L.O.</i>, the Court indicated that it would not assess how serious or important the suspected infraction was in determining whether a search was permissible. Rather, all potential violations of school rules would justify searches. Does the Court in <i>Safford</i> backtrack on this position when it suggests these particular drugs were not that dangerous? The Court in <i>Safford</i> also suggests that the school “overreacted” to a perceived threat, but in the past the Court has been deferential toward schools in these situations. What explains the Court’s willingness to second-guess school officials here? Is this a sign of a new trend, or a case that will be limited to its facts in the future?</p>
<p class="indent">At least one post-<i>Safford</i> lower court opinion has suggested that school districts ought to proceed with more caution in conducting intrusive searches. The court in <i>In re T.A.S.</i>, 713 S.E.2d 211 (N.C. Ct. App. 2011), reasoned that, in regard to a search involving a “bra-lift,” school officials should have asked additional questions of informants “to determine the exigency of the situation” and “the nature of the substances in question.…Moreover, while not expedient but to ensure Fourth Amendment protections along with the dignity and sanctity of T.A.S. and the other girls, T.A.S.’s parents could have been called” prior to the search. <i>Id.</i> at 219.</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch250">2. <i>Suspicionless Searches</i></p>
<p class="noindent">The Court’s opinions in <i>T.L.O</i>. and <i>Safford</i> involve the search of individual students based on suspicion of individual students. The next two cases address an</p>
<p><a id="page_638" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>638</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">entirely different situation: blanket searches of students with no individualized suspicion of any student. These types of searches have become more frequent as schools attempt to rid the environment of drugs and weapons. For instance, some schools search every student for weapons with a metal detector as he or she walks through the door. Some schools have also instituted broad drug testing regimes that subject wide swaths of students to testing, even though most students have done nothing to arouse any suspicion. Putting aside whether these searches are effective or good policy, these blanket searches raise the constitutional question of whether they ought to be subject to the individualized requirement of <i>T.L.O.</i> Under individualized suspicion requirements, schools would be unable to search most students for drugs or weapons, and some drug use and weapons possession would go undetected. But unless courts require individualized suspicion, countless innocent students would be subject to invasions of privacy. Which of these two interests weighs the heaviest, the need to search or the protection of privacy? If some standard other than individualized reasonable suspicion were going to apply, what should it be?</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch251">Vernonia School District v. Acton</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>515 U.S. 646 (1995)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Scalia</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">The Student Athlete Drug Policy adopted by School District 47J in the town of Vernonia, Oregon, authorizes random urinalysis drug testing of students who participate in the District’s school athletics programs. We granted certiorari to decide whether this violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In the mid-to-late 1980’s, teachers and administrators observed a sharp increase in drug use [in Vernonia’s schools]. Students began to speak out about their attraction to the drug culture, and to boast that there was nothing the school could do about it. Along with more drugs came more disciplinary problems. Between 1988 and 1989 the number of disciplinary referrals in Vernonia schools rose to more than twice the number reported in the early 1980’s. Students became increasingly rude during class; outbursts of profane language became common.</p>
<p class="indent">[S]tudent athletes were the leaders of the drug culture. This caused the District’s administrators particular concern, since drug use increases the risk of sports-related injury. Expert testimony at the trial confirmed the deleterious effects of drugs on motivation, memory, judgment, reaction, coordination, and performance. The high school football and wrestling coach witnessed a severe sternum injury suffered by a wrestler, and various omissions of safety procedures and misexecutions by football players, all attributable in his belief to the effects of drug use.</p>
<p><a id="page_639" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>639</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Initially, the District responded to the drug problem by offering special classes, speakers, and presentations designed to deter drug use. It even brought in a specially trained dog to detect drugs, but the drug problem persisted. According to the District Court, [athletes and much of the student body were in rebellion, and disciplinary problems and classroom disruptions had multiplied. Administrators concluded these problems were the result of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and their glamorization. In response, the school board implemented a drug testing policy “to prevent student athletes from using drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide drug users with assistance programs.”]</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Policy applies to all students participating in interscholastic athletics. Students wishing to play sports must sign a form consenting to the testing and must obtain the written consent of their parents. Athletes are tested at the beginning of the season for their sport. In addition, once each week of the season the names of the athletes are placed in a “pool” from which a student, with the supervision of two adults, blindly draws the names of 10% of the athletes for random testing. Those selected are notified and tested that same day, if possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The student to be tested completes a specimen control form which bears an assigned number. Prescription medications that the student is taking must be identified by providing a copy of the prescription or a doctor’s authorization. The student then enters an empty locker room accompanied by an adult monitor of the same sex. Each boy selected produces a sample at a urinal, remaining fully clothed with his back to the monitor, who stands approximately 12 to 15 feet behind the student. Monitors may (though do not always) watch the student while he produces the sample, and they listen for normal sounds of urination. Girls produce samples in an enclosed bathroom stall, so that they can be heard but not observed. After the sample is produced, it is given to the monitor, who checks it for temperature and tampering and then transfers it to a vial.</p>
<p class="indent">The samples are sent to an independent laboratory, which routinely tests them for amphetamines, cocaine, and marijuana. Other drugs may be screened at the request of the District, but the identity of a particular student does not determine which drugs will be tested. The District follows strict procedures regarding the chain of custody and access to test results. The laboratory does not know the identity of the students whose samples it tests. Only the superintendent, principals, vice-principals, and athletic directors have access to test results, and the results are not kept for more than one year.</p>
<p class="indent">If a sample tests positive, a second test is administered as soon as possible to confirm the result. If the second test is negative, no further action is taken. If the second test is positive, the athlete’s parents are notified, and the school principal convenes a meeting with the student and his parents, at which the student is given the option of (1) participating for six weeks in an assistance program that includes weekly urinalysis, or (2) suffering suspension from athletics for the remainder of the current season and the next athletic season. The student is then retested prior to the start of the next athletic season for which he or she is eligible. The Policy states that a second offense results in automatic imposition of</p>
<p><a id="page_640" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>640</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">option (2); a third offense in suspension for the remainder of the current season and the next two athletic seasons.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">As the text of the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is “reasonableness.” At least in a case such as this, where there was no clear practice, either approving or disapproving the type of search at issue, at the time the constitutional provision was enacted, whether a particular search meets the reasonableness standard “‘is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.’” Where a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, this Court has said that reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant. But a warrant is not required to establish the reasonableness of <i>all</i> government searches; and when a warrant is not required, probable cause is not invariably required either. A search unsupported by probable cause can be constitutional, we have said, “when special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.”</p>
<p class="indent">We have found such “special needs” to exist in the public school context. The school search we approved in <i>T.L.O.</i>, while not based on probable cause, <i>was</i> based on individualized <i>suspicion</i> of wrongdoing. As we explicitly acknowledged, however, “‘the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.’” We have upheld suspicionless searches and seizures to conduct drug testing of railroad personnel involved in train accidents, to conduct random drug testing of federal customs officers who carry arms or are involved in drug interdiction, and to maintain automobile checkpoints looking for illegal immigrants and contraband, and drunk drivers.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The first factor to be considered is the nature of the privacy interest upon which the search here at issue intrudes. The Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective expectations of privacy, but only those that society recognizes as “legitimate.” What expectations are legitimate varies with context, depending, for example, upon whether the individual asserting the privacy interest is at home, at work, in a car, or in a public park. In addition, the legitimacy of certain privacy expectations vis-à-vis the State may depend upon the individual’s legal relationship with the State. For example, in <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin</i>, 483 U.S. 868 (1987), we held that, although a “probationer’s home, like anyone else’s, is protected by the Fourth Amendmen[t],” the supervisory relationship between probationer and State justifies “a degree of impingement upon [a probationer’s] privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at large.” Central, in our view, to the present case is the fact that the subjects of the Policy are (1) children, who (2) have been committed to the temporary custody of the State as schoolmaster.</p>
<p><a id="page_641" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>641</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">[U]nemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental rights of self-determination—including even the right of liberty in its narrow sense, <i>i.e.</i>, the right to come and go at will. They are subject, even as to their physical freedom, to the control of their parents or guardians.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>T.L.O.</i> we rejected the notion that public schools, like private schools, exercise only parental power over their students, which of course is not subject to constitutional constraints. But while denying that the State’s power over schoolchildren is formally no more than the delegated power of their parents, <i>T.L.O.</i> did not deny, but indeed emphasized, that the nature of that power is custodial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults. “[A] proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.” While we do not, of course, suggest that public schools as a general matter have such a degree of control over children as to give rise to a constitutional “duty to protect,” we have acknowledged that for many purposes “school authorities ac[t] <i>in loco parentis</i>” with the power and indeed the duty to “inculcate the habits and manners of civility.” Thus, while children assuredly do not “shed their constitutional rights…at the schoolhouse gate,” the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth Amendment rights, no less than First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, are different in public schools than elsewhere; the “reasonableness” inquiry cannot disregard the schools’ custodial and tutelary responsibility for children. For their own good and that of their classmates, public school children are routinely required to submit to various physical examinations, and to be vaccinated against various diseases. In the 1991-1992 school year, all 50 States required public school students to be vaccinated against diphtheria, measles, rubella, and polio. Particularly with regard to medical examinations and procedures, therefore, “students within the school environment have a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the population generally.”</p>
<p class="indent">Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with regard to student athletes. School sports are not for the bashful. They require “suiting up” before each practice or event, and showering and changing afterwards. Public school locker rooms are not notable for the privacy they afford. The locker rooms in Vernonia are typical: No individual dressing rooms are provided; shower heads are lined up along a wall, unseparated by any sort of partition or curtain; not even all the toilet stalls have doors. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has noted, there is “an element of ‘communal undress’ inherent in athletic participation.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is an additional respect in which school athletes have a reduced expectation of privacy. By choosing to “go out for the team,” they voluntarily subject themselves to a degree of regulation even higher than that imposed on students generally. In Vernonia’s public schools, they must submit to a preseason physical exam, they must acquire adequate insurance coverage or sign an insurance waiver, maintain a minimum grade point average, and comply with any “rules of conduct, dress, training hours and related matters as may be established for each sport by the head coach and athletic director with the principal’s</p>
<p><a id="page_642" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>642</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">approval.” Somewhat like adults who choose to participate in a “closely regulated industry,” students who voluntarily participate in school athletics have reason to expect intrusions upon normal rights and privileges, including privacy.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">Having considered the scope of the legitimate expectation of privacy at issue here, we turn next to the character of the intrusion that is complained of. We recognized in <i>Skinner</i> that collecting the samples for urinalysis intrudes upon “an excretory function traditionally shielded by great privacy.” We noted, however, that the degree of intrusion depends upon the manner in which production of the urine sample is monitored. Under the District’s Policy, male students produce samples at a urinal along a wall. They remain fully clothed and are only observed from behind, if at all. Female students produce samples in an enclosed stall, with a female monitor standing outside listening only for sounds of tampering. These conditions are nearly identical to those typically encountered in public restrooms, which schoolchildren use daily. Under such conditions, the privacy interests compromised by the process of obtaining the urine sample are in our view negligible.</p>
<p class="indent">The other privacy-invasive aspect of urinalysis is, of course, the information it discloses. In this regard it is significant that the tests at issue here look only for drugs, and not for whether the student is, for example, epileptic, pregnant, or diabetic. Moreover, the drugs for which the samples are screened are standard, and do not vary according to the identity of the student. And finally, the results of the tests are disclosed only to a limited class of school personnel who have a need to know; and they are not turned over to law enforcement authorities or used for any internal disciplinary function.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents argue, however, that the District’s Policy is in fact more intrusive than this suggests, because it requires the students, if they are to avoid sanctions for a falsely positive test, to identify <i>in advance</i> prescription medications they are taking. We agree that this raises some cause for concern. In <i>Von Raab</i>, we flagged as one of the salutary features of the Customs Service drug-testing program the fact that employees were not required to disclose medical information unless they tested positive, and, even then, the information was supplied to a licensed physician rather than to the Government employer. On the other hand, we have never indicated that requiring advance disclosure of medications is <i>per se</i> unreasonable. Indeed, in <i>Skinner</i> we held that it was not “a significant invasion of privacy.” It can be argued that, in <i>Skinner</i>, the disclosure went only to the medical personnel taking the sample, and the Government personnel analyzing it; and that disclosure to teachers and coaches—to persons who personally <i>know</i> the student—is a greater invasion of privacy. Assuming for the sake of argument that both those propositions are true, we do not believe they establish a difference that respondents are entitled to rely on here [because it] may well be that, if and when James [Acton] was selected for random testing at a time that he was taking medication, the School District would have permitted him to provide the requested information in a confidential manner—for example, in a sealed envelope delivered to the testing lab. Nothing in the Policy</p>
<p><a id="page_643" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>643</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">contradicts that, and when respondents choose, in effect, to challenge the Policy on its face, we will not assume the worst.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">V</span></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we turn to consider the nature and immediacy of the governmental concern at issue here, and the efficacy of this means for meeting it. That the nature of the concern is important—indeed, perhaps compelling—can hardly be doubted. Deterring drug use by our Nation’s schoolchildren is at least as important as enhancing efficient enforcement of the Nation’s laws against the importation of drugs, which was the governmental concern in <i>Von Raab</i>, or deterring drug use by engineers and trainmen, which was the governmental concern in <i>Skinner</i>. School years are the time when the physical, psychological, and addictive effects of drugs are most severe. “Maturing nervous systems are more critically impaired by intoxicants than mature ones are; childhood losses in learning are lifelong and profound”; “children grow chemically dependent more quickly than adults, and their record of recovery is depressingly poor.” And of course the effects of a drug-infested school are visited not just upon the users, but upon the entire student body and faculty, as the educational process is disrupted. In the present case, moreover, the necessity for the State to act is magnified by the fact that this evil is being visited not just upon individuals at large, but upon children for whom it has undertaken a special responsibility of care and direction. Finally, it must not be lost sight of that this program is directed more narrowly to drug use by school athletes, where the risk of immediate physical harm to the drug user or those with whom he is playing his sport is particularly high. Apart from psychological effects, which include impairment of judgment, slow reaction time, and a lessening of the perception of pain, the particular drugs screened by the District’s Policy have been demonstrated to pose substantial physical risks to athletes.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the immediacy of the District’s concerns: We are not inclined to question the District Court’s conclusion that “a large segment of the student body, particularly those involved in interscholastic athletics, was in a state of rebellion,” that “[d]isciplinary actions had reached ‘epidemic proportions,’” and that “the rebellion was being fueled by alcohol and drug abuse as well as by the student’s misperceptions about the drug culture.” That is an immediate crisis of greater proportions than existed in [other cases where we upheld drug testing even though there was no documented problem of past drug use].</p>
<p class="indent">As to the efficacy of this means for addressing the problem: It seems to us self-evident that a drug problem largely fueled by the “role model” effect of athletes’ drug use, and of particular danger to athletes, is effectively addressed by making sure that athletes do not use drugs. Respondents argue that a “less intrusive means to the same end” was available, namely, “drug testing on suspicion of drug use.” We have repeatedly refused to declare that only the “least intrusive” search practicable can be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Respondents’ alternative entails substantial difficulties—if it is indeed practicable at all. It may be impracticable, for one thing, simply because the parents who are willing to accept random drug testing for athletes are not willing</p>
<p><a id="page_644" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>644</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to accept accusatory drug testing for all students, which transforms the process into a badge of shame. Respondents’ proposal brings the risk that teachers will impose testing arbitrarily upon troublesome but not drug—likely students. It generates the expense of defending lawsuits that charge such arbitrary imposition, or that simply demand greater process before accusatory drug testing is imposed. And not least of all, it adds to the ever-expanding diversionary duties of schoolteachers the new function of spotting and bringing to account drug abuse, a task for which they are ill prepared, and which is not readily compatible with their vocation.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VI</span></p>
<p class="indent">Taking into account all the factors we have considered above—the decreased expectation of privacy, the relative unobtrusiveness of the search, and the severity of the need met by the search—we conclude Vernonia’s Policy is reasonable and hence constitutional.</p>
<p class="indent">We caution against the assumption that suspicionless drug testing will readily pass constitutional muster in other contexts. The most significant element in this case is the first we discussed: that the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government’s responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care.</p>
<p class="indent">It is so ordered.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice O’Connor</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Stevens</span> and <span class="smallcap">Justice Souter</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">By the reasoning of today’s decision, the millions of students who participate in interscholastic sports, an overwhelming majority of whom have given school officials no reason whatsoever to suspect they use drugs at school, are open to an intrusive bodily search.</p>
<p class="indent">In justifying this result, the Court dispenses with a requirement of individualized suspicion on considered policy grounds. First, it explains that precisely because <i>every</i> student athlete is being tested, there is no concern that school officials might act arbitrarily in choosing whom to test. Second, a broad-based search regime, the Court reasons, dilutes the accusatory nature of the search. In making these policy arguments, of course, the Court sidesteps powerful, countervailing privacy concerns. Blanket searches, because they can involve “thousands or millions” of searches, “pos[e] a greater threat to liberty” than do suspicion-based ones, which “affec[t] one person at a time.” Searches based on individualized suspicion also afford potential targets considerable control over whether they will, in fact, be searched because a person can avoid such a search by not acting in an objectively suspicious way. And given that the surest way to avoid acting suspiciously is to avoid the underlying wrongdoing, the costs of such a regime, one would think, are minimal.</p>
<p class="indent">For most of our constitutional history, mass, suspicionless searches have been generally considered <i>per se</i> unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. And we have allowed exceptions in recent years only where it has been clear that a suspicion-based regime would be ineffectual. Because that is not the case here, I dissent.</p>
<p><a id="page_645" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>645</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The view that mass, suspicionless searches, however evenhanded, are generally unreasonable remains inviolate in the criminal law enforcement context at least where the search is more than minimally intrusive.</p>
<p class="indent">Outside the criminal context, however, in response to the exigencies of modern life, our cases have upheld several evenhanded blanket searches, including some that are more than minimally intrusive, after balancing the invasion of privacy against the government’s strong need. Most of these cases, of course, are distinguishable insofar as they involved searches either not of a personally intrusive nature, such as searches of closely regulated businesses, or arising in unique contexts such as prisons.</p>
<p class="indent">In any event, in many of the cases that can be distinguished on the grounds suggested above and, more important, in <i>all</i> of the cases that cannot, we upheld the suspicionless search only after first recognizing the Fourth Amendment’s longstanding preference for a suspicion-based search regime, and then pointing to sound reasons why such a regime would likely be ineffectual under the unusual circumstances presented. The obvious negative implication of this reasoning is that, if such an individualized suspicion requirement would <i>not</i> place the government’s objectives in jeopardy, the requirement should not be forsaken.</p>
<p class="indent">[I]n the area of intrusive personal searches, the only recognized exception is for situations in which a suspicion-based scheme would be likely ineffectual. Far from acknowledging anything special about individualized suspicion, the Court treats a suspicion-based regime as if it were just any run-of-the-mill, less intrusive alternative—that is, an alternative that officials may bypass if the lesser intrusion, in their reasonable estimation, is outweighed by policy concerns unrelated to practicability.</p>
<p class="indent">But having misconstrued the fundamental role of the individualized suspicion requirement in Fourth Amendment analysis, the Court never seriously engages the practicality of such a requirement in the instant case. And that failure is crucial because nowhere is it <i>less</i> clear that an individualized suspicion requirement would be ineffectual than in the school context. In most schools, the entire pool of potential search targets—students—is under constant supervision by teachers and administrators and coaches, be it in classrooms, hallways, or locker rooms.</p>
<p class="indent">The record here indicates that the Vernonia schools are no exception. The great irony of this case is that most (though not all) of the evidence the District introduced to justify its suspicionless drug testing program consisted of first- or second-hand stories of particular, identifiable students acting in ways that plainly gave rise to reasonable suspicion of in-school drug use—and thus that would have justified a drug-related search under our <i>T.L.O.</i> decision. Small groups of students, for example, were observed by a teacher “passing joints back and forth” across the street at a restaurant before school and during school hours. Another group was caught skipping school and using drugs at one of the students’ houses. Several students actually <i>admitted</i> their drug use to school officials (some of them being caught with marijuana pipes). One student presented himself to his teacher as “clearly obviously inebriated” and had to be sent home. Still another was observed dancing and singing at</p>
<p><a id="page_646" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>646</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the top of his voice in the back of the classroom; when the teacher asked what was going on, he replied, “Well, I’m just high on life.” To take a final example, on a certain road trip, the school wrestling coach smelled marijuana smoke in a motel room occupied by four wrestlers, an observation that (after some questioning) would probably have given him reasonable suspicion to test one or all of them.</p>
<p class="indent">In light of all this evidence of drug use by particular students, there is a substantial basis for concluding that a vigorous regime of suspicion-based testing (for which the District appears already to have rules in place) would have gone a long way toward solving Vernonia’s school drug problem while preserving the Fourth Amendment rights of James Acton and others like him. And were there any doubt about such a conclusion, it is removed by indications in the record that suspicion-based testing could have been supplemented by an equally vigorous campaign to have Vernonia’s parents encourage their children to submit to the District’s <i>voluntary</i> drug testing program. In these circumstances, the Fourth Amendment dictates that a mass, suspicionless search regime is categorically unreasonable.</p>
<p class="indent">I recognize that a suspicion-based scheme, even where reasonably effective in controlling in-school drug use, may not be <i>as</i> effective as a mass, suspicionless testing regime. In one sense, that is obviously true—just as it is obviously true that suspicion-based law enforcement is not as effective as mass, suspicionless enforcement might be. “But there is nothing new in the realization” that Fourth Amendment protections come with a price. Indeed, the price we pay is higher in the criminal context, given that police do not closely observe the entire class of potential search targets (all citizens in the area) and must ordinarily adhere to the rigid requirements of a warrant and probable cause.</p>
<p class="indent">The principal counterargument to all this, central to the Court’s opinion, is that the Fourth Amendment is more lenient with respect to school searches. That is no doubt correct, for schools have traditionally had special guardian-like responsibilities for children that necessitate a degree of constitutional leeway. This principle explains the considerable Fourth Amendment leeway we gave school officials in <i>T.L.O.</i> In that case, we held that children at school do not enjoy two of the Fourth Amendment’s traditional categorical protections against unreasonable searches and seizures: the warrant requirement and the probable cause requirement.</p>
<p class="indent">The instant case, however, asks whether the Fourth Amendment is even more lenient than that, <i>i.e.</i>, whether it is <i>so</i> lenient that students may be deprived of the Fourth Amendment’s only remaining, and most basic, categorical protection: its strong preference for an individualized suspicion requirement, with its accompanying antipathy toward personally intrusive, blanket searches of mostly innocent people. It is not at all clear that people in <i>prison</i> lack this categorical protection, and we have said “[W]e are not yet ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need be equated for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.” Thus, if we are to mean what we often proclaim—that students do not “shed their constitutional rights…at the schoolhouse gate,”—the answer must plainly be no.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The Court points out that it previously upheld suspicionless searches in connection with train accidents, drug testing customs officers who carry weapons or are involved in drug interdiction, and automobile checkpoints that seek to identify illegal immigrants, contraband, and drunk drivers. Did the Court persuasively establish a special needs exception from reasonable suspicion in the instant case? What balancing test or factors does it use to determine whether this suspicionless search is reasonable?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Would an individualized suspicion regime, per the notes in <i>T.L.O.</i>, be sufficient to address the drug problem in schools? If so, is a suspicionless search regime justified? Assuming there is a serious drug problem in a school and the amount of effort necessary to root it out under an individualized suspicion regime is likely significant, would such a regime lead to circumstances where educators’ days are dominated by investigation? Is that just a temporary price we must pay to respect innocent students’ privacy?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Can one reconcile the absence of a constitutional duty by schools to protect students from harm with a school’s authority to invade students’ constitutional rights to privacy?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Court emphasizes that students voluntarily participate in sports, but is it fair to characterize and justify these searches as voluntary? In other words, the parent and student in this case object to the drug test and argue the opportunity to participate in a school activity is conditioned on the violation of their constitutional rights. Should schools be able to force students to choose between privacy and participating in school activities?</p>
<p class="indent">5. How significant is the invasion of privacy here? Is this a run-of-the-mill urine test as the majority suggests, or does it pose serious concerns, particularly for students who may be on medication for conditions they do not wish to disclose? Do, in fact, student athletes have a lower expectation of privacy?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Is the student drug testing in this case limited to its facts (dangers of participation in sports, drug epidemic led by athletes), or does it establish precedent for extending drug testing to other extracurricular activities and potentially the entire student population?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Schools routinely conduct any number of other suspicionless searches of students and their property, such as forcing students to pass through metal detectors and using dogs to sniff out drugs in lockers, in cars, and on persons. Schools’ interests in conducting these searches is generally equivalent to the interests in <i>Vernonia</i>, but the invasion of students’ privacy is generally lower. Per this reasoning, courts have easily upheld the use of metal detectors. <i>See, e.g.</i>, People v. Latasha W., 70 Cal. Rptr. 2d 886 (Ct. App. 1998) (approving use of hand-held metal detectors to randomly wand students for weapons); State v. J.A., 679 So. 2d 316 (Fla. Ct. App. 1996); People v. Dukes, 580 N.Y.S.2d 850 (Crim. Ct. 1992); <i>In re</i> S.S., 680 A.2d 1172 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996) (approving use of hand-held wands even without school history of violence). <i>But see</i> Martin R. Gardner, <i>Student Privacy in the Wake of</i> T.L.O.: <i>An Appeal for an Individualized Suspicion Requirement for Valid Searches and Seizures in the Schools</i>, 22 <span class="smallcap">Ga. L. Rev.</span></p>
<p><a id="page_648" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>648</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">897, 943 (1988) (emphasizing that public school metal detectors pose greater invasions than metal detectors in other locations like airports because students are compelled to attend school and thus compelled to consent to the searches).</p>
<p class="indent">The use of drug-sniffing dogs is analytically more complex, and its legality can differ based on the varying ways in which students are subject to the dog sniffs. When officials use dogs to detect drugs in student lockers or cars in the school parking lot, courts have generally found that no “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment has even occurred or, at most, that the search is reasonable given its minimal intrusiveness. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Myers v. State, 839 N.E.2d 1154 (Ind. 2005); Hill v. Sharber, 544 F. Supp. 2d 670 (M.D. Tenn. 2008); <i>see also</i> Horton v. Goose Creek Indep. Sch. Dist., 690 F.2d 470 (5th Cir. 1982) (dog sniff of locker is not a search). Under these circumstances, drug-sniffing dogs may be the functional equivalent of a metal detector. But where a dog physically sniffs a student, courts have been more willing to find a search has occurred and that it requires some level of individualized suspicion. <i>See, e.g.</i>, B.C. v. Plumas Unified Sch. Dist., 192 F.3d 1260 (9th Cir. 1999); <i>Horton</i>, 690 F.2d 470; Commonwealth v. Martin, 626 A.2d 556 (Pa. 1993). <i>But see</i> Doe v. Renfrow, 475 F. Supp. 1012 (N.D. Ind. 1979). Both courts and scholars have emphasized how invasive and intimidating a dog search can be. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Plumas</i>, 192 F.3d 1260; Arnold H. Loewy, <i>The Fourth Amendment as a Device for Protecting the Innocent</i>, 81 <span class="smallcap">Mich. L. Rev.</span> 1229, 1246-1247 (1982) (“[T]he very act of being subject to a body sniff by a German shepherd may be offensive at best or harrowing at worst.”). Regardless, when a properly conducted dog sniff has occurred, courts have treated positive searches as generating the reasonable suspicion to engage in more invasion searches. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Doe</i>, 475 F. Supp. at 1024 (upholding search of students’ pockets, but not strip search).</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">Interestingly, while <i>Vernonia</i> sanctioned drug testing in some circumstances, it does not appear that it has had the effect of encouraging widespread testing. A “study of youth education and society, conducted by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research found that only about twenty of the 600 schools surveyed from 1999-2001 had some type of student drug testing program. Similarly, a recent study of Illinois school districts found that the overwhelming majority of districts had not conducted random drug testing and had no plans to do so.” Cynthia Kelly Conlon, <i>Urineschool: A Study on the Impact of the</i> Earls <i>Decision on High School Random Drug Testing Policies</i>, 32 J.L. &amp; <span class="smallcap">Educ.</span> 297, 298 (2003). <i>Vernonia</i> did, however, provide a legal justification for those who were otherwise considering drug testing.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Board of Education v. Earls</i>, 536 U.S. 822 (2002), the Court upheld a school policy that required all students who participate in competitive extracurricular activities to submit to drug testing similar to that in <i>Vernonia</i>. The case, however, was distinct from <i>Vernonia</i> in that, in addition to sports, the policy extended to activities like Academic Team, Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of America, band, choir, and pom-pom. In addition, unlike Vernonia, this school district did not have a documented drug problem. Justice Thomas, in his</p>
<p><a id="page_649" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>649</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">majority opinion, reasoned that evidence of a national drug problem was sufficient and that, while drugs may present special dangers to athletes, they pose a danger to all students. In short, he reasons that the Court’s decision in <i>Vernonia</i> was not conditioned on specific evidence of a drug problem in the district or the increased danger posed by contact sports. Do you agree with this reading of <i>Vernonia</i>? If Justice Thomas is correct, is there any basis on which to prohibit the extension of drug testing to the entire student body?</p>
<p class="indent">State law may provide a greater degree of protection than federal law. The Supreme Court of Washington, for instance, found no special needs exception for a school’s random drug testing of athletes and that, in the absence of individualized suspicion, the drug testing was a violation of students’ right to privacy. York v. Wahkiakum Sch. Dist. No. 200, 163 Wash. 2d 297 (2008). <i>But see</i> Hageman v. Goshen Cty. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 256 P.3d 487 (Wyo. 2011) (treating participation in extracurricular activities as consent).</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch252">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">While away at a school-sponsored competition, Ms. Sawyer, the faculty coach for the high school chess team, smelled marijuana on Paul and Craig as they exited their hotel room. She then searched their room and discovered a bag of marijuana. They confessed it was theirs but denied that anyone else on the team knew about or used the drugs. Ms. Sawyer, however, was skeptical because the overall team’s performance had inexplicably declined significantly over the past two months. She now suspects drugs may be the cause. In addition, Paul and Craig have two of the highest grade point averages in the school. She believes they must have been corrupted by one of their closer peers; if Paul and Craig are susceptible to drugs, then others surely are. The school board ultimately concurs with her and adopts a drug-testing program for the chess team that mirrors the procedures in <i>Vernonia</i>. Is this policy constitutional? Would it be constitutional if it were applied to all students participating in extracurricular activities? What if it were applied to all students in the school?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch253">F. STUDENT INTERROGATION</p>
<p class="noindent">The discipline, search, and arrest of students often begin with some form of questioning. During that questioning, students may feel compelled to respond and make statements against their own interests. Nonetheless, courts have devoted relatively little attention to whether these statements are voluntary or coerced. Courts have been willing to treat these interrogations by administrators as “seizures” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, but doing so has had little practical effect because courts have applied <i>T.L.O.</i>’s relaxed standard of reasonable suspicion and easily found that the seizures are justified. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Shuman v. Penn Manor Sch. Dist., 422 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2005);</p>
<p><a id="page_650" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>650</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Edwards v. Rees, 883 F.2d 882 (10th Cir. 1989). When the questioner is a police officer, however, the opposite is true, and significant criminal law precedent becomes applicable.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>J.D.B. v. North Carolina</i>, 564 U.S. 261 (2011), the Court addressed police interrogations of minors and whether their youth is a relevant factor to be weighed in determining whether police questioning amounts to custodial interrogation that requires <i>Miranda</i> protections (notice of the right to remain silent and have an attorney present). The facts of the case involved a 13-year-old middle school student who was removed “from his classroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour” regarding some recent home break-ins and thefts. <i>Id</i>. at 265. No one notified the student’s grandmother that he was being questioned. The student “was given neither <i>Miranda</i> warnings nor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother. Nor was he informed that he was free to leave the room.” <i>Id</i>. at 266. Instead, the officer indicated that “‘this thing is going to court’” and the student may be “‘sent to juvenile detention before court’” if he did not come clean. The Supreme Court held that “children are ‘most susceptible to influence,’ and ‘outside pressures.’” <i>Id</i>. at 266-267. The Court held that these objective facts must inform the analysis of whether the child is in “custody” and, thus, protected by <i>Miranda</i> warnings.</p>
<p class="indent">While <i>J.D.B.</i> involved questioning that occurred on school grounds, the case is not a school case per se. Rather, the case is a criminal law case addressing the general rights of minors wherever they might be. The case, however, is relevant to school law insofar as police are now frequently on school property investigating crimes or monitoring students. The Court’s holding now potentially provides minors with protections they formerly did not have. Yet the Court did not address potential distinctions between officers acting on behalf of school officials, resource officers acting as employees of the school rather than the police department, and school employees acting on behalf of the police. Thus, the same ambiguities that arise in regard to property and body searches might also arise in regard to questioning that occurs at school when the questioner does not neatly fall into the category of school official or law enforcement.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Would a student in a situation like J.D.B. feel coerced to confess? Would the student feel free to leave? What protections should be afforded such a student?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Some advocates argue <i>Miranda</i> warnings are still insufficient to protect minors because many minors, particularly the youngest, will be unable to comprehend the warnings. In fact, one study found that one out of five children between the ages of 14 and 15 were significantly impaired in terms of competency capacities like understanding, reasoning, and appreciation. One out of three children between the ages of 4 and 13 were significantly impaired. Thomas Grisso et al., <i>Juveniles’ Competence to Stand Trial: A Comparison of Adolescents’ and</i></p>
<p><a id="page_651" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>651</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>Adults’ Capacities as Trial Defendants</i>, 27 <span class="smallcap">Law &amp; Hum. Behav.</span> 333, 345-346 (2003). These incapacities were equivalent to those that courts have found sufficient to demonstrate legal incompetence in adults. <i>Id.</i> at 358-361. Moreover, in response to questioning, approximately half of children 15 and younger believe the best response to police interrogation is simply to confess, while less than 20 percent of individuals 18 or older hold this belief. <i>Id</i>. at 352. <i>See also</i> Elizabeth S. Scott &amp; Thomas Grisso, <i>Developmental Incompetence, Due Process, and Juvenile Justice</i>, 83 <span class="smallcap">N.C. L. Rev.</span> 793, 811-817 (2005) (surveying research on juvenile competency). Based on these findings, do students need additional procedural safeguards beyond <i>Miranda</i>? What other protections might be appropriate? Would additional protections undermine school safety and order?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Does new social science and the Court’s recognition that children lack the maturity and reasoning necessary to make good decisions provide a basis for courts to hold that students are entitled to due process and protections beyond those currently in place? To the extent students are incapable of always acting properly, are schools acting irrationally in the punishment of some students? Would more careful due process deliberation protect against this possibility?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch254">G. STATUTORY RIGHTS OF PRIVACY</p>
<p class="noindent">While the courts have sanctioned certain invasions of students’ privacy to achieve disciplinary goals, Congress has enacted broad legislation to protect students’ privacy in one respect. In particular, students have robust protections in regard to the information contained in their various educational records maintained by the school. The primary protections for these rights are found in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. §1232g, which like other federal education legislation applies to educational institutions that receive federal funding. The Act prohibits educational institutions from releasing or granting access to students’ records to unauthorized outside parties, as well as internal personnel. In addition, it grants students (and the parents of minors) the right to inspect and examine their own student records. If a student or parent believes there is something inaccurate in the records, he or she has the right to challenge that information in a hearing before the school.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Gonzaga University v. Doe</i>, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), a former student brought suit against Gonzaga University for an alleged violation of the statute. The issue before the Court was whether an individual could bring suit to enforce the provisions of the statute. The Court held that no cause of action exists. Complainants, however, are not entirely without recourse. Pursuant to its obligations under the Act, the Department of Education created the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) “to enforce the Act with respect to all applicable programs.” 34 CFR §99.60(b) (2012). The FPCO permits students and parents who suspect a violation to file complaints, which the Office will investigate. <i>Id.</i> at §99.63. If a violation is found, the FPCO distributes a notice of factual findings</p>
<p><a id="page_652" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>652</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and a “statement of the specific steps that the agency or institution must take to comply” with FERPA. §99.66.</p>
<p class="indent">As a general matter, schools and universities tend to take seriously their obligations under FERPA and follow various protocols to ensure students’ privacy rights are not encroached. Critics, however, argue that schools hide behind FERPA’s prohibitions and use them as an excuse to not turn over information to third parties that might allow them to intervene in the case of potentially dangerous students. <i>See generally</i> Nancy C. Cantalupo, <i>Burying Our Heads in the Sand: Lack of Knowledge, Knowledge Avoidance, and the Persistent Problem of Campus Peer Sexual Violence</i>, 43 <span class="smallcap">Loy. U. Chi. L.J.</span> 205 (2011). Theoretically, this should not be an issue. FERPA contains a specific exception that permits schools to disclose a student’s private information when necessary to protect the safety of other students and persons. 20 U.S.C. §1232g(b)(1)(I) (2006).</p>

Newsome, however, does not make this contention, and we find no evidence in the record to support such a contention.</p>

Although we accept Ratner’s assertion as true for the purposes of this appeal, we note that his brief’s recitation of the school’s policies indicates that possession of a weapon on school grounds would not necessarily result in long-term suspension. Instead, as recited by Ratner, board policy in such cases apparently begins with a presumption that offending students will be expelled (permanently removed) but allows school officials discretion to subject offending students “to such lesser disciplinary action, including long-term suspension [suspension for one or two semesters], as may be deemed appropriate.”</p>

Nor do we express any opinion on the standards (if any) governing searches of such areas by school officials or by other public authorities acting at the request of school officials.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote33" id="note33" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a> We here consider only searches carried out by school authorities acting alone and on their own authority. This case does not present the question of the appropriate standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by school officials in conjunction with or at the behest of law enforcement agencies, and we express no opinion on that question.</p>

<p class="findent"><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/19_ELEFR_Chapter_07.xhtml?favre=brett#Rnote34" id="note34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a> We do not decide whether individualized suspicion is an essential element of the reasonableness standard we adopt for searches by school authorities. In other contexts, however, we have held that although “some quantum of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,]…the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.” Exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion are generally appropriate only where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal and where “other safeguards” are available “to assure that the individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy is not ‘subject to the discretion of the official in the field.’” Because the search of T.L.O.’s purse was based upon an individualized suspicion that she had violated school rules, we need not consider the circumstances that might justify school authorities in conducting searches unsupported by individualized suspicion.</p>
