<p class="noindent">The federal role in education flows from two types of legislation: antidiscrimination and spending. The first six chapters of this book addressed the various antidiscrimination statutes and need not be rehashed here. But as you may recall, the applicability of these statutes is dependent on the receipt of federal funds. Because all public school districts receive some form of federal funding, this condition is not particularly important in most cases. What is important are the additional requirements and goals beyond antidiscrimination that federal spending legislation sets.</p>
<p class="indent">The most notable federal spending legislation for public education is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which was originally enacted in the 1960s as part of the federal War on Poverty and the effort to encourage districts to comply with Title VI’s racial discrimination prohibitions. Since then, Congress has reenacted the ESEA several times and, in recent decades, has attempted to spur education reform and close achievement gaps for disadvantaged students. One of the primary mechanisms for achieving this end has been through increased standardized testing and accountability for the results of those tests. The federal government’s role in holding states and districts accountable has effectuated a significant shift of power and influence to the federal government. This shift has generated heated ideological and practical battles between those who believe states and localities are best suited to exercise educational judgment and those who believe some states are incapable of independently remedying widespread inadequacies. Data generated through the ESEA over the past two decades has only further highlighted the existence of inadequacies and the inability or unwillingness of states to remedy them, which has, ironically, fueled demands for a return to local control and flexibility.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter provides the broad framework for understanding this debate over the federal role in education, as well as the substantive reform agendas embedded in the ESEA. The chapter begins with a narrative on the history of the federal role in education and the ESEA. It then focuses on the major policies of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which was the 2002 reauthorization and</p>
<p><a id="page_952" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>952</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">amendment of the ESEA. While NCLB has since been replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the background on NCLB is crucial to understanding exactly what ESSA attempts to achieve and why. That background is followed by excerpts of the most important sections of the ESSA—those detailing academic standards, testing, accountability, teacher quality, school funding, limits on the federal role in education, and the powers of the Secretary of Education. The chapter concludes with a short overview of the law relating to the fair administration of tests.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch362">A. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch363">Regina R. Umpstead, The No Child Left Behind Act: Is It an Unfunded Mandate or a Promotion of Federal Education Ideals?</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>37 <span class="smallcap">J.L. &amp; Educ</span>. 193 (2008)</i></p>
<p class="indent">State and local governments have traditionally been responsible for providing education in the United States. Education is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution and is, therefore, reserved to the states through the Tenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has declared that education is not a fundamental right even though it plays a vital role in our society. Most state constitutions require state governments to provide free public education, and state governments normally delegate this duty to local school districts. Thus, the states and their subordinate localities have the responsibility for and control over education under both tradition and law. For most of our nation’s history, local control has been the hallmark of educational governance, and the federal government has played a limited role. However, federal influence has grown substantially during the past sixty years, and most of this expansion has been accomplished through federal legislation passed under Congress’ Article 1, Section 8 spending power.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">A. Laws Regulating Education: 1950s to Present</span></p>
<p class="indent">The 1950s mark the time when the federal government became increasingly involved in K-12 education. The 1954 landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> and the 1957 launch of the Soviet Union’s first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik, set the stage for Congress’ enactment of the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) in 1958. The NDEA was the first in a series of acts passed by Congress using its Spending Clause power to influence the field of education.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1960s, as part of the Great Society reforms, Congress passed several laws using its spending power in an attempt to eliminate poverty and racial</p>
<p><a id="page_953" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>953</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">inequality. These included Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), and the Bilingual Education Act of 1968. It was during this era that the federal government became the biggest sponsor of educational reform, and the ESEA was the most significant of the educational legislation passed. Title I of this Act, which provided financial assistance to improve the educational opportunities for poor children, embodied the federal hopes for a better future. This legislation continues today in its reauthorized form, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.</p>
<p class="indent">This legislative trend continued into the 1970s with the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, and the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975. During the past thirty years, Congress enacted fewer new education-related legislative initiatives, instead focusing on the reauthorization of prior acts. The two most prominent of these successively reauthorized acts have been the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which was renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990.</p>
<p class="indent">Through all of these initiatives, the federal government has assumed the role as a promoter of educational opportunity to students with enumerated “disadvantages,” such as those living in poverty, in need of special education, subject to discrimination based on race or sex, or learning English as a second language. To accomplish this goal, it has provided supplemental financial resources through categorical grants to states and localities to allow them to better service students’ special needs in the schools. In this manner, the federal government has been able to support its agenda of improving the educational quality for certain groups of students by offering funding only for specific programs and limiting its use to narrowly defined activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Over time, however, the federal government’s role has changed so that it now has a greater focus on aligning federal support with the overall national goals for the education of all students. These universal student goals are reflected in NCLB. NCLB is controversial because it expands coverage to all students without providing sufficient funding to pay for all costs associated with implementing its requirements.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">C. Educational Funding in the [United States]</span></p>
<p class="indent">[I]t is also important to understand the magnitude of the financial commitment being made to public education in this country at the federal, state, and local levels. Public spending on K-12 education in the United States was $536 billion in 2004-05. State sources account for about 83 percent of the revenue spent on K-12 education—generally through a mix of property, sales, and income taxes. Federal sources account for approximately 8.3 percent of the revenue spent on education, and private funding, mostly for private schools, account for the other 8.9 percent. Overall, federal education spending in 2006 was $36 billion. In the fiscal year 2002, the year following NCLB’s enactment, federal education funding increased $4.7 billion—or 26 percent—over the</p>
<p><a id="page_954" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>954</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">previous year. After three years of growth, federal appropriations for education programs began to taper off in fiscal year 2004 and slowed in fiscal year 2005. Federal NCLB funding has held steady in 2005, 2006, and 2007, at $12.7 billion annually. Yet, because of the relatively small share of funding provided by the federal government, the increase in federal funding due to NCLB amounts to only about 2 percent of total K-12 appropriations.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch364">B. THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2002, the federal role in education drastically expanded with the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act. While most of its specific provisions have been replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act, it transformed the relationship between the U.S. Department of Education and state and local school authorities. It also offered the leverage for the Secretary of Education to later pursue new policies through his administrative powers. The James Ryan excerpt identifies NCLB’s major policy agendas and requirements.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch365">James E. Ryan, The Perverse Incentives of the No Child Left Behind Act</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 932 (2004)</i></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">A. Background</span></p>
<p class="indent">Supported by an overwhelming majority in Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) is remarkably ambitious and unusually intrusive. The NCLBA revises the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was first enacted in 1965 and has been reauthorized periodically ever since. The most important and well-known component of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is Title I.</p>
<p class="indent">In reauthorizing Title I in 1994 through the passage of the Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA), Congress and President Clinton incorporated the core ideas of standards-based reform. In doing so, they fundamentally changed the nature of Title I. Instead of providing funds to support remedial instruction for disadvantaged students, Title I funds now had to be used to create standards for all students. In order to receive Title I funds, states had to create “challenging” content and performance standards in at least reading and math, develop assessments that were aligned with those standards, and formulate plans to assist and ultimately sanction failing schools. Importantly, standards and assessments for Title I schools had to be the same as those established for all other schools within a state. In this way, the federal government hoped to ensure that states would hold all students to the same high expectations and hold all schools, regardless of their student population, accountable for failure.</p>
<p><a id="page_955" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>955</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">B. Key Provisions</span></p>
<p class="indent">The No Child Left Behind Act follows the same basic approach as the IASA, but it establishes more ambitious goals and places greater constraints on the states. States must still develop “challenging” content and performance standards, now not only in reading and math, but also in science. States must still use assessments that are aligned with those standards, and must hold schools and school districts accountable for failing to meet ambitious achievement goals.</p>
<p class="indent">The most significant changes have to do with teachers, testing, and accountability. As for teachers, the NCLBA requires that Title I schools hire only “highly qualified” teachers for all subjects and that veteran teachers in such schools demonstrate that they are “highly qualified” by 2005-6. The Act also reaches beyond Title I schools and requires that all teachers of “core academic subjects” in non-Title I schools must be “highly qualified” by 2005-6.</p>
<p class="indent">As for testing and accountability, whereas the IASA required testing in math and reading at three points in a student’s school career, the NCLBA requires annual testing in reading and math in grades three through eight. At least one more test in reading and math must be given in grades ten through twelve. Beginning in 2007-8, students must also be tested in science at least three times between grades three through twelve.</p>
<p class="indent">Test scores are the fuel that makes the NCLBA run. Scores are tabulated for schools in the aggregate and must be disaggregated for a number of subgroups, including migrant students, disabled students, English-language learners, and students from all major racial, ethnic, and income groups. All of these scores are then used to determine whether schools are making “adequate yearly progress.” Adequate yearly progress (AYP), in turn, is the linchpin of the NCLBA.</p>
<p class="indent">Adequate yearly progress is tied to whether a sufficient percentage of students are performing proficiently on state tests. The NCLBA requires states to bring all students to the proficient level within twelve years of the Act’s passage (i.e., by 2014), and states must ensure that their definitions of adequate yearly progress will enable the ultimate twelve-year goal to be met. To accomplish this, states must set a proficiency goal each year, and that percentage must rise periodically so that by 2014, it hits 100%. For a school to make adequate yearly progress, the student population as a whole, as well as each identified subgroup of students, must meet the same proficiency goal. For example, if in the year 2004-5, the state determines that 65% of students must be “proficient” on the tests, 65% of all the students within a school and 65% of the students within each subgroup (e.g., disabled students, poor students, minority students) must be performing proficiently for a school to be making adequate yearly progress. Adequate yearly progress is thus less about yearly achievement gains than it is about hitting uniform benchmarks. All states must set a uniform bar for achievement for all schools and all subgroups of students within a school.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the Act is quite strict in defining AYP, it is remarkably loose with regard to state standards and tests. (The basic reason for this structure is the continued resistance to national standards and tests.) States are free to determine their own standards, to create their own tests, and to determine for themselves the scores that individual students must receive in order to be deemed</p>
<p><a id="page_956" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>956</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">“proficient.” The harder the tests or the higher the scores needed to be deemed proficient, the harder it will be for schools to meet the NCLBA’s definition of adequate yearly progress. For the same reasons, some states have much farther to travel than others in order to meet the goal of 100% proficiency. The starting percentages in Massachusetts, for example, were roughly 40% proficiency in reading and 20% proficiency in math. In Colorado, the starting percentages ranged, depending on the grade level, from roughly 75%-90% in reading and 50%-80% in math.</p>
<p class="indent">The Act requires all schools within a state, regardless of whether they receive Title I funding, to make adequate yearly progress. The stricter accountability mechanisms, however, are reserved for schools receiving Title I funding. Those schools that receive federal funding and fail to make adequate yearly progress are identified as in need of improvement. They are also subject to a range of progressively more serious actions. After two consecutive years of failure, schools must develop a plan for improvement and are supposed to receive “technical” assistance. Students in those schools are also allowed to choose another public school, including a charter school, within the same district. After three years, students who have not already departed for greener pastures must be provided with tutoring services from an outside provider, public or private.</p>
<p class="indent">Those schools that fail to make AYP for four consecutive years must take one of several measures, including replacing school staff or instituting a new curriculum, and those that fail for five years in a row must essentially surrender control to the state government, which can reopen the school as a charter school, turn over management to a private company, or take over the school itself.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Was the NCLB the next logical step in the gradual expansion of the federal role in education, or did it drastically redefine the federal-state relationship, including an incursion into the state role in education? What are the most important new aspects of the NCLB in terms of improving education?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Has the ESEA imposed too many obligations on states for too little money? What level of financial involvement should the federal government have in schools: just enough to encourage the adoption of federal policy or enough to ensure a particular quality of education?</p>
<p class="indent">3. NCLB also included a school transfer provision. Students who attended a school that failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) for two consecutive years had the right to transfer to another school in their district that was making AYP. If there was no such school in the district, the student could theoretically transfer to another school district, but the receiving school district was not obligated to accept the student. <i>See</i> Jane Dimyan-Ehrenfeld, <i>Making Lemonade: Restructuring the Transfer Provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act</i>, 16 <span class="smallcap">Geo. J. on Poverty L. &amp; Pol’y</span> 217 (2009). While civil rights advocates hoped that these</p>
<p><a id="page_957" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>957</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">provisions would facilitate both the intra- and interdistrict integration, for a variety of reasons, very few students were able to exercise their transfer options. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Meredith P. Richards et al., Century Foundation, Can NCLB Choice Work? Modeling the Effects of Interdistrict Choice on Student Access to Higher-Performing Schools</span> 3 (2011) (less than 1 percent of eligible students transfer); Goodwin Liu &amp; William L. Taylor, <i>School Choice to Achieve Desegregation</i>, 74 <span class="smallcap">Fordham L. Rev.</span> 791, 795 (2005) (criticizing the lack of a mandate in the transfer provision).</p>
<p class="indent">4. NCLB was subject to a number of critiques. <i>See, e.g.</i>, James E. Ryan, <i>The Perverse Incentives of the No Child Left Behind Act</i>, 79 <span class="smallcap">N.Y.U. L. Rev.</span> 932, 934 (2004) (concluding that the Act would incentivize states to dumb-down their academic standards and manipulate passing rates on standardized tests); Linda Darling-Hammond, <i>Evaluating No Child Left Behind</i>, <span class="smallcap">Nation,</span> May 21, 2007 (arguing that the Act undermined quality instruction); Peter Schrag, <i>High Stakes Are for Tomatoes</i>, <span class="smallcap">Atlantic Monthly,</span> Aug. 2000 (arguing that the Act incentivized teaching to the test); Derek W. Black, <i>The Congressional Failure to Enforce Equal Protection Through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i>, 90 <span class="smallcap">B.U. L. Rev.</span> 313 (2010) (arguing the Act did not sufficiently focus on inequality of opportunity and instead penalized its effects); Derek W. Black, <i>Civil Rights, Charter Schools, and Lessons to Be Learned</i>, 64 <span class="smallcap">Fla. L. Rev.</span> 1723, 1752–1756 (2012) (arguing the Act set unrealistic goals); Pontiac v. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253 (6th Cir. 2009) (plaintiffs challenging the Act as an unfunded mandate). Subsequent studies have shown several of these critiques to be correct. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Paul E. Peterson &amp; Frederick Hess, <i>Few States Set World-Class Standards</i>, 8 <span class="smallcap">Educ. Next</span> 70, 71–73 (2008) (finding many states had lowered their standards).</p>
<p class="indent">5. While the Act placed numerous obligations on states and districts, it did not explicitly create an individual cause of action and courts generally refused to infer one. <i>See, e.g</i>., Fresh Start Acad. v. Toledo Bd. of Educ., 363 F. Supp. 2d 910 (W.D. Ohio 2005); Ass’n of Cmty. Org. for Reform Now v. N.Y. City Dep’t of Educ., 269 F. Supp. 2d 338 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). As a result, the Act generated relatively little litigation. The two exceptions are in regard to the Act’s “highly qualified teacher” requirement and the notion that the Act amounts to an unfunded mandate. As to the first issue, California was in violation of the Act’s “highly qualified teacher” requirement and the Ninth Circuit held that the Department of Education’s attempt to excuse this failure through regulatory action was invalid. Renee v. Duncan, 623 F.3d 787 (9th Cir. 2010). That decision, however, was rendered moot when Congress passed a statutory fix that codified the Department’s watered-down definition of what it means to comply with the highly qualified teacher requirement. 124 Stat. 3521 (2010); <i>see also Renee</i>, 686 F.3d at 1008 (ruling in California’s favor after the congressional fix). As to the second issue of unfunded mandates, the judicial rationales and outcomes were muddled, but states and districts were generally blocked from pursuing their theory. <i>See</i> Pontiac v. Spellings, No. 05-CV-71535, 2005 WL 3149545 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 23, 2005) (rejecting plaintiffs’ claim); Pontiac v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 584 F.3d 253 (6th Cir. 2009) (evenly divided en banc panel); Connecticut v. Duncan, 612 F.3d 107 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding plaintiffs lacked standing).</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch366">C. STATUTORY WAIVERS</p>
<p class="noindent">The ESEA was due for reauthorization since the beginning of the Obama Administration. When Congress finally passed the Every Student Succeeds Act in December 2015, it was several years too late. In the years following NCLB’s passage, state and local education agencies had proven unable to comply with the NCLB’s requirements and NCLB’s 2014 deadline for full proficiency was fast approaching. As an interim measure, Secretary of Education Duncan waived NCLB’s requirements in exchange for states adopting a new set of education policies. The following excerpt details that process and the events that precipitated it.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch367">Derek W. Black, Federalizing Education by Waiver?</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>68 Vand. L. Rev. 607, 647–659 (2015)</i></p>
<p class="indent">As funding legislation, NCLB was set to automatically expire after a period of years and required reauthorization in 2007. States’ progress, or lack thereof, toward full proficiency on standardized tests during the intervening years made it clear that the Act needed more than a basic reauthorization. To avoid labeling an overwhelming majority of the nation’s schools as failures that were subject to mandatory sanctions, NCLB needed a substantial rewrite. The demands of the Great Recession and the debate over the Affordable Care Act reduced an otherwise crucial reauthorization to an afterthought. Two years into his term, President Obama finally issued a detailed blueprint for reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (“ESEA”). The terms of the blueprint mirrored the policies that the Administration had already been pursuing through a competitive grant process funded through economic stimulus funds.</p>
<p class="indent">Continued fights over health care and the economy and a shift of power in Congress prevented reauthorization from moving forward. Relations between the Administration and Congress grew so acrimonious that the Administration effectively gave up on any major legislative effort in any area, indicating it would take administrative action to achieve its policy ends. In education, this meant using the widespread occurrence of NCLB noncompliance and the Secretary of Education’s waiver authority to promote policies consistent with the Administration’s previously announced reauthorization policies. Thus, rather than an escape clause for states, waivers became a mechanism for achieving the Administration’s affirmative policy objectives that could not be achieved elsewhere. In short, the waiver process became a substitute for the legislative process.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Setting the Stage: Race to the Top Grants</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In February 2009, Congress authorized $787.2 billion to stimulate and stabilize the failing economy. Ninety-seven billion dollars was allocated to cover states’ and local districts’ education budget shortfalls and to prevent the massive layoff of teachers. A small but significant slice of those education funds</p>
<p><a id="page_959" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>959</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">were reserved for competitive grants. The Secretary of Education was authorized to use the funds to foster educational innovation and improvement. The authorizing legislation deferred to the Secretary regarding the criteria by which state applications would be evaluated.</p>
<p class="indent">The first of these competitive grant programs was the $4.35 billion Race to the Top Fund (“RTT”). The Department indicated that it would use RTT to spur four innovations and reforms: “Adopting standards and assessments that prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy; Building data systems that measure student growth and success, and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction; Recruiting, developing, rewarding, and retaining effective teachers and principals, especially where they are needed most; and Turning around our lowest-achieving schools.”</p>
<p class="indent">States that did not commit to these strategies would be ineligible for grants. The workplace and college standards requirement [was designed to] incentiviz[e] states to adopt the Common Core standards or curriculum. In fact, all twelve states that received a[n] RTT grant adopted or promised to adopt the Common Core. To be fair, several states had already begun the process of adopting the Common Core, but the Department clearly took a side in the debate. The data and teacher effectiveness requirements were, likewise, designed to foster another specific agenda: basing teacher hiring, promotion, retention, and compensation on value-added assessments of teaching. The fourth requirement was part escape clause, part new agenda. The school turnaround requirement diverged from the NCLB approach of sanctioning all schools that fail to meet full proficiency, instead only requiring states to focus their turnaround strategies on the very lowest performing schools. While small in size, RTT proved effective in spurring significant change.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. The Administration’s Blueprint for Reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[In 2010], the Administration released <i>A Blueprint for Reform: The Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i>. It summarized its four goals as “(1) Improving teacher and principal effectiveness; (2) Providing information to families to help them evaluate and improve their children’s schools; (3) Implementing college- and career-ready standards; and (4) Improving student learning and achievement in America’s lowest-performing schools by providing intensive support and effective interventions.” For the purposes of this Article, two points are crucial. First, the Administration itself directly tied the blueprint to its prior RTT policy goals, stating that the blueprint was “[m]odeled after the Race to the Top.” In fact, the four goals of reauthorization are almost identical to the conditions placed on RTT applications. Second, the Administration indicated that the blueprint goals were a hard break from the substance and structure of NCLB. President Obama stated: “My Administration’s blueprint for reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is not only a plan to renovate a flawed law, but also an outline for a re-envisioned federal role in education.”</p>
<p><a id="page_960" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>960</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">[Due to the demands of the failing economy and bitter fights over health care reform and the federal budget, Congress never took any serious steps to reauthorize the ESEA.] At that point, the Administration gave up on legislation, indicating it would not wait on Congress [and would instead] pursue policy changes through executive action.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C. The Conditions of Waiver</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">By the fall of 2011, more than eighty percent of the nation’s schools were set to be labeled as failing. Under NCLB, those education systems would be subject to a series of escalating and harsh consequences, including school closings, district restructuring, and fund termination. Those sanctions would have been a practical and political disaster for both the schools and the U.S. Department of Education. The best solution—altering the legislation through reauthorization—was off the table at that point. The only viable option was for the Department to use its waiver power.</p>
<p class="indent">NCLB provides that “the Secretary may waive any statutory or regulatory requirement of this chapter for a State educational agency, local educational agency, Indian tribe, or school through a local educational agency, that…requests a waiver.” In other words, the Secretary is free to waive all of the accountability, teacher and testing requirement provisions that were the hallmark of NCLB. A state that desires a waiver must “submit a waiver request” that specifically identifies those statutory or regulatory provisions of NCLB for which it is requesting a waiver and explain how a waiver will “(i) increase the quality of instruction for students; and (ii) improve the academic achievement of students.” It must also set “measurable educational goals” and the methods for measuring and meeting those goals.</p>
<p class="indent">In September 2011, Secretary Arne Duncan invited states to apply for waivers or request flexibility. He also announced the Administration’s intent to break course from NCLB because too many circumstances had changed since its passage. First, state-level responses to RTT and movement toward the Common Core had demonstrated that better reforms were possible. He remarked that these reforms “were not anticipated when the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) was enacted nearly a decade ago.” Second, NCLB’s approach simply does not work. He explained: “[I]t inadvertently encouraged some States to set low academic standards, failed to recognize or reward growth in student learning, and did little to elevate the teaching profession or recognize the most effective teachers.” He would use the waiver process to “help ensure that Federal laws and policies can support these [new] reforms and not hinder State and local innovation aimed at increasing the quality of instruction and improving student academic achievement.”</p>
<p class="indent">The Secretary was crystal clear regarding what a state must do to receive a waiver: comply with his conditions. First, states must adopt “college- and career-ready expectations for all students in…at least reading/language arts and mathematics” and develop assessments of that curriculum that “measure student growth.” Second, states “must develop and implement a system of differentiated recognition, accountability, and support for all [schools],” which means</p>
<p><a id="page_961" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>961</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">setting differentiated and achievable annual measurable goals and focusing turnaround strategies on the lowest performing schools and those with the highest achievement gaps. Third, states and local districts must adopt “teacher and principal evaluation and support systems” that “meaningfully differentiate [teacher] performance” into at least three levels based on “student growth” data and other factors. States and districts must use that data to “evaluate teachers and principals on a regular basis” and “inform personnel decisions.” Finally, states must “remove duplicative and burdensome reporting requirements that have little or no impact on student outcomes.”</p>
<p class="indent">These conditions mirrored the RTT conditions and the reauthorization blueprint. The Department’s waiver guidance documents are simply a solidification of the broad concepts first articulated in RTT and the blueprint, with the Administration offering nuance and detail regarding how states should measure student growth, evaluate teachers, and focus on failing schools. And by this time, the external work on developing the Common Core had significantly advanced, making it the de facto means by which to comply with the waiver requirement of college- and career-ready standards.</p>
<p class="indent">Two things, however, were very different. First, the conditions were no longer part of a voluntary grant program or negotiated political process; they were unilateral executive prerogative. Second, these conditions supplanted existing law with a new approach. NCLB’s standardized testing goals, demographic group accountability, teacher certification requirements, and punitive sanctions would all be gone. Also gone would be states’ wide discretion over selecting and measuring academic standards.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D. A Rushed and Coercive Process</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">By the end of 2012, forty-five states had submitted requests for a waiver or flexibility, and the Department later approved all but two. The process involved quick but intense interactions between states and the Department regarding the changes the waiver conditions would require for teachers and curriculum standards. Iowa experienced one of the most contentious interactions. According to local officials, complying with the Department’s teacher evaluation requirements—categorizing teachers by three levels of effectiveness and basing employment decisions on them—presented a direct conflict with state law on teachers’ rights. Some other states had taken executive action to meet the Department’s conditions, but Iowa’s governor indicated he lacked the legal authority to unilaterally implement such a teacher evaluation system. The Department’s conditions would require legislative amendments. Iowa’s legislature then indicated that such a significant change to teachers’ rights would require serious study and consideration, which precluded the immediate response the Department was demanding. As a result, the Department denied Iowa’s waiver application. Confronting similar problems, a few other states chose to forgo submitting a waiver application that year.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he Secretary’s leverage was indisputable. All but a couple of states moved at breakneck pace—by legislation or executive action—to make the curriculum and teacher changes necessary to meet the Department’s conditions.</p>
<p><a id="page_962" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>962</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">[B]ut once the change set in, so did the backlash. Teachers and affiliate organizations in several states subsequently filed lawsuits challenging the changes as violations of teachers’ state and federal constitutional rights. Likewise, a national grassroots movement against the Common Core began forming in late 2013 and early 2014. By the summer of 2014, some states had passed legislation to repeal the prior executive or legislative action adopting it; others were considering following suit; and others were embroiled in litigation challenging whether the adoption of the Common Core violated state law.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Did these waivers fundamentally change the Act and how it operates? If so, were they an improvement?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the Secretary’s power to waive certain statutory requirements include the power to impose new requirements or changes to the Act? How likely is it that Congress intended to extend such a power to the Secretary? What problems might arise from extending such a power to the Secretary present?</p>
<p class="indent">3. In August 2014, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education, challenging its exercise of authority regarding Race to the Top and NCLB waivers. The district court denied the Department’s motion to dismiss, Jindal v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2015 WL 854132 (M.D. La. Feb. 26, 2015), but later denied Jindal’s motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that Jindal had “failed to establish the threat of irreparable injury or that there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to both his statutory and constitutional challenges to the RTT and ESEA flexibility programs.” Jindal v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2015 WL 5474290, at *16 (M.D. La. Sept. 16, 2015). Less than three months after the last decision in <i>Jindal</i>, Congress passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, mooting the practical substantive dispute between Louisiana and the Department over the Common Core.</p>
<p class="indent">4. As the following excerpts will reveal, the Every Student Succeeds Act severely restricts various powers of the Secretary of Education, including the waiver power. It also places several issues, including the Common Core and teacher regulation, off-limits for the Department.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch368">D. THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT</p>
<p class="noindent">By 2014, nearly everyone had given up on the idea that the ESEA would be reauthorized during the Obama Administration. States and districts consigned themselves to complying with the new requirements of their NCLB waiver process. Having secured initial acquiescence with the waiver process from nearly every state, the Secretary, in subsequent years, began indicating he would give states additional time to comply with the conditions of their waivers and also offer multi-year waivers.</p>
<p><a id="page_963" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>963</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In early 2015, when there was no pressure to reauthorize ESEA, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander (chair of the Senate committee dealing with education) and Democratic Senator Patty Murray took the surprising step of going into closed-door sessions to develop a bipartisan plan to reauthorize ESEA. In a relatively short time, they produced a bill and moved it through the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions that summer with a unanimous vote. It received a full Senate vote shortly thereafter, passing by a vote of 81-17. Over the next few months, they worked on reconciling the Senate bill with a House bill that differed significantly. By December, they agreed on a reconciliation bill titled the Every Student Succeeds Act. President Obama signed it into law on December 10, 2015.</p>
<p class="indent">The entire Act totals 391 pages—far too many to reprint here. Its topics include the basic education program to improve educational opportunity for low-income students; improving teaching quality; language instruction for English Language Learners and immigrant students; charter and magnet schools; school innovation; education programs for Native Americans; and support for homeless students. The following excerpts focus primarily on Title I of the Act, which is the largest and funds supplemental educational opportunities for low-income students. In exchange for those funds, Title I requires states to adopt education programs that affect the education of nearly all public school students. Following Title I are shorter excerpts that address teacher quality (Title II), along with a few omnibus rules regarding the Department of Education’s power and a few pilot programs of significance.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 1111 of the Act appears first below. It describes the process by which states will develop and submit their plans for complying with the Act, along with the Secretary’s role in evaluating those plans. More particularly, it requires that states develop academic standards, assess students on those standards, set achievement goals, and intervene in and support those schools in need of improvement.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">(D) IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS.—Based on the system of meaningful differentiation described in subparagraph (C), establish a State-determined methodology to identify…at least once every three school years thereafter, one statewide category of schools for comprehensive support and improvement, as described in subsection (d)(1), which shall include—(I) not less than the lowest-performing 5 percent of all schools receiving funds under this part in the State; (II) all public high schools in the State failing to graduate one third or more of their students; and (III) public schools in the State described under subsection (d)(3)(A)(i)(II)….</p>
<p class="indent">(E) ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT.—Annually measure the achievement of not less than 95 percent of all students, and 95 percent of all students in each subgroup of students, who are enrolled in public schools on the assessments described under subsection (b)(2)(v)(I).

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The introductory section of the Act—Section 1001—states its purpose as being “to provide all children significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps.” How effective will this Act be in achieving that purpose? Keep this question in mind as you consider the next questions.</p>
<p><a id="page_976" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>976</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. How do the foregoing provisions of the Act balance power between the state and federal governments? Is it an appropriate balance? What view of educational authority and decision making does it reflect?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What type of academic standards does the Act mandate that states adopt? How, if at all, does the mandate differ from the academic standard mandate of No Child Left Behind? Is this an improvement? Is it sufficient to ensure students are being taught and learning the material they need to succeed?</p>
<p class="indent">4. How have the academic assessment requirements changed since NCLB? How have the assessments remained the same? Are the changes an improvement?</p>
<p class="indent">5. What metrics or factors are states to examine in measuring student performance? What are the goals for student success? How are states to hold local schools and districts accountable under the Act? What metrics or factors are the states to examine in determining whether schools and districts are successful or effective? Is this approach to accountability an improvement over NCLB? Does the Act afford states too much discretion or strike the correct balance?</p>
<p class="indent">6. What are the sanctions for schools and districts that do not meet student performance goals? Are all schools subject to sanctions or just some? How does this differ from NCLB?</p>
<p class="indent">7. How has student choice changed since NCLB? Does the new Act actually do anything to enhance student choice? In the multi-year lead-up to the reauthorization of NCLB, advocates on both sides of the issue sought significant change in regard to student choice. Civil rights advocates wanted to retain the mandate that students in struggling schools be offered the chance to transfer to other schools, but they wanted students to have the right to transfer across school district lines. Given that the most significant funding inequalities and segregation occur between districts, not within them, a right of interdistrict transfer could have achieved many of the goals civil rights advocates have long sought. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Meredith P. Richards et al., Century Foundation, Can NCLB Choice Work? Modeling the Effects of Interdistrict Choice on Student Access to Higher-Performing Schools</span> 3 (2011) (less than 1 percent of eligible students transfer); Goodwin Liu &amp; William L. Taylor, <i>School Choice to Achieve Desegregation</i>, 74 <span class="smallcap">Fordham L. Rev.</span> 791 (2005). On the other hand, those who favor school choice as a principle of general individual autonomy wanted to turn Title I funding into what would amount to a voucher system whereby students could attend any public or private school they wanted. Alyson Klein, <i>Cantor, Kline Push No Child Left Behind Rewrite, Public School Choice</i>, <span class="smallcap">Education Week</span>, July 16, 2013. This might theoretically coincide with some civil rights goals, but it might also undermine public education itself and intensify segregation. <i>See</i> Derek W. Black, <i>Charter Schools, Vouchers, and the Public Good</i>, 48 <span class="smallcap">Wake Forest L. Rev</span>. 445 (2013)</p>
<p class="indent">8. What powers does the Secretary of Education have under the Act? What powers does the Secretary lack? What does the Act explicitly prohibit the Secretary from doing? Why did Congress impose these specific limits?</p>
<p class="indent">9. In the immediate years preceding the Every Student Succeeds Act, teacher and parental dissatisfaction with standardized testing reached a zenith. This dissatisfaction also coincided with the controversy surrounding states’ adoption of the Common Core and the standardized tests being developed to</p>
<p><a id="page_977" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>977</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">assess students’ mastery of the Common Core. The result was a coordinated strategy by parents to keep their children out of school on testing days. In New York, over 150,000 students boycotted the spring tests in 2015. Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, <i>155,000 New York Kids Boycott Standardized Tests</i>, <span class="smallcap">USA Today</span>, Apr. 16, 2015; <i>see also</i> Emily Atteberry, <i>Lee County Makes History, Opts Out of State-mandated Tests</i>, <span class="smallcap">News-Press.com</span>, Sept. 5, 2014. These boycotts created serious problems for districts and states, as No Child Left Behind required that 95 percent of all students take the tests. In other words, school authorities might be in violation of the Act because of what parents were doing. The intent behind the 95 percent requirement was to ensure schools did not exempt students with disabilities and other disadvantaged or academically struggling students from taking the standardized tests so as to boost schools’ passing rates. How does the new Act deal with these problems? Are its solutions good ones? Are there any new problems that the opt-out provision might create?</p>

<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What ends is the Act attempting to achieve through the foregoing provisions? How important are these goals? Are these requirements effective means to achieve them?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How do these provisions intersect with the other statutory and constitutional provisions explored in prior chapters?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">Complex sets of rules have long accompanied the expenditure of federal funds in education. One of the goals of those rules is to ensure that federal funds for low-income students are not being spent on other students or otherwise misused. The reporting and funding tracking requirements, however, can be administratively burdensome. Some schools might better spend their time focusing on the delivery of education. For instance, if nearly all of a school’s students are low-income, it may not be worth the effort to track and disaggregate expenditures. Toward that end, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has traditionally exempted certain schools from some funding rules. Those schools are given what is called “schoolwide program” status. Department of Education guidance offers this explanation of schoolwide programs:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p><a id="page_980" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>980</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">A targeted assistance program employs staff paid with Title I funds to serve only those students who have been identified as being most at-risk of not meeting the State’s challenging standards. Multiple measures of student academic achievement are used to determine which students are eligible to participate in the program. Services to eligible students may be provided in a “pullout” setting on a limited basis, or may be provided in the regular classroom.</p>
<p class="indent">Schoolwide program schools use Title I funds to meet the needs of all students in the school, as determined through a comprehensive needs assessment. Individual students are not identified as eligible to participate. No distinctions are made between staff paid with Title I funds and staff who are not. All school staff are expected to direct their efforts toward upgrading the entire educational program and improving the achievement of all students, particularly those who are low achieving.</p>
<p class="indent">…</p>
<p class="indent">The original schoolwide concept (which was first included in the law in 1978) drew on “effective schools” research that pointed to the value of implementing comprehensive improvement strategies throughout an entire school as a way of improving outcomes for individual students. Research findings since that time reinforce the fact that all children, including the lowest-performing children, in high-poverty communities can master challenging academic content and complex problem solving skills when resources, practices, and procedures are coordinated across an entire school.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Department of Education, Designing Schoolwide Programs: Non-regulatory Guidance 6–7 (Mar. 2006).</p>
<p class="indent">The new Act amended the requirements relating to schoolwide programs. The most pertinent parts of the new section are reprinted below.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Sec. 1008 Schoolwide Programs</span></p>
<div class="block11">
<p class="indent">(a) IN GENERAL.—</p>
<div class="block11">
<p class="indent">(1) USE OF FUNDS FOR SCHOOLWIDE PROGRAMS.—</p>
<div class="block111">
<p class="indent">(A) ELIGIBILITY.—A local educational agency may consolidate and use funds under this part, together with other Federal, State, and local funds, in order to upgrade the entire educational program of a school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families, or not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families.</p>
<p class="indent">(B) EXCEPTION.—A school that serves an eligible school attendance area in which less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families, or a school for which less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from such families, may operate a schoolwide program under this section if the school receives a waiver from the State educational agency to do so, after taking into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school served under this part in improving academic achievement and other factors.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">(2) IDENTIFICATION OF STUDENTS NOT REQUIRED.—</p>
<div class="block111">
<p class="indent">(A) IN GENERAL.—No school participating in a schoolwide program shall be required to identify particular children under</p>

</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The new version of the Act retains the 40 percent poverty threshold to qualify as a schoolwide program, but also makes it easier for schools under that threshold to apply for “schoolwide program” status. Is that a good idea? Is 40 percent poverty the correct threshold?</p>
<p class="indent">2. In 2015, the Department indicated that 70 percent of the nation’s Title I schools were already operating as schoolwide programs. Ann Wahlen, U.S. Department of Educ., Letter to Chief State School Officer, Supporting School Reform by Leveraging Federal Funds in a Schoolwide Program 1 (July 30, 2015).</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The ESEA has long included a “supplement, not supplant” restriction, along with the requirement of “maintenance of effort.” The first standard requires that Title I money be used to supplement existing state funding for education, not as a means to reduce the amount of money states themselves devote to education. Maintenance of effort requires that states maintain their level of education funding over the course of years. The simple intent of these standards is to ensure that federal money is truly extra money for low-income students, but both concepts have come under increasing critique in recent years due to their purported ineffectiveness in achieving the goal of extra money for low-income students’ educational opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">The problem with “supplement, not supplant” is the gap between theory and reality. As a theory, it makes perfect sense, but in practice, it is nearly impossible to enforce given the complexity of school funding and the year-to-year changes that necessarily occur. For that reason, the U.S. Government Accounting Office, in an audit of the standard, recommended eliminating the supplement-not-supplant standard altogether. <span class="smallcap">U.S. Gov’t Accountability Off., Disadvantaged Students: Fiscal Oversight of Title I Could Be Improved</span> 24–26 (2003).</p>
<p class="indent">The problem with maintenance of effort is that the numerical requirements have been too permissive in recent decades. NCLB, “permit[ed] school districts to draw down their current funding to ninety percent of the previous year. Given that federal funds are on average only eight percent of schools’ education budgets, school districts could theoretically reduce their local contribution by eight percent, replace that reduction with federal funds, and still meet the requirement of maintaining their local funding at ninety percent of the previous year. Although such action would clearly subvert the entire purpose of Title I, it would not violate the maintenance-of-effort standard.” Derek W. Black, <i>The Congressional Failure to Enforce Equal Protection Through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i>, 90 B.U. L.<span class="smallcap"> Rev</span>. 313, 319 (2010).</p>
<p><a id="page_982" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>982</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Presumably in response to these and other critiques, the new Act alters both the supplement, not supplant and maintenance-of-effort standards. These concepts appear in several sections of the Act. The sections reprinted below are representative of the other sections and most pertinent.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The new statutory language changes both of these standards. What exactly does it do? Does it resolve the problem, ignore it, or create new ones?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The foregoing sections require the state to maintain its fiscal effort and not supplant funds. Identical provisions apply to school districts. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C.A. §7901; 20 U.S.C.A. §6321.</p>
<p class="indent">3. In Spring 2016, the Secretary of Education proposed and advocated for regulations to strengthen the supplement not supplant standard. The regulations would require districts to demonstrate that they were “spending an amount of state and local funds per pupil in each Title I-A school that is equal to or greater than the average amount spent per pupil in non-Title I-A schools.” Congressional Research Service, Memorandum, <i>Proposed Regulations on the Supplement, Not Supplant Provision That Applies to the Title I-A Program Authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</i> 5 (May 5, 2016). These regulations prompted an intense disagreement between the Secretary of Education and Congressional leaders over whether these regulations were a proper interpretation of the statute. Senator Lamar Alexander, the principal author of the Every Student Succeeds Act, went so far as to say he would support school officials in suing the Department of Education and refusing to comply with the regulations.

<p class="indent">The following excerpt describes a pilot program to further explore weighted per-pupil funding and its effectiveness. The primary effect would appear to alleviate schools and districts from the normal strictures and rules regarding how Title I funds should be spent. Rather than follow the traditional rules, districts could consolidate the funds and allocate them through a weighted formula. To be clear, however, this program would not exempt school districts from complying with state rules and formulas pertaining to the expenditure of state education funds. This program, however, might allow states and districts to better coordinate federal funds with any progressive or weighted student funding policies that exist in state law. Regardless of the impact of this section of the Act, the fact that it was included is symbolically important in that the state explicitly recognizes the potential merits of student-weighted funding.</p>

<div class="block111">
<p class="indent">(A) IN GENERAL.—A local educational agency’s school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations shall—</p>
<div class="block111">
<p class="indent">(i) except as allowed under clause (iv), allocate a significant portion of funds, including State and local education funds and eligible Federal funds, to the school level based on the number of students in a school and a formula developed by the agency under this section that determines per-pupil weighted amounts;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) use weights or allocation amounts that allocate substantially more funding to English learners, students from low-income families, and students with any other characteristics associated with educational disadvantage chosen by the local educational agency, than to other students;</p>

<p class="indent">(v) include all school-level actual personnel expenditures for instructional staff (including staff salary differentials for years of employment) and actual nonpersonnel expenditures in the calculation of the local educational agency’s State and local education funds and eligible Federal funds to be allocated under clause (i).</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">(B) PERCENTAGE.—In establishing the percentage described in subparagraph (A)(iv) for the system, the local educational agency shall demonstrate that the percentage—</p>
<div class="block111">
<p class="indent">(i) under such subparagraph is sufficient to carry out the purposes of the demonstration agreement under this section and to meet each of the requirements of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) of State and local education funds and eligible Federal funds that are not allocated through the local educational agency’s school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations, does not undermine or conflict with the requirements of the demonstration agreement under this section.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What exactly does this section of the Act achieve or attempt to achieve?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How does it compare to the funding methods described in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What are the weaknesses of this section in achieving its goal? How effective is it likely to be?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The following excerpts come from a different title of the Act. Whereas Title I addresses funding and programs aimed primarily at low-income students, Title II addresses teachers in general, although both titles share a common goal of improving overall education. In the new version of the Act, a large portion of Title II lists and discusses the various things state and local agencies <i>might</i> do to improve teaching quality and the various things on which they <i>might</i> spend Title II funds. Title II, however, does not clearly mandate that state and local districts do any of these particular things. In this respect, Title II reads as a menu of potential options that education agencies might accept or go beyond. For that reason, combined with the length of Title II, most sections of Title II are not reprinted here. The following few sections that are reprinted are intended to offer a brief overview of what Title II seeks to achieve and its major reporting requirements. The most significant change regarding teachers in the new Act was reserved to an omnibus change that deleted the phrase “highly qualified teacher” and replaced it with other phraseology that offered states more control</p>
<p><a id="page_988" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>988</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to define quality teaching themselves. That omnibus change, of course, resulted in numerous additions and deletions to Title II.</p>

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Does the Act address the problems schools currently face regarding teaching? What does the Act suggest are the most pressing problems? Do you agree?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Section 9214 of the Every Student Succeeds Act changed a key defining phrase in the Act. No Child Left Behind had required that all teachers in core subjects be “highly qualified.” States violated this provision of the Act quicker than any other. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">Educ. Comm. of the States, ECS Report to the Nation: State Implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act</span> 69 (2004). The Every Student Succeeds Act struck that phrase from the Act, replacing it with the phrase “teachers who meet the applicable State certification and licensure requirements, including any requirements for certification obtained through alternative routes to certification, or, with regard to special education teachers, the qualifications described in section 612(a)(14)(C) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.” Every Student Succeeds Act, §9214, Pub. L. No. 114-95, 129 Stat. 1802 (Dec. 10, 2015). Is this a positive change? What does it accomplish? Do you foresee any problems?</p>
<p><a id="page_991" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>991</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">3. The new Act also included significant flexibility regarding the types of things on which states and districts could spend their Title II teacher funds. On what aspects of teaching should federal funds be spent?</p>
<p class="indent">4. This omnibus change to requiring highly qualified teachers and general hands-off approach to regulating teachers appears to be a response to the Secretary of Education’s aggressive regulation of the teaching profession during the waiver process. As discussed earlier in the chapter, to receive a waiver, states had to agree to adopt teacher evaluation systems that would base personnel decisions heavily on how teachers’ students performed on standardized tests. <i>See</i> <span class="smallcap">U.S. Dep’t of Educ., ESEA Flexibility</span> 6 (June 7, 2012); <i>see also</i> Overview Information; Race to the Top Fund; Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, 74 Fed. Reg. 59,836 (Nov. 18, 2009) (describing teacher evaluation requirements to qualify for Race to the Top’s competitive grant funds); Derek W. Black, <i>Federalizing Education by Waiver?</i>, 68 <span class="smallcap">Vand. L. Rev</span>. 607, 611 (2015). These systems generated significant resistance from teachers, as well as scholarly critiques focusing on their methodical and empirical flaws. Derek W. Black, <i>The Constitutional Challenge to Teacher Tenure</i>, 104 <span class="smallcap">Cal. L. Rev</span>. 75, 94-108 (2016). Did the Act go too far in freeing states to regulate teaching quality as they see fit or are states in a better position to make those judgments?</p>
<p class="indent">5. At least one remnant of the data-driven approach to incentivizing and improving teaching quality made its way into the new Act in the form a competitive grant program. The Act provides that the Secretary shall reserve a certain percentage of Title II funds and “shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities to enable the eligible entities to develop, implement, improve, or expand performance-based compensation systems or human capital management systems, in schools served by the eligible entity.” Every Student Succeeds Act, §2212, Pub. L. No. 114-95, 129 Stat. 1802 (Dec. 10, 2015). Pay-for-performance teacher compensation systems were promoted as a way to revolutionize teaching, but have yet to yield results. <span class="smallcap">Matthew G.

<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Since the Department of Education was first created in 1979, there have been calls for its elimination and a continual critique of the federal role in education. That critique of the federal role grew stronger over the course of the No Child Left Behind Act and the various new obligations it placed on states. The tipping point, however, may have been reached between 2010 and 2015, as the Department pursued various new policies through administrative action that were arguably well beyond the scope of No Child Left Behind. <i>See generally</i> Derek W. Black, <i>Federalizing Education by Waiver?</i>, 68 <span class="smallcap">Vand. L. Rev</span>. 607 (2015). Putting aside the substance of the Every Student Succeeds Act, its technical aspects and prohibitions are specifically designed to restrict any federal “overreach” in education.</p>
<p class="indent">2. What is §8205 implying about the Department? What does it direct the Secretary to do?</p>
<p class="indent">3. What purpose does the waiver process serve? Does the waiver process favor or disfavor waivers? What discretion, if any, does the Secretary have in granting a waiver? What does the statute try to prevent the Secretary from doing through the waiver power? The Secretary can generally waive almost any requirement in the Act, but unchanged from prior versions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the statutory provision that the “Secretary shall not waive under this section any statutory or regulatory requirements relating to—(1) the allocation or distribution of funds…; (2) maintenance of effort; (3) comparability of services; (4) use of Federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds; (5) equitable participation of private school students and teachers; (6) parental participation and involvement; (7) applicable civil rights requirements.…” 20 U.S.C.A. §7861(c) (2016).</p>
<p class="indent">4. Under what conditions can the Secretary of Education reject a state’s plan for implementing the Act? Which party holds the most power: the state in seeking approval of its plan or the Secretary in rejecting a plan? Does the Act strike the appropriate balance of power between the two? What happens if a state submits a plan and the Secretary does not act quickly to review it and come to a decision? Section 8452 of the Act applies the same framework for approving and disapproving school district plans.</p>
<p class="indent">5. What powers does the Act specifically exclude from the Secretary’s power or prohibit the Department from exercising? Why does the Act identify these specific exclusions and powers? Are they too broad or too narrow?</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">As discussed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a>, Title I distributes funds to states and local districts through four separate formulas. Those formulas have been the subject of intense criticism. Scholars and advocacy groups have emphasized how little the formulas do to actually drive funds to those schools and students who need them most, how they sometimes exacerbate inequality and most often are simply irrational in the results they produce. Goodwin Liu, <i>Improving Title I Funding Equity Across States, Districts and Schools</i>, 93 <span class="smallcap">Iowa L. Rev</span>. 973, 1010 (2008); Derek W. Black, <i>How</i></p>
<p><a id="page_999" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>999</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><i>the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Undermines Equal Protection and Congress’s Duty to Remedy It</i>, 90 <span class="smallcap">B.U. L. Rev</span>. 313, 347 (2010); Gary D. Funk, <i>Rural School Snub: The Inequity of Title I Funding</i>, <span class="smallcap">Chicago Policy Rev.</span> (Feb. 13, 2012); Ulrich Boser &amp; Catherine Brown, Ctr. for Am. Progress, <i>ESEA Reauthorization: 5 Key Principles to Guide Consideration of Any ESEA Title I Formula Change</i> (July 7, 2015). In fact, no constituency appeared ready to defend the fundamentally flawed system, other than simply to say they did not want to lose funds under a new formula.</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, the inherent complexity of the funding formulas combined with the difficulty in devising something better that everyone could agree on (which means hurting no one) produced a very unsatisfactory result: leaving the formulas alone. Senator Burr (NC) had introduced an amendment to the Senate bill that would have addressed some irrationalities in the formulas, merging the four formulas into a single, more simple formula. <i>See</i> Press Release, Richard Burr, Burr Offers Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Education Funding for North Carolina’s Poorest Children (July 7, 2014). His amendment did pass in the Senate, but was struck from the final House-Senate reconciliation bill. The primary problem may have been the fact that the reauthorization bill did not include any significant additional Title I funding. Without additional funding, any change to the formulas would necessarily produce “winners and losers.” The prospect of several losers, and their representatives in the House and Senate, was enough to dissuade changes to the formula that would have undermined the speedy, popular, and bipartisan passage of the overall Act. The Act did, however, take a small step in the direction of reform by funding a study of the formulas and recommendations for reform.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Sec. 9211 Study on the Title I Formula</span></p>
<div class="block11">
<p class="indent">(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:</p>
<div class="block11">
<p class="indent">(1) Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) provides funding to local educational agencies through four separate formulas that have been added to the law over time, and which have “distinct allocation patterns, providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of local educational agencies or States,” according to a 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Minimal effort has been made by the Federal Government to determine if the four formulas are adequately delivering funds to local educational agencies with the highest districtwide poverty averages.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and Education Finance Incentive grants use two weighting systems, one based on the percentage of children included in the determination of grants to local educational agencies (percentage weighting), and another based on the absolute number of such children (number weighting). Both weighting systems have five quintiles with a roughly equal number of children in each quintile. Whichever of these weighting systems results in the highest total weighted formula child count for a local</p>
<p><a id="page_1000" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1000</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">educational agency is the weighting system used for that agency in the final allocation of Targeted and Education Finance Incentive Grant funds.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The Congressional Research Service has also said the number weighting alternative is generally more favorable to large local educational agencies with much larger geographic boundaries and larger counts of eligible children than smaller local educational agencies with smaller counts, but potentially higher percentages, of eligible children, because large local educational agencies have many more children in the higher weighted quintiles.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) In local educational agencies that are classified by the National Center for Education Statistics as “Large City”, 47 percent of all students attend schools with 75 percent or higher poverty.</p>

<p class="indent">(b) STUDY.—</p>

<p class="indent">(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences shall complete a study on the effectiveness of the four part A of title I formulas, described in subsection (a), to deliver funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) CONTENTS.—The study described in paragraph (1) shall include—(A) an analysis of the distribution of part A of title I funds under the four formulas; (B) an analysis of how part A of title I funds are distributed among local educational agencies in each of the 12 locale types classified by the National Center on Education Statistics[;] (C) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or unduly disadvantage any of the local educational agencies[, high-poverty eligible school attendance areas, or lower population local educational agencies with relatively high percentages of districtwide poverty]; (F) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting in the formulas [on areas and districts with high concentrations of poverty]; and (I) recommendations, as appropriate, for amending or consolidating the formulas to better target part A of title I funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities and most economically disadvantaged eligible school attendance areas.</p>

<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. This is not the first study of funding inequality in recent years. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education convened an Equity and Excellence Commission to study how the federal government could increase educational opportunity by improving school funding equity. The Commission issued a report in 2013 titled <span class="smallcap">For Each and Every Child: A Strategy for Education Equity and Excellence</span> (2013). The report, however, focused on issues much broader than just Title I or even school funding in general.</p>
<p><a id="page_1001" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1001</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. Given what you have learned thus far, is the problem with reforming the formulas one that requires more study and proposals or more political will? What goals should changes to the formulas seek to achieve? How likely is Congress to make those changes? Under what circumstances might Congress agree to changes to the formulas?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch370">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The major challenge in national education reform is to design standards that are reasonably applicable to every state, school district, and school in the country. The varied circumstances and desires of these localities create significant conflict both within and between states. Moreover, there are numerous national constituencies that are at odds with one another. Important advocacy groups and constituencies exist for, at least, the following: poor, minority, and disadvantaged students; teachers and unions; high-performing suburban districts; state and local administrators and boards; federal agencies; education reformers; and public school alternatives.</p>
<p class="indent">The following exercise is designed to provide a deeper understanding of each of these groups, as well as how their competing positions play out in legislation. Pick one of the foregoing national constituencies to represent. Based on the materials covered in this book, as well as outside sources,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/23_ELEFR_Chapter_11.xhtml?favre=brett#note92" id="Rnote92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> identify the standards and reforms that your group would want to retain from the current version of the ESEA and those standards and reforms you would want to see added in the future. Be prepared to present a proposed ESEA reauthorization to your class. Also be prepared to critique the proposals of other groups in class. Once you have done both, seek out those groups with whom you may be able to find compromise. Your goal should be to build a larger coalition and develop a joint revised proposal. Once coalitions and new proposals are formed, vote on the proposed bills and identify the proposal that would be the most likely to pass in Congress.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch371">E. STANDARDIZED TESTING</p>
<p class="noindent">As the foregoing materials reveal, standardized testing is and has been a core component of the ESEA since the enactment of the Improving America’s School Act in 1994. As the chapters on race and poverty show, test results have also provided important evidence in school desegregation and school finance</p>
<p><a id="page_1002" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1002</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">litigation. This section briefly explores the tests themselves rather than the policies that have relied on them.</p>
<p class="indent">Standardized testing, in the most general sense, refers to any test that is administered and graded in a uniform manner. As discussed here and in educational policy debates, standardized testing most often refers to multiple-choice exams administered to all students and designed to assess students’ proficiency on state or national curriculum in core subjects. Some of these standardized tests are high stakes, meaning that students’ individual performance will have significant educational consequences. For instance, a student’s score might be a primary or the sole factor in whether the student is assigned to a particular ability group or course of study, promoted to the next grade in school, or permitted to graduate. Analogously, standardized tests can be used to make high-stakes decisions about schools as a whole rather than about individual students. As discussed with the NCLB and ESSA, poor performance could lead to sanctions against states, school districts, and schools. Standardized tests, however, need not be used in this “high-stakes” fashion. Standardized tests can be used only for diagnostic purposes, such as generally determining how a group of students is progressing through the curriculum. Or test results might be just one factor among many in making a decision about individual students or schools.</p>
<p class="indent">Two distinct and crucial sets of issues arise with standardized testing. The first set of issues relates to the educational effectiveness and appropriateness of standardized testing. The second set relates to the legal constraints on standardized testing. Standardized testing might be a bad idea from the perspective of educators and, nonetheless, be legal. Likewise, standardized testing might generally be educationally desirable, but run afoul of legal principles if not administered appropriately. While the debate over the educational value of standardized testing is fierce, educators appear to have reached a rough consensus on what form those tests should take if schools are to administer them.</p>
<p class="indent">As an initial matter, educators should adopt clear objectives and purposes before they design or administer the test. They should then determine what information they can reasonably test and how those results can or cannot help them accomplish their goals. <i>See generally</i> <span class="smallcap">Am. Educ. Research Ass’n, Am. Psychol. Ass’n &amp; Nat’l Council on Measurement in Educ., Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing</span> (1999). Four principles or concerns should guide the design of the actual test. First, the test must be valid, meaning that the test is accurate in measuring whether the taker possesses the relevant knowledge. <i>Id.</i> at 9. For instance, a test that sought to measure reading comprehension, but included narratives that discussed matters within common knowledge, might not be valid because the scores it produced could reflect students’ common knowledge as much as their reading comprehension. Second, the test results should be reliable, meaning that student results are consistent and not subject to change based on factors such as who administers the exam, who grades it, or when it is taken. <i>Id.</i> at 25-36. In short, tests are reliable if a student would receive a similar score even if the student took the exam several times. Third, tests should be fair, meaning that they do not contain biases or flaws that would under- or overestimate a student’s skill or knowledge based on the student’s race, gender, ethnicity, or disability. <i>Id.</i> at 74-80. Finally, cut scores for passing or failing tests should be reliable. <i>Id.</i> at 9-16. This means that, if a</p>
<p><a id="page_1003" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1003</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">state requires students to answer 75 percent of the questions correctly to be deemed proficient, it should not be the case that students who score below 75 percent nonetheless possess proficient knowledge of the subject matter. In other words, if a cut score is too high or too low, it mischaracterizes the knowledge that students actually have.</p>
<p class="indent">These educational good practices can often intersect with legal frameworks. For instance, invalid and unreliable tests may have racial and gender biases that render them problematic under various laws. Some of these problems have already been explored in the chapters on race, gender, language status, and disability. With language status and disability, relatively specific law controls how tests can and cannot be used to diagnose language barriers and disabilities, as well as the core subject matter knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">Relatively few hard and fast legal and constitutional rules exist regarding testing, but two guiding legal principles and rules are worth considering. First, regulations and potentially some statutes may prohibit tests that have disparate impacts based on race, gender, disability, and other protected categories. To be clear, random and small variations in test results between student demographic groups do not typically present any legal concern, but larger disparities can require further analysis to determine whether they are justified by some legitimate educational goal and whether some other test or method might reduce or eliminate the disparities. The likelihood of successfully challenging a test based on racial disparities alone is extremely low given the Court’s holding in <i>Alexander v. Sandoval</i>, 532 U.S. 275 (2001). As <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/14_ELEFR_Chapter_02.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 2</a> details, however, administrative remedies still exist for racially disparate impacts and, thus, plaintiffs might still pursue a claim with the Department of Education. The analysis for evaluating disparate impacts in testing is generally the same as that described in the U.S. Department of Education’s Dear Colleague Letter on Resource Comparability, which was reprinted in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/14_ELEFR_Chapter_02.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 2</a>. <i>See also</i> <span class="smallcap">U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, The Use of Tests as Part of High-Stakes Decision-Making for Students</span> (2000).</p>
<p class="indent">Whether <i>Sandoval</i> bars private causes of action for disparate impact regarding gender, language status, and other protected groups is less clear. As you may recall, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/17_ELEFR_Chapter_05.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 5</a> included a pre-<i>Sandoval</i> case regarding the gender inequities that resulted from New York’s policy of tying scholarships to student performance on the SAT. <i>See</i> Sharif by Salahuddin v. New York State Educ. Dept., 709 F. Supp. 345 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). Certain aspects of that case may still be valid. Regardless, administrative claims are still available for this and other group-based disparities.</p>
<p class="indent">The second limitation on standardized tests comes from basic due process principles. Due process requires reasonable notice of the materials, concepts, and knowledge on which students are to be tested. Otherwise, when schools deprive students of a high school diploma, for instance, they may be depriving students of a property right without notice and a fair opportunity to learn the material. As an initial matter, “courts have required sufficient advance notice of tests required for graduation to give students a reasonable chance to learn the material presented on the test. A particularly important concern in some of these decisions is the adequacy of notice provided to students.…In looking at the length of the transition period needed between the announcement of a new requirement and its full implementation, the kind of test and the context in</p>
<p><a id="page_1004" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>1004</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">which it is administered are central factors to be considered.” <span class="smallcap">The Use of Tests as Part of High-Stakes Decision-Making for Students</span>, <i>supra</i>, at 66. Of particular concern are “the nature of instructional supports, including remediation, that accompany the test, whether re-testing is permitted, and whether the decision to promote or graduate the student considers other information about the student’s performance.” <i>Id</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, “[s]everal courts have found that ‘fundamental fairness’ requires that students be taught the material covered by the test where passing the test is a condition for receipt of a high school diploma.…For [a] test to meaningfully measure student achievement, the test, the curriculum, and classroom instruction should be aligned. In cases examining systemwide administration of a test, courts require evidence that the content covered by the test is actually taught, but may not expect proof that every student has received the relevant instruction.” <i>Id</i>. at 67.</p>
<p class="indent">As a final note, the use of high-stakes and other tests raises distinct issues in districts that are still under a court order to desegregate or remedy some form of past racial discrimination. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 407 (5th Cir. 1981); McNeal v. Tate Cty. Sch. Dist., 508 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir. 1975). In this context, a court is far more likely to intervene and strike down the testing regime on any number of statutory or constitutional grounds.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Is there anything fundamentally unfair about using high-stakes tests to evaluate and make decisions about students?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Although some challenges to standardized testing have succeeded, courts have been reluctant to intervene in what are often challenges to a statewide testing system. In explaining its reluctance, one lower court noted that the state had adopted the testing scheme with the specific intent of improving the educational opportunities and outcomes of minority students. <i>See, e.g.</i>, GI Forum Image De Tejas v. Texas Educ. Agency, 87 F. Supp. 2d 667, 676 (W.D. Tex. 2000). Should the state’s goal matter if the impact of the testing regime is to disadvantage minority students? What if the short-term, negative impact is necessary to achieve the long-term goal?</p>
<p class="indent">3. As you may have noticed in the foregoing excerpts from the Every Student Succeeds Act, states now have far more flexibility in the tests they administer, the weight they assign those tests in measuring a school’s effectiveness, and the instances in which they might intervene in a school with low test scores. <i>See, e.g</i>., Sec. 1111(c)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="indent">4. Section 1111(b)(2)(B) of the Act also indicates, consistent with the literature on testing, that the test states adopt “be used for purposes for which such assessments are valid and reliable, consistent with relevant, nationally recognized professional and technical testing standards, objectively measure academic achievement, knowledge, and skills.” Because the Act does not include a private cause of action, it remains to be seen what limits this provision will actually place on test selection and administration.</p>

There are also policy groups such as the Century Foundation, Center for American Progress, Education Trust, and others that routinely issue analysis of the ESEA. Each of these organizations maintains policy platforms and/or reports that are important to understanding the underlying issues. Because these reports and platforms are regularly updated, this casebook does not attempt to recommend or list any particular ones.</p>
