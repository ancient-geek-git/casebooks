<p class="h3" id="ch107">A. DISTINGUISHING THE OVERLAPPING CATEGORIES OF ETHNICITY, LANGUAGE, AND IMMIGRATION STATUS</p>
<p class="noindent">While occupying a relatively small place in the published opinions of federal courts, the educational opportunities that English Language Learners<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note9" id="Rnote9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> (ELLs) and children of immigrants receive are central to the future success of our public education system. A few decades ago, ELL students and children of immigrants were small in number and heavily concentrated in the southwestern United States. Today, ELL students attend public schools in increasingly large numbers and in every state in the country. In fact, ELL students are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population under the age of 18. <i>English Language Learners</i>, <span class="smallcap">Educ. Wk.</span> (Aug. 4, 2004, updated June 16, 2011), <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/english-language-learners/" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/english-language-learners/</a>. In 1979, ELL students represented just 9 percent of children in the United States. <i>Id.</i> By 2007, that number had reached approximately 20 percent. <i>Id.</i> In real numbers, this increase was from 5.5 million students to just under 11 million. Rod Paige, U.S. Sec’y of Educ., U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Press Conference Announcing New Policies for English Language Learners (Feb. 19, 2004).</p>
<p class="indent">Making the educational response to this growth more complex is the fact that ELL students are so diverse. The largest group of ELL students—80 percent—speak Spanish at home. Naomi Chudowsky &amp; Victor Chudowsky, Center on Education Policy, <i>Has Progress Been Made in Raising Achievement for English Level Learners?</i> 3 (2010). But these students, while sharing language, have families who come from numerous different countries, each of which</p>
<p><a id="page_284" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>284</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">may have different education systems and quality levels. The remaining 20 percent of ELL students who do not speak Spanish sometimes share very little in common other than the fact that their English skills are limited. In fact, the ethnicity of students who comprise the remaining 20 percent varies from state to state. For instance, in Alaska, Montana, and North Dakota, the second largest ELL group is Native American, who comprise a very small group in other states. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Putting national origin and language status aside, ELL students’ legal residency status also differs. Most ELL students are born in this country and are citizens (nearly 80 percent). <span class="smallcap">Patricia Gándara &amp; Megan Hopkins, Forbidden Language: English Learners and Restrictive Language Policies</span> (2010). Yet significant portions are not citizens or have parents who are not citizens or legal residents, which adds another potential barrier to the continuity and quality of their education. Based on population surveys, 1.6 million ELL students were also undocumented immigrants in 2003. In addition, 4.6 million children, regardless of their own residency status, had at least one parent who was an undocumented immigrant, which amounts to about 5 percent of the public school population. <span class="smallcap">Randy Capps et al., Found. for Child Dev., Promise or Peril: Immigrants, LEP Students and the No Child Left Behind Act 27</span> (2004). The challenges that these students face can also extend beyond language and residency status to include poverty, housing, and health care. But regardless of cause, the end result for far too many has been to exit school prematurely. Latino/a youth, for instance, are four times more likely to drop out of high school than white students, and two times more likely to drop out of high school than African Americans. <span class="smallcap">Nat’l High Sch. Ctr., Educating English Language Learners at the High School Level: A Coherent Approach to District- and School-Level Support</span> 1 (2009). By one estimate, more than one out of three Latino/a youth between the ages of 16 and 24 were high school dropouts in 2006. <i>Id.</i></p>
<p class="indent">As with race, the law has attempted to respond to those language challenges that are susceptible to legal remedy. Yet in most instances, the law in regard to ELL students and children of immigrants has developed separately from the law of racial discrimination. Historically, students whose first language is not English have faced at least three distinct equality challenges in our public educational system: segregation, access to meaningful instruction that allows them to overcome language barriers, and admission to school systems themselves. Each of these barriers to education has its own distinct law. Thus, this chapter takes up each separately.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of these legal frameworks tends to implicate a different set of circumstances, as well as a distinct group of students within language minority communities. For instance, the purported justification for the segregation of Latino students was a lack of proficiency in English. If this were the case, only some Latino students would have been subject to segregation. But segregation often included students of Hispanic descent who were fluent in English, making the segregation appear to be just another form of race or ethnic segregation. Thus, legal developments regarding the segregation of Latino students, while implicating ELL issues, could not fairly be called ELL law. Rather, it was ethnic segregation that intersected with language barriers in some instances. In short, the segregation of ethnic minorities is a broader issue than ELL rights.</p>
<p><a id="page_285" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>285</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">For those same reasons, the protections afforded to ELL students are irrelevant to immigrant students or children of immigrants who are fluent in English. In this respect, laws relating to ELL students are not race or ethnicity based, but skill based. Yet one cannot underestimate the role that race and ethnicity plays in the way the law responds to ELL claims. Consider that disability too is skill-based in certain respects, but disability does not naturally intersect with race or ethnicity, and thus perceptions of disability are not as obviously impacted by race and ethnicity. In short, ELL rights in theory are designed to address educational needs and skills, not racial, ethnic, or cultural struggles; but in reality, they have grappled with both types of issues.</p>
<p class="indent">Keeping these distinctions in mind is important as you read this chapter. The legal frameworks for segregation, language programs, and access to school, on their face, apply to a distinct group of students confronting a distinct educational obstacle. Thus, the rights in each paradigm are not transferrable to the others. In effect, this chapter is not the law of Latino students, ethnicity, language minorities, or immigrants, but rather a chapter that lumps the law relating to ethnic minorities, language minorities, and immigrants into a single chapter because the issues intersect. Because they intersect and because each of these individual legal paradigms cannot be entirely separated from the larger racial, ethnic, and cultural contexts in which they operate, the issues involved in each can be complex. The last section of this chapter briefly touches on how the rights of ELL, immigrant, and ethnic minority students relate to additional topics in education law, such as disability and school finance.</p>

<p class="h5" id="ch109">Marie C. Scott, Resegregation, Language, and Educational Opportunity: The Influx of Latino Students into North Carolina Public Schools</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>11 Harv. Latino L. Rev. 123 (2008)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The Latino role in the legal history of school desegregation is often left in the shadows of <i>Brown</i> and the African American struggle. This overlooked history includes shining victories and deep frustrations. It is also marked by seeming disjunctions in legal strategies on the part of Latino education advocates as they attempted to navigate the complexity of racial segregation and language concerns within a larger civil rights environment that was dominated by the black-white dynamic. Today, the educational situation of Latinos is further complicated by the dispersal of the Latino population throughout the United States, the socioeconomic status of the community, and immigration issues, as well as the ethnic and language minority statuses with which Latinos have always struggled.</p>
<p class="indent">During the first few decades of the twentieth century, Mexican Americans in the Southwest experienced significant school segregation in addition to</p>
<p><a id="page_286" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>286</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">segregation in most other aspects of public life. However, unlike the statute-imposed racial segregation of African Americans in Southern schools, the segregation of Mexican American children in the Southwest was achieved through school administration policymaking. School administrations justified their actions by pointing to perceived language, intelligence, and health differences between the Mexican American and Anglo student bodies. The schools Mexican Americans were forced to attend were not only separate but often unequal with inferior facilities and resources.</p>
<p class="indent">Latino civil rights in general and the issue of educational rights in particular have been influenced by a series of organizations and a variety of litigation strategies and interests that they pursued. The changing litigation strategies reflect changing opportunities and reactions to events happening outside of the Latino litigation. Latino school litigation has been defined by several distinct phases: 1) pre-World War II local attempts to desegregate schools in Texas and California, 2) post-World War II efforts that were more widespread, 3) post-<i>Brown</i> and post-<i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), efforts to make bilingual education part of the larger desegregation process, and 4) the movement in the 1970s and 1980s away from desegregation concerns to promote bilingual education.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early pre-World War II cases, Mexican American litigants made limited progress by winning a few lower court cases that only had local effect. The primary strategy in these early desegregation cases was to attack segregationist policy by arguing that the segregation of Mexican American children was illegal because they were racially white and no statute allowed separation on the basis of a Latin national origin. However, change came slowly, and it was not until after World War II that Mexican Americans and Latino organizations like [League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)] were able to pursue desegregation aggressively.</p>
<p class="indent">The most influential of the Mexican American school desegregation cases was <i>Mendez v. Westminster</i>, 161 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1947). The <i>Mendez</i> case spurred the desegregation of Mexican American students in California schools and played an important role in the evolution of desegregation cases that led to <i>Brown</i> seven years later. Litigation was brought by several Mexican American families, who were later supported by LULAC, on behalf of their school-aged children who had been denied admission to schools reserved for Anglo whites in Orange County, California. The Mexican American families argued that the school districts’ practice of segregating Mexican children violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The School Board argued that the children were separated because of their limited English proficiency. But the district court found that the school administrators had based their assignment decisions primarily on the children’s surnames. The district court ruled that segregating Mexican American students without credible examination to determine that they had English language deficiencies denied them equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the court enjoined the districts from continuing to segregate.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ninth Circuit affirmed that in the absence of a California statute that permitted the segregation of Mexican-origin students—in contrast to the laws that allowed for the segregation of Native American and Asian American</p>
<p><a id="page_287" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>287</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">students—the segregation of Latino students by school authorities violated the Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs’ victory in <i>Mendez</i> led California to be the first state to desegregate schools. Governor Earl Warren, who would later become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and write the <i>Brown</i> opinion, responded to the <i>Mendez</i> decision by ordering all the school districts in California to eliminate de jure segregation of Mexican Americans. Moreover, the following year, the California State Legislature repealed the statutory school segregation of Asian Americans and Native Americans.</p>
<p class="indent">Many non-Latino civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the ACLU, the American Jewish Congress, and the Japanese-American Citizens League, became involved in the case by submitting amicus curiae briefs. <i>Mendez</i> was seen as a “guinea pig” case for the larger issues of de jure school segregation throughout the nation and Jim Crow laws in the South. The brief filed by the NAACP asked the court to strike down the “separate but equal” doctrine [from] <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>. The NAACP brief in <i>Mendez</i> was the basis for the brief eventually submitted in <i>Brown</i>, including both the assertion that in reality separate could never be equal and the importance of social science evidence to understand that reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Although LULAC and other organizations continued their legal fight to end school segregation for Mexican Americans, the larger legal community and national attention focused on the black-white desegregation issue after the <i>Brown</i> decision in 1954. During the 1960s and the early 1970s, Latinos began to self-identify in a more radicalized manner with the growth of the Chicano Movement and parallel developments in the Puerto Rican community. This growing redefinition led to a shift in legal strategy for Latino organizations—from claiming equality through emphasizing their whiteness to seeking legal protection under <i>Brown</i> as a minority group suffering from discrimination. During this period, new Latino organizations like the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF) were formed and started to advocate for Latino civil rights by following distinct strategies from those used by the older Latino organizations. As federal courts struggled with <i>Brown</i>’s “all deliberate speed” mandate and the subsequent foot dragging of Southern school districts, it was not until <i>Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. One</i> in 1973 that the situation of Latinos reentered the national litigation spotlight.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Keyes</i>, the Supreme Court recognized that Latinos were an identifiable minority group for school desegregation purposes and could not be treated as white in desegregation plans. The plaintiffs claimed that the school district had intentionally redrawn attendance lines and implemented other methods of maintaining racially segregated schools even as some of the city’s neighborhoods had started to integrate. The Court reframed the white-black paradigm through which desegregation had been viewed since <i>Brown</i> into a white-non-white model because of the significant presence of Latino students in the Denver public schools. At the time of <i>Keyes</i>, Latino students made up one-fourth of the students in Denver. The collapsing of Latinos and blacks into a single group for purposes of desegregation policy recognized that both groups were being discriminated against but disregarded the special needs of Latino students. In the remedy stage</p>
<p><a id="page_288" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>288</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of <i>Keyes</i>, the district court ordered a plan that would allow some schools to be predominately Latino, so bilingual-bicultural programs could be implemented in those schools. The bilingual-bicultural aspect of the remedial plan was proposed by Latino advocacy groups. But the Tenth Circuit vacated that portion of the desegregation plan because the concentration of minority students it created undermined the overall desegregation plan in the court’s mind. The Tenth Circuit explained, “Bilingual education…is not a substitute for desegregation. Although bilingual instruction may be required to prevent the isolation of minority students in a predominately Anglo school system…such instruction must be subordinate to a plan of school desegregation.” As exemplified by the situation in <i>Keyes</i>, concerns about Latinos as a language minority added a new level of complication to the Latino struggle for educational rights, as Latino organizations started to think beyond desegregation to other issues that prevented Latino students from receiving an equal educational opportunity.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What, if anything, distinguishes the segregation of Latino students from the segregation of African American students? Are the motives the same or different?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Why did it take so long for the Supreme Court to explicitly recognize and respond to the segregation of Latino students? Has the segregation of Latinos been underemphasized or underappreciated and, if so, why?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Should Latinos and African Americans be treated as distinct groups in desegregating schools with particular remedies addressed to each? In terms of achieving racial balance, should courts seek to balance the numbers of whites, Latinos, and African Americans in each school or only the number of whites in proportion to the total number of Latinos and African Americans combined?</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch110">Gary Orfield &amp; Chungmei Lee, Racial Transformation and the Changing Nature of Segregation</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>(2006)</i></p>
<p class="indent">In the 2003-2004 school year the national totals showed Latinos are the largest minority group at 19 percent, followed by 17 percent black students, four percent Asian students and one percent American Indian students. All of the minority communities are growing much faster than whites, with Latino and Asians increasing most rapidly. The fact that Latinos are the youngest group, have the largest families, and have children at younger ages will result in population growth independent of immigration. For African Americans, on the other hand, child bearing is now similar to the white rates, though the population is younger and thus producing relatively larger numbers of children.</p>
<p><a id="page_289" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>289</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Changing Patterns of Segregation by Region</span></p>
<p class="indent">Latino segregation is higher than black segregation on some measures in the South and West. In the West, where Latinos are concentrated, 81 percent of Latinos are in schools with nonwhite majorities, followed by 78 percent in the Northeast and the South. In the West, 39 percent of Latinos attended intensely segregated (90-100%) minority schools (compared to 32 percent for blacks in the South), and 12 percent attended apartheid (99-100%) schools, the same as the black South. These startling figures are even higher in the Northeast where 44 percent were enrolled in intensely segregated schools and 15 percent in apartheid schools. In the South, which includes the substantial Latino enrollment in Texas, 40 percent of the Latino public school enrollment attended intensely segregated minority schools, far higher than the region’s black segregation, and 10 percent attended apartheid schools. Segregation increased for Latinos in all regions except the Northeast, where it remains very high even though there is a slight decline on some measures, perhaps reflecting Latino suburbanization trends. The lowest segregation levels for Latinos were in the Border and Midwest states where the Latino enrollments were very small but segregation was growing in both as secondary migration patterns to these regions emerged.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">The Historical Context of Segregation for Black and Latino Students</span></p>
<p class="indent">[While history reveals “more than two decades of rising contact between black and white students” following “the passage and enforcement of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,” the] story was very different for Latinos. As the number of Latinos soared and residential segregation increased, the schools in many areas became vastly more segregated and there was no significant initiative to address it. The Office for Civil Rights had been denied enforcement powers by President Nixon. The basic problem targeted by most Latino rights advocates was language, not segregation, and the basic fight was for bilingual education, a movement that enjoyed considerable success in the 1970s, met mounting resistance in the 1980s and sharp reversals in the 1990s. Segregation steadily increased and by some measures and in some regions became substantially higher than black segregation. Many desegregation plans were designed only to desegregate black students, since they were designed before the right of Latinos to desegregation remedies was even established by the Supreme Court and often with no civil rights lawyers representing Latino interests. As Latinos become ever more segregated in inferior schools with extremely low graduation rates and test scores, with many found to be failing under [the] No Child Left Behind Act, federal courts have ended desegregation in their communities and issued rulings which extinguished the rights of Latinos’ children without ever considering the issue of Latino segregation.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">Multiracial Schools and the Need for a New Paradigm</span></p>
<p class="indent">Growing segregation of black and Latino students from white students is a basic educational trend. But there is another large and more encouraging</p>
<p><a id="page_290" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>290</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">development—the emergence of multiracial schools on a large scale. Over the past half century there has been a good deal of energy devoted to creating and studying biracial schools, particularly those with black and white students. But we now see the emergence of thousands of schools that are not biracial but multiracial, often multiracial with two or more historically excluded “minority” groups and relatively few white students. Others may be multiracial, for example, with relatively advantaged groups of whites and Asians and a smaller black or Latino group.</p>
<p class="indent">Across the U.S. some 8.6 million students are attending multiracial schools of a sort never thought of when the school desegregation struggle was framed. Whites are by far the students least likely to attend such schools—only about an eighth (12 percent) of whites do. Asian students are by far the most likely to be in such schools; 42 percent attend these multiracial institutions. Twenty-seven percent of Latinos, 23 percent of African Americans and 20 percent of American Indian students are in multiracial schools. For whites, blacks, and Asians the multiracial experience reaches its highest level in the West. An extraordinary 52 percent of Western blacks and 51 percent of Western Asians attend these diverse schools. For Latinos, however, the multiracial experience is lower in the West (24%) than in all other regions and substantially higher in the Northeast (37 percent). The Northeast also has schools that are second only to the West in the exposure of black and Asian students to multiracial schools. The concentration of such schools in the West and Northeast is likely due in part to the concentration of Asian immigration in these areas as well as the extensive contact between black and Latino students in these areas.</p>
<p class="indent">An important reality about multiracial schools is that the basic multiracial contact may be between two or three minority groups and that they may still be highly segregated from whites. Very little systematic research has been done on the dynamics and effects of multiracial schools in terms of possible benefits or best ways to operate schools where there are substantial numbers of students from two or more disadvantaged groups attending the same school. Since many of the traditional benefits of desegregation result from moving students from high poverty to middle class schools with richer opportunities and networks, it is important to consider likely effects of combining two or more impoverished groups in the same multiracial school. There are large numbers of both blacks and Latinos in such schools in important immigration destinations where there are few whites left in the schools and these groups are inheriting the city. In the West, for example, blacks who are isolated from whites in minority schools are actually, on average, in schools with more Latinos than fellow African Americans.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. How has desegregation for Latinos compared to that of African Americans? Has it been as effective? Are there factors that make the desegregation of Latinos more challenging? Are there factors that should make it easier?</p>
<p><a id="page_291" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>291</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. How does the segregation of Latinos vary by region?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Do multiracial schools comprised primarily of minority students present a new paradigm and warrant additional research, or are they just another iteration of segregation?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The report notes that Asians are the most integrated racial group. In contrast, whites tend to be the most racially isolated, although most do not see themselves as being isolated. Must this point be acknowledged to have a realistic chance for policy change?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch111">C. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch112">1. <i>Historical and Statutory Background</i></p>
<p class="noindent">As indicated in the previous section, courts first addressed the rights of ELLs in the context of school segregation. Language status was, in many instances, a pretext for race and ethnic segregation, but because school districts raised language barriers as a defense for segregation, courts had to address the issue. Striking down the segregation of Latino students, the district court in <i>Mendez v. Westminister School District of Orange County</i>, 64 F. Supp. 544, 549 (S.D. Cal. 1946), wrote</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">the only tenable ground upon which segregation practices in the defendant school districts can be defended lies in the English language deficiencies of some of the children of Mexican ancestry as they enter elementary public school life as beginners. But even such situations do not justify the general and continuous segregation in separate schools of the children of Mexican ancestry from the rest of the elementary school population.…</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">The district court held that classroom segregation based on language was permissible where “credible examination by the appropriate school authority of each child whose capacity to learn is under consideration,” but a student’s ethnic trait or ancestry could not be part of the consideration. <i>Id.</i> at 550.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue left unanswered in the <i>Mendez</i> litigation was what instructional responsibilities, if any, a school district has to ELL students in the classroom. The prohibition against school building segregation based on language is relatively meaningless if schools are free to segregate ELL students in classrooms and have no responsibility to ensure those students are learning. The first major attempt to address this question came in 1968 when Congress passed the Bilingual Education Act as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The Act provided federal funds to incentivize schools to implement bilingual education. 20 U.S.C. §880(b) (1970). While some expressed concerns that bilingual programs could become too costly and reinforce cultural isolation rather than integration, the wider political support for civil rights and cultural inclusiveness of the time provided political momentum for the Act and helped it avoid a</p>
<p><a id="page_292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>292</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">significant controversy. <span class="smallcap">Arnold H. Leibowitz, The Bilingual Education Act: A Legislative Analysis 9 (1980)</span>. With that said, the funding for bilingual education was still limited. John Strahinich, <i>Ethnicity and Education: Bilingual Education Runs into Trouble</i>, <span class="smallcap">Boston Rev</span>., Oct. 1981.</p>
<p class="indent">The next major step came in 1970 when the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, or national origin as a source of rights for ELLs. OCR indicated that “Title VI compliance reviews [and investigations] have revealed a number of common practices which have the effect of denying equality of educational opportunity to Spanish-surnamed pupils [and] disadvantaged pupils from other national origin-minority groups.” Dep’t of Health, Educ., and Welfare Office for Civil Rights, <i>Identification of Discrimination and Denial of Services on the Basis of National Origin</i>, 35 <span class="smallcap">Fed. Reg</span>. 11595-03 (July 18, 1970). Whether these practices were intentionally discriminatory, deliberately indifferent, or just produced disparate impacts was of little import at the time.

<p class="indent">In <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), the Supreme Court took up these issues when Chinese students challenged San Francisco’s failure to provide any particularized instruction to address their limited English proficiency. The Court wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[T]here is no equality of treatment merely by providing students with the same facilities, textbooks, teachers, and curriculum; for students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.…Imposition of a requirement that, before a child can effectively participate in the educational program, he must already have acquired those basic [English] skills is to make a mockery of public education.

<p class="noindent">intentional discrimination, the Court indirectly called the viability of <i>Lau</i>’s holding into question because <i>Lau</i> was premised on the notion that Title VI prohibited disparate impact in addition to intentional discrimination. This issue, however, is largely moot because Congress passed the Equal Education Opportunities Act of 1974 and explicitly addressed districts’ obligation to ELL students. The Act mandated that schools and educational agencies “take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by [their] students in [their] instructional programs.” 20 U.S.C. §1703(f) (1976). Since then, the EEOA has been the primary source of law governing the education of ELL students. The most definitive legal interpretation of the Act was issued by the Fifth Circuit in 1981 in <i>Castaneda v. Pickard</i>. The case articulated a three-prong standard for evaluating ELL programs under the EEOA. Courts and agencies have nearly uniformly followed the standard ever since.</p>

<p class="h5a"><i>648 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1981)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs, instituted this action against the Raymondville, Texas Independent School District (RISD) alleging that the district engaged in racial discrimination against Mexican-Americans which deprived the plaintiffs of rights secured to them by the fourteenth amendment and 42 U.S.C. §1983 (1976), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974. Specifically, plaintiffs charged that the school district unlawfully discriminated against them by failing to implement adequate bilingual education to overcome the linguistic barriers that impede the plaintiffs’ equal participation in the educational program of the district.</p>
<p class="indent">Raymondville is located in Willacy County, Texas. [B]y conservative estimate based on census data, 77% of the population of the county is Mexican-American and almost all of the remaining 23% is “Anglo.” The student population of RISD is about 85% Mexican-American.</p>
<p class="indent">Willacy County ranks 248th out of the 254 Texas counties in average family income. Approximately one-third of the population of Raymondville is composed of migrant farm workers. Three-quarters of the students in the Raymondville schools qualify for the federally funded free school lunch program. The district’s assessed property valuation places it among the lowest ten percent of all Texas counties in its per capita student expenditures.</p>
<p class="indent">The district operates five schools. Two campuses, L.C. Smith and Pittman, house students in kindergarten through fifth grade. The student body at L.C. Smith is virtually 100% Mexican-American; Pittman, which has almost twice as many students, has approximately 83% Mexican-American students. There is one junior high school, which has 87% Mexican-American students, and one high school, in which the enrollment is 80% Mexican-American.</p>
<p><a id="page_294" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>294</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[I]</span></p>
<p class="indent">RISD currently operates a bilingual education program for all students in kindergarten through third grade. The language ability of each student entering the Raymondville program is assessed when he or she enters school. The language dominance test currently employed by the district is approved for this purpose by the [Texas Education Agency (TEA)]. The program of bilingual instruction offered students in the Raymondville schools has been developed with the assistance of expert consultants retained by the TEA and employs a group of materials developed by a regional educational center operated by the TEA. The articulated goal of the program is to teach students fundamental reading and writing skills in both Spanish and English by the end of third grade.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the program’s emphasis is on the development of language skills in the two languages, other cognitive and substantive areas are addressed, e. g., mathematics skills are taught and tested in Spanish as well as English during these years. All of the teachers employed in the bilingual education program of the district have met the minimum state requirements to teach bilingual classes. However, only about half of these teachers are Mexican-American and native Spanish speakers; the other teachers in the program have been certified to teach bilingual classes following a 100 hour course designed by TEA to give them a limited Spanish vocabulary (700 words) and an understanding of the theory and methods employed in bilingual programs. Teachers in the bilingual program are assisted by classroom aides, most of whom are fluent in Spanish.</p>
<p class="indent">RISD does not offer a formal program of bilingual education after the third grade. In grades 4 and 5, although classroom instruction is only in English, Spanish speaking teacher aides are used to assist students having language difficulties which may impair their ability to participate in classroom activities. For students in grades 4-12 having limited English proficiency or academic deficiencies in other areas, the RISD provides assistance in the form of a learning center operated at each school. This center provides a diagnostic/prescriptive program in which students’ particular academic deficiencies, whether in language or other areas, are identified and addressed by special remedial programs. Approximately 1,000 of the district’s students, almost one-third of the total enrollment, receive special assistance through small classes provided by these learning centers. The district also makes English as a Second Language classes and special tutoring in English available to all students in all grades; this program is especially designed to meet the needs of limited English speaking students who move into the district in grades above 3.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[II]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs claim that the bilingual education and language remediation programs offered by the Raymondville schools are educationally deficient and unsound and that RISD’s failure to alter and improve these programs places the district in violation of Title VI and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. RISD’s program does not violate Title VI [for three reasons. First, the <i>Lau</i> Guidelines developed by the Department of HEW following the Supreme</p>
<p><a id="page_295" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>295</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Court’s decision in <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, upon which plaintiffs rely so heavily, do not purport to set the standard for assessing the sufficiency of a language program, but rather speak to the legal responsibilities of districts that are not providing any language assistance to students of limited English proficiency. Second, because RISD does have a language assistance program, it is not in violation of these guidelines. Third, because these guidelines “were not developed through the usual administrative procedures employed to draft administrative rules or regulations,” they are not “the sort of administrative document to which we customarily give great deference in our determinations of compliance with a statute.”]</p>
<p class="indent">We must [also] confess to serious doubts about the continuing vitality of the rationale of the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Lau v. Nichols</i> which gave rise to those guidelines. <i>Lau</i> was written prior to <i>Washington v. Davis</i>, in which the Court held that a discriminatory purpose must be shown to establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and <i>Univ. of California Regents v. Bakke</i>, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), in which a majority of the court interpreted Title VI to be coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause. Whatever the deficiencies of the RISD’s program of language remediation may be, we do not think it can seriously be asserted that this program was intended or designed to discriminate against Mexican-American students in the district. Thus, we think it cannot be said that the arguable inadequacies of the program render it violative of Title VI.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs, however, also claim that the district’s current program is unlawful under §1703(f) of the EEOA which makes it unlawful for an educational agency to fail to take “appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.” [W]e have very little legislative history from which to glean the Congressional intent behind the EEOA’s provisions. Thus, we shall adhere closely to the plain language of §1703(f) in defining the meaning of this provision. Unlike subsections (a) and (e) of §1703, §1703(f) does not contain language that explicitly incorporates an intent requirement nor, like §1703(d) which we construed above, does this subsection employ words such as “discrimination” whose legal definition has been understood to incorporate an intent requirement. [I]n <i>Morales v. Shannon</i>, we assumed that the failure of an educational agency to undertake appropriate efforts to remedy the language deficiencies of its students, regardless of whether such a failure is motivated by an intent to discriminate against those students, would violate §1703(f) and we think that such a construction of that subsection is most consistent with the plain meaning of the language employed in §1703(f). Thus, the essential holding of <i>Lau</i>, i.e., that schools are not free to ignore the need of limited English speaking children for language assistance to enable them to participate in the instructional program of the district, has now been legislated by Congress, acting pursuant to its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment. The difficult question presented by plaintiffs’ challenge to the current language remediation programs in RISD is really whether Congress in enacting §1703(f) intended to go beyond the essential requirement of <i>Lau</i>, that the schools do something, and impose, through the use of the term “appropriate action” a more specific obligation on state and local educational authorities.</p>
<p><a id="page_296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>296</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">We note that although Congress enacted both the Biligual [<i>sic</i>] Education Act and the EEOA as part of the 1974 amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Congress, in describing the remedial obligation it sought to impose on the states in the EEOA, did not specify that a state must provide a program of “bilingual education” to all limited English speaking students. We think Congress’ use of the less specific term, “appropriate action,” rather than “biligual [<i>sic</i>] education,” indicates that Congress intended to leave state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing programs and techniques to meet their obligations under the EEOA. However, by including an obligation to address the problem of language barriers in the EEOA and granting limited English speaking students a private right of action to enforce that obligation in §1706, Congress also must have intended to insure that schools made a genuine and good faith effort, consistent with local circumstances and resources, to remedy the language deficiencies of their students and deliberately placed on federal courts the difficult responsibility of determining whether that obligation had been met.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress has provided us with almost no guidance, in the form of text or legislative history, to assist us in determining whether a school district’s language remediation efforts are “appropriate.” Thus we find ourselves confronted with a type of task which federal courts are ill-equipped to perform and which we are often criticized for undertaking prescribing substantive standards and policies for institutions whose governance is properly reserved to other levels and branches of our government (i.e., state and local educational agencies). Confronted, reluctantly, with this type of task, we have attempted to devise a mode of analysis which will permit ourselves and the lower courts to fulfill the responsibility Congress has assigned to us without unduly substituting our educational values for the educational and political decisions reserved to state or local school authorities or the expert knowledge of educators.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">[III]</span></p>
<p class="indent">In a case in which the appropriateness of a particular school system’s language remediation program is challenged under §1703(f), we believe that the responsibility of the federal court is threefold. First, the court must examine carefully the evidence the record contains concerning the soundness of the educational theory or principles upon which the challenged program is based. This, of course, is not to be done with any eye toward discerning the relative merits of sound but competing bodies of expert educational opinion, for choosing between sound but competing theories is properly left to the educators and public officials charged with responsibility for directing the educational policy of a school system. The state of the art in the area of language remediation may well be such that respected authorities legitimately differ as to the best type of educational program for limited English speaking students and we do not believe that Congress in enacting §1703(f) intended to make the resolution of these differences the province of federal courts. The court’s responsibility, insofar as educational theory is concerned, is only to ascertain that a school system is pursuing a program informed by an educational theory recognized as sound</p>
<p><a id="page_297" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>297</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">by some experts in the field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">The court’s second inquiry would be whether the programs and practices actually used by a school system are reasonably calculated to implement effectively the educational theory adopted by the school. We do not believe that it may fairly be said that a school system is taking appropriate action to remedy language barriers if, despite the adoption of a promising theory, the system fails to follow through with practices, resources and personnel necessary to transform the theory into reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a determination that a school system has adopted a sound program for alleviating the language barriers impeding the educational progress of some of its students and made bona fide efforts to make the program work does not necessarily end the court’s inquiry. If a school’s program fails, after being employed for a period of time sufficient to give the plan a legitimate trial, to produce results indicating that the language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome, that program may, at that point, no longer constitute appropriate action as far as that school is concerned. We do not believe Congress intended that under §1703(f) a school would be free to persist in a policy which, although it may have been “appropriate” when adopted, in the sense that there were sound expectations for success and bona fide efforts to make the program work, has, in practice, proved a failure.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, the plaintiffs’ challenge to the appropriateness of the RISD’s efforts does not rest on an argument over the soundness of the educational policy being pursued by the district, but rather on the alleged inadequacy of the program actually implemented by the district. Plaintiffs contend that in three areas essential to the adequacy of a bilingual program—curriculum, staff and testing—Raymondville falls short. Plaintiffs contend that although RISD purports to offer a bilingual education program in grades K-3, the district’s curriculum actually overemphasizes the development of reading and writing skills in English to the detriment of education in other areas such as mathematics and science, and that, as a result, children whose first language was Spanish emerge from the bilingual education program behind their classmates in these other areas. The record in this case does not support plaintiffs’ allegation that the educational program for predominantly Spanish speaking students in grades K-3 provides significantly less attention to these other areas than does the curriculum used in the English language dominant classrooms. [While it may be true that “Spanish language dominant children spend” more time “on language development” in classes devoted to “music, creative writing and physical education” than children in other rooms, they] spend almost exactly the same amount of classroom time on math, science and social studies as do their counterparts in the predominantly English speaking classrooms.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if we accept this allegation as true, however, we do not think that a school system which provides limited English speaking students with a curriculum, during the early part of their school career, which has, as its primary objective, the development of literacy in English, has failed to fulfill its obligations under §1703(f), even if the result of such a program is an interim sacrifice of learning in other areas during this period. The language of §1703(f) speaks in</p>
<p><a id="page_298" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>298</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">terms of taking action “to overcome language barriers” which impede the “equal participation” of limited English speaking children in the regular instructional program. We believe the statute clearly contemplates that provision of a program placing primary emphasis on the development of English language skills would constitute “appropriate action.”</p>
<p class="indent">Limited English speaking students entering school face a task not encountered by students who are already proficient in English. Since the number of hours in any school day is limited, some of the time which limited English speaking children will spend learning English may be devoted to other subjects by students who entered school already proficient in English. In order to be able ultimately to participate equally with the students who entered school with an English language background, the limited English speaking students will have to acquire both English language proficiency and to recoup any deficits which they may incur in other areas of the curriculum as a result of this extra expenditure of time on English language development. We understand §1703(f) to impose on educational agencies not only an obligation to overcome the direct obstacle to learning which the language barrier itself poses, but also a duty to provide limited English speaking ability students with assistance in other areas of the curriculum where their equal participation may be impaired because of deficits incurred during participation in an agency’s language remediation program. If no remedial action is taken to overcome the academic deficits that limited English speaking students may incur during a period of intensive language training, then the language barrier, although itself remedied, might, nevertheless, pose a lingering and indirect impediment to these students’ equal participation in the regular instructional program. We also believe, however, that §1703(f) leaves schools free to determine whether they wish to discharge these obligations simultaneously, by implementing a program designed to keep limited English speaking students at grade level in other areas of the curriculum by providing instruction in their native language at the same time that an English language development effort is pursued, or to address these problems in sequence, by focusing first on the development of English language skills and then later providing students with compensatory and supplemental education to remedy deficiencies. In short, §1703(f) leaves schools free to determine the sequence and manner in which limited English speaking students tackle this dual challenge so long as the schools design programs which are reasonably calculated to enable these students to attain parity of participation in the standard instructional program within a reasonable length of time. Therefore, we disagree with plaintiffs’ assertion that a school system which chooses to focus first on English language development and later provides students with an intensive remedial program to help them catch up in other areas of the curriculum has failed to fulfill its statutory obligation under §1703(f).</p>
<p class="indent">Although we therefore find no merit in the plaintiffs’ [challenge to] the emphasis the curriculum places on English language development in the primary grades, we are more troubled by the plaintiffs’ allegations that the district’s implementation of the program has been severely deficient in the area of preparing its teachers for bilingual education. Although the plaintiffs raised this issue below and introduced evidence addressed to it, the district court made no</p>
<p><a id="page_299" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>299</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">findings on the adequacy of the teacher training program employed by RISD. We begin by noting that any school district that chooses to fulfill its obligations under §1703 by means of a bilingual education program has undertaken a responsibility to provide teachers who are able competently to teach in such a program. The record in this case indicates that some of the teachers employed in the RISD bilingual program have a very limited command of Spanish, despite completion of the TEA course. Plaintiffs’ expert witness, Dr. Jose Cardenas, was one of the bilingual educators who participated in the original design of the 100 hour continuing education course to prepare them to teach bilingual classes. He testified that a subsequent evaluation of the program showed that although it was effective in introducing teachers to the methodology of bilingual education, the course was “a dismal failure in the development of sufficient proficiency in a language other than English to qualify the people for teaching bilingual programs.” [T]estimony of those involved in the RISD’s program [also] suggested that despite completion of the 100 hour course, some of the district’s English speaking teachers were inadequately prepared to teach in a bilingual classroom. Mr. Inez Ibarra, who was employed by the district as bilingual supervisor, testified in the administrative hearing that he had observed the teachers in the bilingual program and that some of the teachers had difficulty communicating in Spanish and that there were teachers in the program who taught almost exclusively in English, using Spanish, at most, one day per week. He also described the evaluation program used to determine the Spanish proficiency of the teachers at the end of the 100 hour course. Teachers were required to write a paragraph in Spanish. Since in completing this task, they were permitted to use a Spanish-English dictionary, Ibarra acknowledged that this was not a valid measure of their Spanish vocabulary. Teachers also read orally from a Spanish language text and answered oral questions. There was no formal grading of the examination; the certification committee had no guide to measure the Spanish language vocabulary of the teachers based on their performance on the exam. Thus, it may well have been impossible for the committee to determine whether the teachers had mastered even the 700 word vocabulary the TEA had deemed the minimum to enable a teacher to work effectively in a bilingual elementary classroom. Following the examination, the committee would have an informal discussion among themselves and decide whether or not the teacher was qualified. Mr. Ibarra testified that the certification committee had approved some teachers who were in need of more training “much more than what they were given.”</p>
<p class="indent">The record thus raises serious doubts about the actual language competency of the teachers employed in bilingual classrooms and about the degree to which the district is making a genuine effort to assess and improve the qualifications of its bilingual teachers. As in any educational program, qualified teachers are a critical component of the success of a language remediation program. A bilingual education program, however sound in theory, is clearly unlikely to have a significant impact on language barriers, if the teachers charged with educating children are termed “qualified” despite the fact that they operate under their own unremedied language disability. The use of Spanish speaking aides may be an appropriate interim measure, but such aides cannot, RISD</p>
<p><a id="page_300" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>300</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">acknowledges, take the place of qualified bilingual teachers. The record in this case strongly suggests that the efforts RISD has made to overcome the language barriers confronting many of the teachers are inadequate. On this record, we think a finding to the contrary would be clearly erroneous. Nor can there be any question that deficiencies in the in-service training of teachers for bilingual classrooms seriously undermine the promise of the district’s bilingual education program. Until deficiencies in this aspect of the program’s implementation are remedied, we do not think RISD can be deemed to be taking “appropriate action” to overcome the language disabilities of its students. [W]e are by no means suggesting that teachers already employed by the district should be replaced or that the district is limited to hiring only teachers who are already qualified to teach in a bilingual program. We are requiring only that RISD undertake further measures to improve the ability of any teacher, whether now or hereafter employed, to teach effectively in a bilingual classroom.</p>
<p class="indent">The third specific area in which plaintiffs claim that RISD programs are seriously deficient is in the testing and evaluation of students having limited English proficiency. Plaintiffs claim first that the language dominance placement test used to evaluate students entering Raymondville schools is inadequate. [B]y the time of the trial in this civil suit RISD had adopted a test approved by TEA. None of plaintiffs’ expert witnesses testified that this test was an inappropriate one. Thus, we do not think there is any reason to believe that the district is deficient in the area of initial evaluation of students entering the bilingual program.</p>
<p class="indent">A more difficult question is whether the testing RISD employs to measure the progress of students is adequate. [P]roper testing and evaluation is essential in determining the progress of students involved in a bilingual program and ultimately, in evaluating the program itself. In their brief, plaintiffs contend that RISD’s testing program is inadequate because the limited English speaking students in the bilingual program are not tested in their own language to determine their progress in areas of the curriculum other than English language literacy skills. Although during the bilingual program Spanish speaking students receive much of their instruction in these other areas in the Spanish language, the achievement level of these students is tested, in part, by the use of standardized English language achievement tests. No standardized Spanish language tests are used. Plaintiffs contend that testing the achievement levels of children, who are admittedly not yet literate in English and are receiving instruction in another language, through the use of an English language achievement test, does not meaningfully assess their achievement, any more than it does their ability, a contention with which we can scarcely disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">Valid testing of students’ progress in these areas is, we believe, essential to measure the adequacy of a language remediation program. The progress of limited English speaking students in these other areas of the curriculum must be measured by means of a standardized test in their own language because no other device is adequate to determine their progress vis-à-vis that of their English speaking counterparts. Although, we do not believe these students must necessarily be continuously maintained at grade level in other areas of instruction during the period in which they are mastering English, these</p>
<p><a id="page_301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>301</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">students cannot be permitted to incur irreparable academic deficits during this period. Only by measuring the actual progress of students in these areas can it be determined that such irremediable deficiencies are not being incurred.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally plaintiffs contend that test results indicate that the limited English speaking students who participate in the district’s bilingual education program do not reach a parity of achievement with students who entered school already proficient in English at any time throughout the elementary grades and that since the district’s language program has failed to establish such parity, it cannot be deemed “appropriate action” under §1703(f). Although this question was raised at the district court level, no findings were made on this claim. While under some circumstances it may be proper for a court to examine the achievement scores of students involved in a language remediation program in order to determine whether this group appears on the whole to attain parity of participation with other students, we do not think that such an inquiry is, as yet, appropriate with regard to RISD. Such an inquiry may become proper after the inadequacies in the implementation of the RISD’s program, which we have identified, have been corrected and the program has operated with the benefit of these improvements for a period of time sufficient to expect meaningful results.</p>
<p class="indent">Because an effective language remediation program is essential to the education of many students in Raymondville, we think it imperative that the district court, as soon as possible, conduct a hearing to identify the precise causes of the language deficiencies affecting some of the RISD teachers and to establish a time table for the parties to alleviate these deficiencies. The district court should also assure that RISD takes whatever steps are necessary to acquire validated Spanish language achievement tests for administration to students in the bilingual program at an appropriate time during the 1981-82 academic year.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What exactly must a district do to comply with the EEOA? What limits, if any, exist on districts’ discretion in adopting an educational program to assist ELLs? Given that the choice of an educational program is a pedagogical decision, would it be appropriate for courts to second-guess districts? Is there any way the courts could exercise review of these decisions without actually “second-guessing” districts? Scholars have been critical of the level of deference this prong affords. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Derek W. Black, <i>Civil Rights, Charter Schools, and Lessons to Be Learned</i>, 64 <span class="smallcap">Fla. L. Rev</span>. 1723, 1782 (2012); Eric Haas, <i>The Equal Educational Opportunity Act 30 Years Later: Time to Revisit “Appropriate Action” for Assisting English Language Learners</i>, 34 J.L. &amp; <span class="smallcap">Educ</span>. 361 (2005); Claire Raj, <i>The Gap Between Rights and Reality: The Intersection of Language, Disability, and Educational Opportunity</i>, 87 <span class="smallcap">Temp. L. Rev</span>. 283, 287-290 (2015).</p>
<p class="indent">2. The second prong of <i>Castaneda</i> requires a showing that the district has appropriately implemented its chosen program. In what respects did this district fail this prong?</p>
<p><a id="page_302" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>302</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">3. The final prong of <i>Castaneda</i> requires a showing that “the language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome.” Here the court criticizes the district’s testing methods but indicates the district has a period of years in which to show that its program is effective in this respect. After this period, how would a plaintiff or school district meet this burden? Who are these students to be gauged against: themselves, other students in the school, or ELL students at other schools?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Does equal educational opportunity require that ELL students be moved to parity with non-ELL students or only that they overcome language barriers so that they can then access English instruction equally with other students? Can these two concepts be separated? Given that ELL status will disadvantage ELL students until they overcome their initial language barriers, does equal opportunity require that they then be given additional remedial instruction afterward so that they are achieving at a level that is consistent with their academic capacities? Is that asking too much of schools?</p>
<p class="indent">5. On the one hand, the court writes in a commanding tone indicating that “if no remedial action is taken to overcome the academic deficits that limited English speaking students may incur during a period of intensive language training, then the language barrier, although itself remedied, might, nevertheless, pose a lingering and indirect impediment to these students’ equal participation in the regular instructional program.” But on the other hand, the court sets no short-term benchmarks for assuring that districts comply with these requirements. At worst, the districts have a few years to implement their program, after which the damage could already be done. Is this a necessary evil given the need to respect local decision making, or does it afford districts too much latitude? Are there any reasonable benchmarks that Congress and/or the courts might set in the first instance?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Does this case set high, low, or average expectations for ELL programs and the achievement of students within them? Are these expectations consistent with the purpose and language of the EEOA?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Is there a threshold number of students in need of language assistance that necessitates a programmatic response by a school? At least one lower court has indicated that programmatic responses are required regardless of the number of ELL students. Heavy Runner v. Bremner, 522 F. Supp. 162 (D. Mont. 1981) (remedial action required if even one student is denied equal educational opportunity).</p>
<p class="indent">8. Providing services to ELL students can also intersect with school desegregation. For instance, the United States originally brought suit against the state of Texas for the segregation of nine all-black school districts. United States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex. 1970). Two years later, Mexican-American students intervened in the litigation, asserting a denial of equal educational opportunity. <i>See</i> United States v. Texas, 601 F.3d 354, 357 (5th Cir. 2010) (detailing the case’s procedural history). In subsequent years, the case morphed almost entirely into one addressing whether the state was meeting its obligations under the EEOA. <i>Id.</i> at 358.</p>
<p class="indent">9. The <i>Castaneda</i> analysis focuses almost exclusively on school districts’ actions, but property poor districts may lack the resources to unilaterally</p>

<p class="noindent">improve their ELL programs. In a state with a regressive funding system, a poor district’s noncompliance with EEOA may be as much a product of state fiscal policy as local decisions. Can a court fairly evaluate a district’s ELL program under the EEOA without also considering the district’s fiscal capacity? To the extent funding is relevant, should the state be a codefendant in these cases? Do underfunded ELL programs also implicate state constitutional rights to education? State courts and school finance scholars have rarely devoted distinct independent analysis to ELL funding. The most notable analysis of ELL funding is in <i>Horne v. Flores</i>, 557 U.S. 433 (2009), the discussion and reprint of which appear later in this chapter.</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The first prong of the <i>Castaneda</i> standard largely defers to local discretion regarding the soundness of a school’s language program. By local discretion, however, courts mean the local school district and the state, as opposed to the federal government or courts. <i>Castaneda</i> just so happens to involve a challenge to a local district’s actions, but other cases have challenged the failings of state educational agencies. Courts have held that the affirmative duty to assist ELL students in overcoming language barriers extends to state education agencies as well. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Gomez v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 811 F.2d 1030 (7th Cir. 1987); United States v. Texas, 680 F.2d 356, 371-372 (5th Cir. 1982); Idaho Migrant Council v. Bd. of Educ., 647 F.2d 69 (9th Cir. 1981). Thus, states should exercise control over and provide assistance to local districts in carrying out and structuring their ELL programs.</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">The ELL program that the court in <i>Castaneda</i> struck down was, in many respects, minimal or rudimentary. In contrast, the next case involves a district with a more robust program for providing specialized services to ELL students. The fact that the district had developed a rather extensive and detailed language program made a significant difference in the legal analysis. Regardless of the substantive efficacy of the program, a detailed and established program implicitly represents serious efforts by a school district, which likely count in its favor regardless of their efficacy. As you read the case, compare it to the previous one and consider whether the practical result of the EEOA is to require positive results for ELL students or only good faith efforts by school districts toward that end.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch115">Teresa P. v. Berkeley Unified School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>724 F. Supp. 698 (N.D. Cal. 1989)</i></p>
<p class="indent">[The District’s 571 LEP students speak approximately 38 languages other than English. About 40 percent of the Limited English Proficient (LEP) students speak Spanish, but the rest of the languages account for only small percentages</p>
<p><a id="page_304" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>304</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and many are spoken by only 1 to 3 students in total. Moreover, these students do not all attend the same schools, but rather are spread across 17 elementary schools, 2 junior high schools, and 1 high school.</p>
<p class="indent">Parents fill out surveys to identify any languages other than English that are spoken at home and the district subsequently tests the oral and written English proficiency of students who speak languages other than English at home through a battery of different tests, some of which have been evaluated as effective by outside experts.</p>
<p class="indent">“Students identified by the BUSD [Berkeley Unified School District] as LEP students are placed in the District’s program of special language services. Parents are notified of such placement.…The parents are given the option to withdraw their child from the program [or] transfe[r] their child from one type of special language services program to another where choices are available based on the language needs of the individual child. Parents also may withdraw their child from all participation in special language services.”</p>
<p class="indent">“The District has adopted two types of special language services: (1) a Spanish bilingual program; and (2) ESL [English as a second language] programs in three separate forms.” The District offers bilingual education in its elementary schools. Students are taught to read and write in Spanish before they are taught to read and write in English, but the bilingual program emphasizes English language development. Its bilingual teachers are fully credentialed bilingual teachers. After examining its program in 1984, the District “concluded that the program did not produce satisfactory English and academic results” and modified it to promote English proficiency as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">The District’s ESL program provides special language services to all LEP students who are not in the Spanish bilingual program. The ESL program delivers instruction in English, and its curriculum focuses on rapid development of English proficiency. The program provides both instruction in the English language and simultaneous academic instruction. “All regular classroom teachers who teach LEP students are scheduled to receive training in Sheltered English methods during the 1988-89 academic year.” The district also employs ESL resource teachers who receive additional training and must meet higher certification requirements.</p>
<p class="indent">ESL students attend class with non-ESL students to avoid in-school segregation. LEP students who need additional help are given help on a “pull-out” basis individually or in small groups. To coordinate ESL and regular instruction, the District develops an individual learning plan for each LEP student. All ESL students receive extensive tutoring, which is offered in students’ native tongue when necessary and possible (but tutoring in native language is not possible for all languages). The District’s techniques are based on generally accepted educational theories.</p>
<p class="indent">The District also has several other supplementary and compensatory programs “to assist low achieving minority students, a category of students that includes LEP students as well as others.”</p>
<p class="indent">“LEP students are tested annually for oral and written proficiency in English.…[T]o be eligible to exit the District’s programs of special language services, a LEP student must score at least at the 38th percentile level [in California’s Test of Basic Skills (CTBS), at the ‘fluent’ level on” a written language</p>
<p><a id="page_305" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>305</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">proficiency test and pass an oral exam. “[W]hen a LEP student has been receiving language services for more than 3 years, the achievement test score criterion may be relaxed if the student’s teacher and principal so recommend, with District supervisor approval.”</p>
<p class="indent">After the District authorizes a student to exit the language program, it monitors the student’s progress for an additional six months. If the student does not make satisfactory progress, staff meet to determine whether to furnish the student language services again.</p>
<p class="indent">In most grades, the math, reading, and English report card scores for LEP students were similar to those of non-LEP students. During the course of one year, LEP students increased their English proficiency by an average of 1.41 points on a scale of 1 through 7. “CTBS scores 2 years before reclassification compared to scores two years after reclassification of former LEP students…went from the middle 40s up to the low 70s [in English language], and…from the middle 30s up to the middle 60s [in reading]. Math scores went from 60 to 70 up to 70 to 80.” Berkeley’s LEP students score at levels similar to those of LEP students in Fremont and San Jose, both of which are regarded as having effective LEP programs. Based on standardized test scores, Berkeley’s LEP students “are learning at rates equal to, and in some cases greater than, their counterparts, countywide and statewide.” “A comparison of the academic achievement of LEP students in the ESL-ILP and the Spanish bilingual programs shows no significant difference in achievement.” BUSD developed its LEP program in conjunction with parental input. Most Hispanic parents preferred a bilingual language program, while most Asian parents preferred the ESL program “because it represented the fastest way to learn English.” Most parents of LEP students expressed satisfaction with the education their children receive in the District.]</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">1. Legal Framework</span></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs[’] first cause of action is based on section 1703(f) of the EEOA. The EEOA does not define appropriate action nor does it provide criteria for a court to evaluate whether or not a school district has taken “appropriate action.” The clearest statement of this requirement is set forth in <i>Castaneda v. Pickard</i>, 648 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1981). <i>Castaneda</i> held that in evaluating a school system’s language remediation program, a court must conduct the following three-prong analysis. First, the court must determine whether the school district is pursuing a program “informed by an educational theory recognized as sound by some experts in the field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental strategy.” Second, the court must establish whether “the programs and practices actually used by the school system are reasonably calculated to implement effectively the educational theory adopted by the school.” Third, the court must determine whether the school’s program, although premised on sound educational theory and effectively implemented, “produces results indicating that the language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome.” Several other courts have adopted this approach. Although this Court is not bound by the <i>Castaneda</i> three-prong approach, the decision does provide the Court with useful criteria to be used in the review of appropriate action issues.</p>
<p><a id="page_306" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>306</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">2. Discussion</span></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs contend that the BUSD has failed to take appropriate action to overcome the language barriers faced by its LEP students. Specifically, plaintiffs challenge the BUSDs alternative to bilingual education, which is an ESL-ILP program at the elementary level and ESL classes and a Sheltered English program at the secondary level. They claim that even if the program rests on a pedagogically sound basis its implementation violates the appropriate action standard of the EEOA. Plaintiffs argue that by failing to provide qualified teachers, sufficient supporting resources, and necessary monitoring systems, the BUSD has violated the EEOA. Plaintiffs also argue that the procedures utilized by the BUSD to identify, place, and exit students from the special language services program, violate the EEOA.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>a. Sound Educational Theory</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The EEOA does not require school districts to adopt a specific educational theory or implement an ideal academic program. That Congress utilized the term “appropriate action,” rather than “bilingual education,” indicates that Congress intended to leave educational authorities substantial latitude in formulating programs to meet their EEOA obligations.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the diversity of opinion in the education field concerning which theoretical and programmatic approach is sound, it is fortunate that this Court is not charged with the difficult task of establishing the ideal program or choosing between competing theories. Instead, this Court is charged solely with the responsibility of determining whether the BUSD’s program is informed by an educational theory which some experts recognize as sound. After reviewing the evidence presented in this case, this Court concludes that the plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that the BUSD program is not pedagogically sound. In fact, the evidence shows that the educational theories, upon which the BUSD’s programs are grounded, are manifestly as sound as any theory identified by plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="indent">Although plaintiffs advocate a program that emphasizes native tongue instruction, they introduced no objective evidence demonstrating that the efficacy of this approach, whatever it may be, for teaching LEP students English, or helping them succeed in a mainstream environment, renders the alternative programs preferred by BUSD pedagogically unsound.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>b. Implementation of the Educational Program</i></b></p>
<p class="h10b"><i>(1) Effective Teachers</i></p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs maintain that the training of the bilingual teacher and tutor is crucial to the proper implementation of a language remediation program. Plaintiffs argue that by failing to hire teachers and tutors qualified to provide the highly technical and specialized instruction required by the ESL approach, the BUSD has failed to implement a sound educational program.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs contend that in order to implement its language remediation program, BUSDs teachers must have skills based on academic course work in ESL methodology, the developmental needs of LEP students, language</p>
<p><a id="page_307" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>307</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">proficiency assessment procedures, applied linguistics, general language acquisition, and second language acquisition. Plaintiffs contend that the BUSD should assure this competence by hiring teachers with a language development specialist credential, a bilingual-crosscultural certificate of proficiency or a bilingual-crosscultural specialist credential. Plaintiffs further argue that in order to effectively deliver ESL instruction, the tutors and paraprofessionals hired by the BUSD must also possess a certificate or credential indicating that they possess the necessary skills and educational background.</p>
<p class="indent">By including in the EEOA the obligation to remove language barriers through appropriate action, Congress intended to ensure that school districts make “genuine and good faith efforts, <i>consistent with local circumstances and resources</i>,” to remedy the language deficiencies of their LEP students. <i>Castaneda</i>, 648 F.2d at 1009. To this end, a school district that chooses to fulfill its EEOA obligations by means of a bilingual program must make good faith efforts to provide teachers competent to teach such a program. However, as <i>Castaneda</i> makes clear, the question of whether a school district has in good faith attempted to implement such a program must be tested against reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on the record in this case, this Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show that the actual programs and practices are not reasonably calculated to effectively implement the educational theories upon which an overall program is premised. The BUSD has not violated the EEOA by a failed implementation effort.</p>
<p class="indent">The threshold question is, of course, whether or not the credentialed teachers contemplated by plaintiffs are in fact available to a school district who seeks them out. The evidence at trial did not fully resolve this issue but did suggest that it is highly unlikely that the BUSD could fill all necessary positions with fully credentialed teachers in the basic language groups and that it is impossible to cover all languages represented in the BUSD school population. The record in this case established that the mix of teachers newly hired or reassigned to language remediation responsibilities by the BUSD, included both credentialed and non-credentialed teachers. Those without credentials were assessed as to relevant bilingual skills, required to participate in district level training sessions, and to make substantial progress toward completion of requirements for credentials as a condition of employment. The situation with tutors was much the same. The BUSD looks to college graduates or students with two years college at a minimum, finds some with native language ability, and provides relevant district level training to all.</p>
<p class="indent">The other major assumption of plaintiffs in this area is that it is necessary to hold language-specific credentials in order to deliver remediation programs which do not violate the EEOA. The evidence in the record does not support this assumption. Rather, it tends to show an alternative assumption: that good teachers are good teachers no matter what the educational challenge may be. There is in fact evidence in the record showing that there is no difference in achievement success of LEP students in the BUSD between students with credentialed teachers and students who do not have credentialed teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, any review of the actual complement of teachers and the support provided them must be done in light of the resources actually available to the</p>
<p><a id="page_308" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>308</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">BUSD. The fact that the BUSD was nearly bankrupt in 1986 simply underscores the reality that the BUSD does not have unlimited funds and that program delivery by the BUSD in all areas is conditioned upon that fact.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though funds are limited, the evidence in this case shows that the BUSD has committed significant funds to language remediation program delivery and further that the actual delivery of those programs as to qualified teachers, supporting resources, and program monitoring, does not violate the EEOA on grounds of ineffective implementation.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>c. Success of the Program</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The third prong of the <i>Castaneda</i> test involves consideration of the program’s results. Neither the EEOA nor the <i>Castaneda</i> court explains how it is that a federal court is to judge the results of a school district’s language remediation program. <i>Castaneda</i> simply indicated that the program should “produce results indicating that the language barriers confronting students are actually being overcome.”</p>
<p class="indent">Measuring the success or failure of educational programs is one of the great challenges that faces our educators. It is surely beyond the competence of this Court to fashion its own measure of academic achievement, and the Court will necessarily defer to the measuring devices already used by the school system.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, [standardized test scores], as well as the classroom grades of the BUSD’s LEP students, point to the effectiveness of the program in teaching English to LEP students and in contributing to their academic achievement. These scores show that the BUSD’s LEP students are learning at rates equal to or higher than their counterparts in California. LEP students in the BUSD have a record of achievement which is the same or better than the record of LEP students in schools identified by plaintiffs’ experts as having effective language remediation programs. Extremely strong attendance patterns provide further proof that LEP students are fully participating in the BUSD’s educational program.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing the difficulties inherent in measurement it is nevertheless true that the best evidence of a sound and effectively implemented program lies in the results that it achieves. The overwhelming weight of evidence in this case establishes that the special language programs of the BUSD assure equal educational opportunity for LEP students and are effective in removing the language barriers faced by the LEP students.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, this Court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to establish a violation of section 1703(f) of the EEOA.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What steps does Berkeley take to identify, evaluate, provide services to, and promote students with language needs? Is Berkeley a model district in comparison to the one at issue in <i>Castaneda</i> or just more sophisticated in adopting rules and regulations?</p>
<p><a id="page_309" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>309</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. What does “reasonably calculated” to effectively implement the educational theory mean? Is this court’s application more permissive than <i>Castaneda</i>? Does this court implicitly adopt practicality concerns as a defense for school districts?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court refuses to fault the school district for using uncredentialed teachers to instruct LEP students because those students’ achievement was on par with those in classrooms with credentialed teachers. Does this mean districts are free to implement language programs as they see fit so long as they produce results? Does this collapse the <i>Castaneda</i> standard into a single inquiry? Did not <i>Castaneda</i> strike down the program based on uncredentialed teachers? What do the facts of this case suggest about the availability of ELL teachers?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The court indicates that plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of showing the program was ineffective in its implementation or results. Given that districts have an affirmative duty to assist students in overcoming language barriers, should the burden of proof rest with plaintiffs or school districts?</p>
<p class="indent">5. What role, if any, should cost play in assessing program effectiveness? Does the fact that the district was nearly bankrupt resolve the question of its good faith efforts to implement the program? Would you want to know more about the district’s finances and how it was using them?</p>
<p class="indent">6. If LEP students are achieving so well in Berkeley, why are they suing the district? Does the court potentially overstate the effectiveness of the program here, or is something other than student achievement driving the litigation?</p>
<p class="indent">7. Is it possible that most of California’s schools were failing to provide appropriate educational services for LEP students? If so, is it fair to conclude the Berkeley’s comparable, and sometimes higher, achievement is indicative of an effective program? Berkeley is, as a general matter, one of the highest-achieving districts in the state. <i>Teresa P.</i>, 724 F. Supp. at 716. Should a court require that its LEP students also be among the highest achieving? In recent policy guidance, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education wrote:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">To assess whether an EL program is succeeding in overcoming language barriers within a reasonable period of time, school districts must consider accurate data that permit a comprehensive and reliable comparison of how EL students in the EL program, EL students who exited the program, and never-EL students are performing on criteria relevant to participation in the district’s educational programs over time.</p>
<p class="indent">Meaningful EL program evaluations include longitudinal data that compare performance in the core content areas (e.g., valid and reliable standardized tests in those areas), graduation, dropout, and retention data for EL students as they progress through the program, former EL students, and never-EL students. When evaluating the effectiveness of an EL program, the performance of EL students in the program and former EL students who exited the program should be compared to that of never-EL students. While the data need not demonstrate that current EL students perform at a level equal to their never-EL peers, a school district’s data should show that EL students are meeting exit criteria and are being exited from the program within a reasonable period of time, and that former EL students are participating meaningfully in classes without EL services and are performing comparably to their never-EL peers in the standard instructional program. To assess whether the EL program sufficiently prepared EL students for more demanding academic requirements in higher grades, the Departments expect districts to evaluate these data not only at the point that students exit EL services, but also over time.</p>

<p class="indent">8. The decision in <i>Teresa P</i>. does not appear to be an outlier in its willingness to excuse implementation failures. More recently, a district court went out of its way to excuse a Chicago district’s failures. It wrote that “no program of this size can be expected to be free of criticism or deficiencies” and “although plaintiffs have identified a number of problems and concerns about the ELL program as it existed prior to the close of discovery in 2009, the court finds that by that time the District had established and recognized programs in place to educate its non-English speaking students in its educational programs.” <i>McFadden v. Bd. of Educ. for Illinois Sch. Dist. U-46</i>, 984 F. Supp. 2d 882, 895-896 (N.D. Ill. 2013). As to deficiencies in teaching, the court simply indicated that “there is a national shortage of qualified ELL teachers.” <i>Id</i>. at 896. Unlike Berkeley, however, the court in <i>McFadden</i> did not reference any compelling evidence that the district’s program was producing positive outcomes notwithstanding its teacher implementation problems. The court in <i>McFadden</i>, relying on <i>Teresa P</i>., implied that a national teacher shortage alone was sufficient to excuse the district. The court was, likewise, dismissive of plaintiffs’ concerns that the district was failing to comply with an Illinois state regulation that required ELL classrooms to have fewer students than other classrooms. The problem here, of course, is that the state had chosen a method of implementing its Equal Educational Opportunities Act obligation and the district was failing to carry it out. <i>Id</i>. at 896.</p>
<p class="indent">9. On a slightly different theory, a state trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs in California, finding that the state had failed to ensure equal educational opportunity for ELL students. The court’s finding, however, was largely premised on the state’s failure to respond to and address allegations that local districts were not properly implementing their language programs. Thus, the victory was more procedural than substantive for plaintiffs. That holding, nonetheless, led to a statewide settlement. Derek Black, <i>California Settles English Language Learner Case, Promising to Implement Better Standards and Oversight</i>, <span class="smallcap">Education Law Prof Blog</span>, Sept. 30, 2015, <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/09/california-settles-english-language-learner-case-promising-to-implement-better-standards-and-oversig.html" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/education_law/2015/09/california-settles-english-language-learner-case-promising-to-implement-better-standards-and-oversig.html</a>.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch116">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The state board of education in your state is responsible for the educational policies and guidelines of its schools. Currently, the board’s regulations mandate that local school districts identify the number of ELL students within a given school district and classify these children according to the language in which they possess primary speaking ability. The regulations also mandate that districts administer an annual examination for determining the level of ELL students’ oral comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing of English. The board, however, does not mandate the specific methods or tests by which districts</p>
<p><a id="page_311" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>311</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">identify ELL students or the specific annual examination they must administer. The regulations further mandate that when the identification process at a particular school building identifies 20 or more ELL students who speak the same primary language, the local district is required to provide a transitional bilingual education program. But when the process discloses less than 20 such students, the board does not conduct any review or supervision of the existence or adequacy of whatever services a district might provide to ELL students.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on these regulations, local districts act with unlimited discretion in selecting methods for identifying ELL students. Some, by using their own methods, may be under-identifying the number of ELL students in their district, which would bring the number speaking the same language below 20 and avoid the regulatory requirement to provide transitional bilingual education. Across the state, local districts have been found to use as many as 23 different language proficiency tests, 11 standardized English tests, 7 standardized reading tests, and many formal and informal teacher-developed tests. Based on the changing status of students who transfer school districts, these tests have been shown to lead to inconsistent results across districts. The state board has taken no action to limit districts’ discretion.</p>
<p class="indent">A mother, who asserts that her son’s primary language is Spanish and that he is struggling academically, indicates his school has not identified her son as an ELL student and that it has identified only a total of 18 ELL students in his school building. Does she have a claim against the state and/or the district?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch117">3. <i>Choice of Language Programs and Bilingual Education</i></p>
<p class="noindent">As <i>Teresa P.</i> demonstrates, districts are free to choose the specific language program that they wish to implement. In Berkeley, the district adopted bilingual education and an ESL program taught exclusively in English, so as to accommodate differing parental preferences. Most districts, however, do not have that luxury, which led to heated debates over bilingual programs at every level of government and education.</p>
<p class="indent">Bilingual programs expanded throughout the 1970s following the passage of the Bilingual Education Act in 1968. Kristi L. Bowman, <i>Pursuing Educational Opportunities for Latino/a Students</i>, 88 N.C. L. <span class="smallcap">Rev</span>. 911, 926 (2010). The expansion was also accompanied by an increased focus on effectiveness. When Congress considered amendments to the Bilingual Education Act in 1977, one of the most influential studies was that of the American Institute for Research. The study concluded:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">1) On English tests, students in bilingual education programs obtained slightly lower scores than comparable students in regular programs; 2) on mathematics tests, students in bilingual education programs performed somewhat better than comparable students in regular programs; 3) there was no significant difference in the attitudes toward school of children in bilingual education programs and regular programs; and 4) the ability of students in bilingual education programs to read Spanish did improve significantly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Rachel F. Moran, <i>The Politics of Discretion</i>, 76 <span class="smallcap">Cal. L. Rev</span>. 1249, 1284 (1988). Many researchers highly criticized the study’s findings, but Congress</p>
<p><a id="page_312" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>312</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">nonetheless afforded the study significant weight. In addition, other evidence suggested that local educators and researchers might use the funds to pursue long-term goals of bilingualism and biculturalism, which Congress believed was contrary to its legislative intent. <i>Id.</i> at 1289. Thus, the 1978 amendments to the Act granted the commissioner of education the authority to terminate a district’s program funding. Other changes represented skepticism toward bilingual education’s effectiveness and implementation rather than efforts to strengthen it.</p>
<p class="indent">Support for bilingual education waned even further in the following decade. A 1981 report by the Office of Planning, Budget, and Evaluation challenged the empirical basis for the primary reliance on transitional bilingual education (TBE) programs. <span class="smallcap">B. Birman &amp; A. Ginsburg, Addressing the Needs of Language-Minority Children: Issues for Federal Policy (1981).</span> It concluded that the educational problems experienced by language minority students were due to a combination of poverty and language; so bilingual education programs provided only a partial solution. <i>Id.</i> at xv-xvi. In 1982, Congress considered decreasing funding for bilingual education programs. Concerns were raised that bilingual programs were divisive in nature and part of a separatist movement that threatened American national identity. Some leaders attributed these concerns to anti-immigrant sentiment rather than reality. Regardless, the controversy surrounding bilingual education only grew, and federal funding for it fell. Congress’s new approach was to cap the length of time a student could spend in bilingual education, afford local authorities more flexibility in whether they offered bilingual education at all, and encourage and fund structured English immersion instead. This redirection in funding and eligibility made changes to the Bilingual Education Act largely unnecessary during the 1990s. When the No Child Left Behind Act was passed in 2001, the Act did not even reference bilingual education.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1990s, some states went further than the federal government in undermining bilingual education; they took steps to end or abolish it. In 1998, after 30 years of offering bilingual education, 61 percent of Californians voted in favor of ending it. William Ryan, Note, <i>The Unz Initiatives and the Abolition of Bilingual Education</i>, 43 B.C. L. <span class="smallcap">Rev</span>. 487, 499 (2002). To add insult to injury, the initiative stated, “English is the language of economic opportunity, immigrant parents want their children to participate in the ‘American dream,’ and ‘public schools in California do a poor job of educating immigrant children.’” <i>Id.</i> (quoting Cal. Educ. Code §300 (1998)). In 2001, a similar, although slightly more aggressive and restrictive, measure passed in Arizona. Ryan, <i>supra</i>, at 505. The success of legislation in those states, along with immigration growth, fueled additional English-only education measures in Massachusetts and Colorado. The initiative passed in Massachusetts, but failed in Colorado. Lisa B. Ross, Note, <i>Learning the Language: An Examination of Voter Initiatives to Make Language Education Policy</i>, 82 N.Y.U. L. <span class="smallcap">Rev</span>. 1510, 1511 (2007).</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Valeria v. Davis</i>, 307 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 2002), plaintiffs challenged California’s elimination of bilingual education as a denial of equal protection. Plaintiffs argued that the ban was motivated by ethnic discrimination and placed a special burden on minorities in their attempt to secure protection from unequal treatment in schools. The court, however, rejected this argument,</p>
<p><a id="page_313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>313</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">finding there was no hidden discriminatory motivation for the initiative. Rather, the motivation was only to improve education. The court recognized that those supporting bilingual education were now placed at a unique political disadvantage, but again, the disadvantage was based on educational policy not race.</p>
<p class="indent">Does the fact that the efficacy of bilingual versus nonbilingual programs was in dispute have any bearing on the alleged discriminatory motive? The court suggested that, since there is no constitutional right to bilingual education, the plaintiffs were asking for special treatment. If bilingual education was necessary for an equal educational opportunity for some students, would adopting a policy prohibiting access to it amount to discrimination rather than a denial of special treatment? The court also indicated the state has a legitimate interest in promoting English instruction. Does the state have legitimate motive for banning bilingual instruction rather than leaving the issue to local educators?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch118">4. <i>Funding Language Programs</i></p>
<p class="noindent">In 2009 in <i>Horne v. Flores</i>, the Court took up the relevance of funding in complying with the EEOA’s mandates. The Court cited heavily to <i>Castaneda</i> and did not question the validity of the <i>Castaneda</i> approach. <i>Horne</i>, however, arose under a relatively complex procedural posture. The precise issue before the Court was not whether funding is a relevant consideration under EEOA or whether funding has a causal effect on academic outcomes for ELL students, but whether the lower courts appropriately evaluated the state’s motion for reconsideration of a prior order mandating additional funding of ELL programs. Thus, the Court’s opinion broadly addresses the standard for evaluating motions for reconsideration based on changed circumstances in long-running education reform litigation. But in applying the standard to the facts in <i>Horne</i>, the Court also reconsidered the lower courts’ findings in regard to the role of funding in meeting an educational agency’s responsibilities under the EEOA.</p>

<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL program in Nogales filed suit on behalf of “all minority ‘at risk’ and limited English proficient children…now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified School District…as well as their parents and guardians.” The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment holding that the State of Arizona, its Board of Education, and its Superintendent</p>
<p><a id="page_314" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>314</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of Public Instruction (defendants) were violating the EEOA [Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974] by providing inadequate ELL instruction in Nogales.</p>
<p class="indent">The relevant portion of the EEOA states: “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by…(f) the failure by an educational agency to take <i>appropriate action</i> to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.”</p>
<p class="indent">By simply requiring a State “to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers” without specifying particular actions that a State must take, “Congress intended to leave state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing the programs and techniques they would use to meet their obligations under the EEOA.” <i>Castaneda v. Pickard</i>, 648 F.2d 989, 1009 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="indent">In January 2000, the District Court concluded that defendants were violating the EEOA because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. Defendants did not appeal the District Court’s order.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In October 2000, the court ordered the State to “prepare a cost study to establish the proper appropriation to effectively implement” ELL programs. [Over the next five years, the court issued several orders and injunctions in regard to Nogales and statewide ELL programs. The state repeatedly failed to meet court-imposed deadlines. Eventually, in 2005, the court imposed daily escalating fines on the state legislature until it implemented a funding scheme that “bear[s] a rational relationship to the actual funding needed.”]</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[The state did not appeal these orders and instead passed “HB 2064, which was designed to implement a permanent funding solution to the problems identified by the District Court in 2000. Among other things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding with a 2-year per-student funding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all elements of ELL instruction.” The state then filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) motion for relief based on changed circumstances. The district court ignored this motion initially, ruling against the state on other grounds. But after an appeal, the Ninth Circuit remanded with specific instructions to consider the motion. The district court then denied the 60(b)(5) motion, found the state’s action insufficient to comply with its prior orders, and gave the state until the end of the legislative session to comply. The state failed to do so, and the district court again held the state in contempt.] Petitioners appealed.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals affirmed. It acknowledged that Nogales had “made significant strides since 2000,” but concluded that the progress did not warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief. [T]he Court of Appeals explained that relief would be</p>
<p><a id="page_315" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>315</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">appropriate only if petitioners had shown “either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona” or that Arizona had altered its funding model. The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioners had made neither showing, and it rejected petitioners’ other arguments.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) permits a party to obtain relief from a judgment or order if, among other things, “applying [the judgment or order] prospectively is no longer equitable.” Rule 60(b)(5) may not be used to challenge the legal conclusions on which a prior judgment or order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a party can ask a court to modify or vacate a judgment or order if “a significant change either in factual conditions or in law” renders continued enforcement “detrimental to the public interest.” The party seeking relief bears the burden of establishing that changed circumstances warrant relief, but once a party carries this burden, a court abuses its discretion “when it refuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes.”</p>
<p class="indent">Rule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in what we have termed “institutional reform litigation.” For one thing, injunctions issued in such cases often remain in force for many years, and the passage of time frequently brings about changed circumstances—changes in the nature of the underlying problem, changes in governing law or its interpretation by the courts, and new policy insights—that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals did not engage in the [appropriate] Rule 60(b)(5) analysis. Rather than applying a flexible standard that seeks to return control to state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to federalism concerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether changed conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an ELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals concerned itself only with determining whether increased ELL funding complied with the original declaratory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion by citing the correct legal standard, but it quickly strayed. It referred to the situations in which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief as “likely rare,” and explained that, to succeed on these grounds, petitioners would have to make a showing that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to “sweep away” the District Court’s incremental funding determination. The Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had not erred in determining that “the landscape was not so <i>radically</i> changed as to justify relief from judgment without compliance.”</p>
<p><a id="page_316" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>316</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In addition to applying a Rule 60(b)(5) standard that was too strict, the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry that was too narrow—one that focused almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding. In large part, this was driven by the significance the Court of Appeals attributed to petitioners’ failure to appeal the District Court’s original order. The Court of Appeals explained that “the central idea” of that order was that without sufficient ELL incremental funds, “ELL programs would necessarily be inadequate.” It felt bound by this conclusion, lest it allow petitioners to “reopen matters made final when the Declaratory Judgment was not appealed.” It repeated this refrain throughout its opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">In attributing such significance to the defendants’ failure to appeal the District Court’s original order, the Court of Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litigation into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to that of the original order, it insulated the policies embedded in the order—specifically, its incremental funding requirement—from challenge and amendment. But those policies were supported by the very officials who could have appealed them—the state defendants—and, as a result, were never subject to true challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of Appeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry prescribed in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (2009). This inquiry makes no reference to the presence or absence of a timely appeal. It takes the original judgment as a given and asks only whether “a significant change either in factual conditions or in law” renders continued enforcement of the judgment “detrimental to the public interest.” It allows a court to recognize that the longer an injunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the risk that it will improperly interfere with a State’s democratic processes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a “changed circumstances” inquiry, but it asked only whether changed circumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifically, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate, in the court’s view, only if petitioners “demonstrate[d] either that there [we]re no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona’s ‘base plus incremental costs’ educational funding model was so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental costs funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.”</p>
<p class="indent">This was a Rule 60(b)(5) “changed circumstances” inquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into whether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that the District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied. And this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the original order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier judgment is <i>one</i> of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5) relief—but it is not the only basis for such relief.</p>
<p class="indent">Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where “[i] the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; [ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; <i>or</i> [iii] applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.” Use of the disjunctive “or” makes it clear that each of the provision’s three grounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore that relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not “satisfied” the original order. As</p>
<p><a id="page_317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>317</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">petitioners argue, they may obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order “is no longer equitable.”</p>
<p class="indent">To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of Appeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law (here, the EEOA). It failed to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State to take “appropriate action to overcome language barriers,” 20 U.S.C. §1703(f), “leave[s] state and local educational authorities a substantial amount of latitude in choosing” how this obligation is met. <i>Castaneda</i>, 648 F.2d at 1009. Of course, any educational program, including the “appropriate action” mandated by the EEOA, requires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the end. By focusing so intensively on Arizona’s incremental ELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the EEOA’s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate “appropriate action” through a particular funding mechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted its own educational and budgetary policy judgments for those of the state and local officials to whom such decisions are properly entrusted.</p>
<p class="indent">The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar errors. Instead of determining whether changed circumstances warranted modification of the original order, the District Court asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the original declaratory judgment order through increased incremental funding.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower courts with four principal conclusions that it draws from the record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect and mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts—a fixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure to recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the dissent concludes that “the Rule 60(b)(5) ‘changes’ upon which the District Court focused” were not limited to changes in funding, and included “‘changed teaching methods’” and “‘changed administrative systems.’” The District Court did note a range of changed circumstances, concluding that as a result of these changes, Nogales was “doing substantially better.” But it neither focused on these changes nor made up-to-date factual findings. To the contrary, the District Court explained that “it would be premature to make an assessment of some of these changes.” Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that the court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed funding directly and exclusively. The last eight addressed funding indirectly. None of the District Court’s findings of fact addressed either “‘changed teaching methods’” or “‘changed administrative systems.’”</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent’s second conclusion is that “‘incremental funding’ costs…[were] the basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court’s finding of a statutory violation.” We fail to see this conclusion’s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion, where the question is whether any change in factual or legal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the original order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowledges, petitioners “pointed to three sets of changed circumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion]</p>
<p><a id="page_318" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>318</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">which, in their view, showed that the judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary.” In addition to “increases in the amount of funding available to Arizona school districts,” these included “changes in the method of English-learning instruction,” and “changes in the administration of the Nogales school district.”</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the dissent concludes that “the type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused”—the incremental funding issue—“lies at the heart of the statutory demand for equal educational opportunity.” In what we interpret to be a restatement of this point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient funding and the presence or absence of an EEOA violation “<i>are one and the same</i>.” “In focusing upon the one,” the dissent asserts, “the District Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.”</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, these two issues are decidedly not “<i>one and the same</i>.” Nor is it the case, as the dissent suggests, that the EEOA targets States’ provision of resources for ELL programming. What the statute forbids is a failure to take “appropriate action to overcome language barriers.” Funding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did not order increased ELL incremental funding and did not dictate state and local budget priorities. The dissent’s point is that the District Court did not set a specific amount that the legislature was required to appropriate. The District Court did, however, hold the State in contempt and impose heavy fines because the legislature did not provide sufficient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed important restrictions on the legislature’s ability to set budget priorities.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>E</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Because the lower courts—like the dissent—misperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the inquiry called for under Rule 60(b)(5), these cases must be remanded for a proper examination of at least four important factual and legal changes: the State’s adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology, Congress’ enactment of NCLB, structural and management reforms in Nogales, and increased overall education funding.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>1</i></p>
<p class="indent">At the time of the District Court’s original declaratory judgment order, ELL instruction in Nogales was based primarily on “bilingual education.” In November 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203, which mandated statewide implementation of a “structured English immersion” (SEI) approach [defined as] an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.</p>
<p class="indent">In HB 2064, the state legislature attended to the successful and uniform implementation of SEI in a variety of ways[, including creating a task force] to “develop and adopt research based models of structured English immersion programs”[, requiring school districts to] select one of the adopted SEI models,</p>
<p><a id="page_319" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>319</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">[creating an office to train and] aid school districts [and teachers] in implementation of the models.</p>
<p class="indent">Research indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than bilingual education. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion. In light of this, a proper analysis of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should include further factual findings regarding whether Nogales’ implementation of SEI methodology constitutes a “significantly changed circumstance” that warrants relief.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>2</i></p>
<p class="indent">Congress’ enactment of NCLB represents another potentially significant “changed circumstance.” NCLB marked a dramatic shift in federal education policy. It reflects Congress’ judgment that the best way to raise the level of education nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and implement educational programs, while holding them accountable for the results. NCLB implements this approach by requiring States receiving federal funds to define performance standards and to make regular assessments of progress toward the attainment of those standards. NCLB conditions the continued receipt of funds on demonstrations of “adequate yearly progress.”</p>
<p class="indent">Title III [of NCLB] requires States to ensure that ELL students “attain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet.” It requires States to set annual objective achievement goals for the number of students who will annually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency, and make “adequate yearly progress” with respect to academic achievement, and it holds schools accountable for meeting these objectives.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB, the State has established compliance with the EEOA. They note that when a State adopts a compliance plan under NCLB—as the State of Arizona has—it must provide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive assistance “to achieve at high levels in the core academic subjects so that those children can meet the same…standards as all children are expected to meet.” They argue that when the Federal Department of Education approves a State’s plan—as it has with respect to Arizona’s—it offers definitive evidence that the State has taken “appropriate action to overcome language barriers” within the meaning of the EEOA.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that because of significant differences in the two statutory schemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily constitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA. Approval of a NCLB plan does not entail substantive review of a State’s ELL programming or a determination that the programming results in equal educational opportunity for ELL students.</p>
<p class="indent">This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant to petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion. To the contrary, we think it is probative in four principal ways. First, it prompted the State to institute significant structural and programming changes in its delivery of ELL education, leading the Court of Appeals to observe that “Arizona has significantly improved its ELL infrastructure.” These changes</p>
<p><a id="page_320" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>320</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">should not be discounted in the Rule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or result from increased funding. Second, NCLB significantly increased federal funding for ELL programming. These funds should not be disregarded just because they are not state funds. Third, through its assessment and reporting requirements, NCLB provides evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales’ ELL students. This evidence could provide persuasive evidence of the current effectiveness of Nogales’ ELL programming.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, NCLB marks a shift in federal education policy. NCLB grants States “flexibility” to adopt ELL programs they believe are “most effective for teaching English.” Reflecting a growing consensus in education research that increased funding alone does not improve student achievement,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note10" id="Rnote10" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> NCLB expressly refrains from dictating funding levels. Instead, it focuses on the demonstrated progress of students through accountability reforms.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note11" id="Rnote11" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></sup> The original declaratory judgment order, in contrast, withdraws the authority of state and local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that best suit Nogales’ needs, and measures effective programming solely in terms of adequate incremental funding. This conflict with Congress’ determination of federal policy may constitute a significantly changed circumstance, warranting relief.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>3</i></p>
<p class="indent">Structural and management reforms in Nogales constitute another relevant change in circumstances. These reforms were led by Kelt Cooper, the Nogales superintendent from 2000 to 2005, who “adopted policies that ameliorated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies discussed by the district court.” Among other things, Cooper “reduce[d] class sizes,” “significantly improv[ed] student/teacher ratios,” “improved teacher quality,” “pioneered a uniform system of textbook and curriculum planning,” and “largely eliminated what had been a severe shortage of instructional materials.” [B]y “[u]sing careful financial management and applying for ‘all funds available,’ Cooper was able to achieve his reforms with limited resources.” But the Court of Appeals missed the legal import of this observation—that these reforms might have brought Nogales’ ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even without sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the District Court’s original order.</p>
<p class="indent">This was error. The EEOA seeks to provide “equal educational opportunity” to “all children enrolled in public schools.” Its ultimate focus is on the quality of</p>
<p><a id="page_321" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>321</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">educational programming and services provided to students, not the amount of money spent on them. Accordingly, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming by means other than increased funding—for example, through Cooper’s structural, curricular, and accountability-based reforms. The weight of research suggests that these types of local reforms, much more than court-imposed funding mandates, lead to improved educational opportunities.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper’s reforms for other reasons as well. It explained that while they “did ameliorate many of the specific examples of resource shortages that the district court identified in 2000,” they did not “result in such success as to call into serious question [Nogales’] need for increased incremental funds.” Among other things, the Court of Appeals referred to “the persistent achievement gaps documented in [Nogales’] AIMS test data” between ELL students and native speakers, but any such comparison must take into account other variables that may explain the gap. In any event, the EEOA requires “appropriate action” to remove language barriers, not the equalization of results between native and nonnative speakers on tests administered in English.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar performance of Nogales’ high schools. There is no doubt that Nogales’ high schools represent an area of weakness, but the District Court made insufficient factual findings to support a conclusion that the high schools’ problems stem from a failure to take “appropriate action,” and constitute a violation of the EEOA.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note12" id="Rnote12" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement grants States broad latitude to design, fund, and implement ELL programs. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL students.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>4</i></p>
<p class="indent">A fourth potentially important change is an overall increase in the education funding available in Nogales. The original declaratory judgment order noted five sources of funding that collectively financed education in the State: (1) the State’s “base level” funding, (2) ELL incremental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and county taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and county taxes called “overrides.” All five sources have notably increased since 2000.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note13" id="Rnote13" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></sup> Notwithstanding these increases, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners’ claim that overall education funds were sufficient to support</p>
<p><a id="page_322" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>322</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">EEOA-compliant programming in Nogales. The court reasoned that diverting base-level education funds would necessarily hurt other state educational programs, and was not, therefore, an “‘appropriate’ step.” In so doing, it foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could establish changed circumstances warranting relief through an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales.</p>
<p class="indent">This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement does not necessarily require any particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does not require that the money come from any particular source. It is unfortunate if a school, in order to fund ELL programs, must divert money from other worthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the scope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the State’s budget for general education funding, in addition to any local revenues, is currently supporting EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to make up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower courts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all of the changed circumstances just noted. These changes are critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as they may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of the EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking “appropriate action” to remove language barriers in its schools. If this is the case, continued enforcement of the District Court’s original order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">[The Court reversed the district court’s entry of statewide relief as well, reasoning that the “record contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than Nogales failed (much less continues to fail) to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students.” The district court’s entry of statewide relief was premised on the notion that an individualized remedy would be contrary to “the Arizona Constitution’s requirement of ‘a general and uniform public school system.’” Whether that premise is correct, however, is a[n] unsettled “question of state law, to be determined by state authorities.”]</p>

<p class="indent">The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion—that the lower courts did not “<i>fairly consider</i>” the changed circumstances—in a complicated way. It begins by placing this case in a category it calls “institutional reform litigation.” It then sets forth special “institutional reform litigation” standards applicable when courts are asked to modify judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It applies those standards, and finds that the lower courts committed error.</p>
<p class="indent">I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one thing, the “institutional reform” label does not easily fit this case.

<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[T]he Court writes that the lower courts focused so heavily on the original decree’s “incremental funding” requirement that they failed to ask whether “the State was fulfilling its obligation under” federal law “by other means.” The problem with this basic criticism is that the State’s provision of adequate resources to its English-learning students, <i>i.e.</i>, what the Court refers to as “incremental funding,” has always been the basic contested issue in this case. That is why the lower courts continuously focused attention directly upon it.</p>
<p class="indent">[When the suit was initially filed, the students sought an injunctive relief based on the claim] that the State had “systematically…failed or refused to provide fiscal as well as other resources sufficient to enable” the Nogales School District and other “similarly situated [school] districts” to “establish and maintain” successful programs for English learners. [T]he parties proceeded to trial on [a single] disputed issue in the case, namely whether the State and its education authorities “<i>adequately fund and oversee</i>” their English-learning program. [A]fter a three-day bench trial, the District Court made 64 specific factual findings, including the following: (1) The State assumes that its school districts need funding equal to a designated “base level amount” per child—reflecting the funding required to educate a “typical” student—along with an additional amount needed to educate each child with special educational needs, including those children who are not yet proficient in English. (2) In the year 2000, the “base level amount” the State assumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to roughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars). (3) A cost study showed that the extra cost per student of the State’s English-learning program was $617 per English-learning child. (4) In the year 2000, the State’s funding formula provided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in extra costs per child that the State assumed were needed to pay for its English-learning program.</p>
<p class="indent">The record contains no suggestion that Nogales, or any other school district, could readily turn anywhere but to the State to find the $467 per-student difference between the amount the State assumed was needed and the amount that it made available. Nor does the record contain any suggestion that Nogales or any other school district could have covered additional costs by redistributing “base level,” typical-child funding it received.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on these, and related findings, the District Court concluded that the State’s method of paying for the additional costs associated with English-learning education was “arbitrary and capricious and [bore] no relation to the actual funding needed.” The court added that the State’s provision of financial resources was “not reasonably calculated to effectively implement” the</p>
<p><a id="page_324" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>324</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">English-learning program chosen by the State. Hence, the State had failed to take “appropriate action” to provide the “practices, resources, and personnel” necessary to make its chosen educational theory a “reality.”</p>
<p class="indent">The District Court consequently entered judgment in the students’ favor. The State neither appealed nor complied with the 2000 declaratory judgment or any of the injunctive orders. When the State failed to produce either a study of the type ordered or a funding program rationally related to need for financial resources, the court imposed a series of fines to lead the State to comply with its orders.</p>
<p class="indent">[After passing HB 2064 in 2006, the petitioners asked the district court to consider whether the bill “would satisfy its judgment and injunctive orders” and to dissolve the injunctive relief orders pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances. The district court “found that all of the changes, resource-related and otherwise, including the new teaching and administrative methods, taken together, were not sufficient to warrant setting aside the judgment or the injunctive orders; and it denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion for relief.” The Court of Appeals affirmed.]</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[T]he District Court and the Court of Appeals focused more heavily upon “incremental funding” costs for the <i>reason</i> that the State’s provision for those costs—<i>i.e.</i>, its provision of the resources necessary to run an adequate English-learning program—was the basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court’s finding of a statutory violation. That is, the sole subsection (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the State provides the “practices, resources, and personnel necessary” to implement its English-learning program. To be sure, as the Court points out, changes other than to the State’s funding system could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the necessary resources. But given the centrality of “resources” to the case, it is hardly surprising that the courts below scrutinized the State’s provision of “incremental funding,” <i>but without ignoring</i> the other related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as changes in teaching methods and administration (all of which the District Court rejected as insufficient).</p>
<p class="indent">[Second], the type of issue upon which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statutory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State’s failure to provide the “practices, resources, and personnel necessary” to eliminate the educational burden that accompanies a child’s inability to speak English is precisely what the statute forbids. And no one in this case suggests there is no need for those resources, <i>e.g.</i>, that there are no extra costs associated with English-learning education irrespective of the teaching method used. [L]anguage-acquisition instruction requires particular textbooks and other instructional materials, teachers trained in the school’s chosen method for teaching English, special assessment tests, and tutoring and other individualized instruction—all of which cost money. That is why the petitioners admitted to the District Court that English learners “need extra help and that costs extra money.”</p>
<p><a id="page_325" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>325</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">[Third], <i>the “resource” issue</i> that the District Court focused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion, and <i>the statutory subsection (f) issue</i> that lies at the heart of the court’s original judgment (and the plaintiffs’ original complaint) are not <i>different</i> issues, as the Court claims. Rather in all essential respects <i>they are one and the same issue.</i> For all practical purposes, changes that would have proved sufficient to show the statutory violation cured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting aside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="indent">To say, as the Court does, that “[f]unding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective,” while true, is beside the point. Of course, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But one way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to provide necessary “practices, resources, and personnel.” And that is the way the District Court found that the State had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be true of some other case, in this case the failure to provide adequate resources and the underlying subsection (f) violation were one and the same.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What are the changed circumstances that warranted a reconsideration of the district court’s prior orders for the state to enact funding mechanisms that were rationally related to the actual funding needs of ELL programs? Changes necessarily occur over time and, thus, change in and of itself is not significant. Are any of the changes in the district sufficiently unusual or significant to warrant reconsideration of the court’s order? Are any of them insignificant?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Do these changed circumstances actually relate to the question of whether the state is adequately funding or implementing its ELL program? If so, would they warrant the dissolution of the initial decree or just a finding that the state is closer to being in compliance? In 2000, the district court found there was a $467 per-pupil shortfall for ELL students. Yet, as the majority points out, federal funding alone had increased by approximately that much between 2000 and 2006. Of course, this and other funding increases are necessary to some extent just to cover inflation and increased costs.</p>
<p class="indent">3. To the extent that changed circumstances are a result of a defendant’s attempt to comply with an earlier court order, should the defendant be permitted to argue that the facts amounting to partial compliance are relevant changed circumstances? Would this make the initial order practically irrelevant? Is HB 2064 an attempt at compliance or a changed circumstance?</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Court’s discussion of the relevance of funding to student achievement suggests the social science is settled in the finding that there is no significant connection. The materials from <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/15_ELEFR_Chapter_03.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 3</a> on poverty, however, would indicate that the Court took a one-sided approach to the issue and ignored evidence to the contrary. <i>See also</i> Michael A. Rebell, <i>Poverty, “Meaningful” Educational Opportunity, and the Necessary Role of the Courts</i>, 85 N.C. L. <span class="smallcap">Rev.</span> 1467 (2006) (discussing judicial opinions and social science as to whether money matters).</p>
<p class="indent">5. The court in <i>Castaneda</i> held that a school district must take steps reasonably calculated to effectively implement its chosen program. A district has</p>
<p><a id="page_326" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>326</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">discretion in which program it adopts, but once it adopts a program, that program would presumably have some minimal level of fixed costs associated with effective implementation. Is there any rationale one could offer within the <i>Castaneda</i> analysis that would allow for inadequate funding of a chosen language program?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Did the lower courts concentrate on funding too much, or were they simply applying <i>Castaneda</i>? Who gets the better of the argument that funding and compliance are one in the same?</p>
<p class="indent">7. The Court does not explicitly adopt the <i>Castaneda</i> three-prong standard, but the Court’s approach generally reflects a focus on the same issues. Which of the <i>Castaneda</i> inquiries is this case most focused on: soundness of education theory, effective implementation of the theory, or the results of the implementation? Does the Court modify the <i>Castaneda</i> approach in any way?</p>
<p class="indent">8. Does the Court expect equality of results for ELL students in comparison to non-ELL students? In a footnote, the Court assigns significance to the age of ELL students when they enter an ELL program, to their potential involvement in gangs, and other demographic factors. Are these factors relevant to the issue in this case?</p>
<p class="indent">9. While the No Child Left Behind Act did not formally alter the affirmative obligations that the EEOA imposed on school districts to assist ELL students, the Court posits NCLB and its shift in federal policy were relevant to the adjudication of this EEOA case. At least one lower court picked up on this idea and relied on it as a basis for rejecting plaintiffs’ position in an EEOA case. United States v. Texas, 601 F.3d 354, 366 n.12 (5th Cir. 2010). The Every Student Succeeds Act, which replaced NCLB, however, eliminated the old metrics for assessing compliance with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Rather than federally defined adequate yearly progress goals on standardized tests, states have far more flexibility in setting goals and identifying the appropriate metrics for measuring success.</p>
<p class="indent">10. On remand from the Supreme Court decision in <i>Horne</i>, plaintiffs retooled some of their arguments and dropped others, but the district court held that plaintiffs failed to allege a statewide violation of the EEOA and that Nogales had “‘made a genuine and good faith effort, consistent with local circumstances and resources, to remedy the language deficiencies of [its] students[.]’” Flores v. Arizona, 2013 WL 10207656, at *14 (D. Ariz. Mar. 29, 2013) (quoting Castaneda v. Pickard). Thus, it dismissed jurisdiction in the case and brought an end to the most successful, long-running ELL litigation in history. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in <i>Flores v. Huppenthal</i>, 789 F.3d 994 (9th Cir. 2015).</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">While the Court’s opinion in <i>Horne</i> may place limits on the extent to which federal courts can compel school finance remedies, it has little, if any relevance, on state claims. In fact, the legal predicate in <i>Horne</i> was unusual in that the litigants had attempted state-wide school finance reform through the EEOA rather than the state constitution. Some state-based school finance claims</p>
<p><a id="page_327" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>327</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">have included subclaims on behalf of ELL students, whereas others have established principles that would be as applicable to inadequacies in ELL programs as they are to the general education program. With that said, funding for ELL programs tends to be more complex.</p>
<p class="indent">ELL programs are funded through three sources—local funds, state funds, and federal funds—but significant variations persist in regard to each. Because ELL students also tend to be low-income students, districts can draw on federal and state resources for low-income and at-risk students to fund their ELL programs. Some districts also receive additional funds through Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which allocates funds solely for ELL programs. Relatively few districts, however, are eligible for Title III funds because, to be eligible, a district must serve an unusually high number of ELL students. State funding earmarked for ELL programs is, likewise, inconsistently available. Only a portion of states make special provision for ELL students, whereas others expect districts to fund ELL programs solely out of their low-income or at-risk student funding. Either way, districts vary in their capacity to fund these programs. Bruce D. Baker &amp; Paul L. Markham, <i>State School Funding Policies and Limited English Proficient Students</i>, 26 <span class="smallcap">Bilingual Res</span>. J. 659 (2002).</p>
<p class="indent">Even in states that specifically provide supplemental state aid for ELL programs, the inconsistent funding for ELL programs generally still persists. States intend these supplemental funds to equalize local districts’ ability to provide comparable levels of service, but states most often distribute these supplemental funds on a flat basis, meaning that every district in the state receives the same amount of supplemental funding per pupil for ELL students. If that basic per-pupil grant is sufficient to cover the costs of ELL programs, equity concerns do not arise. Most often, however, the cost of educating ELL students is far higher than the per-pupil grant. Wealthy districts are in a position to make up the difference, whereas poorer districts are not.</p>
<p class="indent">In a national study of ELL funding practices, Bruce Baker and Paul Markham found that “districts serving higher percentages of LEP students tend to [be the same districts that] have less local capacity to provide services for those students.” <i>Id</i>. at 662. Summarizing their conclusions based on the data, they wrote</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">that state efforts to help local districts provide adequate programming opportunities for LEP children are often poorly conceived or applied, and are often inadequate. Furthermore, states presuming that Title [III] assistance and other small-scale federal interventions are able to pick up the slack are sadly misinformed. Low income school districts with a sizable LEP student population are unlikely to be able to meet the needs of the students in states that assume no responsibility for funding this student population. Moreover, states that maintain LEP funding policies that are neither rational nor equitable seem highly unlikely to give adequate help to local districts in need of services without recognizing the incongruity of their current LEP student funding policies.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">
<i>Id</i>. at 678. They attributed some of the variation to the “lack of analyses of present policies and dearth of available information on alternative policies.” <i>Id</i>. These funding failures are particularly problematic in those states in which the courts have held that education is a fundamental right or students have a</p>
<p><a id="page_328" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>328</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">right to an adequate education. In these states, variations in local capacity to meet ELL students’ educational needs are as problematic as variations in local capacity to meet general education needs. In fact, in many states, courts have emphasized the state’s obligation to special needs and at-risk students.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch120">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Assume you represent a group of ELL students who live in a poor rural county. The number of ELL students in the county has significantly increased in the last five years. The district has adopted an ELL program, but it has struggled to raise the funds necessary to fully implement it, including the hiring of certified ELL instructors. Your state went through school finance litigation throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. The state supreme court recognized a constitutional right to an adequate education and ordered the state to revise its funding formula to address the needs of at-risk students, which the state did. The revised formula, however, does not specifically account for ELL students, although districts do receive additional funds for ELL students who are also low-income.</p>
<p class="indent">What legal claim is most likely to succeed and resolve the challenges your clients face: an EEOA claim against the district, an EEOA claim against the state premised on the need for additional funding support, or a state constitutional claim against the state?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch121">5. <i>The Role of Federal Agencies</i></p>
<p class="noindent">While important, courts have not necessarily been the leaders in enforcing the right to equal educational opportunities for ELLs. As a general matter, a relatively small number of challenges to ELL programs have made it to litigation; many fewer produced judicial opinions. As a result, the case law in regard to ELLs is sparse. More often, ELL education has been contested through administrative and legislative processes. In some respects, the importance of administrative agencies makes sense, given that it was the Office for Civil Rights’ policy guidance that provided the foundation for <i>Lau</i> and the EEOA itself. Of course, OCR can only act pursuant to those statutory powers Congress grants it, and thus the EEOA limits OCR. But OCR, more so than courts or Congress, has been willing to explain and expand on the basic rights articulated by statutes or cases. Equally important, OCR retains the authority to enforce disparate impact standards through its administrative processes, whereas the courts have indicated private citizens have no power to enforce disparate impact in court. Thus, OCR also has the power to enforce slightly stronger substantive obligations than do courts.</p>
<p class="indent">While OCR has never made it a point to emphasize its relative power and importance in this area, its history and activities makes the point clear. Not only did OCR recognize ELL rights and issue guidance in regard to them well before Congress enacted the EEOA, OCR has since then regularly updated and supplemented its guidance, with the most notable policy statements coming in 1984,</p>
<p><a id="page_329" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>329</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">1985, and 1991. The documents articulate standards clearly consistent with <i>Castaneda</i>, but in the attempt to provide more specificity than can be found in court opinions, they also identify specific methods and steps that districts should and should not take to comply with the law. Implicit in the guidance is also a willingness to enforce these policies. For the OCR’s most recent significant policy guidance, see <span class="smallcap">U.S. Department of Education, Policy Update on Schools’ Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students with Limited-English Proficiency</span> (Sept. 27, 1991).</p>
<p class="indent">Acting in accordance with its policy guidance, OCR has forced major school districts to significantly alter their ELL programs. For instance, in 2010, OCR investigated Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD) program, focusing on whether ELL students were receiving adequate instruction. LAUSD is the nation’s second-largest school system and has the most ELL students in the country, but only 3 percent of its ELL students were proficient in math and English at the high school level. Howard Blume, <i>U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Targets L.A. Unified for Investigation</i>, L.A. <span class="smallcap">Times</span>, Mar. 9, 2010. As a result of the OCR investigation, LAUSD agreed to comprehensive revisions in the way it teaches its ELL students. Under the agreement, the district is required to “focus on the academic progress of students judged to have adequately learned English…, [and to] concentrate efforts on students who have reached high school without mastering the English skills necessary to enroll in a college-preparatory curriculum and who may be at risk of dropping out.” Howard Blume, <i>LAUSD Agrees to Revise How English Learners, Blacks Are Taught</i>, L.A. <span class="smallcap">Times</span>, Oct. 11, 2011. After similar enforcement actions in other districts, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, sought to further raise the profile of these issues and clarify districts’ legal obligations in 2015. Toward those ends, they released joint policy guidance, a toolkit, and resources, summarizing the relevant law, best practices, and research. U.S. Department of Education &amp; U.S. Department of Justice, Dear Colleague Letter: English Learner Students and Limited English Proficient Parents, Jan. 7, 2015, <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Congress, in similar fashion, has more recently sought to influence ELL policy indirectly through its overall agenda to improve student achievement through standardized testing. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 sought to ensure that schoolchildren have a “fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education” by requiring that all students reach proficiency in state educational standards as measured by standardized achievement tests. 20 U.S.C. §6301 (2006). In terms of ELL students, the Act took two significant steps. First, it required states to adopt or develop English language proficiency tests to determine which students should be classified as ELLs and to provide a reliable and consistent basis for tracking those students’ achievement. 20 U.S.C. §6311(7). Second, the Act’s primary stated goal was to close the achievement gap between various student subgroups, and it included ELL students as one of the subgroups whose achievement gap with other students should be closed. 20 U.S.C. §6301(3).</p>
<p class="indent">OCR has also noted the intersecting rights and issues that ELL students and students with disabilities might have. The rights of students with disabilities are</p>
<p><a id="page_330" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>330</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">addressed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/18_ELEFR_Chapter_06.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 6</a>, but it is important to emphasize here that language barriers, if not dealt with carefully, will only complicate the issue. Schools might perceive a student to have a disability, when, in fact, the student only has a language barrier. Likewise, an ELL student may also have a disability, but a district overlooks it because it is more immediately focused on the language barrier. For these reasons, ELL students suffer from both under- and over-identification of disability, depending on the district. Scholars find that an even deeper level of nuance emerges when one disaggregates ELL students by age and ethnicity:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Data on Latino/a students is complicated by the fact that they tend to be under-identified in elementary school but over-identified in high school. It may be that younger Latino/a students are being placed in bilingual or English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and are thus not referred for special education until later in their school careers. To fully document Latino/a overrepresentation, there is a need for data that is disaggregated by age or grade level, English proficiency, as well as data that includes information on whether districts offer bilingual or ESL classes. Similar analyses are needed to fully understand the impact that ESL programs might be having on the relatively low referral of Asian students for special education and to see if there are within-group differences among Asian students of different social classes, nationalities, and immigration statuses.</p>

Connor, <i>Special Education and the Subverting of</i> Brown, 8 J. <span class="smallcap">Gender Race</span> &amp; <span class="smallcap">Just</span>. 57, 62-63 (2004). In short, properly serving ELL students requires that school districts develop sophistication in both language programs and special education.</p>
<p class="indent">Martha Minow agrees with the need for more sophistication in serving students with language barriers, disabilities or both, but she emphasizes that</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">[t]he disproportionate representation of LEP students in special education is inextricably connected to issues of race. Like LEP students, more minorities continue to be served in special education than would be expected from their percentage of the general school population. Language difficulties may be only a part of a much larger chain of causation. Clearly, changing racial and ethnic demographics necessitate an examination of how LEP students and multicultural populations are being educated. Without reform and proper assessment of LEP students in regard to special education placement, the increasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity of students could potentially overwhelm special education programs.</p>

<p class="h3" id="ch122">D. ACCESS TO SCHOOL AND LEARNING</p>
<p class="noindent">The less prevalent yet most serious issue facing some ELL students is enrollment in school itself. The additional cost that comes with educating ELL students has, at times, prompted some localities to attempt to deny ELL students the opportunity to attend public school. Some states have also attempted to use school policy as a means of setting immigration policy, with the thought being that if</p>
<p><a id="page_331" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>331</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">children of undocumented immigrants were excluded from schools their parents might leave the community, and thereby alleviate the perceived burdens immigration poses on communities in general. The Supreme Court addressed this issue in <i>Plyler v. Doe</i> and held that it was unconstitutional for schools to exclude these students.</p>
<p class="indent">While the Court’s holding was clear in <i>Plyler</i>, its rationale did not stand on firm precedent and has been contested ever since. Over the past decade, states have enacted legislation directly inapposite to <i>Plyler</i>. Courts have rejected legislation that directly excludes undocumented children from school, but courts have been less consistent in their approach to indirect impingements on the opportunity to attend school. Consider a law that requires that schools ask newly enrolled students to show proof of citizenship or lawful residency status, and then report that information to the state department of education. Information collection and reporting does not directly deny these students access to schools, but it sends a chilling message to parents and can have the effect of excluding children. As you read <i>Plyler</i>, consider the extent to which it might prohibit the indirect effects on educational access.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch123">Plyler v. Doe</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>457 U.S. 202 (1982)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Since the late 19th century, the United States has restricted immigration into this country. Unsanctioned entry into the United States is a crime, and those who have entered unlawfully are subject to deportation. But despite the existence of these legal restrictions, a substantial number of persons have succeeded in unlawfully entering the United States, and now live within various States, including the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="indent">In May 1975, the Texas Legislature revised its education laws to withhold from local school districts any state funds for the education of children who were not “legally admitted” into the United States. The 1975 revision also authorized local school districts to deny enrollment in their public schools to children not “legally admitted” to the country. These cases involve constitutional challenges to those provisions.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall…deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny</p>
<p><a id="page_332" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>332</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">to <i>any person within its jurisdiction</i> the equal protection of the laws.” Appellants argue at the outset that undocumented aliens, because of their immigration status, are not “persons within the jurisdiction” of the State of Texas, and that they therefore have no right to equal protection. We reject this argument. Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien is surely a “person” in any ordinary sense of that term. Aliens, even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as “persons” guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Indeed, we have clearly held that the Fifth Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government. <i>Matthews v. Diaz</i>, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976).</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he Fourteenth Amendment was designed to afford its protection to all within the boundaries of a State. <i>Wong Wing v. United States</i>, 163 U.S. 228, 238 (1896). To permit a State to employ the phrase “within its jurisdiction” in order to identify subclasses of persons whom it would define as beyond its jurisdiction, thereby relieving itself of the obligation to assure that its laws are designed and applied equally to those persons, would undermine the principal purpose for which the Equal Protection Clause was incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Protection Clause was intended to work nothing less than the abolition of all caste-based and invidious class-based legislation. That objective is fundamentally at odds with the power the State asserts here to classify persons subject to its laws as nonetheless excepted from its protection.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Equal Protection Clause directs that “all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.” <i>F. S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia</i>, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920). But so too, “[t]he Constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.” The initial discretion to determine what is “different” and what is “the same” resides in the legislatures of the States. A legislature must have substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived, that accommodate competing concerns both public and private, and that account for limitations on the practical ability of the State to remedy every ill. In applying the Equal Protection Clause to most forms of state action, we thus seek only the assurance that the classification at issue bears some fair relationship to a legitimate public purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">But we would not be faithful to our obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment if we applied so deferential a standard to every classification. The Equal Protection Clause was intended as a restriction on state legislative action inconsistent with elemental constitutional premises. Thus we have treated as presumptively invidious those classifications that disadvantage a “suspect class,” or that impinge upon the exercise of a “fundamental right.” With respect to such classifications, it is appropriate to enforce the mandate of equal protection by requiring the State to demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. In addition, we have recognized that certain forms of legislative classification, while not facially</p>
<p><a id="page_333" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>333</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">invidious, nonetheless give rise to recurring constitutional difficulties; in these limited circumstances we have sought the assurance that the classification reflects a reasoned judgment consistent with the ideal of equal protection by inquiring whether it may fairly be viewed as furthering a substantial interest of the State. We turn to a consideration of the standard appropriate for the evaluation of [the Texas statute].</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Sheer incapability or lax enforcement of the laws barring entry into this country, coupled with the failure to establish an effective bar to the employment of undocumented aliens, has resulted in the creation of a substantial “shadow population” of illegal migrants—numbering in the millions—within our borders. This situation raises the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, encouraged by some to remain here as a source of cheap labor, but nevertheless denied the benefits that our society makes available to citizens and lawful residents. The existence of such an underclass presents most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/16_ELEFR_Chapter_04.xhtml?create=true&amp;favre=brett#note14" id="Rnote14" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The children who are plaintiffs in these cases are special members of this underclass. Persuasive arguments support the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very presence within the United States is the product of their own unlawful conduct. These arguments do not apply with the same force to classifications imposing disabilities on the minor <i>children</i> of such illegal entrants. At the least, those who elect to enter our territory in violation of our law should be prepared to bear the consequences, including, but not limited to, deportation. But the children of those illegal entrants are not comparably situated. Their “parents have the ability to conform their conduct to societal norms,” and presumably the ability to remove themselves from the State’s jurisdiction; but the children who are plaintiffs in these cases “can affect neither their parents’ conduct nor their own status.” Even if the State found it expedient to control the conduct of adults by acting against their children, legislation directing the onus of a parent’s misconduct against his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice. “[V]isiting…condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and unjust. Moreover, imposing disabilities on the…child is contrary to the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing. Obviously, no child is responsible for his birth and penalizing the…child is an ineffectual—as well as unjust—way of deterring the parent.” <i>Weber v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.</i>, 406 U.S. 164, 175 (1972).</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, undocumented status is not irrelevant to any proper legislative goal. Nor is undocumented status an absolutely immutable characteristic since it is the product of conscious, indeed unlawful, action. But §21.031 is directed</p>
<p><a id="page_334" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>334</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">against children, and imposes its discriminatory burden on the basis of a legal characteristic over which children can have little control. It is thus difficult to conceive of a rational justification for penalizing these children for their presence within the United States. Yet that appears to be precisely the effect of §21.031.</p>
<p class="indent">Public education is not a “right” granted to individuals by the Constitution. <i>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez</i>, 411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973). But neither is it merely some governmental “benefit” indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation. Both the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child, mark the distinction. “[A]s…pointed out early in our history,…some degree of education is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system if we are to preserve freedom and independence.” <i>Wisconsin v. Yoder</i>, 406 U.S. 205, 221 (1972). In addition, education provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all. In sum, education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society. We cannot ignore the significant social costs borne by our Nation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which our social order rests.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the pivotal role of education in sustaining our political and cultural heritage, denial of education to some isolated group of children poses an affront to one of the goals of the Equal Protection Clause: the abolition of governmental barriers presenting unreasonable obstacles to advancement on the basis of individual merit. Paradoxically, by depriving the children of any disfavored group of an education, we foreclose the means by which that group might raise the level of esteem in which it is held by the majority. But more directly, “education prepares individuals to be self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in society.” Illiteracy is an enduring disability. The inability to read and write will handicap the individual deprived of a basic education each and every day of his life. The inestimable toll of that deprivation on the social economic, intellectual, and psychological well-being of the individual, and the obstacle it poses to individual achievement, make it most difficult to reconcile the cost or the principle of a status-based denial of basic education with the framework of equality embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">These well-settled principles allow us to determine the proper level of deference to be afforded §21.031. Undocumented aliens cannot be treated as a suspect class because their presence in this country in violation of federal law is not a “constitutional irrelevancy.” Nor is education a fundamental right; a State need not justify by compelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is provided to its population. But more is involved in these cases than the abstract question whether §21.031 discriminates against a suspect class, or whether education is a fundamental right. Section 21.031 imposes a lifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status. The stigma of illiteracy will mark them for the rest of their lives. By denying</p>
<p><a id="page_335" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>335</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">these children a basic education, we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our Nation. In determining the rationality of §21.031, we may appropriately take into account its costs to the Nation and to the innocent children who are its victims. In light of these countervailing costs, the discrimination contained in §21.031 can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="indent">It is the State’s principal argument that the undocumented status of these children <i>vel non</i> establishes a sufficient rational basis for denying them benefits that a State might choose to afford other residents. The State notes that while other aliens are admitted “on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws,” the asserted right of these children to an education can claim no implicit congressional imprimatur. Indeed, in the State’s view, Congress’ apparent disapproval of the presence of these children within the United States, and the evasion of the federal regulatory program that is the mark of undocumented status, provides authority for its decision to impose upon them special disabilities. Faced with an equal protection challenge respecting the treatment of aliens, we agree that the courts must be attentive to congressional policy; the exercise of congressional power might well affect the State’s prerogatives to afford differential treatment to a particular class of aliens. But we are unable to find in the congressional immigration scheme any statement of policy that might weigh significantly in arriving at an equal protection balance concerning the State’s authority to deprive these children of an education.</p>
<p class="indent">The Constitution grants Congress the power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” Drawing upon this power, upon its plenary authority with respect to foreign relations and international commerce, and upon the inherent power of a sovereign to close its borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme governing admission to our Nation and status within our borders. The States enjoy no power with respect to the classification of aliens. This power is “committed to the political branches of the Federal Government.” Although it is “a routine and normally legitimate part” of the business of the Federal Government to classify on the basis of alien status, and to “take into account the character of the relationship between the alien and this country,” only rarely are such matters relevant to legislation by a State.</p>
<p class="indent">As we recognized in <i>DeCanas v. Bica</i>, 424 U.S. 351 (1976), the States do have some authority to act with respect to illegal aliens, at least where such action mirrors federal objectives and furthers a legitimate state goal. In <i>DeCanas</i>, the State’s program reflected Congress’ intention to bar from employment all aliens except those possessing a grant of permission to work in this country. In contrast, there is no indication that the disability imposed by §21.031 corresponds to any identifiable congressional policy. The State does not claim that the conservation of state educational resources was ever a congressional concern in restricting immigration. More importantly, the classification reflected in §21.031 does not operate harmoniously within the federal program.</p>
<p><a id="page_336" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>336</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, like all persons who have entered the United States unlawfully, these children are subject to deportation. But there is no assurance that a child subject to deportation will ever be deported. An illegal entrant might be granted federal permission to continue to reside in this country, or even to become a citizen. In light of the discretionary federal power to grant relief from deportation, a State cannot realistically determine that any particular undocumented child will in fact be deported until after deportation proceedings have been completed. It would of course be most difficult for the State to justify a denial of education to a child enjoying an inchoate federal permission to remain.</p>
<p class="indent">We are reluctant to impute to Congress the intention to withhold from these children, for so long as they are present in this country through no fault of their own, access to a basic education. In other contexts, undocumented status, coupled with some articulable federal policy, might enhance state authority with respect to the treatment of undocumented aliens. But in the area of special constitutional sensitivity presented by these cases, we perceive no national policy that supports the State in denying these children an elementary education. The State may borrow the federal classification. But to justify its use as a criterion for its own discriminatory policy, the State must demonstrate that the classification is reasonably adapted to “<i>the purposes for which the state desires to use it.</i> “We therefore turn to the state objectives that are said to support §21.031.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">V</span></p>
<p class="indent">Appellants argue that the classification at issue furthers an interest in the “preservation of the state’s limited resources for the education of its lawful residents.” Of course, a concern for the preservation of resources standing alone can hardly justify the classification used in allocating those resources. The State must do more than justify its classification with a concise expression of an intention to discriminate. Apart from the asserted state prerogative to act against undocumented children solely on the basis of their undocumented status—an asserted prerogative that carries only minimal force in the circumstances of these cases—we discern three colorable state interests that might support §21.031.</p>
<p class="indent">First, appellants appear to suggest that the State may seek to protect itself from an influx of illegal immigrants. While a State might have an interest in mitigating the potentially harsh economic effects of sudden shifts in population, §21.031 hardly offers an effective method of dealing with an urgent demographic or economic problem. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the State’s economy. To the contrary, the available evidence suggests that illegal aliens underutilize public services, while contributing their labor to the local economy and tax money to the state fisc. The dominant incentive for illegal entry into the State of Texas is the availability of employment; few if any illegal immigrants come to this country, or presumably to the State of Texas, in order to avail themselves of a free education. Thus, even making the doubtful assumption that the net impact of illegal aliens on the economy of the State is negative, we think it clear that</p>
<p><a id="page_337" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>337</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">“[c]harging tuition to undocumented children constitutes a ludicrously ineffectual attempt to stem the tide of illegal immigration,” at least when compared with the alternative of prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, while it is apparent that a State may “not…reduce expenditures for education by barring [some arbitrarily chosen class of] children from its schools,” appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out for exclusion because of the special burdens they impose on the State’s ability to provide high-quality public education. But the record in no way supports the claim that exclusion of undocumented children is likely to improve the overall quality of education in the State.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he State failed to offer any “credible supporting evidence that a proportionately small diminution of the funds spent on each child [which might result from devoting some state funds to the education of the excluded group] will have a grave impact on the quality of education.” Of course, even if improvement in the quality of education were a likely result of barring some <i>number</i> of children from the schools of the State, the State must support its selection of <i>this</i> group as the appropriate target for exclusion. In terms of educational cost and need, however, undocumented children are “basically indistinguishable” from legally resident alien children.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out because their unlawful presence within the United States renders them less likely than other children to remain within the boundaries of the State, and to put their education to productive social or political use within the State. Even assuming that such an interest is legitimate, it is an interest that is most difficult to quantify. The State has no assurance that any child, citizen or not, will employ the education provided by the State within the confines of the State’s borders. In any event, the record is clear that many of the undocumented children disabled by this classification will remain in this country indefinitely, and that some will become lawful residents or citizens of the United States. It is difficult to understand precisely what the State hopes to achieve by promoting the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime. It is thus clear that whatever savings might be achieved by denying these children an education, they are wholly insubstantial in light of the costs involved to these children, the State, and the Nation.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">VI</span></p>
<p class="indent">If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest. No such showing was made here. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases is affirmed.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Blackmun</span> concurring.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe the Court’s experience has demonstrated that the <i>Rodriguez</i> formulation does not settle every issue of “fundamental rights” arising under the</p>
<p><a id="page_338" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>338</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Equal Protection Clause. Only a pedant would insist that there are <i>no</i> meaningful distinctions among the multitude of social and political interests regulated by the States, and <i>Rodriguez</i> does not stand for quite so absolute a proposition. To the contrary, <i>Rodriguez</i> implicitly acknowledged that certain interests, though not constitutionally guaranteed, must be accorded a special place in equal protection analysis. Thus, the Court’s decisions long have accorded strict scrutiny to classifications bearing on the right to vote in state elections, and <i>Rodriguez</i> confirmed the “constitutional underpinnings of the right to equal treatment in the voting process.” Yet “the right to vote, <i>per se</i>, is not a constitutionally protected right.” Instead, regulation of the electoral process receives unusual scrutiny because “the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights.” In other words, the right to vote is accorded extraordinary treatment because it is, in equal protection terms, an extraordinary right: a citizen cannot hope to achieve any meaningful degree of individual political equality if granted an inferior right of participation in the political process. Those denied the vote are relegated, by state fiat, in a most basic way to second-class status.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, when the State provides an education to some and denies it to others, it immediately and inevitably creates class distinctions of a type fundamentally inconsistent with those purposes, mentioned above, of the Equal Protection Clause. Children denied an education are placed at a permanent and insurmountable competitive disadvantage. And when those children are members of an identifiable group, that group—through the State’s action—will have been converted into a discrete underclass. Other benefits provided by the State, such as housing and public assistance, are of course important; to an individual in immediate need, they may be more desirable than the right to be educated. But classifications involving the complete denial of education are in a sense unique, for they strike at the heart of equal protection values by involving the State in the creation of permanent class distinctions. In a sense, then, denial of an education is the analogue of denial of the right to vote: the former relegates the individual to second-class social status; the latter places him at a permanent political disadvantage.</p>
<p class="indent">This conclusion is fully consistent with <i>Rodriguez. Rodriguez</i> held that “a State need not justify by compelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is provided to its population.” Similarly, it is undeniable that education is not a “fundamental right” in the sense that it is constitutionally guaranteed. Here, however, the State has undertaken to provide an education to most of the children residing within its borders. And, in contrast to the situation in <i>Rodriguez</i>, it does not take an advanced degree to predict the effects of a complete denial of education upon those children targeted by the State’s classification. In such circumstances, the voting decisions suggest that the State must offer something more than a rational basis for its classification.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Chief Justice Burger</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice White</span>, <span class="smallcap">Justice Rehnquist</span>, and <span class="smallcap">Justice O’Connor</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">I have no quarrel with the conclusion that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to aliens who, after their illegal entry into</p>
<p><a id="page_339" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>339</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">this country, are indeed physically “within the jurisdiction” of a state. However, as the Court concedes, this “only begins the inquiry.” The Equal Protection Clause does not mandate identical treatment of different categories of persons.</p>
<p class="indent">The dispositive issue in these cases, simply put, is whether, for purposes of allocating its finite resources, a state has a legitimate reason to differentiate between persons who are lawfully within the state and those who are unlawfully there. The distinction the State of Texas has drawn—based not only upon its own legitimate interests but on classifications established by the Federal Government in its immigration laws and policies—is not unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court acknowledges that, except in those cases when state classifications disadvantage a “suspect class” or impinge upon a “fundamental right,” the Equal Protection Clause permits a state “substantial latitude” in distinguishing between different groups of persons. Moreover, the Court expressly—and correctly—rejects any suggestion that illegal aliens are a suspect class or that education is a fundamental right. Yet by patching together bits and pieces of what might be termed quasi-suspect-class and quasi-fundamental-rights analysis, the Court spins out a theory custom-tailored to the facts of these cases.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, we are told little more than that the level of scrutiny employed to strike down the Texas law applies only when illegal alien children are deprived of a public education. If ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result-oriented approach, this case is a prime example.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court first suggests that these illegal alien children, although not a suspect class, are entitled to special solicitude because they lack “control” over or “responsibility” for their unlawful entry into this country. Similarly, the Court appears to take the position that §21.031 is presumptively “irrational” because it has the effect of imposing “penalties” on “innocent” children. However, the Equal Protection Clause does not preclude legislators from classifying among persons on the basis of factors and characteristics over which individuals may be said to lack “control.” Indeed, in some circumstances persons generally, and children in particular, may have little control over or responsibility for such things as their ill health, need for public assistance, or place of residence. Yet a state legislature is not barred from considering, for example, relevant differences between the mentally healthy and the mentally ill, or between the residents of different counties, simply because these may be factors unrelated to individual choice or to any “wrongdoing.” The Equal Protection Clause protects against arbitrary and irrational classifications, and against invidious discrimination stemming from prejudice and hostility; it is not an all-encompassing “equalizer” designed to eradicate every distinction for which persons are not “responsible.”</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. What level of review is the Court applying? Would this plan pass scrutiny under the Court’s application of rational basis in <i>Rodriguez</i>? Why does the <i>Plyler</i> Court find that it fails? Is the Court intruding on social policy and judgments about what is good for society, or just assessing rationality?</p>
<p><a id="page_340" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>340</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">2. Is this case precedent for the principle that education, although not a fundamental right, warrants some level of special or rigorous scrutiny? If current precedent does not require some level of rigorous scrutiny for educational inequality and deprivations, are the precedents themselves and the current broad tiers of scrutiny (rational, intermediate, and strict) of questionable validity in that they do not take relevant differences into account? What level of scrutiny or review would be appropriate for educational deprivations or inequalities (that do not otherwise involve suspect discrimination or interference with fundamental rights)?</p>
<p class="indent">3. The Court’s decision was 5-4 in <i>Plyler</i>, and its principle has remained contentious in some states. Reasoning that the decision hinged on a rigorous rational basis review, some opponents believe that were the Court to revisit the issue it would decide the case differently. As a result, legislators have supported and, in some instances, passed anti-immigrant legislation that is clearly unconstitutional under <i>Plyler. See, e.g., Lawmakers to Debate Education for Illegals</i>, <span class="smallcap">Augusta Chron</span>., Dec. 29, 2005, at B5.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting in 2010 with Arizona, several states enacted their own versions of global immigration reform. Within their sweeping legislation, some included provisions pertaining to schools or students. <i>See, e.g.</i>, S.B. 1070, 49th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2010). Most notably, Alabama passed legislation in 2011 that included a provision that requires school officials to ask for and report a student’s immigration status to the state education agency. Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (HB 56), <span class="smallcap">Ala. Code</span> §31-13-7 (LexisNexis 2011). The provision, however, stops short of contravening <i>Plyler</i> directly and does not prohibit undocumented youths from enrolling in school. Drawing on the Supreme Court’s recent rejection in <i>Arizona v. United States</i>, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012) of Arizona’s mandate that aliens carry registration documents, advocates and the Department of Justice have argued that Alabama’s legislation is similarly preempted by federal law. The Department of Justice has also charged that Alabama’s legislation has led to hostility toward and bullying of Latino students and their parents, and a general fear by children that they or their parents might be removed from school and the country. To the extent this amounts to a hostile environment, it would raise Title VI concerns. In 2013, Alabama agreed to a settlement, under which the state would permanently refrain from “[r]equiring schools to verify the immigration status of newly enrolled K-12 students.” Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC Victorious Against Alabama Ant-immigrant Law, Oct. 28, 2013, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2013/10/29/splc-victorious-against-alabama-anti-immigrant-law" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">https://www.splcenter.org/news/2013/10/29/splc-victorious-against-alabama-anti-immigrant-law</a>. In 2014, the Departments of Education and Justice also released new policy guidance reinforcing the law in this area.

<p class="indent">4. Immigrants’ access to public education can also be blocked through unofficial policies or local exercises of discretion, with or without malicious intent. In 2014, New York saw a significant increase in the number of children fleeing from violence in Central America. As their numbers in New York increased, so too did the administrative burdens to enrollment. Given the circumstances of their departure from their countries of origin, many of these</p>

<p class="noindent">students lacked official documentation of their age, prior educational experience, and other relevant information. Schools used the lack of documentation to deny them enrollment. This generated an investigation by the New York State Department of Education and attorney general. They found that twenty New York school districts were “blocking access for undocumented immigrant children.” Benjamin Mueller, <i>New York Compels 20 School Districts to Lower Barriers to Immigrants</i>, <span class="smallcap">N.Y.
