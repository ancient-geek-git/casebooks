<p class="noindent">Much of education law deals with issues beyond what is taught in school. From school funding and integration to student rights and discipline, legal issues permeate almost every aspect of a school district’s functioning. This chapter, however, moves into the classrooms and school libraries themselves, looking at who gets to decide what students will actually study at school. In particular, it explores the allocation of power among three key stakeholders in creating and controlling the curriculum: the school board, individual classroom teachers, and parents. Are there any limits to the decisions that a school board can make in choosing textbooks, curricula, and library books? What happens if a classroom teacher wants to deviate from the path that the school board has laid down? And what if parents object to aspects of the curriculum, wanting to shield their children from material that they find objectionable or inappropriate? As you will see, battles over creation and control of the curriculum can implicate a range of overlapping (and sometimes competing) constitutional interests: free speech rights of teachers, substantive due process rights of parents to control their children’s upbringing; free exercise rights of parents and students; Establishment Clause rights of parents and students; and, not least, First Amendment rights of students to receive ideas and information.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter includes three main sections. First, it looks at the very broad power of school boards to make decisions regarding curricula, textbooks, and library holdings, and the few limitations that courts have imposed here. Next, it turns to teachers and explores whether they have constitutionally protected rights (apart from any job security they may have through state tenure rules) to adopt teaching methods and materials of their own choosing. Here, you will see that the combination of school boards’ broad power and a recent Supreme Court decision contracting the scope of government employees’ speech rights means that teachers’ constitutional protection is currently very limited in the classroom. Finally, the chapter turns to one of the most controversial issues in education: what power parents should have to “opt out”—or, more precisely, opt their <i>children</i> out—of various pieces of the public school curriculum with which they disagree. Courts have repeatedly held that parents have very little power here, beyond their power to remove their children from the public school</p>
<p><a id="page_884" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>884</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">altogether. As you read this chapter, consider whether courts are striking the right balance in protecting the rights and prerogatives of the different stakeholders here, or whether they should be doing more to curb school boards’ discretion.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch343">A. THE SCHOOL BOARD’S POWER TO CREATE THE CURRICULUM</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch344">1. <i>Library Books</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Only one Supreme Court case has addressed a school board’s power to make curriculum-related decisions for the school district—and it did not even produce a clear majority opinion. <i>Board of Education v. Pico</i>, addressing the constitutional limits on a school board’s decision to remove controversial books from the school library, produced a 4-4-1 split. Four Justices on the <i>Pico</i> Court agreed that removing such books for viewpoint-discriminatory reasons—that is, out of dislike for the ideas contained within them—would violate the First Amendment. But four other Justices disagreed, and one Justice declined to reach the issue. Given the lack of a majority holding, <i>Pico</i> does not stand as binding precedent. That said, lower courts still look to <i>Pico</i> for guidance, and it is often the starting point in controversies over school boards’ pedagogical decisions.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch345">Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>457 U.S. 853 (1982)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Brennan</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which <span class="smallcap">Justice Marshall</span> and <span class="smallcap">Justice Stevens</span> joined, and in which <span class="smallcap">Justice Blackmun</span> joined except for Part II-A-(1).</p>
<p class="indent">The principal question presented is whether the First Amendment imposes limitations upon the exercise by a local school board of its discretion to remove library books from high school and junior high school libraries.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Petitioners are the Board of Education of the Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26, in New York, and Richard Ahrens, Frank Martin, Christina Fasulo, Patrick Hughes, Richard Melchers, Richard Michaels, and Louis Nessim. When this suit was brought, Ahrens was the President of the Board, Martin was the Vice President, and the remaining petitioners were Board members. The Board is a state agency charged with responsibility for the operation and administration of the public schools within the Island Trees School District, including</p>
<p><a id="page_885" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>885</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the Island Trees High School and Island Trees Memorial Junior High School. Respondents are Steven Pico, Jacqueline Gold, Glenn Yarris, Russell Rieger, and Paul Sochinski. When this suit was brought, Pico, Gold, Yarris, and Rieger were students at the High School, and Sochinski was a student at the Junior High School.</p>
<p class="indent">In September 1975, petitioners Ahrens, Martin, and Hughes attended a conference sponsored by Parents of New York United (PONYU), a politically conservative organization of parents concerned about education legislation in the State of New York. At the conference these petitioners obtained lists of books described by Ahrens as “objectionable,” and by Martin as “improper fare for school students.” It was later determined that the High School library contained nine of the listed books, and that another listed book was in the Junior High School library.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note74" id="Rnote74" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup> In February 1976, at a meeting with the Superintendent of Schools and the Principals of the High School and Junior High School, the Board gave an “unofficial direction” that the listed books be removed from the library shelves and delivered to the Board’s offices, so that Board members could read them. When this directive was carried out, it became publicized, and the Board issued a press release justifying its action. It characterized the removed books as “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-[Semitic], and just plain filthy,” and concluded that “[it] is our duty, our moral obligation, to protect the children in our schools from this moral danger as surely as from physical and medical dangers.”</p>
<p class="indent">A short time later, the Board appointed a “Book Review Committee,” consisting of four Island Trees parents and four members of the Island Trees schools staff, to read the listed books and to recommend to the Board whether the books should be retained, taking into account the books’ “educational suitability,” “good taste,” “relevance,” and “appropriateness to age and grade level.” In July, the Committee made its final report to the Board, recommending that five of the listed books be retained<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note75" id="Rnote75" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> and that two others be removed from the school libraries.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note76" id="Rnote76" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></sup> As for the remaining four books, the Committee could not agree on two,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note77" id="Rnote77" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></sup> took no position on one,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note78" id="Rnote78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></sup> and recommended that the last book be made available to students only with parental approval.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note79" id="Rnote79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></sup> The Board substantially rejected the Committee’s report later that month, deciding that only one book should be returned to the High School library without restriction,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note80" id="Rnote80" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></sup> that another</p>
<p><a id="page_886" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>886</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">should be made available subject to parental approval,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note81" id="Rnote81" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></sup> but that the remaining nine books should “be removed from elementary and secondary libraries and [from] use in the curriculum.” The Board gave no reasons for rejecting the recommendations of the Committee that it had appointed.</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents reacted to the Board’s decision by bringing the present action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. They alleged that petitioners had “ordered the removal of the books from school libraries and proscribed their use in the curriculum because particular passages in the books offended their social, political and moral tastes and not because the books, taken as a whole, were lacking in educational value.”</p>
<p class="indent">Respondents claimed that the Board’s actions denied them their rights under the First Amendment. They asked the court for a declaration that the Board’s actions were unconstitutional, and for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief ordering the Board to return the nine books to the school libraries and to refrain from interfering with the use of those books in the schools’ curricula.</p>
<p class="indent">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court, and remanded the action for a trial on respondents’ allegations. We granted certiorari.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">We emphasize at the outset the limited nature of the substantive question presented by the case before us. [A]s this case is presented to us, it does not involve textbooks, or indeed any books that Island Trees students would be required to read. Respondents do not seek in this Court to impose limitations upon their school Board’s discretion to prescribe the curricula of the Island Trees schools. On the contrary, the only books at issue in this case are <i>library</i> books, books that by their nature are optional rather than required reading. Our adjudication of the present case thus does not intrude into the classroom, or into the compulsory courses taught there. Furthermore, even as to library books, the action before us does not involve the <i>acquisition</i> of books. Respondents have not sought to compel their school Board to add to the school library shelves any books that students desire to read. Rather, the only action challenged in this case is the <i>removal</i> from school libraries of books originally placed there by the school authorities, or without objection from them.</p>
<p class="indent">The substantive question before us is still further constrained by the procedural posture of this case. Petitioners were granted summary judgment by the District Court. The Court of Appeals reversed that judgment, and remanded the action for a trial on the merits of respondents’ claims. We can reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and grant petitioners’ request for reinstatement of the summary judgment in their favor, only if we determine that “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,” and that petitioners are “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”</p>
<p><a id="page_887" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>887</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In sum, the issue before us in this case is a narrow one, both substantively and procedurally. It may best be restated as two distinct questions. First, does the First Amendment impose <i>any</i> limitations upon the discretion of petitioners to remove library books from the Island Trees High School and Junior High School? Second, if so, do the affidavits and other evidentiary materials before the District Court, construed most favorably to respondents, raise a genuine issue of fact whether petitioners might have exceeded those limitations?</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="h10b"><i>(1)</i></p>
<p class="indent">The Court has long recognized that local school boards have broad discretion in the management of school affairs. We have also acknowledged that public schools are vitally important “in the preparation of individuals for participation as citizens,” and as vehicles for “inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.” We are therefore in full agreement with petitioners that local school boards must be permitted “to establish and apply their curriculum in such a way as to transmit community values,” and that “there is a legitimate and substantial community interest in promoting respect for authority and traditional values be they social, moral, or political.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, however, we have necessarily recognized that the discretion of the States and local school boards in matters of education must be exercised in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment. In <i>West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette,</i> we held that under the First Amendment a student in a public school could not be compelled to salute the flag. We reasoned: “Boards of Education…have, of course, important, delicate, and highly discretionary functions, but none that they may not perform within the limits of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>. That they are educating the young for citizenship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.”</p>
<p class="indent">Later cases have consistently followed this rationale. Thus <i>Epperson</i> invalidated a State’s anti-evolution statute as violative of the Establishment Clause, and reaffirmed the duty of federal courts “to apply the First Amendment’s mandate in our educational system where essential to safeguard the fundamental values of freedom of speech and inquiry.” And <i>Tinker</i> held that a local school board had infringed the free speech rights of high school and junior high school students by suspending them from school for wearing black armbands in class as a protest against the Government’s policy in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, courts should not “intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems” unless “basic constitutional values” are “directly and sharply [implicated]” in those conflicts. But we think that the First Amendment rights of students may be directly and sharply implicated by the removal of books from the shelves of a school library. Our precedents have focused “not only on the role of the First Amendment in</p>
<p><a id="page_888" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>888</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">fostering individual self-expression but also on its role in affording the public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas.” And we have recognized that “the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.” In keeping with this principle, we have held that in a variety of contexts “the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.” This right is an inherent corollary of the rights of free speech and press that are explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution, in two senses. First, the right to receive ideas follows ineluctably from the <i>sender’s</i> First Amendment right to send them: “The right of freedom of speech and press…embraces the right to distribute literature, and necessarily protects the right to receive it.” “The dissemination of ideas can accomplish nothing if otherwise willing addressees are not free to receive and consider them. It would be a barren marketplace of ideas that had only sellers and no buyers.”</p>
<p class="indent">More importantly, the right to receive ideas is a necessary predicate to the <i>recipient’s</i> meaningful exercise of his own rights of speech, press, and political freedom. Madison admonished us: “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.” 9 Writings of James Madison 103.</p>
<p class="indent">In sum, just as access to ideas makes it possible for citizens generally to exercise their rights of free speech and press in a meaningful manner, such access prepares students for active and effective participation in the pluralistic, often contentious society in which they will soon be adult members. Of course all First Amendment rights accorded to students must be construed “in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.” <i>Tinker.</i> But the special characteristics of the school <i>library</i> make that environment especially appropriate for the recognition of the First Amendment rights of students.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioners emphasize the inculcative function of secondary education, and argue that they must be allowed <i>unfettered</i> discretion to “transmit community values” through the Island Trees schools. But that sweeping claim overlooks the unique role of the school library. It appears from the record that use of the Island Trees school libraries is completely voluntary on the part of students. Their selection of books from these libraries is entirely a matter of free choice; the libraries afford them an opportunity at self-education and individual enrichment that is wholly optional. Petitioners might well defend their claim of absolute discretion in matters of <i>curriculum</i> by reliance upon their duty to inculcate community values. But we think that petitioners’ reliance upon that duty is misplaced where, as here, they attempt to extend their claim of absolute discretion beyond the compulsory environment of the classroom, into the school library and the regime of voluntary inquiry that there holds sway.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>(2)</i></p>
<p class="indent">Petitioners rightly possess significant discretion to determine the content of their school libraries. But that discretion may not be exercised in a narrowly partisan or political manner. If a Democratic school board, motivated by party</p>
<p><a id="page_889" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>889</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">affiliation, ordered the removal of all books written by or in favor of Republicans, few would doubt that the order violated the constitutional rights of the students denied access to those books. The same conclusion would surely apply if an all-white school board, motivated by racial animus, decided to remove all books authored by blacks or advocating racial equality and integration. Our Constitution does not permit the official suppression of <i>ideas</i>. Thus whether petitioners’ removal of books from their school libraries denied respondents their First Amendment rights depends upon the motivation behind petitioners’ actions. If petitioners <i>intended</i> by their removal decision to deny respondents access to ideas with which petitioners disagreed, and if this intent was the decisive factor in petitioners’ decision,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note82" id="Rnote82" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></sup> then petitioners have exercised their discretion in violation of the Constitution. To permit such intentions to control official actions would be to encourage the precise sort of officially prescribed orthodoxy unequivocally condemned in <i>Barnette</i>. On the other hand, respondents implicitly concede that an unconstitutional motivation would <i>not</i> be demonstrated if it were shown that petitioners had decided to remove the books at issue because those books were pervasively vulgar. And again, respondents concede that if it were demonstrated that the removal decision was based solely upon the “educational suitability” of the books in question, then their removal would be “perfectly permissible.” In other words, in respondents’ view such motivations, if decisive of petitioners’ actions, would not carry the danger of an official suppression of ideas, and thus would not violate respondents’ First Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted earlier, nothing in our decision today affects in any way the discretion of a local school board to choose books to <i>add</i> to the libraries of their schools. Because we are concerned in this case with the suppression of ideas, our holding today affects only the discretion to <i>remove</i> books. In brief, we hold that local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to “prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.” <i>Barnette.</i> Such purposes stand inescapably condemned by our precedents.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">We now turn to the remaining question presented by this case: Do the evidentiary materials that were before the District Court, when construed most favorably to respondents, raise a genuine issue of material fact whether petitioners exceeded constitutional limitations in exercising their discretion to remove the books from the school libraries? We conclude that the materials do raise such a question, which forecloses summary judgment in favor of petitioners.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence plainly does not foreclose the possibility that petitioners’ decision to remove the books rested decisively upon disagreement with</p>
<p><a id="page_890" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>890</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">constitutionally protected ideas in those books, or upon a desire on petitioners’ part to impose upon the students of the Island Trees High School and Junior High School a political orthodoxy to which petitioners and their constituents adhered. Of course, some of the evidence before the District Court might lead a finder of fact to accept petitioners’ claim that their removal decision was based upon constitutionally valid concerns. But that evidence at most creates a genuine issue of material fact on the critical question of the credibility of petitioners’ justifications for their decision.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Blackmun</span>, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">While I agree with much in today’s plurality opinion, and while I accept the standard laid down by the plurality to guide proceedings on remand, I write separately because I have a somewhat different perspective on the nature of the First Amendment right involved.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">[T]he principle involved here is both narrower and more basic than the “right to receive information” identified by the plurality. I do not suggest that the State has any affirmative obligation to provide students with information or ideas, something that may well be associated with a “right to receive.” And I do not believe, as the plurality suggests, that the right at issue here is somehow associated with the peculiar nature of the school library; if schools may be used to inculcate ideas, surely libraries may play a role in that process. Instead, I suggest that certain forms of state discrimination <i>between</i> ideas are improper. In particular, our precedents command the conclusion that the State may not act to deny access to an idea simply because state officials disapprove of that idea for partisan or political reasons.</p>
<p class="indent">As I see it, then, the question in this case is how to make the delicate accommodation between the limited constitutional restriction that I think is imposed by the First Amendment, and the necessarily broad state authority to regulate education. In starker terms, we must reconcile the schools’ “inculcative” function with the First Amendment’s bar on “prescriptions of orthodoxy.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">In my view, we strike a proper balance here by holding that school officials may not remove books for the <i>purpose</i> of restricting access to the political ideas or social perspectives discussed in them, when that action is motivated simply by the officials’ disapproval of the ideas involved. It does not seem radical to suggest that state action calculated to suppress novel ideas or concepts is fundamentally antithetical to the values of the First Amendment. At a minimum, allowing a school board to engage in such conduct hardly teaches children to respect the diversity of ideas that is fundamental to the American system. In this context, then, the school board must “be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,” and that the board had</p>
<p><a id="page_891" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>891</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">something in mind in addition to the suppression of partisan or political views it did not share.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice White</span>, concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p class="indent">[The Court of Appeals concluded] that there was a material issue of fact that precluded summary judgment sought by petitioners. The unresolved factual issue, as I understand it, is the reason or reasons underlying the school board’s removal of the books. I am not inclined to disagree with the Court of Appeals on such a fact-bound issue and hence concur in the judgment of affirmance. Presumably this will result in a trial and the making of a full record and findings on the critical issues.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Chief Justice Burger</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist</span>, and <span class="smallcap">Justice O’Connor</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">I agree with the fundamental proposition that “students do not ‘shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.’ ” Here, however, no restraints of any kind are placed on the students. They are free to read the books in question, which are available at public libraries and bookstores; they are free to discuss them in the classroom or elsewhere. Despite this absence of any direct external control on the students’ ability to express themselves, the plurality suggests that there is a new First Amendment “entitlement” to have access to particular books in a school library.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">If, as we have held, schools may legitimately be used as vehicles for “inculcating fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system,” school authorities must have broad discretion to fulfill that obligation. Presumably all activity within a primary or secondary school involves the conveyance of information and at least an implied approval of the worth of that information. How are “fundamental values” to be inculcated except by having school boards make content-based decisions about the appropriateness of retaining materials in the school library and curriculum. In order to fulfill its function, an elected school board <i>must</i> express its views on the subjects which are taught to its students. In doing so those elected officials express the views of their community; they may err, of course, and the voters may remove them. It is a startling erosion of the very idea of democratic government to have this Court arrogate to itself the power the plurality asserts today.</p>
<p class="indent">The plurality concludes that under the Constitution school boards cannot choose to retain or dispense with books if their discretion is exercised in a “narrowly partisan or political manner.” The plurality concedes that permissible factors are whether the books are “pervasively vulgar,” or educationally unsuitable. “Educational suitability,” however, is a standardless phrase. This conclusion will undoubtedly be drawn in many—if not most—instances because of</p>

<p class="noindent">the decisionmaker’s content-based judgment that the ideas contained in the book or the idea expressed from the author’s method of communication are inappropriate for teenage pupils.</p>
<p class="indent">The plurality also tells us that a book may be removed from a school library if it is “pervasively vulgar.” But why must the vulgarity be “pervasive” to be offensive? Vulgarity might be concentrated in a single poem or a single chapter or a single page, yet still be inappropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, there is no guidance whatsoever as to what constitutes “political” factors. This Court has previously recognized that public education involves an area of broad public policy and “ ‘[goes] to the heart of representative government.’ ” As such, virtually all educational decisions necessarily involve “political” determinations.</p>
<p class="indent">What the plurality views as valid reasons for removing a book at their core involve partisan judgments. Ultimately the federal courts will be the judge of whether the motivation for book removal was “valid” or “reasonable.” Undoubtedly the validity of many book removals will ultimately turn on a judge’s evaluation of the books. Discretion must be used, and the appropriate body to exercise that discretion is the local elected school board, not judges.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Given that <i>Pico</i> did not produce a majority opinion, what status does it have? Lower courts have not treated <i>Pico</i> as binding law, although they do look to it for guidance, as you will see below.</p>
<p class="indent">2. In her landmark work <i>Democratic Education</i>, political philosopher Amy Gutmann argues that a guiding principle of public education in a democratic state should be nonrepression, explaining that “[t]he principle of nonrepression presents the state, and any group within it, from using education to restrict rational deliberation of competing conceptions of the good life and good society.” <span class="smallcap">Amy Gutmann, Democratic Education</span> 44 (1987). Gutmann further argues, with specific reference to <i>Pico</i>:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Decisions by local school boards to ban books from public-school libraries are among the most direct and open violations of the principle of nonrepression. Even if the school board’s intention is to lay the foundation of human decency and patriotism by banning books, it should not attempt to achieve this end by shielding students from understanding why some people use indecent language, hold radical political views, and break laws. Such understanding constitutes an important part of what it means to be an informed citizen.…</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he crucial test of the legitimacy—as distinguished from the correctness or the wisdom—of a policy of book banning by local school boards is whether the policy is nonrepressive.…Nonrepression prohibits educational authorities from shielding students from reasonable (not correct or uncontroversial) political views represented by the adult citizenry or from censoring reasonable challenges to those views.</p>

<p><a id="page_893" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>893</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">3. How does the <i>Pico</i> plurality characterize the First Amendment interest implicated here, and to whom does the right belong?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Why did Justice Blackmun write separately? How did his view of the First Amendment interest here diverge from the <i>Pico</i> plurality?</p>
<p class="indent">5. How does the <i>Pico</i> plurality differentiate between the school curriculum and the school library? What does it suggest should be the standard for school boards’ pure curricular decisions, and why?</p>
<p class="indent">6. Why do you think the plurality emphasized that “nothing in our decision today affects in any way the discretion of a local school board to choose books to <i>add</i> to the libraries of their schools”? What are the relevant distinctions between a decision to remove books and a decision not to add them?</p>
<p class="indent">7. How persuasive do you find the dissent’s argument that the <i>Pico</i> plurality’s standard is inherently flawed? Do you think that the plurality’s line is workable? Would there be a better line? Or should federal courts stay out of this entire area? Circle back to these questions after you have read <i>ACLU v. Miami-Dade County School Board</i>, in which judges on the Eleventh Circuit diverged sharply in their application of <i>Pico</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Carnes</span>, Circuit Judge:</p>
<p class="indent">Juan Amador was outraged when he read the inaccurate portrayal of life in Cuba that was contained in a book on the shelves of the library where his young daughter went to school. He asked that the book be removed from the shelves, explaining that, “[a]s a former political prisoner from Cuba, I find the material to be untruthful.” After a lengthy review process, the School Board removed the book.</p>
<p class="indent">Illustrating something akin to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, the action the School Board took at Amador’s request caused an equal and opposite reaction from another parent and two organizations. They promptly sued the Board. Agreeing with their claims that the School Board’s action violated the First Amendment, a federal district court enjoined the Board from removing the book. This is the Board’s appeal.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Miami-Dade County Public School District has forty-nine copies of the book, <i>A Visit to Cuba</i>, and its Spanish-language counterpart, <i>!Vamos a Cuba!</i>, spread out among thirty-three of its elementary and middle schools. The <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book is part of a series of books which “targets readers between the ages of 4 to 8 years old, and [is] written to provide basic information about what life is like for a child” in various countries. The “A Visit to” series also includes books about Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, Cambodia, England, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Canada, Vietnam, Wales, Australia,</p>
<p><a id="page_894" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>894</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">China, Japan, Scotland, Mexico, Italy, Israel, Ireland, India, Greece, Germany, and France. The school district has at least one copy of those other “A Visit to” books in some of its elementary and middle school libraries. The “A Visit to” series is located in the libraries’ nonfiction (history, geography, cultures) section.</p>
<p class="indent">The books in the “A Visit to” series all follow the same “formulaic format.” They offer the young reader “superficial introductions to geography, people, customs, language, and daily life.” “The large-print texts are accompanied by color photos of varying quality and relevance.” For example, the thirty-two pages of <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> contain general statements about Cuba’s geography (“Cuba is a country in the Caribbean Sea, south of Florida.”), people (“Most Cubans live in cities.”), customs (“Cubans dress to keep cool in the hot weather.”), language (“Most people in Cuba speak Spanish.”), and daily life (“People in Cuba eat, work, and go to school like you do.”).</p>
<p class="indent">The library at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School is one of the thirty-three district libraries with <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> in its collection. On April 4, 2006, Juan Amador, the father of a young girl at Douglas Elementary, filed a “Citizen’s Request for Reconsideration of Media” to have <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> removed from the library at his daughter’s school. On the request form Amador identified himself as a former political prisoner and complained that the material in the book was not truthful and “portrays a life in Cuba that does not exist.” Amador also wrote that, “I believe [<i>Vamos a Cuba</i>] aims to create an illusion and distort reality.” He recommended that the book be replaced by one “that truly reflects the plight of the Cuban people of the past and present.”</p>
<p class="indent">The school district has a four-tiered administrative procedure for reviewing citizen requests to remove books from the district’s libraries. In this case Amador followed the administrative review process from start to finish. Because he was not satisfied with the principal’s explanation about <i>Vamos a Cuba</i>, he submitted a formal request to the School Committee to remove the book from the Douglas Elementary library. The School Committee considered the book in light of the district’s fifteen written criteria for evaluating books for its school library collections. Some of the eight committee members believed that <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> was “factually accurate,” “apolitical,” and “appropriate for the age group,” while one member felt that the “author could have better written and researched the topic,” and another was convinced that the book did not meet the district’s criteria for accuracy. All eight members checked the “meets criteria” box for the categories of “educational significance” and “appropriateness.” The School Committee’s vote was seven to one in favor of retaining <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> in the Douglas Elementary library.</p>
<p class="indent">Amador appealed the School Committee’s decision to retain the book in the Douglas Elementary library to the superintendent, who submitted the appeal to the District Committee. The seventeen-member District Committee decided to evaluate <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> based on what it determined to be the three most important of the fifteen criteria: educational significance, appropriateness, and accuracy. The District Committee, by a vote of 15 to 1, recommended that the superintendent retain <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> in the Douglas Elementary library. (One member resigned before the vote, stating that “he had concerns regarding the ability of the committee to render an objective decision.”)</p>
<p><a id="page_895" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>895</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">The superintendent adopted the District Committee’s recommendation and informed Amador of his decision to leave <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> on the library shelves. Amador appealed the superintendent’s decision to the School Board the same day and asked that the Board take up his appeal at its next meeting. It did so. In its April 18, 2006 meeting, the Board heard comments from guest speakers in the community and considered the issue of removing <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> from the libraries. In its June 14, 2006 meeting, Board members spoke about their views on the subject, and a majority of the Board voted for removal of <i>Vamos a Cuba</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">At that June 14 meeting, after Amador spoke, Board chairman Augustin Barrera began the discussion for the Board. He stated that the “issues before us, to me are quite clear, it’s issues of inaccuracies, it’s issues of omissions, because sometimes the words that are not said are more powerful than those words which are said, and sometimes there’s generalities, which [is] how this book is portrayed.”</p>
<p class="indent">Board member Ana Rivas Logan spoke next. She said that “from the very first day” she reviewed <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> she had “found the book extremely offensive, inaccurate, full of omissions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Board vice-chair Perla Tabares Hantman explained that she did not view the issue to remove the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book as “one of censorship or about banning a book.” “I view this,” she continued, “as one of accuracy and truth.”</p>
<p class="indent">Board member Evelyn Langlieb Greer explained that the “beauty” of the administrative procedure for requesting that a book be removed from the library was that “it takes the emotion and the politics out” of the decision-making process, “and substitutes professional judgment.” She explained:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Once a book is in a system, and has enjoyed the consent of the administrative, of being in the system, it can only be legitimately removed in this country based on serious, material, irrevocable and clear inaccuracies and biases.</p>
<p class="indent">The 22 professional educators who reviewed this book have affirmatively determined that that is not the case, therefore, we are here today in essentially a political process.…</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Board member Martin Karp explained that “the author’s intent in <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> was not to say anything about the politics of the country, and the harsh realities that exist there, but sometimes, as our Chair said, when you do not say anything or avoid addressing real problems, you say a lot.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally Board member Robert Ingram spoke. He suggested that if some of his colleagues on the School Board did not vote to remove <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> from the libraries, “they can’t walk out of here. If they don’t vote for it, they can’t go home, they might find a bomb under their automobiles, and I feel that’s a shame to be put upon a school system that we are trying to train our children to have equality and justice.” Board member Ingram continued: “I can’t vote my conscience without feeling threatened. That should never happen in this community anymore.”</p>
<p class="indent">After all Board members who wished to speak (eight of the nine) had done so, Board member Logan made a motion. Her motion was to reject the superintendent’s decision to retain the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book in the Douglas Elementary library and to replace the entire “A Visit to” series in the district’s libraries “with updated books that are more actual to real life in these countries.” Logan stated</p>
<p><a id="page_896" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>896</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that the “findings” for her motion were “that the book is inaccurate, it has omissions.” Board member Bolonas seconded the motion. The motion was approved by a vote of 6 to 3.</p>
<p class="indent">About a week later the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, Inc. and the Miami-Dade County Student Government Association filed a complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983, in the Southern District of Florida against the School Board and the superintendent seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The ACLU and the student government association alleged that the defendants had violated their members’ First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="indent">[The district] court found that…the plaintiffs were likely to succeed. [It issued] a preliminary injunction enjoining the School Board from enforcing its removal order, and it also ordered that any of the books in the “A Visit to” series that were already removed be returned to the libraries.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants [appealed].</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The parties disagree about the contours of the legal standard we should apply to decide whether it is likely that the plaintiffs will succeed on their claim that the School Board’s decision to remove the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book from all the school district’s libraries violated their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs contend, and the district court agreed, that we should apply the test enunciated by a plurality of the Supreme Court in <i>Pico</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The School Board in our case equates its decision about which books to remove from school library shelves with the decision the principal made in Hazelwood about which articles to remove from the school newspaper. Both decisions, it asserts, relate to control over curriculum.</p>
<p class="indent">The argument against applying the <i>Hazelwood</i> standard here is that this is not a school newspaper situation, and the speech at issue does not form part of a course of study in a school’s curriculum. This is a school library book case. The question of what standard applies to school library book removal decisions is unresolved. And for reasons that will become apparent later we have no need to resolve it here.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if the plaintiffs won the argument about the applicable standard and got the one of their dreams, the furthest we could possibly go in their favor is the standard that failed to attract a majority in the Pico case: school officials may not remove books from library shelves “simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.” That is the standard the plaintiffs want.</p>
<p class="indent">Even assuming that standard applies, however, the plaintiffs still lose if the School Board removed <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> not for those prohibited reasons but instead, as the Board insists, for legitimate pedagogical reasons such as concerns about the accuracy of the book. Whatever else it prohibits, the First Amendment does not forbid a school board from removing a book because it contains factual</p>
<p><a id="page_897" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>897</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">inaccuracies, whether they be of commission or omission. There is no constitutional right to have books containing misstatements of objective facts shelved in a school library.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs do not dispute that the School Board may remove a book because it is educationally unsuitable. Nor do they dispute that one of the Board’s written criteria for determining the educational suitability of a nonfiction book is factual accuracy. What they dispute is the Board’s actual motive for ordering <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> removed from the library shelves. They contend that the Board acted to suppress the viewpoint expressed in <i>Vamos a Cuba</i>. The viewpoint the plaintiffs ascribe to the book, and describe as content neutral and apolitical, is one in which the people of Cuba are portrayed as eating, working, and going to school like students in the Miami-Dade County School District do. The Board’s conclusion that <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> is inaccurate is, according to plaintiffs, nothing but a pretense for enforcing the politically orthodox view—especially prevalent in South Florida—that opposes the Castro regime. The Board responds that it decided to remove the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> books because they were “inaccurate and rife with omissions in their portrayal of life in Cuba,” and that reason “does not constitute viewpoint discrimination.”</p>
<p class="indent">The district court agreed with the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Ordinarily, we review district court factfindings only for clear error, but First Amendment issues are not ordinary. Where the First Amendment is involved our review of the district court’s findings of “constitutional facts,” as distinguished from ordinary historical facts, is de novo.</p>
<p class="indent">We will review for clear error only the district court’s findings of ordinary historical facts. Those are facts about the who, what, where, when, and how of the controversy—what the School Board did, when and how it acted, what various members of the Board said, and so forth. Those facts, already set out earlier in this opinion, are largely undisputed.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, under the assumptions about the law that we have made for purposes of deciding this case, we must determine the “why” facts. Those are the core constitutional facts that involve the reasons the School Board took the challenged action—its intent, or more accurately, its motive for removing copies of the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book from the school libraries.</p>
<p class="indent">The dissent believes that “viewpoint discrimination was the decisive factor in [the Board’s] motivation.” Our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that under the <i>Pico</i> standard we are assuming applies, the Board members did not “remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike[d] the ideas contained in those books and [sought] by their removal to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics…or other matters of opinion.” The record shows that the Board did not simply dislike the ideas in the <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> book. Instead, everyone, including both sides’ experts, agreed that the book contained factual inaccuracies. Factual accuracy in a non-fiction book is not a “matter[] of opinion.” Under the <i>Pico</i> standard we are applying, the Board did not act based on an unconstitutional motive.</p>
<p><a id="page_898" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>898</b></a></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Even one of the three Board members who voted to retain <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> in the district’s libraries acknowledged that there were factual errors in the book. The Board’s formal order stated <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> was being removed because the Board had found that “the book is inaccurate and contains several omissions.” The order required that <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> “be replaced, throughout the school district, with a more accurate set of books that is more representative of actual life” in Cuba.</p>
<p class="indent">The consistency throughout the process of the inaccuracy complaints and the consistency of the explanations of the Board members who voted to remove the book evidence that the Board’s motive was what it stated—that the book was ordered removed from school libraries because it is full of factual errors. And there is more evidence.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">A fact of great significance in deciding whether the School Board was motivated to remove <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> because of inaccuracies is that the book indisputably does contain inaccuracies. It is inaccurate because of what it says. It is inaccurate because of what it does not say.</p>
<p class="indent">Page 29 of the English version of <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> states: “In one valley in Cuba, there are large, colorful paintings on some rocks. Inside the rocks are caves. The caves have paintings made by people who lived in Cuba about 1,000 years ago.”<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note83" id="Rnote83" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></sup> The book includes a picture of a rock painting that depicts people and animals in red, blue, green, and purple. It is undisputed, however, that the rock painting in the picture was not created “by people who lived in Cuba about 1,000 years ago” as the book indicates. Instead, the painting, “called Mural de la Prehistoria, which is located in the Valle de Vinales in Pinar del Rio,” was done in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="indent">On page 25 of <i>Vamos a Cuba</i>, the book states: “Cuba’s beaches are good for swimming and boating. People like to dive and fish. There are also rowboat and sailboat races.” The truth, according to the uncontradicted evidence in the record, is that the traditional Cuban rowboat and sailboat races were abolished a half century ago.</p>
<p class="indent">The third sentence in the book tells the children of this country that: “People in Cuba eat, work, and go to school like you do.” It is simply not true that people in Cuba “eat, work, and go to school” the same way that American children do.</p>
<p class="indent">As for eating, unlike the situation in this country, in Cuba food is rationed by the government. It has been for forty-six years. The book fails to mention that. As for the Cuban people “working like you do,” that is not true for children or adults. In Cuba there is “little private work,” and “it [is] a crime to exercise private initiative or to have private practice of a profession.” “Practically everyone must work for the government.” From the sixth grade on, students must go to the countryside for a period of 45 days to do unpaid agricultural work. Moreover, “from the senior high</p>
<p><a id="page_899" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>899</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">level, all must go to the countryside to do unpaid agricultural work, on a permanent basis, alternating half day in the fields and half in the classroom.” Refusal to do agricultural work may result in expulsion from school. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Dep’t of State, Cuba: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006 (2007). The book does not mention that.</p>
<p class="indent">The book’s assertion that people in Cuba go to school “like you do” is false, too. In addition to agricultural field work being a mandatory part of school for Cuban children, the Human Rights Report found that elementary and secondary students receive “obligatory ideological indoctrination.”</p>
<p class="indent">What <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> fails to mention, and takes great pains to cover up with its “like you do” misrepresentations, is that the people of Cuba live in a state of subjugation to a totalitarian communist regime with all that involves.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>E</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[T]he district court characterized the Board’s removal of <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> as book “banning.” That is a faulty foundation. The Board did not ban any book. The Board removed from its own school libraries a book that the Board had purchased for those libraries with Board funds. It did not prohibit anyone else from owning, possessing, or reading the book. The overwrought rhetoric about book banning has no place here.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Wilson</span>, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>
<p class="indent">Having read the book and independently examined the entire record, I agree with the district court that the School Board’s claim that <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> is grossly inaccurate is simply a pretense for viewpoint suppression, rather than the genuine reason for its removal. The record supports the district court’s determination that the book was not removed for a legitimate pedagogical reason.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority declines to determine whether the standard set forth in <i>Hazelwood</i> or the standard set forth in <i>Pico</i> applies to school library book removal decisions, finding that “even if the plaintiffs…got the [standard] of their dreams,” the test articulated by a plurality of the Supreme Court <i>Pico</i>, the plaintiffs would still lose because the School Board removed <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> for “legitimate pedagogical reasons.” I also do not determine which standard applies, as I find that even under the more lenient standard the Court set forth in <i>Hazelwood</i>, the plaintiffs demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the more lenient standard in <i>Hazelwood</i>, a school board may regulate expression related to curricular materials so long as the school board’s motivation is “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” This standard does not, however, permit a school board to engage in viewpoint discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent">The record provides palpable support for the district court’s conclusion that School Board members banned the book not because of inaccuracies per se but because the book failed to make a negative political statement about contemporary Cuba.</p>
<p class="indent">Several School Board members referred to their Cuban birth and their experience as exiles as explanations for why they found the book offensive. Their criticism is grounded in a portrayal of Cuba as normal and apolitical.</p>
<p><a id="page_900" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>900</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Some members of the Cuban American community attended the School Board meetings and demonstrated their intolerance to messages that fail to conform to their personal experiences. One member of the DMRC, Ronald Bilbao, described the environment at one of the meetings, as “very scary.” The Superintendent of the Miami-Dade County School System also noted the intense political pressure from the community.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the School Board, a politically elected body, was faced with intense community pressure. The evidence also shows that personal feelings were not always put aside; indeed, School Board member Hantman explained that her decision to ban the book was grounded “firmly in [her] commitment to stand with the Cuban American community, [of] which [she is] a very proud member.” She further stated that she “would not be doing her job as a Cuban American” if she did not vote to remove the book.</p>
<p class="indent">The record contains observations by educators, most of whom were themselves employed by the School Board, who consistently assured the Board that whatever omissions and inaccuracies there were in the book were not significant enough to remove the book for a legitimate pedagogical reason. Certainly a School Board is a political body that must serve its constituents. However, the School Board also took an oath to uphold the Constitution.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. The School Board’s Proffered Inaccuracies and Omissions</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The majority finds that “[a] fact of great significance in deciding whether the School Board was motivated to remove <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> because of inaccuracies is that the book indisputably does contain inaccuracies.” My independent view of the record, however, fully supports the district court’s determination that these inaccuracies were merely post hoc rationalizations for the book’s removal—“plausible but disingenuous justifications.”</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he omissions about which the plaintiff complained, if included, were found to be developmentally inappropriate and would render the book educationally unsuitable. The book was written for children ages four to eight.</p>
<p class="indent">The omitted information also falls outside the scope of a superficial geography book. <i>Vamos a Cuba</i> is simply part of an apolitical geography series. Its overall purpose is “to offer very basic information to young children about the way of life in another country.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. A Dangerous Precedent</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The majority concludes that the book is “inaccurate because of what it does not say,” in that it leaves out the horrors of the Castro regime. Opening the door to the majority’s interpretation of “inaccuracy” would lead to a host of challenges. The sanctioned banning of a simple book like this would be logically supported by a finding that age-appropriate, politically neutral texts are rendered “inaccurate” by their omission of information that would express a particular political viewpoint.</p>
<p class="indent">I am also troubled by the majority’s discussion about how the “book was not being <i>banned</i>…[but rather] <i>removed</i> from a school’s library shelves.” The majority argues that because the book was removed from a school’s library</p>
<p><a id="page_901" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>901</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">shelves, but could still be found in other public libraries in the area and was available for purchase, the booked was not banned. I disagree.</p>
<p class="indent">[U]nder the majority’s definition—“where a government or its officials forbid or prohibit others from <i>having</i> a book,” a school board could never ban a book. It has the authority to remove books only within its school system. If it does this, according to the majority, it has not banned the book, as it could only be “banned” if people cannot have the book altogether. Such a definition limits the word’s application to almost nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Cuba—“Cuba is a country in the Caribbean Sea, south of Florida. It is one big island with some smaller ones nearby. People in Cuba eat, work, and go to school like you do. Life in Cuba is also unique.” (2) Land—“Cuba has flat plains that are used for farmland. There are also sandy beaches and coral reefs. The weather in Cuba is very warm. There are mountains in Cuba, too. The mountains are covered with forests.” (3) Landmarks—“The capital of Cuba is Havana. The Capitol building in Havana looks like the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Morro Castle is an old fort. It was built by people from Spain. It was used 400 years ago to protect Havana from pirates.” (4) Homes—“Most Cubans live in cities. The cities are crowded, so many live in apartment buildings. There are some beautiful old buildings. There are new buildings, too. Most homes in the country are simple. Some are made of wood from palm trees. They have roofs of palm leaves or grasses.” (5) Food—“White rice is the most common food in Cuba. Sometimes it is mixed with black beans. Chicken with rice is popular, too. Many kinds of fruits grow in Cuba. Bananas, pineapples, oranges, and mangoes are favorites. Yucca is a plant that people eat as a vegetable.” (6) Clothes—“Cubans dress to keep cool in the hot weather. Many children wear shorts and T-shirts. For special festivals, men wear white pants and white shirts. Women wear colorful ruffled dresses.” (7) Work—“Some Cubans work in factories that make cigars or sugar. There are also factories where people make cloth, shoes, paper, and farm tools. In the country, there are large farms. The workers there grow sugarcane and tobacco. There are also farms for vegetables, such as lettuce, onions, and carrots.” (8) Transportation—“There are not many cars in Cuba. In the cities, some people drive old cars from the United States. Most Cubans travel by bus. On country roads, people use animals to pull wagons. Animals are also used to help farmers in their fields.” (9) Language—“Most people in Cuba speak Spanish. This is because Cuba was settled by people from Spain. Spanish uses some of the same letters as English. There are also some extra letters in the Spanish alphabet.” (10) School—“Cuban children go to school between the ages of five and fourteen. They wear uniforms to school. There are different colored uniforms for different ages. In school, children learn math, reading, and history. All school children do some kind of work during their school day. Some children work in gardens. Older children may work in factories.” (11) Free Time—“Baseball is Cuba’s national sport. Cuba won the gold medal in baseball in the 1996 Olympic Games. Cuba’s beaches are good for swimming and boating. People like to dive</p>
<p><a id="page_902" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>902</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and fish. There are also rowboats and sailboat races. (12) Celebrations—“Cuba’s biggest celebration is called Carnival. It is held on July 26. People dance and sing at this festival. Some people who settled in Cuba were Roman Catholics. Other people who lived in Cuba were from Africa. So some Cuban celebrations mix African and Catholic beliefs.” (13) The Arts—“Cuban music mixes sounds from Africa and Spain. Musicians use guitars, drums, and gourds to make music and a beat. Dances from Cuba are popular around the world. In one valley in Cuba, there are large colorful paintings on some rocks. Inside the rocks are caves. The caves have paintings made by people who lived in Cuba about 1,000 years ago.”</p>

<p class="indent">1. Which opinion did you find more persuasive here?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the divergence between the <i>ACLU</i> majority and dissent make you rethink your opinion about whether <i>Pico</i> articulated a workable standard, in suggesting that the key question is whether the decision makers were motivated by concerns about educational suitability or instead by disapproval of a particular viewpoint? If so, is there a rule that would make more sense?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Despite the origins of <i>Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier</i>, 484 U.S. 260 (1988), presented in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/20_ELEFR_Chapter_08.xhtml" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Chapter 8</a> as a student speech case, its standard—whether the school’s action was “reasonably related to a legitimate pedagogical concern”—sometimes migrates into cases involving curriculum-related disputes, as in <i>ACLU v. Miami-Dade County School Board</i>. The extent to which <i>Hazelwood</i>, if applied, might yield a different outcome than <i>Pico</i> largely depends on whether <i>Hazelwood</i>’s standard is viewed as requiring viewpoint neutrality (a question on which there is currently a circuit split). If <i>Hazelwood</i> requires viewpoint neutrality, then the <i>Pico</i> and <i>Hazelwood</i> standards are actually very similar: They both require the school’s decision to have stemmed from concerns about educational suitability, rather than a desire to shield students from a particular viewpoint. Indeed, given that the Eleventh Circuit had previously held that <i>Hazelwood</i> requires viewpoint neutrality, it is not surprising that the <i>ACLU</i> majority and dissent both agreed that <i>Pico</i> and <i>Hazelwood</i> cut the same way (with the majority thinking that the plaintiffs should lose under both cases, and the dissent thinking that the plaintiffs should win under either of them). By contrast, if <i>Hazelwood</i> permits viewpoint discrimination, then—to the extent that it is used in curriculum-related disputes—it may sometimes yield different results from <i>Pico</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The <i>ACLU</i> majority and dissent diverged over whether the school district’s action should actually be considered a book “banning.” Whom did you find more convincing on this point?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch347">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Patricia Parker, the parent of a seventh-grader at West York Middle School, contacted the school librarian to express concern that the Harry Potter books were available for students to check out of the library. She explained that based</p>
<p><a id="page_903" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>903</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">on her review of the books, they dealt with “witchcraft” and “the occult.” Pursuant to official school policies, the school district convened a Library Committee to consider the matter, consisting of the school principal, the librarian, a seventh-grade teacher, and a parent representative. The Library Committee unanimously voted to keep the book in circulation without any restrictions, and passed this recommendation on to the West York School Board.</p>
<p class="indent">The board, however, voted 3-2 to restrict access to the Harry Potter series. Under the new regime, students need signed permission slips from their parents to check out the Harry Potter books, which are kept with the librarian at the circulation desk rather than being available on the shelves for students to browse. One member voting in favor of restricting access explained that he objected to a book that would expose students to the “witchcraft religion.” Another member reiterated that the books “teach about witchcraft.” The third member stated that regardless of how she felt about the books, the controversy demonstrated to her that it was best to leave the decision to parents through a permission slip regime, as opposed to letting students browse and check out the books on their own. The other two members said that they deferred to the Library Committee’s recommendation and would thus vote to leave the books in full circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">After the new regime was implemented, the parents of one student, Alison Adams, contacted you, a noted education lawyer, to see whether they have a valid claim on her behalf. Alison and her friends are avid Harry Potter readers and are very upset about this new policy. What advice would you give them about the strength of their potential lawsuit?</p>
<p class="h4" id="ch348">2. <i>Pure Curricular Decisions</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Both of the above cases deal with a school board’s removal of library books. But what about school board decisions regarding what gets taught in the classroom itself? Here, lower courts have taken to heart <i>Pico</i>’s suggestion that the school board members “might well defend their claim of absolute discretion in matters of <i>curriculum</i>.” Moreover, as the next case illustrates, some have moved toward the approach that such curricular decisions reflect pure “government speech.”</p>

<p><a id="page_904" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>904</b></a></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Texas State Board of Education (the “SBOE” or “Board”) is a body created by the state legislature and given a wide degree of authority over education policy in Texas, including the authority to “develop and update a long range plan for public education,” “establish curriculum and graduation requirements,” and “adopt and purchase or license textbooks as provided by Chapter 31 [of the Texas Education Code] and adopt rules required by that Chapter.” The Board is composed of fifteen members elected from districts across Texas in biennial general elections.</p>
<p class="indent">The SBOE reviews and adopts the textbooks it deems appropriate for each course. For each subject and grade level, the State Board of Education is required to adopt two lists of textbooks: one list includes “conforming” textbooks, the other includes “nonconforming” textbooks. Conforming textbooks contain material covering each element of the essential knowledge and skills of the subject and grade level as determined by the Board, while nonconforming textbooks contain material covering at least half, but not all, of those elements. Both conforming and nonconforming textbooks must be free from errors and meet the physical requirements adopted by the Board. The Board accepts or rejects each textbook proposed for placement on one of the two lists by a majority vote.</p>
<p class="indent">The review process for a textbook begins with submission of the textbook by the publisher. The textbook is examined by a review panel, which evaluates the textbook according to criteria promulgated by the SBOE, and submits its evaluation to the Texas Education Agency Commissioner. Based on the opinion of the review panel, the Commissioner then prepares a recommendation to the Board that the textbook under consideration be placed on the conforming list, placed on the nonconforming list, or rejected. The Board then solicits commentary from the public on the textbook, both in written form and in hearings. Finally, the Board votes on each textbook to either place the book on the conforming or nonconforming list, or to reject the book.</p>
<p class="indent">The SBOE has established four conditions under which a textbook can be rejected. Specifically, the Board may reject any textbook for:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent">(1) failure to meet essential knowledge and skills specified in the proclamation. In determining the percentage of elements of the essential knowledge and skill covered by instructional materials, each performance description shall count as an independent element of the essential knowledge and skills of the subject;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) failure to meet established manufacturing standards and specifications recognized by the SBOE;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) failure to correct errors of fact; or</p>
<p class="indent">(4) content that clearly conflicts with the stated purpose of the Texas Education Code, §28.002(h).</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Section 28.002(h) of the Texas Education Code in turn provides:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">The State Board of Education and each school district shall foster the continuation of the tradition of teaching United States and Texas history and the free enterprise system in</p>
<p><a id="page_905" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>905</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">regular subject matter and in reading courses and in the adoption of textbooks. A primary purpose of the public school curriculum is to prepare thoughtful, active citizens who understand the importance of patriotism and can function productively in a free enterprise society with appreciation for the basic democratic values of our state and national heritage.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent">Each year, once the SBOE formulates its lists of conforming and nonconforming textbooks, the lists are circulated to individual school districts. School districts are required to select textbooks for use in “foundation curriculum” subjects from either the conforming or nonconforming list. School districts may select a book not on either list, however, for use in “enrichment curriculum” subjects. If a school district selects a textbook from the conforming or nonconforming list, the SBOE pays the cost of supplying copies of the textbook, subject to certain limitations. If, however, a school district selects a textbook not on either of the lists adopted by the Board, the Board pays only 70% of the cost of the textbooks, and the local school district is responsible for the remainder. School districts may also seek a waiver from the Texas Education Agency Commissioner to obtain full state funding for a rejected textbook.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">In May of 1999, the SBOE solicited bids from publishers for textbooks to be used in regular and advanced environmental science classes in Texas public high school. In response, Jones and Bartlett Publishers submitted the sixth edition of <i>Environmental Science: Creating a Sustainable Future</i>, authored by Appellant Daniel Chiras.</p>
<p class="indent">In accordance with the Board’s administrative regulations, Chiras’ book was submitted to a review panel composed of professors at Texas A&amp;M University. The review panel initially identified some potential factual errors in Chiras’ book, and so notified the Commissioner in its initial report. Jones &amp; Bartlett agreed to make corrections to some statements identified by the review panel, and provided justification for others. The review panel accepted Jones &amp; Bartlett’s revisions and reported to the Commissioner that no additional corrections were necessary. The Commissioner then placed <i>Environmental Science</i> on the proposed list of nonconforming textbooks to be submitted for public comment. After reviewing the public comments and Jones &amp; Bartlett’s responses, the Commissioner recommended in his final report issued on October 26, 2001, that the SBOE adopt Chiras’ book. <i>Environmental Science</i> was one of only three textbooks recommended for use in regular environmental science courses, and the only textbook recommended for advanced courses.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants allege that after the Commissioner issued his report, two “conservative think-tank organizations”—the Texas Public Policy Foundation (“TPPF”) and Citizens for a Sound Economy (“CSE”)—requested that the SBOE permit additional public comment on the proposed textbooks prior to the scheduled vote. The SBOE agreed, and scheduled a public hearing for November 8, 2001, the day before the final vote on the proposed textbooks was scheduled. Appellants also allege that Defendant-Appellees McLeroy, Shore, and Thornton—all members of the Board—worked with TPPF and</p>
<p><a id="page_906" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>906</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">CSE to “develop a strategy for rejecting Chiras’ book.” After the public hearing, at which members of TPPF and CSE spoke in opposition to approving <i>Environmental Science</i>, the Board voted not to adopt Chiras’ book by a vote of 10-5.</p>
<p class="indent">The SBOE issued no formal findings or reasons for its decision to reject <i>Environmental Science</i>. However, Appellants identify three comments by Board members which they allege demonstrate an unconstitutional motivation to reject the textbook. First, Appellee McLeroy wrote an article published on the CSE website in which he suggested that the SBOE rejected Chiras’ textbook because it was based on a “false premise” and that the textbook’s “claim that the root cause of environmental problems is economic growth is simply wrong.” Second, the <i>Austin American-Statesman</i> reported that Appellee Shore told the newspaper that “the oil and gas industry should be consulted” regarding passage of proposed environmental science textbooks, because “we [the oil and gas industry] always get a raw deal.” Third, the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> reported that Appellee Bradley told the newspaper that the Board was “seeing a change in the attitude of publishers. They are starting to work with conservative groups and textbook critics…who more accurately reflect the viewpoint of most Texans. I really think the pendulum is swinging back to a more traditional, conservative value system in our schools.”</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Following the Board’s decision to reject Chiras’ textbook, Appellants filed this action on the theory that the Board’s decision constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Appellees moved to dismiss, and the district court granted that motion after concluding that school officials may permissibly discriminate on the basis of viewpoint when selecting materials for inclusion in the public school curriculum.</p>
<p class="indent">The district court reasoned that the selection and use of a textbook by the public schools is neither pure government speech nor pure private speech, but rather private speech which bears the imprimatur of the government. As a result, the district court applied the forum analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Hazelwood.</i> Applying the rule of Hazelwood, the district court concluded that Hazelwood did not require the Board’s decision to be viewpoint-neutral, and that the motivations for the Board’s decision alleged by Appellants were “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding both that <i>Hazelwood</i> does not require the SBOE’s decision to be viewpoint-neutral and that the Board’s reasons for its decision were “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” Appellees argue, however, that the selection and use of textbooks in the public schools is government speech, not a forum, and not subject to the First Amendment rights of either textbook authors or students.</p>
<p><a id="page_907" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>907</b></a></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The first question we must answer is whether Appellant Chiras alleged a violation of his First Amendment rights as a textbook author by the SBOE when it declined to place his textbook on the conforming or nonconforming list of textbooks for use in public school classrooms. Although the Supreme Court has not answered this question directly, the Court has given us ample guidance to allow us to comfortably answer in the negative.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>1</i></p>
<p class="indent">Any discussion of the constitutionality of a state’s decision to reject a textbook for its public schools must begin with the recognition that the states enjoy broad discretionary powers in the field of public education. Central among these discretionary powers is the authority to establish public school curricula which accomplishes the states’ educational objectives.</p>
<p class="indent">[W]hen the SBOE devises the state curriculum for Texas and selects the textbook with which teachers will teach to the students, it is the state speaking, and not the textbook author. Designing the curriculum and selecting textbooks is a core function of the SBOE. It is necessary for the Board to exercise editorial judgment over the content of the instructional materials it selects for use in the public school classrooms, and the exercise of that discretion will necessarily reflect the viewpoint of the Board members. The purpose of the Board is not to establish a forum for the expression of the views the various authors of textbooks and other instructional materials might want to interject into the classroom. Further, the Board has a statutory obligation under Texas law to exercise that discretion in order to promote the state’s chosen message through the Board’s educational policy. As noted above, the Texas Education Code requires that the Board “foster the continuation of the tradition of teaching United States and Texas history and the free enterprise system in regular subject matter and in reading courses and <i>in the adoption of textbooks</i>.”</p>
<p class="indent">Because the Board must necessarily exercise its editorial discretion in selecting which private entities will convey the message the state selects, forum analysis and the viewpoint neutrality requirement are inapposite in this case. As a result, there is no forum to which Appellant Chiras can claim access as a textbook author.</p>
<p class="h10b"><i>2</i></p>
<p class="indent">Much of the Appellants’ claim depends on the argument that the SBOE’s decision in this case is subject to the restrictions developed by the Supreme Court in <i>Hazelwood</i>. Because we conclude that the Board’s selection of textbooks is government speech, <i>Hazelwood</i> does not apply, and there is no forum to which Chiras might assert a right of access under the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">Our conclusion that the SBOE’s selection and use of textbooks in public school classrooms is government speech and not a forum for First Amendment</p>
<p><a id="page_908" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>908</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">purposes means only that Appellant Chiras may not assert a cognizable right of access to the approved list of textbooks. The conclusion that no forum exists in this case does not necessarily preclude, however, Appellant Rodriguez’s asserted right as a student to receive the information in Chiras’ textbook from the school. Therefore, the second question we must answer is whether Appellant Rodriguez alleged a violation by the SBOE of her First Amendment rights as a student when it declined to place Chiras’ textbook on the conforming or nonconforming lists.</p>
<p class="indent">Appellants’ primary claim to support for a student’s right to receive information is the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Pico.</i> However, the Court carefully circumscribed that potential right, acknowledging that the case “does not involve textbooks” and that the Court’s conclusion “does not intrude into the classroom, or into the compulsory courses taught there.” Indeed, the Court readily admitted that a school board “might well defend their claim of absolute discretion in matters of <i>curriculum</i> by reliance upon their duty to inculcate community values.” Because <i>Pico</i> addressed the removal of an optional book from the school library, not the selection of a textbook for use in the classroom, we decline to apply <i>Pico</i> to the facts before us.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. In concluding that textbook selection represents “government speech,” the Fifth Circuit basically foreclosed the viability of any free speech–based challenges by textbook authors to a school district’s textbook choices. During the past few years, the Supreme Court has further developed the government speech doctrine, explaining that “the Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private speech; it does not regulate government speech.” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 467 (2009). Most recently, the Supreme Court applied the government speech doctrine to specialty license plates, holding that Texas’s decisions about which specialty license plates to approve reflected pure government speech, such that the viewpoint-neutrality requirement did not apply. Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2239 (2015). As the government speech doctrine continues to evolve and expand, that will have important implications for challenges to school districts’ curricular and textbook choices. <i>See generally</i> Kristi L. Bowman, <i>The Government Speech Doctrine and Speech in Schools,</i> 48 <span class="smallcap">Wake Forest L. Rev.</span> 211 (2013).</p>
<p class="indent">2. As <i>Chiras</i> illustrates, challenges to curricular and textbook choices can come from different places. The notion that those choices reflect government speech is fatal to a <i>textbook author</i>’s challenge to them, but not necessarily fatal to a <i>student</i>’s challenge to them—since, as <i>Chiras</i> noted, such a challenge stems from a “right to receive information” theory. That said, those student challenges face a steep battle as well, given <i>Pico</i>’s explicit distinction between textbooks and library books. Indeed, several years after <i>Chiras</i>, the First Circuit joined the Fifth Circuit in ruling that <i>Pico</i>’s prohibition of viewpoint discrimination should be inapplicable to textbook and curricular selections, although it stopped short of</p>
<p><a id="page_909" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>909</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">explicitly holding that such selections amount to pure government speech. Griswold v. Driscoll, 616 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2010). That said, the Ninth Circuit recently held that students should be able to bring First Amendment challenges to a decision to remove material from the curriculum, and that the key test should be whether the decision was “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 983 (9th Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">3. Remember that the Free Speech clause is not the only potential legal basis for a challenge to a school’s curricular or textbook decisions. Indeed, in <i>Arce</i> itself—discussed further below—the student plaintiffs (along with their teachers) also brought an Equal Protection challenge to the curricular change at issue.</p>
<p class="indent">4. States have different processes for textbook selection. A 2011 study found that of the 50 states, 29 states leave the decision to the individual school districts, 12 states produce recommended but not mandatory lists of textbooks (as does Texas), and 8 states have mandatory lists from which school districts must choose. Hawaii was not included in the study because it has only one school district, which is state-run. The study further found that “state book lists are less likely 1) in more educated states, where voters are better able to select the most appropriate textbook, 2) in states with smaller school districts, where voters are more involved in the schools, and 3) in states with stronger teacher unions, giving teachers more power in textbook selection.” Michelle Phillips, <i>State Involvement in Limiting Textbook Choice by School Districts</i> (Oct. 20, 2011), <i>available at</i> <a href="http://www.phillipsmichelle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/phillipsjmpoct20.pdf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://www.phillipsmichelle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/phillipsjmpoct20.pdf</a>. Which process do you think makes the most sense?</p>
<p class="indent">5. In 2010, Texas’s education standards again made news when the Texas State Board of Education approved new social studies standards after a divided board vote that largely tracked party lines. One such standard stated that students should “examine the reasons the Founding Fathers protected religious freedom in America and guaranteed its free exercise by saying that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and compare and contrast this to the phrase ‘separation of church and state.’ ” Another such standard stated that students should “discuss the solvency of long term entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.” Because textbook publishers hoping to have their books adopted in Texas use these standards as guidelines, and because Texas is such a large purchaser of books, some commentators predicted that these guidelines would have a ripple effect beyond Texas.</p>
<div class="line" />
<p class="indent">In addition to Free Speech claims, challenges to textbook and curricular decisions can come from other constitutional and statutory bases. The final cases in this section illustrate two such challenges, one from the Establishment Clause and one from the Equal Protection Clause combined with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p><a id="page_910" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>910</b></a></p>
<p class="h5" id="ch350">Edwards v. Aguillard</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>482 U.S. 578 (1987)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Brennan</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">The question for decision is whether Louisiana’s “Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction” Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Creationism Act forbids the teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools unless accompanied by instruction in “creation science.” No school is required to teach evolution or creation science. If either is taught, however, the other must also be taught. The theories of evolution and creation science are statutorily defined as “the scientific evidences for [creation or evolution] and inferences from those scientific evidences.”</p>
<p class="indent">Appellees, who include parents of children attending Louisiana public schools, Louisiana teachers, and religious leaders, challenged the constitutionality of the Act in District Court, seeking an injunction and declaratory relief. Appellants, Louisiana officials charged with implementing the Act, defended on the ground that the purpose of the Act is to protect a legitimate secular interest, namely, academic freedom. Appellees attacked the Act as facially invalid because it violated the Establishment Clause and made a motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals affirmed [and we] now affirm.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” The Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause. First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a secular purpose. Second, the statute’s principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion. <i>Lemon.</i> State action violates the Establishment Clause if it fails to satisfy any of these prongs.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools. Families entrust public schools with the education of their children, but condition their trust on the understanding that the classroom will not purposely be used to advance religious views that may conflict with the private beliefs of the student and his or her family. Students in such institutions are impressionable and their attendance is involuntary. The State exerts great authority and coercive power through mandatory attendance requirements, and because of the students’ emulation of teachers as role models and the children’s susceptibility to peer pressure. Therefore, in employing the three-pronged <i>Lemon</i> test, we must do so mindful</p>
<p><a id="page_911" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>911</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of the particular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Lemon</i>’s first prong focuses on the purpose that animated adoption of the Act. “The purpose prong of the <i>Lemon</i> test asks whether government’s actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion.”</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, appellants have identified no clear secular purpose for the Louisiana Act. True, the Act’s stated purpose is to protect academic freedom. This phrase might, in common parlance, be understood as referring to enhancing the freedom of teachers to teach what they will. The Court of Appeals, however, correctly concluded that the Act was not designed to further that goal. Even if “academic freedom” is read to mean “teaching all of the evidence” with respect to the origin of human beings, the Act does not further this purpose. The goal of providing a more comprehensive science curriculum is not furthered either by outlawing the teaching of evolution or by requiring the teaching of creation science.</p>
<p class="indent">While the Court is normally deferential to a State’s articulation of a secular purpose, it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham. It is clear from the legislative history that the purpose of the legislative sponsor, Senator Bill Keith, was to narrow the science curriculum. During the legislative hearings, Senator Keith stated: “My preference would be that neither [creationism nor evolution] be taught.” Such a ban on teaching does not promote—indeed, it undermines—the provision of a comprehensive scientific education.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, the goal of basic “fairness” is hardly furthered by the Act’s discriminatory preference for the teaching of creation science and against the teaching of evolution. While requiring that curriculum guides be developed for creation science, the Act says nothing of comparable guides for evolution. Similarly, resource services are supplied for creation science but not for evolution. Only “creation scientists” can serve on the panel that supplies the resource services. The Act forbids school boards to discriminate against anyone who “chooses to be a creation-scientist” or to teach “creationism,” but fails to protect those who choose to teach evolution or any other noncreation science theory, or who refuse to teach creation science.</p>
<p class="indent">If the Louisiana Legislature’s purpose was solely to maximize the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of science instruction, it would have encouraged the teaching of all scientific theories about the origins of humankind. But under the Act’s requirements, teachers who were once free to teach any and all facets of this subject are now unable to do so. Moreover, the Act fails even to ensure that creation science will be taught, but instead requires the teaching of this theory only when the theory of evolution is taught. Thus we agree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the Act does not serve to protect academic freedom, but has the distinctly different purpose of discrediting “evolution by counterbalancing its teaching at every turn with the teaching of creationism.”</p>
<p><a id="page_912" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>912</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to advance a particular religious belief, the Act endorses religion in violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Justice Scalia vigorously dissented in <i>Edwards</i>, describing it as “extraordinary to invalidate the Balanced Treatment Act for lack of a valid secular purpose.” He observed:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">If one adopts the obviously intended meaning of the statutory term “academic freedom,” there is no basis whatever for concluding that the purpose they express is a “sham.” To the contrary, the Act pursues that purpose plainly and consistently. It requires that, whenever the subject of origins is covered, evolution be “taught as a theory, rather than as proven scientific fact” and that scientific evidence inconsistent with the theory of evolution (viz., “creation science”) be taught as well. Living up to its title of “<i>Balanced Treatment</i> for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act,” it treats the teaching of creation the same way. It does <i>not</i> mandate instruction in creation science, <i>forbids</i> teachers to present creation science as proven scientific fact,” and <i>bans</i> the teaching of creation science unless the theory is (to use the Court’s terminology) “discredit[ed]‘…at every turn’ ” with the teaching of evolution.”</p>

<p class="indent">2. Do you agree with the <i>Edwards</i> Court’s suggestion that its Establishment Clause analysis should take into consideration “the particular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and secondary schools”? How did the Court characterize those concerns, and do you agree?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Questions about the teaching of evolution reemerged in <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</i>, 400 F. Supp. 2d 707 (M.D. Pa. 2005). There, the Dover Area School Board passed a resolution that “[s]tudents will be made aware of gaps/problems in Darwin’s theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design.” Pursuant to this resolution, teachers were required to read the following statement to students in ninth-grade biology class:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="indent">The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin’s Theory of Evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part.</p>
<p class="indent">Because Darwin’s Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The Theory is not a fact. Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no evidence. A theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations.</p>
<p class="indent">Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin’s view. The reference book, Of Pandas and People, is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind. The school leaves the discussion of the Origins of Life to individual students and their families. As a Standards-driven district, class instruction focuses upon preparing students to achieve proficiency on Standards-based assessments.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">Several Dover residents filed suit, alleging that the resolution violated the Establishment Clause. The district court agreed, applying the endorsement test</p>
<p><a id="page_913" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>913</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">and holding that Intelligent Design—which holds that “nature must have had an intelligent designer,” but does not explicitly state that the designer must have been God—is a form of creationism and that an objective Dover High School ninth grader would view the above statement “as a strong official endorsement of religion.” The court added that it did “not question that many of the leading advocates of ID [Intelligent Design] have bona bide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors,” and that “ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed,” but that at present, it was “unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom.”</p>
<p class="indent">Shortly after the decision came out, the school board members who had voted in favor of this policy lost to challengers who opposed the policy. The school board therefore did not appeal the ruling.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the Establishment Clause, antidiscrimination law—at both the constitutional and statutory levels—provides another potential source of challenges to textbook and curricular decisions. In the following case, a group of African American students challenged a district’s decision to include, in the freshman English class, two well-known literary works that repeatedly used racial slurs. Such conflicts, as you will see, pose difficult questions about how to balance the school district’s curricular autonomy with the various student interests involved.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch351">Monteiro v. Tempe Union High School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>158 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 1998)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Reinhardt</span>, Circuit Judge:</p>
<p class="indent">More and more frequently we are faced with cases in which two fundamental constitutional rights appear to be at odds. At such times, the job of federal judges is particularly difficult. Here, we confront a case presenting some elements of such a clash. The setting is a freshman English class in Tempe, Arizona, and the competing interests are the First Amendment rights of high school students to receive information or ideas—even when contained in literary works that may in today’s world appear to have racist overtones—and the rights of those same students to receive a public education that neither fosters nor acquiesces in a racially hostile environment.</p>
<p class="indent">Jane Doe was a student in a freshman English class at McClintock High School, which is part of the defendant Tempe Unified Union High School District (“School District”). The class’ required reading included two classic literary works—the novel <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,</i> by Mark Twain, and the short story <i>A Rose for Emily,</i> by William Faulkner. The complaint, brought on Doe’s behalf by her mother, Kathy Monteiro, alleged that each of these literary works “contains repeated use of the profane, insulting and racially derogatory term ‘nigger.’ ” It also alleged that neither work is a necessary component of a freshman English class and that none of the assignments in the curriculum refers to Caucasians in a derogatory manner.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the complaint, Doe and other similarly situated African-American students suffered psychological injuries and lost educational</p>
<p><a id="page_914" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>914</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">opportunities due to the required reading of the literary works. The complaint alleged that the School District had notice that Doe suffered these injuries but refused to offer a remedy other than to allow her to study alone in the library while the works were being discussed in class. It further alleged that the assignment of the literary works “created and contributed to a racially hostile educational environment,” including increased racial harassment by other students. Finally, it alleged that by its conduct the School District intentionally discriminated against Doe.</p>
<p class="indent">In her complaint, Monteiro sought a declaratory judgment, urging that the conduct of the School District violated Doe’s rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She also requested a temporary and permanent injunction “prohibiting [the defendants] from committing similar unlawful acts in the future.” Monteiro did not, however, seek the exclusion of the literary works from a voluntary reading list or from inclusion in classroom discussions in which Jane Doe and other African American students [are] <i>not</i> held as a captive student audience or consigned to a separate and unequal educational environment.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Monteiro’s amended complaint alleges violations of the Equal Protection clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We have held that §1983 claims based on Equal Protection violations must plead intentional unlawful discrimination or allege facts that are at least susceptible of an inference of discriminatory intent. Under Title VI, however, we have required only that the complaint allege that the defendant is engaging in discrimination, although a showing of intent is necessary at trial.</p>
<p class="indent">Title VI provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under and program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">A significant portion of the amended complaint, like the original, is based on the District’s assignment of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>A Rose for Emily</i> as required reading and its subsequent refusal to remove them from the mandatory curriculum. We consider here whether the District’s conduct, the requirement that students read books that were determined by the appropriate school authorities to have educational value, and the refusal to remove those books from a mandatory curriculum, can form the basis for a complaint alleging discriminatory conduct under the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI.</p>
<p class="indent">We approach this question in light of a number of considerations. The first is the threat to First Amendment freedoms posed by efforts to prevent school boards from assigning the reading of literary works on the ground that individuals or groups may find the contents injurious or offensive. The second is the broad discretion afforded school boards to establish curricula they believe to be appropriate to the educational needs of their students. The third is the awareness that words can hurt, particularly</p>
<p><a id="page_915" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>915</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">in the case of children, and that words of a racist nature can hurt especially severely. The fourth is the knowledge that the historic prejudice against African-Americans that has existed in this nation since its inception has not yet been eradicated—by any means. The fifth is the requirement that young African-Americans, like all students, be afforded a public education free from racially discriminatory conduct on the part of educational authorities.</p>
<p class="indent">The Supreme Court has addressed on a number of occasions the balancing of a school’s discretion in determining educational matters with a students’ First Amendment rights. <i>See, e.g., Hazelwood, Fraser, Pico.</i> In doing so, the Court has recognized that school boards generally retain a broad discretion in managing school affairs, but it has also consistently noted that the school board’s discretion “in matters of education must be exercised in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment.”</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the cases cited above, the case before us does not involve an action taken by a school board that arguably abridges the First Amendment rights of its students. Instead, it is a third party, a parent or a class of parents, that seeks to limit the educational materials the school officials may furnish to the students—and require them to read. Here we consider whether the school board’s interest in exercising its broad discretion in assigning the literary works in question and the students’ First Amendment interest in reading those works are collectively outweighed by the constitutional and statutory interests of students who assert that they are injured by the mandatory assignments. To resolve this controversy, we must consider whether the assignment of material deemed to have educational value by school authorities may in itself serve as the basis for an injunction by a court or an award of damages, when the challenge to the material is founded on its message or the language it employs.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note84" id="Rnote84" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></sup> In other words, may courts ban books or other literary works from school curricula on the basis of their content? We answer that question in the negative, even when the works are accused of being racist in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="indent">To begin with, Monteiro’s amended complaint—and other lawsuits threatening to attach civil liability on the basis of the assignment of a book—would severely restrict a student’s right to receive material that his school board or other educational authority determines to be of legitimate educational value. Certainly when a school board identifies information that it believes to be a useful part of a student’s education, that student has the right to receive the information.</p>
<p class="indent">Were the plaintiff to succeed in this litigation or even to succeed in forcing the defendants to engage in a trial over such well-established literary works, the threat of future litigation would inevitably lead many school districts to “buy their peace” by avoiding the use of books or other materials that express messages—or simply use terms—that could be argued to cause harm to a group of students.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not surprising that this conflict arises over <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. According to the American Library Association, Twain’s slim volume describing the effects</p>
<p><a id="page_916" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>916</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">of racism and slavery in antebellum society is the most frequently banned book in the United States, as well as one of the nation’s most respected literary works. Black parents all over the country have asserted, as does Monteiro, that the book’s use of the word “nigger” some 215 times “has a negative effect on the self-esteem of young black students” and that it therefore “has no place in the classroom.” <i>See</i> Dan Cryer, <i>Why Is Huck So Controversial?,</i> Newsday, Oct. 15, 1996, at A33. Recent years have seen efforts to remove the work from libraries and reading lists in school districts in a number of states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California, as well as Arizona. Although some districts voted to retain the book, many others have removed it from the curriculum due to concerns about the use of racial stereotypes and epithets.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, of course, an extremely wide—if not unlimited—range of literary products that might be considered injurious or offensive, particularly when one considers that high school students frequently take Advanced Placement courses that are equivalent to college-level courses. White plaintiffs could seek to remove books by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, and other prominent Black authors on the ground that they portray Caucasians in a derogatory fashion; Jews might try to impose civil liability for the teachings of Shakespeare and of more modern English poets where writings exhibit a similar anti-Semitic strain. Female students could attempt to make a case for damages for the assignment of some of the works of Tennessee Williams, Hemingway, or Freud, and male students for the writings of Andrea Dworkin or Margaret Atwood.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note85" id="Rnote85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></sup> The number of potential lawsuits that could arise from the highly varied educational curricula throughout the nation might well be unlimited and unpredictable. Many school districts would undoubtedly prefer to “steer far” from any controversial book and instead substitute “safe” ones in order to reduce the possibility of civil liability and the expensive and time-consuming burdens of a lawsuit—even one having but a slight chance of success. In short, permitting lawsuits against school districts on the basis of the content of literary works to proceed past the complaint stage could have a significant chilling effect on a school district’s willingness to assign books with themes, characters, snippets of dialogue, or words that might offend the sensibilities of any number of persons or groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, any school board attempting to remove books from its curriculum on the ground that the works might offend would likely be vulnerable to First Amendment actions brought by students desiring to study those books, and possibly teachers, as well. Schools could be caught between those seeking to remove <i>Huckleberry Finn and</i> those seeking to study it. It would clearly not be in the best interests of our public education system and its students to have such competing lawsuits become a part of our legal landscape.</p>
<p><a id="page_917" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>917</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, as we said at the outset, there are important countervailing considerations that also must be weighed. We are aware that books can hurt, and that words can hurt—particularly racist epithets. We also recognize that the younger a person is, the more likely it is that those messages will help form that person’s thinking, and that the feelings of minority students, especially younger ones, are extremely vulnerable when it comes to books that are racist or have racist overtones. Nevertheless, for our courts or even our school boards to prohibit the assignment of literary works that may in some respects be racially offensive is simply not the proper solution.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the fact that a student is required to read a book does not mean that he is being asked to agree with what is in it. It cannot be disputed that a necessary component of any education is learning to think critically about offensive ideas—without that ability one can do little to respond to them. Second, it is important for young people to learn about the past—and to discover both the good and the bad in our history. Third, if all books with messages that might be deemed harmful were removed, the number of “acceptable” works might be highly limited. Next, we reject the notion that putting books on trial in our courts is the proper way to determine the appropriateness of their use in the classroom. Such judgments are ordinarily best left to school boards and educational officials charged with educating young people and determining which education materials are appropriate for which students, and under what circumstances. Therefore, although we recognize that books—and words—are powerful tools that can convey extremely injurious messages, we conclude that the assignment of a literary work determined to have intrinsic educational value by the duly authorized school authorities cannot constitute the type of discriminatory conduct prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI, regardless of the fact that the work may be deemed to contain racist ideas or language.</p>
<p class="indent">We do not, of course, suggest that racist actions on the part of teachers implementing a curriculum could not comprise discriminatory conduct for the purposes of Title VI or the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor do we preclude the prosecution of actions alleging that schools have pursued policies that serve to promote racist attitudes among their students, or have sought to indoctrinate their young charges with racist concepts. We conclude only that allegations that a school required that a book be read, and then refused to remove it from the curriculum, fails to provide the basis for a claim of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI, even when the school district is also accused of a failure to take steps to remedy a hostile racial environment. It is simply not the role of courts to serve as literary censors or to make judgments as to whether reading particular books does students more harm than good.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. If you were on a school board or otherwise in a policymaking role for a school, would you include books like <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> in the curriculum? What are the arguments for and against including books that are</p>
<p><a id="page_918" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>918</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">considered “classics,” but that also include racial slurs or other racially hostile language or concepts, in the classroom experience?</p>
<p class="indent">2. The amended complaint in <i>Monteiro</i> apparently stated that the plaintiffs were not seeking to have the challenged books altogether removed from the classroom, but simply seeking to opt out from attending classes in which they were taught. This, however, did not change the court’s analysis. You will see further “opt out” cases in Section C of this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The <i>Monteiro</i> court indicated that “racist actions on the part of teachers implementing a curriculum” could give rise to a viable Equal Protection claim. In <i>Arce v. Douglas</i>, 793 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2015), the Ninth Circuit confronted a related issue—but in terms of legislators’, rather than teachers’, intentions. The Tucson Unified School District, the majority of whose student body is of Mexican or Hispanic descent, adopted a Mexican American Studies program in 1998. Over the next decade, political opposition to the program developed in the state, and in 2010, the Arizona legislature passed a statute, H.B. 2281, that prohibited school districts and charter schools from including any courses or classes that, among other things, were “designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group” or “advocate[d] ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of individuals.” It was clear that the statute was enacted with Tucson’s Mexican American Studies program in mind, and it was the first and only ethnic studies program found in violation of the statute.</p>
<p class="indent">A group of teachers and students sued, and the Ninth Circuit recently concluded that there was enough evidence to hold a trial on the plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim. The court explained that although the statute was facially neutral, it had a disparate impact on Mexican American and other Hispanic students, and that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it had been enacted with discriminatory intent.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch352">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The West Dakota School District uses an Internet-filtering system called SafeChild on all computers that its students can use at school—in classrooms, in computer labs, and at the library—to access the Internet. The system blocks students from seeing websites that fall into the categories of “advertisements,” “pornography,” and “sexuality.” Because of the way that the SafeChild filtering system works, most websites expressing a positive viewpoint toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals are systematically blocked because they get caught in the “sexuality” filter. By contrast, a larger percentage of websites that include a negative viewpoint toward LGBT individuals remain accessible to students because they do not get caught in SafeChild’s sexuality filter.</p>
<p class="indent">A group of high school parents, advised by an outside advocacy group, complained to the school district about SafeChild and pointed out the issue. They also submitted a letter from an outside librarian who stated that SafeChild failed to meet professional standards of librarianship, and that there were other filtering systems that did a better job of distinguishing between pornographic</p>
<p><a id="page_919" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>919</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">material and all pro-LGBT material. At a school board meeting, the issue was briefly discussed. One board member stated that he was concerned about letting students access, without parental consent, websites indicating that it was “okay to be gay.”</p>
<p class="indent">After a vote, the board members decided to leave the system in place, noting that they needed to comply with the Children’s Internet Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. §254(h)(6)(B)(i) (2006), under which schools must enforce “a policy of Internet safety for minors that includes monitoring the online activities of minors and the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions that are (I) obscene; (II) child pornography; or (III) harmful to minors.”</p>
<p class="indent">The group of parents, on behalf of their high school children, have now filed suit, alleging that the school district’s continued use of SafeChild violates their children’s First Amendment rights. How do you think the case is likely to come out?</p>
<p class="h3" id="ch353">B. PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS’ RIGHT TO SPEAK IN THE CLASSROOM</p>
<p class="noindent">The above section explored the limits of school boards’ discretion to make curriculum-related choices for their districts. What happens if a schoolteacher wants to diverge from those choices in some way? Does she possess First Amendment speech rights—in other words, a certain sphere of academic freedom—to adopt teaching methodologies and materials of her own choosing?</p>
<p class="indent">In the early 1990s, a circuit split developed over which line of Supreme Court cases governed that question. Some circuits applied <i>Hazelwood</i>’s “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical purposes” standard to disputes in which a teacher was disciplined for her in-class speech (regardless of whether the speech reflected a conscious curricular choice or was more of a stray remark). In other words, if the school’s disciplinary response could be considered reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns, it was upheld; if not, it was held to violate the First Amendment.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note86" id="Rnote86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></sup> Other circuits, meanwhile, applied the speech framework that the Supreme Court had generally developed for speech claims brought by government employees. Under this framework, which emerged from <i>Pickering v. Board of Education</i>, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), and <i>Connick v. Myers</i>, 491 U.S. 138 (1983), courts analyzing a government employee’s First Amendment claim that she was disciplined for her speech first consider whether the employee was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern. If not, the First Amendment</p>
<p><a id="page_920" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>920</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">claim immediately fails. If so, a court must then evaluate whether the employee’s First Amendment interest in making the speech outweighed the employer’s justification for limiting it, in a test known as “<i>Pickering</i> balancing.” Courts applying this test to teachers’ classroom speech included the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note87" id="Rnote87" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Much of the difficulty stemmed from the fact that neither <i>Hazelwood</i> nor <i>Pickering-Connick</i> perfectly addressed the unique status of teachers’ classroom speech. <i>Hazelwood</i> was a student speech case, and its rationale was articulated in that context. Meanwhile, the <i>Pickering-Connick</i> two-pronged framework forced courts first to decide whether a teacher speaking in the classroom was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern, or as an employee on a matter of nonpublic concern. Given that a teacher’s role as an employee is often to speak in the classroom on matters of public concern, cases involving teachers’ classroom speech did not neatly fall on either side of this line.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2006, some of the confusion lifted when the Supreme Court decided <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos</i>, which involved a government employee who was allegedly punished for speech that he engaged in <i>as an employee</i> on a matter of public concern. As you will see, <i>Garcetti</i> held that the primary question here is whether the plaintiff was speaking as a citizen or as an employee. Since the plaintiff had been speaking as an employee, his speech was unprotected by the First Amendment, regardless of whether it was on a matter of public concern. Although <i>Garcetti</i> did not itself involve a teacher’s classroom speech, it had obvious implications for that issue.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch354">Garcetti v. Ceballos</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>547 U.S. 410 (2006)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Kennedy</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p class="indent">It is well settled that “a State cannot condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee’s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression.” The question presented by the instant case is whether the First Amendment protects a government employee from discipline based on speech made pursuant to the employee’s official duties.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">Respondent Richard Ceballos has been employed since 1989 as a deputy district attorney for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. During the period relevant to this case, Ceballos was a calendar deputy in the office’s Pomona branch, and in this capacity he exercised certain supervisory responsibilities over other lawyers. In February 2000, a defense attorney contacted Ceballos about a pending criminal case. The defense attorney said there were</p>
<p><a id="page_921" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>921</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">inaccuracies in an affidavit used to obtain a critical search warrant. The attorney informed Ceballos that he had filed a motion to traverse, or challenge, the warrant, but he also wanted Ceballos to review the case. According to Ceballos, it was not unusual for defense attorneys to ask calendar deputies to investigate aspects of pending cases.</p>
<p class="indent">After examining the affidavit and visiting the location it described, Ceballos determined the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="indent">Ceballos spoke on the telephone to the warrant affiant, a deputy sheriff from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, but he did not receive a satisfactory explanation for the perceived inaccuracies. He relayed his findings to his supervisors, petitioners Carol Najera and Frank Sundstedt, and followed up by preparing a disposition memorandum.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on Ceballos’ statements, a meeting was held to discuss the affidavit. The meeting allegedly became heated, with one lieutenant sharply criticizing Ceballos for his handling of the case.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite Ceballos’ concerns, Sundstedt decided to proceed with the prosecution, pending disposition of the defense motion to traverse. The trial court held a hearing on the motion. Ceballos was called by the defense and recounted his observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge to the warrant.</p>
<p class="indent">Ceballos claims that in the aftermath of these events he was subjected to a series of retaliatory employment actions. The actions included reassignment from his calendar deputy position to a trial deputy position, transfer to another courthouse, and denial of a promotion. Ceballos [filed suit, alleging that] petitioners violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by retaliating against him based on his memo.</p>
<p class="indent">Petitioners contended that, in any event, Ceballos’ memo was not protected speech under the First Amendment. Petitioners moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted their motion.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that “Ceballos’s allegations of wrongdoing in the memorandum constitute protected speech under the First Amendment.”</p>
<p class="indent">We granted certiorari, and we now reverse.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">As the Court’s decisions have noted, for many years “the unchallenged dogma was that a public employee had no right to object to conditions placed upon the terms of employment—including those which restricted the exercise of constitutional rights.” That dogma has been qualified in important respects. The Court has made clear that public employees do not surrender all their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment. Rather, the First Amendment protects a public employee’s right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Pickering</i> provides a useful starting point in explaining the Court’s doctrine. There the relevant speech was a teacher’s letter to a local newspaper addressing issues including the funding policies of his school board. “The problem in any</p>
<p><a id="page_922" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>922</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">case,” the Court stated, “is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.” The Court found the teacher’s speech “neither [was] shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher’s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally.” Thus, the Court concluded that “the interest of the school administration in limiting teachers’ opportunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public.”</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Pickering</i> and the cases decided in its wake identify two inquiries to guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded to public employee speech. The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer’s reaction to the speech. If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises. The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public. This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker’s expressions and employment. A government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as employer, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect the entity’s operations.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="indent">With these principles in mind we turn to the instant case. Respondent Ceballos believed the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained serious misrepresentations. He conveyed his opinion and recommendation in a memo to his supervisor. That Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, is not dispositive. Employees in some cases may receive First Amendment protection for expressions made at work. Many citizens do much of their talking inside their respective workplaces, and it would not serve the goal of treating public employees like “any member of the general public,” to hold that all speech within the office is automatically exposed to restriction.</p>
<p class="indent">The memo concerned the subject matter of Ceballos’ employment, but this, too, is nondispositive. The First Amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker’s job. As the Court noted in <i>Pickering:</i> “Teachers are, as a class, the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.” The same is true of many other categories of public employees.</p>
<p class="indent">The controlling factor in Ceballos’ case is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy. That consideration—the fact that Ceballos spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling a responsibility to advise his supervisor</p>
<p><a id="page_923" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>923</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">about how best to proceed with a pending case—distinguishes Ceballos’ case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline. We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.</p>
<p class="indent">Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do. It is immaterial whether he experienced some personal gratification from writing the memo; his First Amendment rights do not depend on his job satisfaction. The significant point is that the memo was written pursuant to Ceballos’ official duties. Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee’s professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen. It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created. Contrast, for example, the expressions made by the speaker in <i>Pickering</i>, whose letter to the newspaper had no official significance and bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day.</p>
<p class="indent">Ceballos did not act as a citizen when he went about conducting his daily professional activities, such as supervising attorneys, investigating charges, and preparing filings. In the same way he did not speak as a citizen by writing a memo that addressed the proper disposition of a pending criminal case. When he went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform, Ceballos acted as a government employee. The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.</p>
<p class="indent">This result is consistent with our precedents’ attention to the potential societal value of employee speech. Refusing to recognize First Amendment claims based on government employees’ work product does not prevent them from participating in public debate. The employees retain the prospect of constitutional protection for their contributions to the civic discourse. This prospect of protection, however, does not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.</p>
<p class="indent">Our holding likewise is supported by the emphasis of our precedents on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations. Employers have heightened interests in controlling speech made by an employee in his or her professional capacity. Official communications have official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity. Supervisors must ensure that their employees’ official communications are accurate, demonstrate sound judgment, and promote the employer’s mission. Ceballos’ memo is illustrative. It demanded the attention of his supervisors and led to a heated meeting with employees from the sheriff’s department. If Ceballos’ superiors thought his memo was inflammatory ormisguided, they had the authority to take proper corrective action.</p>
<p class="indent">When an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a matter of public concern, the First Amendment requires a delicate balancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences. When, however, the employee is simply performing his or her job duties, there is no warrant for a</p>
<p><a id="page_924" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>924</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">similar degree of scrutiny. To hold otherwise would be to demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.</p>
<p class="indent">Proper application of our precedents thus leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee’s expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities. Because Ceballos’ memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.</p>
<p class="indent">Two final points warrant mentioning. First, as indicated above, the parties in this case do not dispute that Ceballos wrote his disposition memo pursuant to his employment duties. We thus have no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee’s duties in cases where there is room for serious debate. We reject, however, the suggestion that employers can restrict employees’ rights by creating excessively broad job descriptions.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, Justice Souter suggests today’s decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom, at least as a constitutional value. There is some argument that expression related to academic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests that are not fully accounted for by this Court’s customary employee-speech jurisprudence. We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Justice Souter</span>, with whom <span class="smallcap">Justice Stevens</span> and <span class="smallcap">Justice Ginsburg</span> join, dissenting.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court holds that “when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.” This ostensible domain beyond the pale of the First Amendment is spacious enough to include even the teaching of a public university professor, and I have to hope that today’s majority does not mean to imperil First Amendment protection of academic freedom in public colleges and universities, whose teachers necessarily speak and write “pursuant to…official duties.”</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Why did the Supreme Court hold that Ceballos’ speech was unprotected here? On which prong of the <i>Pickering-Connick</i> test did he lose?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How did the majority opinion distinguish between Ceballos’s speech and Pickering’s speech? Why did the latter deserve more protection?</p>
<p class="indent">3. <i>Garcetti</i> was a very close case. It had to be reargued after Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s retirement because, without her, the Supreme Court was split 4-4. After Justice Alito joined the Court and the case was reargued, the Court ultimately ruled against Ceballos by a 5-4 vote. Do you find Justice Kennedy’s overall approach convincing, or do you think it provides too little protection for government employees’ speech?</p>
<p><a id="page_925" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>925</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">As Justice Souter pointed out in dissent, <i>Garcetti</i>’s holding suggested that even public university professors—who, after all, have job responsibilities that typically include speaking and writing about issues of public concern—might not have their academic speech protected by the First Amendment. In response, Justice Kennedy explicitly declined to reach the question of how <i>Garcetti</i> applied “to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.”</p>
<p class="indent">Courts have been reading this carve-out, however, as applying only at the university level, not to public K-12 teachers. Moreover, at least one circuit that had previously been applying <i>Hazelwood</i> to teachers’ classroom speech has now shifted to the <i>Pickering-Connick-Garcetti</i> framework.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note88" id="Rnote88" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></sup> The upshot is that under current law, teachers have very little constitutional protection for their classroom speech. While tenured teachers may nonetheless enjoy strong job security under the applicable state tenure rules, untenured teachers whose only source of protection is the First Amendment are vulnerable here, as illustrated by the following case.</p>
<p class="h5" id="ch355">Evans-Marshall v. Board of Education of the Tipp City Exempted Village School District</p>
<p class="h5a"><i>624 F.3d 332 (6th Cir. 2010)</i></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Sutton</span>, Circuit Judge.</p>
<p class="indent">Does a public high school teacher have a First (and Fourteenth) Amendment right “to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials”? Yes, says the teacher, Shelley Evans-Marshall. No, says the Tipp City Board of Education. Because the right to free speech protected by the First Amendment does not extend to the in-class speech of teachers in primary and secondary schools made “pursuant to” their official duties, <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> we affirm the judgment rejecting this claim as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">I</span></p>
<p class="indent">In 2000, the Tipp City Board of Education hired Evans-Marshall to teach English and to supervise Tippecanoe High School’s literary magazine, BirchBark, for the 2000-2001 school year. The Board renewed her contract for the 2001-2002 school year, when Evans-Marshall taught English to 9th and 11th grade students and a creative writing course to 11th and 12th grade students. At the beginning of the fall semester, Evans-Marshall assigned Ray Bradbury’s <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> to her 9th graders. To the end of exploring the book’s theme of government censorship, she distributed a list compiled by the American Library Association of the “100 Most Frequently Challenged Books.” Students divided into groups, and Evans-Marshall asked each group to pick a book from the list, to investigate the reasons why the book was challenged and to lead an in-class</p>
<p><a id="page_926" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>926</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">debate about the book. Two groups chose <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> by Leslea Newman.</p>
<p class="indent">A parent complained about <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i>, and the principal, Charles Wray, asked Evans-Marshall to tell the students to choose a different book. She complied, explaining to her class that “they were in a unique position to…use this experience as source material for their debate because they were in the…position of having actually experienced censorship in preparing to debate censorship.” After the class completed the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> unit, Evans-Marshall assigned <i>Siddhartha</i> by Hermann Hesse and used it as the basis for in-class discussions about “spirituality, Buddhism, romantic relationships, personal growth, [and] familial relationships.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the October 2001 meeting of the school board, twenty-five or so parents complained about the curricular choices in the schools, including <i>Siddhartha</i> and the book-censorship assignment. The next day, Principal Wray called a meeting of the English department and told Evans-Marshall that she was “on the hot seat.” Nearly 100 parents, as well as the local news media, attended the board’s November meeting. For over an hour, parents expressed concerns about books in the curriculum and in the school libraries. While the parents mentioned many books, they raised particular objections to the materials in Evans-Marshall’s classroom and her teaching methods. Superintendent John Zigler explained that the school board had purchased many of the materials, including <i>Siddhartha</i>, several years before, making it difficult to criticize Evans-Marshall for teaching a book the school board had bought. “You should be embarrassed,” one parent responded, referring to the explicit language and sexual themes in the book. Another parent complained that she had asked for an alternative assignment—instead of <i>Siddhartha—and</i> “was given three books,” two of which “were for a four-to-eight year old.” “I’m not going to put my daughter through this,” the parent added, explaining that she thought Evans-Marshall was “punish[ing] my daughter.” A group of parents presented the board with a 500-signature petition calling for “decency and excellence” in the classroom.</p>
<p class="indent">The meeting was not one-sided. A member of the board—a parent himself—warned that the school district’s policies about potentially objectionable material “have to be well thought out because what you might find offensive, I might not.” Another board member reminded the group that, as elected officials, the board “must walk the middle of the road to some extent,” even if the community might “err…on the conservative side.” And a parent who made a formal statement said that he “[did not] condone” the behavior of some of the more vocal parents and trusted that school officials “want what’s best for our kids.”</p>
<p class="indent">The matter did not end there. In teaching creative writing, Evans-Marshall maintained a file of student writing samples that she shared with students who asked for additional guidance on assignments. Running low on copies of some of the samples, she sent three of them to support staff to be copied. A member of the copy room staff, apparently not a friend, showed the writing samples to Wray, saying he “ought to read this.” After reading the papers, Wray called Evans-Marshall to his office. When she arrived, he waved two of the writing samples in his hand, one a first-hand account of a rape, the other a story about a young boy</p>
<p><a id="page_927" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>927</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">who murdered a priest and desecrated a church. “[A]re you going to use these in class after everything that’s happened?” he shouted. Marshall explained that the writing samples were not intended for in-class distribution and that she would refrain from sharing the papers if he wanted. Wray said that he did not like the materials she was using in her classroom or the themes of her in-class discussions and that he “intended to rei[n] it in.”</p>
<p class="indent">The two soon had another argument in the school library about Evans-Marshall’s plans to give a final exam involving group discussions and student self-evaluations. Evans-Marshall asked Wray to give her a model exam so she could “give [him] back exactly what [he] want[ed],” prompting Wray to call her a “smart a—.” The next day, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about Wray’s behavior. Zigler told her to meet with Wray after the semester break to work things out and offered to speak with Wray in the meantime. He also said that she should feel free to file a formal grievance if things had not been worked out by January.</p>
<p class="indent">Things did not work out by January. Wray and Evans-Marshall talked, but they fell back into the same channels of disagreement.</p>
<p class="indent">At its March 2002 meeting, the school board voted unanimously not to renew Evans-Marshall’s contract. She requested an explanation, and the school board sent her a letter on April 9, 2002, saying that her non-renewal was “due to problems with communication and teamwork.” At Evans-Marshall’s request, the board held a formal hearing about the employment decision. Principal Wray, Superintendent Zigler and Evans-Marshall all testified, and the board again voted unanimously not to renew her contract.…</p>
<p class="indent">In March 2003, Evans-Marshall filed this §1983 action against the school board, Wray and Zigler. She alleged that the school board and other defendants had retaliated against her “curricular and pedagogical choices,” infringing her First Amendment right “to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.” The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), but the district court held that Evans-Marshall had sufficiently alleged a First Amendment violation. We affirmed.</p>
<p class="indent">After discovery by both sides, the defendants again moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Supreme Court’s intervening decision in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos</i>, and the unrebutted facts gleaned from discovery foreclosed Evans-Marshall’s claim.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">This free-speech-retaliation case implicates two competing intuitions. On the one side, doesn’t a teacher have the First Amendment right to choose her own reading assignments, decide how they should be taught and above all be able to teach a unit on censorship without being censored or otherwise retaliated against? On the other side, doesn’t a school board have the final say over what is taught, and how, in the public schools for which it is responsible?</p>
<p class="indent">When government employees speak “pursuant to their official duties,” <i>Garcetti</i> teaches that they are “not speaking as citizens for First Amendment</p>
<p><a id="page_928" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>928</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">purposes.” Any dispute over the board’s motivations, <i>Pickering</i> balancing or the “public concerns” of her speech under <i>Connick</i> is beside the point if, as Evans-Marshall does not dispute, she made her curricular and pedagogical choices in connection with her official duties as a teacher.</p>
<p class="indent">In the light cast by <i>Garcetti</i>, it is clear that the First Amendment does not generally “insulate” Evans-Marshall “from employer discipline,” even discipline prompted by her curricular and pedagogical choices and even if it otherwise appears (at least on summary judgment) that the school administrators treated her shabbily. When a teacher teaches, “the school system does not ‘regulate’ [that] speech as much as it <i>hires</i> that speech. Expression is a teacher’s stock in trade, the commodity she sells to her employer in exchange for a salary.” And if it is the school board that hires that speech, it can surely “regulate the content of what is or is not expressed,” what is expressed in other words on its behalf. Only the school board has ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the classroom, legitimately giving it a say over what teachers may (or may not) teach in the classroom.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that teachers, like students, do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” But that does not transform them into the employee <i>and</i> employer when it comes to deciding what, when and how English is taught to fifteen-year-old students. Consider the difference between the speech of Evans-Marshall and Marvin Pickering, teachers both. When Pickering sent a letter to the local newspaper criticizing the school board, he said something that any citizen has a right to say, and he did it on his own time and in his own name, not on the school’s time or in its name. Yet when Evans-Marshall taught 9th grade English, she did something she was hired (and paid) to do, something she could not have done but for the Board’s decision to hire her as a public school teacher. As with any other individual in the community, she had no more free-speech right to dictate the school’s curriculum than she had to obtain a platform—a teaching position—in the first instance for communicating her preferred list of books and teaching methods. “[N]o relevant analogue” exists between her in-class curricular speech and speech by private citizens.</p>
<p class="indent">Teachers are not everyday citizens, Evans-Marshall insists, and they have a right “to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.” But that is not what Ohio law provides or the First Amendment requires. Start with Ohio law. Under it, “[t]he board of education of each city…shall prescribe a curriculum.” State law gives elected officials—the school board—not teachers, not the chair of a department, not the principal, not even the superintendent, responsibility over the curriculum. This is an accountability measure, pure and simple, one that ensures the citizens of a community have a say over a matter of considerable importance to many of them—their children’s education—by giving them control over membership on the board.</p>
<p class="indent">The First Amendment does not ban this policy choice or this accountability measure. The Constitution does not prohibit a State from creating elected school boards and from placing responsibility for the curriculum of each school district in the hands of each board. Teachers no doubt are “required…to speak or</p>
<p><a id="page_929" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>929</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">write” and otherwise express themselves, but this does not make them “sovereign[s] unto [themselves].” “The curricular choices of the schools should be presumptively their own—the fact that such choices arouse deep feelings argues strongly for democratic means of reaching them.”</p>
<p class="indent">How at any rate would a contrary approach work? If one teacher, Evans-Marshall, has a First Amendment right “to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom,” so presumably do other teachers. Evans-Marshall may wish to teach <i>Siddhartha</i> in the first unit of the school year in a certain way, but the chair of the English department may wish to use the limited time in a school year to teach <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> at that stage of the year. Maybe the head of the upper school has something else in mind. When educators disagree over what should be assigned, as is surely bound to happen if each of them has a First Amendment right to influence the curriculum, whose free-speech rights win? Why indeed doesn’t the principal, Wray, have a right to defend the discharge on the ground that he was merely exercising <i>his</i> First Amendment rights in rejecting Evans-Marshall’s curricular choices and methods of teaching? Placing the First Amendment’s stamp of approval on these kinds of debates not only would “demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations,” but it also would transform run-of-the-mill curricular disputes into constitutional stalemates.</p>
<p class="indent">That is not the only problem. What employer discipline arising from an employee’s manner of teaching—choices of books and the methods of teaching them—does not implicate speech? Could a teacher respond to a principal’s insistence that she discuss certain materials by claiming that it improperly <i>compels</i> speech? Could a teacher continue to assign materials that members of the community perceive as racially insensitive even after the principal tells her not to? Could a teacher raise a controversial topic (say, the virtues of one theory of government over another or the virtues of intelligent design) after a principal has told her not to? Could a teacher introduce mature sexual themes to fifteen year olds when discussing a work of literature after a principal has told her not to? And “[d]oes a music teacher retain veto power over that most controversial of school productions—the Holiday Concert?”</p>
<p class="indent">The key insight of <i>Garcetti</i> is that the First Amendment has nothing to say about these kinds of decisions. An employee does not lose “any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen” by signing on to work for the government, but by the same token, the government, just like a private employer, retains “control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created”: the employee’s job. And that insight has particular resonance in the context of public education. Every child in Ohio must attend school, providing public school teachers with a captive audience for their in-class speech, and providing a compelling reason for putting curricular choices in the hands of “someone [they] can vote out of office,” or who is otherwise democratically accountable.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor can Evans-Marshall sidestep this conclusion on the theory that <i>Garcetti</i> does not apply. In his dissent in <i>Garcetti</i>, as Evans-Marshall points out, Justice Souter raised concerns about the applicability of the decision to “academic freedom in public colleges and universities.” The majority disclaimed any intent to resolve the point.</p>
<p><a id="page_930" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>930</b></a></p>
<p class="indent"><i>Garcetti</i>’s caveat offers no refuge to Evans-Marshall. She is not a teacher at a “public college[]” or “university” and thus falls outside of the group the dissent wished to protect. The concept of “academic freedom,” moreover, does not readily apply to in-class curricular speech at the high school level. As a cultural and a legal principle, academic freedom “was conceived and implemented in the university” out of concern for “teachers who are also researchers or scholars—work not generally expected of elementary and secondary school teachers.” “[U]niversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition” and the constitutional rules applicable in higher education do not necessarily apply in primary and secondary schools, where students generally do not choose whether or where they will attend school.</p>
<p class="indent">Even to the extent academic freedom, as a constitutional rule, could somehow apply to primary and secondary schools, that does not insulate a teacher’s curricular and pedagogical choices from the school board’s oversight, as opposed to the teacher’s right to speak and write publicly about academic issues outside of the classroom. “[I]t is the educational institution that has a right to academic freedom, not the individual teacher.”</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. The Sixth Circuit stated that the concept of academic freedom “does not readily apply to in-class curricular speech at the high school level.” Do you agree that the notion of academic freedom—at least on the part of the individual teacher—should be limited to the university setting?</p>
<p class="indent">2. A recent case comment argues that “[i]nstead of applying <i>Garcetti</i>, the court should have created a new balancing test that accounts for the in-class interests of teachers, school administrators, and students. The presence of students and a third and equal institutional actor differentiates the education context from the broader sphere of public employment and counsels against applying <i>Garcetti</i> to teachers’ in-class curricular speech.…The Sixth Circuit should have borrowed elements from <i>Tinker</i> and <i>Hazelwood</i> to create a new balancing test for teachers’ curricular decisions: does the teacher’s interest in choosing her desired instructional methods and materials, coupled with the students’ interest in receiving this information, outweigh the administrators’ interest in promoting effective education?” 124 <span class="smallcap">Harv. L. Rev.</span> 2107 (2011). What are the arguments for and against such an approach? Can you think of another test that you would advocate?</p>
<p class="indent">3. While K-12 public school teachers may have little First Amendment protection for their classroom speech, many of them are tenured and thus enjoy considerable job security under state law. The nature of tenure protection varies from state to state, but it typically protects teachers—who are considered for tenure after having been employed on a probationary basis for several years—from being terminated except for just cause (i.e., incompetence or misconduct). Tenured teachers are also usually entitled to extensive review</p>
<p><a id="page_931" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>931</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">procedures before they can be terminated from their positions. As such, absent extreme circumstances, tenured teachers are unlikely to be terminated for some degree of deviation from the curriculum.</p>
<p class="indent">4. What about teachers who are disciplined for their <i>off-campus</i> speech? Here, because they are not speaking in their capacity as employees, they have the potential to receive more protection. Such a teacher would need to show that her off-campus speech was on a matter of public concern, and that the school district lacked an adequate reason for punishing it. Indeed, as you read above, <i>Pickering</i> itself involved a teacher’s off-campus speech: a letter to the editor that criticized the school board’s funding decisions. The <i>Pickering</i> Court held that the school’s termination of the teacher was unconstitutional because the teacher’s letter could neither be shown nor “presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher’s proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally.” The Court added that if, by contrast, the teacher’s statements had been “so without foundation to call into question his fitness to perform his duties in the classroom,” or if the statements had been “directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher” and thus had the potential to undermine workplace discipline and harmony, then the school would have been justified in terminating him. In sum, this is a very fact-specific inquiry that hinges on the substance and effect of the teacher’s off-campus speech.</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch356">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">The week before an upcoming presidential election, Windy Hills High School teacher David Dobbs—an untenured teacher in his second year on the job—devoted class time to having his students hold a mock debate. One student played the role of the Democratic candidate; the other student played the role of the Republican candidate. The other students were members of the audience, posing questions to both candidates. At the end of the debate, the students had the opportunity to vote. They voted in favor of the Democratic candidate by a 3-2 margin. After the vote, as the students were leaving class, one of them asked Mr. Dobbs how he planned to vote in the election. “Well, I probably should keep that private,” said Mr. Dobbs, “but I’ll just say that if the American public votes the way this class just did, I’ll be very happy on Election Day.” Not all of the students heard his answer, since they were on their way out, but many of them did, and they told other students about it.</p>
<p class="indent">Several of the students who had supported the Republican candidate were upset that Mr. Dobbs had indicated his political leanings to the class, especially after having just said that he should keep that information private. They complained to the school principal, who is now thinking about how to handle the situation. If the school <i>were</i> to sanction Mr. Dobbs for his speech, would Mr. Dobbs have a valid legal challenge?</p>

<p class="noindent">In <i>Wisconsin v.

These parents were opting out of public education altogether—indeed, <i>any</i> education at the high school level—for their children. But what happens when parents want to opt out of public education, but not completely? Do parents have any constitutional rights to send their children to public school but then shield them from certain portions of the curriculum, either because they disagree with them or because they would prefer to expose their children to these ideas at home? As you will see, so far cases alleging such claims—either under the Free Exercise Clause, parental due process rights, or both—have been unsuccessful, but courts have implied that in certain very limited circumstances, they might have merit.</p>

<p class="indent">This case arose under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.

<p class="indent">The plaintiff Vicki Frost is the mother of four children, three of whom were students in Hawkins County public schools in 1983. At the beginning of the 1983-84 school year Mrs. Frost read a story in a daughter’s sixth grade reader that involved mental telepathy. Mrs. Frost, who describes herself as a “born again Christian,” has a religious objection to any teaching about mental telepathy. Reading further, she found additional themes in the reader to which she had religious objections. After discussing her objections with other parents, Mrs. Frost talked with the principal of Church Hill Middle School and obtained an agreement for an alternative reading program for students whose parents objected to the assigned Holt reader. The students who elected the alternative program left their classrooms during the reading sessions and worked on</p>

Thereafter the plaintiff students refused to read the Holt series or attend reading classes where the series was being used. The children of several of the plaintiffs were suspended for brief periods for this refusal. Most of the plaintiff students were ultimately taught at home, or attended religious schools, or transferred to public schools outside Hawkins County. One student returned to school because his family was unable to afford alternate schooling. Even after the board’s order, two students were allowed some accommodation, in that the teacher either excused them from reading the Holt stories, or specifically noted on worksheets that the student was not required to believe the stories.</p>
<p class="indent">On December 2, 1983, the plaintiffs, consisting of seven families—14 parents and 17 children—filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. In their complaint the plaintiffs asserted that they have sincere religious beliefs which are contrary to the values taught or inculcated by the reading textbooks and that it is a violation of the religious beliefs and convictions of the plaintiff students to be required to read the books and a violation of the religious beliefs of the plaintiff parents to permit their children to read the books. The plaintiffs sought to hold the defendants liable because “forcing the student-plaintiffs to read school books which teach or inculcate values in violation of their religious beliefs and convictions is a clear violation of their rights to the free exercise of religion protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.”</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">[At trial,] Vicki Frost was the first witness for the plaintiffs and she presented the most complete explanation of the plaintiffs’ position. The plaintiffs do not belong to a single church or denomination, but all consider themselves born again Christians. Mrs. Frost testified that the word of God as found in the Christian Bible “is the totality of my beliefs.” There was evidence that other members of their churches, and even their pastors, do not agree with their position in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Frost testified that she had spent more than 200 hours reviewing the Holt series and had found numerous passages that offended her religious beliefs. She stated that the offending materials fell into seventeen categories which she listed. These ranged from such familiar concerns of fundamentalist Christians as evolution and “secular humanism” to less familiar themes such as “futuristic supernaturalism,” pacifism, magic and false views of death.</p>
<p><a id="page_934" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>934</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">In her lengthy testimony Mrs. Frost identified passages from stories and poems used in the Holt series that fell into each category. Illustrative is her first category, futuristic supernaturalism, which she defined as teaching “Man As God.” Passages that she found offensive described Leonardo da Vinci as the human with a creative mind that “came closest to the divine touch.” Similarly, she felt that a passage entitled “Seeing Beneath the Surface” related to an occult theme, by describing the use of imagination as a vehicle for seeing things not discernible through our physical eyes. She interpreted a poem, “Look at Anything,” as presenting the idea that by using imagination a child can become part of anything and thus understand it better. Mrs. Frost testified that it is an “occult practice” for children to use imagination beyond the limitation of scriptural authority. She testified that the story that alerted her to the problem with the reading series fell into the category of futuristic supernaturalism. Entitled “A Visit to Mars,” the story portrays thought transfer and telepathy in such a way that “it could be considered a scientific concept,” according to this witness. This theme appears in the testimony of several witnesses, <i>i.e.</i>, the materials objected to “could” be interpreted in a manner repugnant to their religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Frost described objectionable passages from other categories in much the same way. Describing evolution as a teaching that there is no God, she identified 24 passages that she considered to have evolution as a theme. She admitted that the textbooks contained a disclaimer that evolution is a theory, not a proven scientific fact. Nevertheless, she felt that references to evolution were so pervasive and presented in such a factual manner as to render the disclaimer meaningless. After describing her objection to passages that encourage children to make moral judgments about whether it is right or wrong to kill animals, the witness stated, “I thought they would be learning to read, to have good English and grammar, and to be able to do other subject work.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another witness for the plaintiffs was Bob Mozert, father of a middle school and an elementary school student in the Hawkins County system. His testimony echoed that of Vicki Frost in large part, though his answers to questions tended to be much less expansive. He also found objectionable passages in the readers that dealt with magic, role reversal or role elimination, particularly biographical material about women who have been recognized for achievements outside their homes, and emphasis on one world or a planetary society. Both witnesses testified under cross-examination that the plaintiff parents objected to passages that expose their children to other forms of religion and to the feelings, attitudes and values of other students that contradict the plaintiffs’ religious views without a statement that the other views are incorrect and that the plaintiffs’ views are the correct ones.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">III</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The first question to be decided is whether a governmental requirement that a person be exposed to ideas he or she finds objectionable on religious</p>
<p><a id="page_935" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>935</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">grounds constitutes a burden on the free exercise of that person’s religion as forbidden by the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint mentioned only the textbooks that the students were required to read. It did not seek relief from any method of teaching the material and did not mention the teachers’ editions. The plaintiffs did not produce a single student or teacher to testify that any student was ever required to affirm his or her belief or disbelief in any idea or practice mentioned in the various stories and passages contained in the Holt series. However, the plaintiffs appeared to assume that materials clearly presented as poetry, fiction and even “make-believe” in the Holt series were presented as facts which the students were required to believe. Nothing in the record supports this assumption.</p>
<p class="indent">At numerous places in her testimony Vicki Frost referred to various exercises and suggestions in the teachers’ manuals as support for her view that objectionable ideas were being inculcated as truth rather than being offered as examples of the variety of approaches possible to a particular question. However, the students were not required to read the teachers’ materials. While these materials suggested various ways of presenting the lessons, including “acting out” and round table discussions, there was no proof that any plaintiff student was ever called upon to say or do anything that required the student to affirm or deny a religious belief or to engage or refrain from engaging in any act either required or forbidden by the student’s religious convictions. Mrs. Frost seemed to assume that each teacher used every suggested exercise or teaching tool in the teachers’ editions. There was evidence that reading aloud and acting out the themes encountered in school lessons help young people learn. One of the teachers stated that students read some of the stories aloud. Proof that an objecting student was <i>required</i> to participate beyond reading and discussing assigned materials, or was disciplined for disputing assigned materials, might well implicate the Free Exercise Clause because the element of compulsion would then be present. But this was not the case either as pled or proved.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Frost testified that it would be acceptable for the schools to teach her children about other philosophies and religions, but if the practices of other religions were described in detail, or if the philosophy was “profound” in that it expressed a world view that deeply undermined her religious beliefs, then her children “would have to be instructed to [the] error [of the other philosophy].” It is clear that to the plaintiffs there is but one acceptable view—the Biblical view, as they interpret the Bible. Furthermore, the plaintiffs view every human situation and decision, whether related to personal belief and conduct or to public policy and programs, from a theological or religious perspective. Mrs. Frost testified that many political issues have theological roots and that there would be “no way” certain themes could be presented without violating her religious beliefs. She identified such themes as evolution, false supernaturalism, feminism, telepathy and magic as matters that could not be presented in any way without offending her beliefs. The only way to avoid conflict with the plaintiffs’ beliefs in these sensitive areas would be to eliminate all references to the subjects so identified. However, the Supreme Court has clearly held that it violates the Establishment Clause to tailor a public school’s curriculum to satisfy the principles or prohibitions of any religion.</p>
<p><a id="page_936" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>936</b></a></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that governmental compulsion either to do or refrain from doing an act forbidden or required by one’s religion, or to affirm or disavow a belief forbidden or required by one’s religion, is the evil prohibited by the Free Exercise Clause.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs appear to contend that the element of compulsion was supplied by the requirement of class participation in the reading exercises. As we have pointed out earlier, there is no proof in the record that any plaintiff student was required to engage in role play, make up magic chants, read aloud or engage in the activity of haggling. Being exposed to other students performing these acts might be offensive to the plaintiffs, but it does not constitute the compulsion described in the Supreme Court cases, where the objector was required to affirm or deny a religious belief or engage or refrain from engaging in a practice contrary to sincerely held religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">[<i>Yoder</i>] is the only Supreme Court decision that might be read to support the proposition that requiring mere exposure to materials that offend one’s religious beliefs creates an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of religion. However, <i>Yoder</i> rested on such a singular set of facts that we do not believe it can be held to announce a general rule that exposure without compulsion to act, believe, affirm or deny creates an unconstitutional burden.</p>
<p class="indent">The parents in <i>Yoder</i> were required to send their children to some school that prepared them for life in the outside world, or face official sanctions. The parents in the present case want their children to acquire all the skills required to live in modern society. They also want to have them excused from exposure to some ideas they find offensive. Tennessee offers two options to accommodate this latter desire. The plaintiff parents can either send their children to church schools or private schools, as many of them have done, or teach them at home.</p>
<p class="indent">
<i>Yoder</i> was decided in large part on the impossibility of reconciling the goals of public education with the religious requirement of the Amish that their children be prepared for life in a separated community. No such threat exists in the present case.</p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">IV</span></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Supreme Court has recently affirmed that public schools serve the purpose of teaching fundamental values “essential to a democratic society.” These values “include tolerance of divergent political and religious views” while taking into account “consideration of the sensibilities of others.” <i>Fraser.</i> The Court has noted with apparent approval the view of some educators who see public schools as an “assimilative force” that brings together “diverse and conflicting elements” in our society “on a broad but common ground.” The critical reading approach furthers these goals. Mrs. Frost stated specifically</p>
<p><a id="page_937" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>937</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">that she objected to stories that develop “a religious tolerance that all religions are merely different roads to God.” Stating that the plaintiffs reject this concept, presented as a recipe for an ideal world citizen, Mrs. Frost said, “We cannot be tolerant in that we accept other religious views on an equal basis with ours.” While probably not an uncommon view of true believers in any religion, this statement graphically illustrates what is lacking in the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Boggs,</span> Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>
<p class="indent">I approach this case with a profound sense of sadness. At the classroom level, the pupils and teachers in these schools had in most cases reached a working accommodation. Only by the decisions of higher levels of political authority, and by more conceptualized presentations of the plaintiffs’ positions, have we reached the point where we must decide these harsh questions today. The school board faced what must have seemed a prickly and difficult group of parents, however dedicated to their children’s welfare. In a similar situation, the poet Edwin Markham described a solution:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">He drew a circle that shut me out—Heretic, Rebel, a thing to flout.</p>
<p class="noindent">But Love and I had the wit to win:</p>
<p class="noindent">We drew a circle that took him in!</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p class="indent">As this case now reaches us, the school board rejects any effort to reach out and take in these children and their concerns. At oral argument, the board specifically argued that it was better for both plaintiffs’ children and other children that they not be in the public schools, despite the children’s obvious desire to obtain some of the benefits of public schooling. Though the board recognized that their allegedly compelling interests in shaping the education of Tennessee children could not be served at all if they drove the children from the school, the board felt it better not to be associated with any hybrid program.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs’ requests were unusual, but a variety of accommodations in fact were made, with no evidence whatsoever of bad effects. Given the masses of speculative testimony as to the hypothetical future evils of accommodating plaintiffs in any way, had there been any evidence of bad effects from what actually occurred, the board would surely have presented it. As we ultimately decide here, on the present state of constitutional law, the school board is indeed entitled to say, “my way or the highway.” But in my view the school board’s decision here is certainly not required by the Establishment Clause.<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note89" id="Rnote89" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="h8"><span class="smallcap">II</span></p>
<p class="indent">Returning to the treatment of plaintiffs’ free exercise claim, I believe this is a more difficult case than outlined in the court’s opinion. I disagree with the first</p>
<p><a id="page_938" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>938</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">proposition in the court’s opinion, that plaintiffs object to any exposure to any contrary idea. A reasonable reading of plaintiffs’ testimony shows they object to the overall effect of the Holt series, not simply to any exposure to any idea opposing theirs.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, I think we must address plaintiffs’ claims as they actually impact their lives: it is their belief that they should not take a course of study which, on balance, to them, denigrates and opposes their religion, and which the state is compelling them to take on pain of forfeiting all other benefits of public education.</p>
<p class="indent">Their view may seem silly or wrong-headed to some, but it is a sincerely held religious belief. By focusing narrowly on references that make plaintiffs appear so extreme that they could never be accommodated, the court simply leaves resolution of the underlying issues here to another case, when we have plaintiffs with a more sophisticated understanding of our own and Supreme Court precedent, and a more careful and articulate presentation of their own beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">Under the court’s assessment of the facts, this is a most uninteresting case. It is not the test case sought, or feared, by either side. The court reviews the record and finds that the plaintiffs actually want a school system that affirmatively teaches the correctness of their religion, and prevents other students from mentioning contrary ideas. If that is indeed the case, then it can be very simply resolved. It would obviously violate the Establishment Clause for any school system to agree with such an extravagant view.</p>
<p class="indent">[The] plaintiffs may “want” a school system tailored exactly to their religious beliefs (that is why many people choose religious education), but they very well know that that is constitutionally impermissible. They “want” a particular type of accommodation that they have sought in this law suit, and they believe that they are constitutionally entitled to that. Thus, I believe we must take plaintiffs’ claims as they have stated them—that they desire the accommodation of an opt-out, or alternative reading books, and no more. That is all they have ever asked for in their pleadings, in the arguments at trial and in appellate briefing and argument.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the burden is many years of education, being required to study books that, in plaintiffs’ view, systematically undervalue, contradict and ignore their religion. I trust it is not simply because I am chronologically somewhat closer than my colleagues to the status of the students involved here that I interpret the choice forced upon the plaintiffs here as a “burden.”</p>
<p class="indent">However, constitutional adjudication, especially for a lower court, is not simply a matter of common sense use of words. We must determine whether the common sense burden on plaintiffs’ religious belief is, in the context of a public school curriculum, a constitutional “burden” on their religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">I reluctantly conclude that under the Supreme Court’s decisions as we have them, school boards may set curricula bounded only by the Establishment Clause, as the state contends. Our holding requires plaintiffs to put up with what they perceive as an unbalanced public school curriculum, so long as the curriculum does not violate the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p><a id="page_939" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>939</b></a></p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Why did the <i>Mozert</i> majority emphasize that the plaintiff children were never required to say or do anything that conflicted with their religious beliefs? How did this affect the court’s free exercise analysis?</p>
<p class="indent">2. How do the majority and concurrence differ in their view of this case?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Nomi Maya Stolzenberg observes that <i>Mozert</i> “crystallizes the paradox of tolerance for the intolerant: the fundamentalists’ call for eliminating tolerance from the public schools can be rebuffed only at the expense of maintaining an environment that is exceedingly inhospitable to the fundamentalists, and is potentially inimical to the survival of their way of life.” Nomi Maya Stolzenberg, <i>“He Drew A Circle That Shut Me Out”: Assimilation, Indoctrination, and the Paradox of a Liberal Education</i>, 106 <span class="smallcap">Harv. L. Rev.</span> 581, 584 (1993). But Stolzenberg also articulates an alternative way to interpret the poem cited by Judge Boggs:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Judge Boggs lamented the fact that the school board “drove the children from the school,” instead of enfolding them in a more inclusive “hybrid program.” As he saw it, accommodations in the form of exemptions from the reading program would have represented the inclusive “circle” of “Love,” whereas the imposition of the reading requirements constituted a circle of exclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the poem can be interpreted in just the opposite way with the school board’s insistence on including all school children in one reading program seen as the canny, agappic “circle that took [them] in!” Conversely, permitting parents to insulate their children from exposure to foreign ideas can be seen as a way of drawing a circle that “shut[s] [their children] out” from the larger democratic society.</p>
<p class="indent">These two readings reflect the tension between cultural pluralism and assimilation that underlies the fundamentalists’ complaint against secular humanist education. On the one hand, exposing children to diverse positions and attitudes assimilates them into pluralist culture, thereby preparing them for participation in a democratic society. Hence, this exposure includes children in civic life, but also threatens the survival of certain traditional ways of life. On the other hand, insulating children from exposure to diversity helps to protect and perpetuate their parents’ traditional way of life, but it also renders the children less fit for participation in a pluralist democracy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Id</i>. at 585. Which interpretation do you find more persuasive?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Relatedly, putting aside the legal question of whether the school district was required to accommodate the plaintiff families’ requests for an alternative program for their children, do you think that the school district <i>should</i> have continued to accommodate them?</p>
<p class="indent">5. How did the <i>Mozert</i> majority distinguish this case from <i>Yoder</i>? Do you find its distinctions persuasive?</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, parents seeking recognition of a constitutional right to shield their children from portions of the school curriculum have frequently joined their free exercise challenges with claims sounding in their substantive due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to direct their children’s upbringing. This strategy, however, has not yielded them any greater success.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcap">Lynch</span>, Circuit Judge.</p>
<p class="indent">Two sets of parents, whose religious beliefs are offended by gay marriage and homosexuality, sued the Lexington, Massachusetts school district in which their young children are enrolled. They assert that they must be given prior notice by the school and the opportunity to exempt their young children from exposure to books they find religiously repugnant. Plaintiffs assert violations of their own and their children’s rights under the Free Exercise Clause and their substantive parental and privacy due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent">The Parkers object to their child being presented in kindergarten and first grade with two books that portray diverse families, including families in which both parents are of the same gender. The Wirthlins object to a second-grade teacher’s reading to their son’s class a book that depicts and celebrates a gay marriage. The parents do not challenge the use of these books as part of a nondiscrimination curriculum in the public schools, but challenge the school district’s refusal to provide them with prior notice and to allow for exemption from such instruction. They ask for relief until their children are in seventh grade.</p>
<p class="indent">Massachusetts does have a statute that requires parents be given notice and the opportunity to exempt their children from curriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human sexuality issues. The school system has declined to apply this statutory exemption to these plaintiffs on the basis that the materials do not primarily involve human sexual education or human sexuality issues.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>A. Massachusetts Statewide Curricular Standards</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted a comprehensive education reform bill in 1993, requiring the State Board of Education (SBE) to establish academic standards for core subjects. The statute mandates that the standards “be designed to inculcate respect for the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity of the commonwealth.”</p>
<p class="indent">The SBE established such standards, including a Comprehensive Health Curriculum Framework in 1999. That Framework establishes Learning Standards, which set different measurable goals for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 5, grades 6-8, and grades 9-12. The Health Framework also specifically notes that “public schools must notify parents before implementing curriculum that involves human sexuality.”</p>
<p class="indent">Within the Framework are Strands, and Strands have different components. Under the Social and Emotional Health Strand, there is a Family Life component, which states:</p>
<p class="space"> </p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindent">Students will gain knowledge about the significance of the family on individuals and society, and will learn skills to support the family, balance work and family life, be an effective parent, and nurture the development of children.</p>
</div>
<p class="space"> </p>
<p><a id="page_941" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>941</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">The Learning Standard for elementary school grades under the Family Life component states that children should be able to “[d]escribe different types of families.” The associated Learning Standard for pre-kindergarten through grade 5 recommends that children be able to “[d]escribe the concepts of prejudice and discrimination.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is also a Reproduction/Sexuality component under the Physical Health Strand. Within that component, the Learning Standards provide that by grade 5, students should be able to “[d]efine sexual orientation using the correct terminology (such as heterosexual, and gay and lesbian).”</p>
<p class="indent">These statewide academic standards do not purport to select particular instructional materials, but only to be a guide to assist others in that selection. Thus, there is no statewide regulation or policy providing for the use of the particular texts in dispute here.</p>
<p class="indent">By statute, the actual selection of books is the responsibility of a school’s principal, with the approval of the superintendent of schools. We assume these books were chosen locally subject to the terms of that statute. Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that Lexington school officials began integrating books like these into their elementary school’s curriculum at the behest of gay rights advocates. In 1996, the Massachusetts legislature adopted a parental notification statute to be implemented by schools starting with the 1997-1998 school year. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, §32A. Section 32A requires school districts to provide parents with notice of and an opportunity to exempt their children from “curriculum which primarily involves human sexual education or human sexuality issues.” The Commissioner of Education, in an advisory opinion guiding the implementation of the new law, noted that it was intended to apply to discrete curricular units, such as “any courses (typically, sex education or portions of a health education or science course), school assemblies or other instructional activities and programs.”<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note90" id="Rnote90" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>B. The Parkers</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">David and Tonia Parker’s sons, Jacob and Joshua Parker, and Joseph and Robin Wirthlin’s son, Joseph Robert Wirthlin, Jr., are students at Estabrook Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts. Both families assert that they are devout Judeo-Christians and that a core belief of their religion is that homosexual behavior and gay marriage are immoral and violate God’s law.</p>
<p class="indent">In January 2005, when Jacob Parker (“Jacob”) was in kindergarten, he brought home a “Diversity Book Bag.” This included a picture book, <i>Who’s in a Family?</i>, which depicted different families, including single-parent families, an extended family, interracial families, animal families, a family without children, and—to the concern of the Parkers—a family with two dads and a family with two moms. The book concludes by answering the question, “Who’s in a</p>
<p><a id="page_942" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>942</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">family?”: “The people who love you the most!” The book says nothing about marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">The Parkers were concerned that this book was part of an effort by the public schools “to indoctrinate young children into the concept that homosexuality and homosexual relationships or marriage are moral and acceptable behavior.” Such an effort, they feared, would require their sons to affirm a belief inconsistent with their religion. On January 21, 2005, they met with Estabrook’s principal, Joni Jay (“Jay”), to request that Jacob not be exposed to any further discussions of homosexuality. Principal Jay disagreed that the school had any obligation under section 32A to notify parents in advance of such class discussions. In March 2005, the Parkers repeated their request that “no teacher or adult expose [Jacob] to any materials or discussions featuring sexual orientation, same-sex unions, or homosexuality without notification to the Parkers and the right to ‘opt out,’ ” this time including in their communication the then-Superintendent of Lexington’s schools, William Hurley (“Hurley”), and two other district-wide administrators. This request was met with the same response. A further meeting to discuss these issues was held at Estabrook on April 27, 2005, which resulted in Mr. Parker’s arrest when he refused to leave the school until his demands were met.</p>
<p class="indent">As the 2005-2006 school year began, Paul Ash (“Ash”), the current Superintendent, released a public statement explaining the school district’s position that it would not provide parental notification for “discussions, activities, or materials that simply reference same-gender parents or that otherwise recognize the existence of differences in sexual orientation.” When Jacob entered first grade that fall, his classroom’s book collection included <i>Who’s in a Family?</i> as well as <i>Molly’s Family</i>, a picture book about a girl who is at first made to feel embarrassed by a classmate because she has both a mommy and a mama but then learns that families can come in many different varieties. In December 2005, the Parkers repeated their request for advance notice, which Superintendent Ash again denied.</p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>C. The Wirthlins</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">We turn to the other plaintiff family.</p>
<p class="indent">In March 2006, an Estabrook teacher read aloud <i>King and King</i> to her second grade class, which included Joseph Robert Wirthlin, Jr. (“Joey”). This picture book tells the story of a prince, ordered by his mother to get married, who first rejects several princesses only to fall in love with another prince. A wedding scene between the two princes is depicted. The last page of the book shows the two princes kissing, but with a red heart superimposed over their mouths. There is no allegation in the complaint that the teacher further discussed the book with the class. That evening, Joey told his parents about the book; his parents described him as “agitated” and remembered him calling the book “so silly.” Eventually the Wirthlins were able to secure a meeting with the teacher and Jay on April 6, 2006, to object to what they considered to be indoctrination of their son about gay marriage in contravention of their religious beliefs. Jay reiterated the school district’s position that no prior notice or exemption would be given.</p>
<p><a id="page_943" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>943</b></a></p>
<p class="h10a"><b><i>D. Procedural History</i></b></p>
<p class="indent">On April 27, 2006, the Parkers and the Wirthlins filed suit on behalf of themselves and their children in federal district court against Hurley, Ash, Jay, and Joey Wirthlin’s teacher, as well as the town of Lexington, the members of its school board, and other school district administrators.</p>
<p class="indent">The complaint alleges that the public schools are systematically indoctrinating the Parkers’ and the Wirthlins’ young children contrary to the parents’ religious beliefs and that the defendants held “a specific intention to denigrate the [families’] sincere and deeply-held faith.” They claim, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, violations of their and their children’s First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and of their Fourteenth Amendment due process right to parental autonomy in the upbringing of their children, as well as of their concomitant state rights. They also assert a violation of the Massachusetts “opt out” statute.</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs argue that their ability to influence their young children toward their family religious views has been undercut in several respects. First, they believe their children are too young to be introduced to the topic of gay marriage. They also point to the important influence teachers have on this age group. They fear their own inability as parents to counter the school’s approval of gay marriage, particularly if parents are given no notice that such curricular materials are in use. As for the children, the parents fear that they are “essentially” required “to affirm a belief inconsistent with and prohibited by their religion. The parents assert it is ironic, and unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause, for a public school system to show such intolerance towards their own religious beliefs in the name of tolerance.</p>
<p class="indent">For relief, the plaintiffs seek a declaration of their constitutional rights; damages; and an injunction requiring the school (1) to provide an opportunity to exempt their children from “classroom presentations or discussions the intent of which is to have children accept the validity of, embrace, affirm, or celebrate views of human sexuality, gender identity, and marriage constructs,” (2) to allow the parents to observe any such classroom discussions, and (3) to not present any “materials graphically depicting homosexual physical contact” to students before the seventh grade.</p>

<p class="indent">The parties have focused on the standard of justification the defendants must meet in the aftermath of <i>Employment Division v. Smith.</i> In <i>Smith</i>, the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that they had unconstitutionally been denied unemployment benefits due to their violation of Oregon’s general criminal prohibition on the use of peyote, even though they had used the peyote for religious purposes. The Court found no free exercise objection to the criminal statute’s enforcement because, as it summarized in a later case, “a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.”</p>
<p><a id="page_944" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>944</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">If <i>Smith</i>’s mere rationality test were the applicable standard, this case would easily be dismissed. Plaintiffs do not contest that the defendants have an interest in promoting tolerance, including for the children (and parents) of gay marriages. The Supreme Court has often referred to the role of public education in the preparation of students for citizenship. Given that Massachusetts has recognized gay marriage under its state constitution, it is entirely rational for its schools to educate their students regarding that recognition.</p>
<p class="indent">In plaintiffs’ favor, however, we will assume their case is not necessarily subject to this general <i>Smith</i> rule. First, the case does not arise in the same context as <i>Smith</i>. Plaintiffs have not engaged in conduct prohibited by state law or otherwise sought to avoid compliance with a law of general applicability. In contrast to the mere rationality standard for neutral laws of general applicability, <i>Smith</i> and its progeny require a compelling justification for any law that targets religious groups. This case also does not fit into the “targeting” category, as the Supreme Court has used the phrase. The school was not singling out plaintiffs’ particular religious beliefs or targeting its tolerance lessons to only those children from families with religious objections to gay marriage. The fact that a school promotes tolerance of different sexual orientations and gay marriage when such tolerance is anathema to some religious groups does not constitute targeting.</p>
<p class="indent">The <i>Smith</i> Court, in our view, left open other possible approaches. <i>Smith</i>, by its terms, also carved out an area of “hybrid situations.” Plaintiffs argue this is where their claim fits. <i>Smith</i> described such hybrid situations as involving free exercise claims brought in conjunction with other claims of violations of constitutional protections. <i>Smith</i> gave as one example of a companion claim “the right of parents…to direct the education of their children,” citing to <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i> and <i>Wisconsin v. Yoder.</i></p>
<p class="indent">What the Court meant by its discussion of “hybrid situations” in <i>Smith</i> has led to a great deal of discussion and disagreement. Observers debate whether <i>Smith</i> created a new hybrid rights doctrine, or whether in discussing “hybrid situations” the Court was merely noting in descriptive terms that it was not overruling certain cases such as <i>Pierce</i> and <i>Yoder.</i> Courts and commentators also disagree over how strong the companion constitutional claim must be to establish a hybrid situation: whether, for example, the associated claim must be independently viable, or whether it is enough for the claim to be “colorable.” Yet another debate is whether such “hybrid” cases automatically subject the governmental defendant to the compelling state interest test. Without entering the fray over the meaning and application of <i>Smith</i>’s “hybrid situations” language, we approach the parents’ claims as the Court did in <i>Yoder</i>. In that case, the Court did not analyze separately the due process and free exercise interests of the parent-plaintiffs, but rather considered the two claims interdependently, given that those two sets of interests inform one other.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs’ opening premise is that their rights of parental control are fundamental rights. They rely on a Supreme Court decision recognizing a substantive due process right of parents “to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.” <i>Troxel v. Granville. Troxel</i> is not so broad as plaintiffs assert. [T]he schooling cases cited in <i>Troxel</i> “evince the principle that</p>
<p><a id="page_945" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>945</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">the state cannot <i>prevent</i> parents from choosing a specific educational program.” Plaintiffs argue their request for notice and exemption is simply a logical extension of their parental rights under <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, as reinforced by their free exercise rights.</p>
<p class="indent">Defendants respond that plaintiffs’ argument runs afoul of the general proposition that, while parents can choose between public and private schools, they do not have a constitutional right to “direct <i>how</i> a public school teaches their child.” That proposition is well recognized. Indeed, <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> specified that the parental interests they recognized would not interfere with the general power of the state to regulate education, including “the state’s power to prescribe a curriculum for institutions which it supports.”</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiffs say, in response, that they are not attempting to control the school’s power to prescribe a curriculum. Nonetheless, we have found no federal case under the Due Process Clause which has permitted parents to demand an exemption for their children from exposure to certain books used in public schools.</p>
<p class="indent">The due process right of parental autonomy might be considered a subset of a broader substantive due process right of familial privacy. The other cases establishing privacy rights under the Due Process Clause pertain to such issues as the right to marry and the right to procreate, and are not relevant to plaintiffs’ claims. In sum, the substantive <i>due process clause</i> by itself, either in its parental control or its privacy focus, does not give plaintiffs the degree of control over their children’s education that their requested relief seeks. We turn then to whether the combination of substantive due process and free exercise interests give the parents a cause of action.</p>
<p class="indent">Preliminarily, we mark the distinction between the alleged burden on the parents’ free exercise rights and the alleged burden on their children’s. The right of parents “to direct the religious upbringing of their children,” is distinct from (although related to) any right their children might have regarding the content of their school curriculum. We start with the parents’ claim.</p>
<p class="indent">In the present case, the plaintiffs claim that the exposure of their children, at these young ages and in this setting, to ways of life contrary to the parents’ religious beliefs violates their ability to direct the religious upbringing of their children. We try to identify the categories of harms alleged. The parents do not allege coercion in the form of a direct interference with their religious beliefs, nor of compulsion in the form of punishment for their beliefs, as in <i>Yoder</i>. Nor do they allege the denial of benefits. Further, plaintiffs do not allege that the mere listening to a book being read violated any religious duty on the part of the child. There is no claim that as a condition of attendance at the public schools, the defendants have forced plaintiffs—either the parents or the children—to violate their religious beliefs. In sum there is no claim of direct coercion.</p>
<p class="indent">The heart of the plaintiffs’ free exercise claim is a claim of “indoctrination”: that the state has put pressure on their children to endorse an affirmative view of gay marriage and has thus undercut the parents’ efforts to inculcate their children with their own opposing religious views. The Supreme Court, we believe, has never utilized an indoctrination test under the Free Exercise Clause, much less in the public school context. The closest it has come is <i>Barnette</i>, a free speech</p>
<p><a id="page_946" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>946</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">case that implicated free exercise interests and which <i>Smith</i> included in its hybrid case discussion. In <i>Barnette</i>, the Court held that the state could not coerce acquiescence through compelled statements of belief, such as the mandatory recital of the pledge of allegiance in public schools. It did not hold that the state could not attempt to inculcate values by instruction, and in fact carefully distinguished the two approaches. We do not address whether or not an indoctrination theory under the Free Exercise Clause is sound. Plaintiffs’ pleadings do not establish a viable case of indoctrination, even assuming that extreme indoctrination can be a form of coercion.</p>
<p class="indent">First, as to the parents’ free exercise rights, the mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion in public school to a concept offensive to a parent’s religious belief does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently. A parent whose “child is exposed to sensitive topics or information [at school] remains free to discuss these matters and to place them in the family’s moral or religious context, or to supplement the information with more appropriate materials.” The parents here did in fact have notice, if not prior notice, of the books and of the school’s overall intent to promote toleration of same-sex marriage, and they retained their ability to discuss the material and subject matter with their children. Our outcome does not turn, however, on whether the parents had notice.</p>
<p class="indent">Turning to the children’s free exercise rights, we cannot see how Jacob’s free exercise right was burdened at all: two books were made available to him, but he was never required to read them or have them read to him. Further, these books do not endorse gay marriage or homosexuality, or even address these topics explicitly, but merely describe how other children might come from families that look different from one’s own. There is no free exercise right to be free from any reference in public elementary schools to the existence of families in which the parents are of different gender combinations.</p>
<p class="indent">Joey has a more significant claim, both because he was required to sit through a classroom reading of <i>King and King</i> and because that book affirmatively endorses homosexuality and gay marriage. It is a fair inference that the reading of <i>King and King</i> was precisely <i>intended</i> to influence the listening children toward tolerance of gay marriage. That was the point of why that book was chosen and used. Even assuming there is a continuum along which an intent to influence could become an attempt to indoctrinate, however, this case is firmly on the influence-toward-tolerance end. There is no evidence of systemic indoctrination. There is no allegation that Joey was asked to affirm gay marriage. Requiring a student to read a particular book is generally not coercive of free exercise rights.</p>
<p class="indent">On the facts, there is no viable claim of “indoctrination” here. Without suggesting that such showings would suffice to establish a claim of indoctrination, we note the plaintiffs’ children were not forced to read the books on pain of suspension. Nor were they subject to a constant stream of like materials. There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute “indoctrination.”</p>
<p><a id="page_947" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>947</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">Because plaintiffs do not allege facts that give rise to claims of constitutional magnitude, the district court did not err in granting defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims under the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p class="h6"><i>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</i></p>
<p class="indent">1. Rather than “analyz[ing] separately the due process and free exercise interests of the parent-plaintiffs,” the <i>Parker</i> court “considered the two claims interdependently, given that those two sets of interests inform one another.” How do those interests inform each other? Do you think the fact that the court analyzed them “interdependently,” rather than separately, made any real difference in the ultimate outcome of the case?</p>
<p class="indent">2. In addition to the parents’ constitutional interests, the <i>Parker</i> court also identified the two children—Joey and Jacob—as having their own free exercise rights at stake. Why were those claims unsuccessful?</p>
<p class="indent">3. As <i>Parker</i> describes, many states, including Massachusetts, have statutes that provide parents with opt-out rights with respect to sex education,<sup><a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781454882220/epub/OEBPS/xhtml/22_ELEFR_Chapter_10.xhtml?favre=brett#note91" id="Rnote91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></sup> although no court has ruled that parents have a federal <i>constitutional</i> right to opt their children out of such classes. Do you believe that such statutes reflect good policy? If you were a state legislator, would you vote in favor of them?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Under the applicable regulations, Massachusetts’ opt-out requirement for sex education does not cover “educational materials designed to promote tolerance, including materials recognizing differences in sexual orientation, if those materials are presented ‘without further instruction or discussion of the physical and sexual implications of homosexuality.’ ” What are the arguments in favor of, and against, providing greater parental opt-out rights for sex education materials than for “educational materials designed to promote tolerance”?</p>
<p class="indent">5. The <i>Parker</i> court declined to address “whether or not an indoctrination theory under the Free Exercise Clause is sound,” concluding that “plaintiffs’ pleadings do not establish a viable case of indoctrination, even assuming that extreme indoctrination can be a form of coercion.” Do you think such a theory could be sound? If so, what would constitute extreme indoctrination by a school?</p>
<p class="h7" id="ch360">PROBLEM</p>
<p class="indent">Utopia Middle School (UMS) has a reputation as one of the most outstanding and innovative middle schools in the state of East Dakota. One of the hallmarks of UMS is its focus on experiential learning through role-playing and simulations, consistent with educational research that suggests that this is a</p>
<p><a id="page_948" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>948</b></a></p>
<p class="noindent">particularly effective way to teach middle-school students. For example, the seventh-grade biology classes participate in a mock medical school. Similarly, in the eighth-grade English classes, the students dress up as fictional characters from the books that they are reading. And by the same token, various simulations are threaded throughout the sixth-grade social studies course, which focuses on world history. During the fall unit on the Middle Ages, for instance, the sixth graders were grouped into different feudal manors and dressed up as lords, knights, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">The present controversy has arisen from the sixth-grade social studies class’s one-week unit on Hinduism, which occurred last week. The sixth-grade social studies teacher, Stacy Sutton, used a variety of sources to teach about Hinduism, including readings from the textbook as well as handouts that were designed to facilitate role-playing. The first handout said that “during this module, you and your classmates are going to become Hindus.” Another handout then led the students through the process of choosing a Hindu name. Over the course of the week, the students learned about the basic beliefs of Hinduism, including the different Hindu gods and their symbols, the Hindu concept of the afterlife, and the various Hindu holidays. After the students had read about these concepts in their textbook, Ms. Sutton asked them to create a shrine to the Hindu god of their choice and also had each student recite a short portion of a Hindu prayer.</p>
<p class="indent">The culmination of the unit was a classroom celebration of Diwali, the Hindu New Year. During the Diwali celebration, Ms. Sutton had the students clean the classroom (because Hindus often start Diwali by cleaning their homes to make them ready for the Goddess Lakshmi) and had them each create a colorful flower decoration to make Lakshmi more likely to visit the class. During the Diwali celebration, Ms. Sutton had the students play a game to test who had the strongest knowledge of Hinduism. Some of the questions were true/false questions that included statements of religious faith (for example, “The universe exists in endless cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.”). At the end of the Diwali celebration, Ms. Sutton had the students engage in the ritual of driving out Alaksmi, the goddess of bad luck, by making a lot of noise.</p>
<p class="indent">One student in the class, Isabel Ipson, expressed her discomfort to Ms. Sutton about participating in the unit. At the beginning of the unit, when the students received the initial handout, Isabel told Ms. Sutton that she did not want to become a Hindu; she was a devout Christian. Ms. Sutton responded that the unit was just a role-playing exercise and that the students would not actually become Hindus by participating in it. That night, Isabel’s parents also e-mailed Ms. Sutton to express their concern about the unit. Ms. Sutton wrote back and stated that this was only a role-playing unit. She added that the unit was consistent with the school’s general focus on role-playing to enhance student learning and pointed out that the students had been engaging in different simulations during the entire year. Isabel’s parents wrote back that they still did not feel comfortable with the unit, and that if it were possible for Ms. Sutton to exclude Isabel from the unit without drawing any attention to the situation, they would appreciate it. Ms. Sutton responded to indicate that there would be no way to remove Isabel in a nonobvious manner.</p>
<p><a id="page_949" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><b>949</b></a></p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the week, when Isabel’s parents found out that the students had recited lines from Hindu prayers, engaged in the above-described Hindu rituals, and stated (as part of the game to test their knowledge of Hinduism) that various tenets of Hinduism were “true,” they were furious. They called the principal of UMS to complain, and even stated that they were considering filing a lawsuit. The superintendent now wants your advice. First, what possible legal claims could Isabel’s parents bring, and what are their chances of success? Second, are there changes that UMS should make to the Hinduism unit to reduce the chances of liability in the future?</p>
