And the prosecution must prove that causal link (like any other required element) beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

When the actor kills the person he meant to kill, in precisely the way he intended, no causation difficulty arises. Nor is there difficulty when an unintended death occurs in precisely the way that the defendant’s risky conduct made likely. But when the intended death occurs in an unintended way or the unintended death occurs in an unlikely way, the law must distinguish variations (between the actual result and the result intended or risked) that preclude liability from variations that do not preclude liability.

<span class="epub-small-caps">WALLIN</span>, J. Vincent William Acosta appeals his conviction on three counts of second degree murder . . . contending: (1) there was insufficient evidence his conduct was the proximate cause of the deaths; (2) there was insufficient evidence of malice. . . . At 10 <span class="epub-small-caps">P.M.</span> on March 10, 1987, Officers Salceda and Francis . . . saw Acosta in [a] stolen Nissan Pulsar parked on the street. The officers approached Acosta and identified themselves. Acosta inched the Pulsar forward, then accelerated rapidly. He led Salceda, Francis and officers from other agencies on a 48-mile chase along numerous surface streets and freeways throughout Orange County. The chase ended near Acosta’s residence in Anaheim.</p>
<p id="76d1b96e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the chase, Acosta engaged in some of the most egregious driving tactics imaginable.

<p id="76d1e07f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Police helicopters from Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, and Newport Beach assisted in the chase by tracking Acosta. During the early part of the pursuit, the Costa Mesa and Newport Beach craft were used, pinpointing Acosta’s location with their high beam spotlights. The Costa Mesa helicopter was leading the pursuit, in front of and below the Newport Beach helicopter. As they flew into Newport Beach, the pilots agreed the Newport Beach craft should take the lead. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d1e080-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the direction of the Costa Mesa pilot, the Newport Beach helicopter moved forward and descended while the Costa Mesa helicopter banked to the <span title="605" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-605">p. 605</span>right. Shortly after commencing this procedure, the Costa Mesa helicopter, having terminated radio communication, came up under the Newport Beach helicopter from the right rear and collided with it. Both helicopters fell to the ground. Three occupants in the Costa Mesa helicopter died as a result of the crash.</p>
<p id="76d1e081-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Menzies Turner, a retired Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigator, testified as an expert and concluded the accident occurred because the Costa Mesa helicopter, the faster of the two aircraft, made a 360-degree turn and closed too rapidly on the Newport Beach helicopter. He opined the Costa Mesa helicopter’s pilot violated an FAA regulation prohibiting careless and reckless operation of an aircraft by failing to properly clear the area, not maintaining communication with the Newport Beach helicopter, failing to keep the other aircraft in view at all times, and not changing his altitude. He also testified the Costa Mesa pilot violated another FAA regulation prohibiting operation of one aircraft so close to another as to create a collision hazard.</p>
<p id="76d1e082-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turner could not think of any reason for the Costa Mesa helicopter’s erratic movement.

[He] argues that although a collision between ground vehicles was a foreseeable result of his conduct, one between airborne helicopters was not, noting his expert had never heard of a similar incident. He also contends the Costa Mesa helicopter pilot’s violation of FAA regulations was a superseding cause. Because the deaths here were unusual, to say the least, the issue deserves special scrutiny. . . .

The term is, in a sense, artificial, serving matters of policy surrounding tort and criminal law and based partly on expediency and partly on concerns of fairness and justice. Because such concerns are sometimes more a matter of “common sense” than pure logic, the line of demarcation is flexible, and attempts to lay down uniform tests which apply evenly in all situations have failed. That does not mean general guidelines and approaches to analysis cannot be constructed.</p>
<p id="76d1e087-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The threshold question in examining causation is whether the defendant’s act was an “actual cause” of the victim’s injury.

<p id="76d1e089-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosser and Keeton, in an in-depth discussion of the dynamics of foresight, conclude that although it is desirable to exclude extremely remarkable and unusual results from the purview of proximate cause, it is virtually impossible to express a logical verbal formula which will produce uniform results. (Prosser &amp; Keeton, [Torts] 300 [(5th ed. 1984)].) I agree. The standard should be simply stated, exclude extraordinary results, and allow the trier of fact to determine the issue on the particular facts of the case using “the common sense of the common man as to common things.” As with other ultimate issues, appellate courts must review that determination, giving due deference to the trier of fact. The “highly extraordinary result” standard serves that purpose. It is consistent with the definition of foreseeability used in California. It does not involve the defendant’s state of mind, but focuses upon the objective conditions present when he acts.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100EA_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100EA_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">19</a></span>

<p id="76d1e08c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The result was not highly extraordinary. Although a two-helicopter collision was unknown to expert witness Turner and no reported cases describe one, it was “a possible consequence which reasonably might have been contemplated.” Given the emotional dynamics of any police pursuit, there is an “appreciable probability” that one of the pursuers, in the heat of the chase, may act negligently or recklessly to catch the quarry. That no pursuits have ever before resulted in a helicopter crash or midair collision is more a comment on police flying skill and technology than upon the innate probabilities involved. . . . Given these circumstances, a finding of proximate cause is appropriate. . . .

<i>1. </i>People v. Brady, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 286 (Ct. App. 2005), involved the mid-air collision of two firefighting planes that were attempting to extinguish a fire in a remote wooded area. Defendant had recklessly started the fire, which quickly spread to his clandestine methamphetamine lab nearby, setting off an intense blaze. When fire control aircraft arrived on the scene, one pilot deviated from the customary flight pattern, approached from the wrong direction, and crashed into another plane, killing himself and the other pilot. Defendant was convicted of causing both deaths. The appellate court upheld the jury’s finding that the deaths were reasonably foreseeable, in part because—given the location of the fire—an effort to control it was bound to require a number of aircraft flying at low altitude. Was there a comparable degree of foreseeability in <i>Acosta</i>? If not, was the helicopter crash in the latter case nonetheless <i>sufficiently</i> foreseeable? What criteria determine when the likelihood of a given outcome is <i>too</i> remote?</p>

<p id="76d207aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The causation requirement has two components: The defendant’s wrongful act must be both the <i>factual</i> cause and the <i>proximate</i> cause of the relevant <span title="608" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-608">p. 608</span>harm. Factual cause, sometimes called the “but-for” or “<i>sine qua non</i>” requirement, is straightforward; it simply means that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant’s act. Proximate cause is more complicated; the act, in addition to being a but-for cause, must have a close relationship to the resulting harm. But how close is close enough? The answers are elusive. As the Supreme Court has explained (Paroline v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1710, 1719 (2014)): “[P]roximate cause, as distinct from actual cause or cause in fact, defies easy summary. It is a flexible concept, . . . often explicated in terms of foreseeability or the scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct. A requirement of proximate cause thus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations where the causal link between conduct and result is so attenuated that the consequence is more aptly described as mere fortuity.”</p>
<p id="76d22ebb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most causation problems present only this second set of issues. Note, for example, the eight hypotheticals presented at the outset of this section, pp. 603-604 supra. Nearly all of them easily meet the factual cause requirement. (Which of them does not?) Similarly in <i>Acosta</i>, only the second set of issues is debatable; there is no doubt that, as the court states, “but for Acosta’s conduct . . . , the helicopters would never have been in position for the crash.”</p>
<p id="76d22ebc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By comparison to the elusive concept of <i>proximate</i> cause, <i>factual</i> causation seems an uncontroversial requirement. Suppose, for example, that one of the pilots pursuing Acosta had a heart attack and died, not because of the stress of the events but solely because of a blood clot that would have produced fatal results at that moment no matter what the pilot was doing. In such a case, there is no reason to hold Acosta responsible for the death; indeed statutes and case law typically treat factual causation as an invariable prerequisite to liability. See, e.g., MPC §2.03(1)(a).</p>
<p id="76d22ebd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Would it ever make sense to treat conduct as a legal cause even though it is not a factual cause? Consider these cases:</p>
<p id="76d22ebe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. State v. Montoya, 61 P.3d 793 (N.M. 2002).</i> A private bodyguard shot and severely wounded Lowery. Montoya, one of the shooter’s associates, then drove the victim to a secluded location and left him there to die. Montoya was convicted of murder on the theory that he had caused the death by preventing Lowery from getting help. The testimony, however, established only that immediate medical attention “could have” saved Lowery’s life. Should the conviction be upheld on appeal? Since a necessary element of a murder case is proof that the defendant’s conduct caused death, the prosecution had to prove <i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i> that, but for Montoya’s actions, Lowery would have survived. The evidence could not support that conclusion, and the appellate court reversed the conviction. But does it make sense for Montoya—who <i>wanted</i> Lowery to die—to escape a murder conviction simply by showing that his victim <i>might</i> have died anyway?</p>
<p id="76d22ebf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. State v. Muro, 695 N.W.2d 425 (Neb. 2005).</i> The defendant came home to discover that her husband had beaten their daughter, fracturing her skull. She waited four hours before summoning medical attention, and <span title="609" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-609">p. 609</span>the daughter died later that night. The Nebraska Supreme Court held that because the state had proved “only the <i>possibility</i> of survival with earlier treatment,” it had failed to prove but-for causation beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 432. Note the clash between the requirements of mens rea and those of causation. If early treatment would have given the child a 90 percent chance of survival, the mother’s failure to summon help would show a high level of culpability—extreme recklessness or negligence. But the same probability (a 90 percent chance of survival) would defeat causation, because of the 10 percent chance that the child would have died just as quickly anyway. For criticism of courts’ insistence on proof of but-for causation in cases where the defendant deprives the victim of a <i>chance</i> of survival, see Eric A. Johnson, Criminal Liability for Loss of a Chance, 91 Iowa L. Rev. 59 (2005).</p>

<i>3. Burrage v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 881 (2014).</i> A federal statute imposes a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who unlawfully distributes a controlled substance, when “death or serious bodily injury results.” Joshua Banka died following an extended drug binge. Drugs present in his system at the time of death included heroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metabolites, and oxycodone. Experts testified that heroin supplied by the defendant “was a contributing factor” in Banka’s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to stop Banka’s breathing. If Banka had not taken the heroin, his death would still have been possible but much less likely. The jury convicted on the mandatory minimum count, after being instructed that to do so it would have to find that the heroin was a “contributing cause of Banka’s death.” The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the statute’s “results” element reflected the traditional requirement of but-for causation, which was not satisfied on these facts. The prosecution, noting that “at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010 involved more than one drug” argued that strict but-for causation should not be required, so long as a drug distributed by the defendant was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in producing the result. Rejecting that approach, the Court explained (id. at 887-892):</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Does <i>Burrage</i>’s insistence on a strict but-for connection bring reasonable certainty to the causation analysis?

<span class="epub-small-caps">MILONAS</span>, J. The defendant was indicted on September 28, 1977 for two counts of murder in the second degree and arson in the third degree after he allegedly intentionally set fire to a couch, thus causing a serious fire on the fifth floor of an abandoned building at 358 East 8th Street in New York County. The New York City Fire Department, in responding to the conflagration, arrived to find the rear portion of the fifth and sixth floors burning. The firemen attempted to bring the situation under control, but making no progress and there being no additional assistance available, they decided to withdraw from the building. At that point, they were suddenly enveloped by a dense smoke, which was later discovered to have arisen from another independent fire that had broken out on the second floor.</p><p id="76d255d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although this fire was also determined to have originated in arson, there is virtually no evidence implicating the defendant in its responsibility. However, the combination of the thick smoke and the fifth floor fire made evacuation from the premises extremely hazardous, and, in the process, Fireman Martin Celic sustained injuries from which he subsequently died. Accordingly, the defendant was accused [in the first count] of murder in the second degree for having, “Under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person,” thereby causing the death of Martin Celic, and [alternatively, in the second count] with felony murder. The third charge of the indictment, arson, is not at issue for purposes of the instant application.</p><p id="76d255d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the defendant’s contention that the evidence before the grand jury is insufficient to support the first two counts. He argues that . . . murder requires a causal link between the underlying crime and the death, a connection which, in the defendant’s view, is here lacking.</p><p id="76d255da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In] People v. Kibbe, 321 N.E.2d 773 (N.Y. 1974), the Court of Appeals affirmed the [murder] conviction of defendants who had abandoned their helplessly intoxicated robbery victim by the side of a dark road in subfreezing temperature, one-half mile from the nearest structure, without shoes or eyeglasses, with his trousers at his ankles, his shirt pulled up and his outer <span title="611" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-611">p. 611</span>clothing removed. The court held that while the deceased was actually killed by a passing truck, the defendants’ conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the ensuing death to warrant criminal liability and that “it is not necessary that the ultimate harm be intended by the actor. It will suffice if it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt, as indeed it can here be said, that the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to the acts of the accused.”</p><p id="76d255db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clearly, an obscure or merely probable connection between the defendant’s conduct and another person’s death is not enough to support a charge of homicide. People v. Stewart, [358 N.E.2d 487 (N.Y. 1976)]. In <i>Stewart</i>, the victim had been operated upon for a stab wound in the stomach inflicted by the defendant. Afterwards, the surgeon performed an entirely unrelated hernia procedure on him, and he died. According to the court, “the prosecutor must, at least, prove that the defendant’s conduct was an actual cause of death, in the sense that it forged a link in the chain of causes which actually brought about the death. . . . ” In this instance, the possibility that death resulted from a factor not attributable to the defendant could not be ruled out beyond a reasonable doubt, since the patient would, in all likelihood, have survived except for the hernia operation. . . . 
</p><p id="76d255dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he defendant’s conduct need not be the sole and exclusive factor in the victim’s death. In the standard established by <i>People v. Kibbe</i>, supra, and <i>People v. Stewart</i>, supra, an individual is criminally liable if his conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death, and the ultimate harm is something which should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to his acts. It is irrelevant that, in this instance, the fire which had erupted on the second floor intervened, thus contributing to the conditions that culminated in the death of Fireman Celic. In <i>Kibbe</i>, the victim was killed when he was struck by a truck. This did not relieve the defendants in that case from criminal responsibility for his murder, as it does not absolve the defendant here. Certainly, it was foreseeable that firemen would respond to the situation, thus exposing them, along with the persons already present in the vicinity, to a life-threatening danger. The fire set by the defendant was an indispensable link in the chain of events that resulted in the death. It continued to burn out of control, greatly adding to the problem of evacuating the building by blocking off one of the access routes. At the very least, the defendant’s act, as was the case in <i>Kibbe</i>, placed the deceased in a position where he was particularly vulnerable to the separate and independent force, in this instance, the fire on the second floor.</p><p id="76d255dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consequently, the defendant’s motion to dismiss the [murder counts] of the indictment is denied.</p></div>

<p id="76d255e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendant corporation and several of its officers and employees were indicted for second-degree manslaughter (N.Y. Penal Law §125.15, p. 449 supra) and criminally negligent homicide (N.Y. Penal Law §125.10, p. 449 supra). Several of the corporation’s employees were killed and many more were injured in a massive explosion at one of its chewing-gum factories. Evidence before the grand jury <span title="612" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-612">p. 612</span>showed that the corporation used magnesium stearate (MS), a potentially explosive substance, in its manufacturing process; that defendants had been warned by their insurance carrier that the high concentrations of MS dust created an explosion hazard; and that the hazard had not been eliminated by the time of the accident. On the issue of what triggered the explosion, there was no hard proof; experts speculated that it could have been caused by sparking in the machinery or by a concentration of MS igniting under the impact of a moving metal part. The court held the evidence before the grand jury insufficient to establish the foreseeability of the immediate, triggering cause of the explosion and therefore dismissed the indictment. The court stated:]</p>
<p id="76d255e1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been the position of the People that but-for causation is all that is required for the imposition of criminal liability. [T]heir submission, reduced to its simplest form, [is] that there was evidence of a foreseeable and indeed foreseen risk of explosion of MS dust and that in consequence of defendants’ failure to remove the dust a fatal explosion occurred. The chain of physical events by which the explosion was set off, i.e., its particular cause, is to them a matter of total indifference. [T]he People contended that liability could be imposed if the cause of the explosion were the lighting of a match by an uninvited intruder or the striking of a bolt of lightning. In effect they would hold defendants to the status of guarantors until the ambient dust was removed. It thus appears that the People would invoke an expanded application of proximate cause principles lifted from the civil law of torts.</p>
<p id="76d255e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have rejected the application of any such sweeping theory of culpability under our criminal law. . . . [In <i>People v. Kibbe</i> (discussed in the <i>Arzon</i> case, supra)] the critical issue was whether the defendants should be held criminally liable for murder when the particular cause of death was vehicular impact rather than freezing. Under the theory now advanced by the People it would have been irrelevant that death had been the consequence of one particular chain of causation rather than another; it would have been enough that the defendants exposed their victim to the risk of death and that he died. That, of course, was not the analysis of culpability that we adopted. [W]e held that . . . “the defendants’ actions must be a <i>sufficiently direct cause</i> of the ensuing death before there can be any imposition of criminal liability, and recognize[d], of course, that this standard is greater than that required [for] tort liability.” Thus, we were concerned for the nature of the chain of particularized events which in fact led to the victim’s death; it was not enough that death had occurred as the result of the defendants’ abandonment of their helpless victim. To analogize the factual situation in the case now before us to that in <i>Kibbe</i> it might be hypothesized that the abandoned victim in <i>Kibbe</i> instead of being either frozen to death or killed when struck by a passing motor vehicle was killed when struck by an airplane making an emergency landing on the highway or when hit by a stray bullet from a hunter’s rifle—occasions of death not reasonably to have been foreseen when the defendants abandoned their victim.</p>

<i>1. Statutory standards.</i> Most state codes include no explicit rules for determining causation. In these jurisdictions, the courts are left to decide the question on the basis of evolving common-law principles. MPC §2.03 seeks to articulate an appropriate standard, and roughly a dozen states have adopted causation provisions based on it. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.03 at 264-265 (1985). Does the MPC standard clarify the issues?

<i>2. The specific causal mechanism.</i> Is <i>Warner-Lambert</i> sound in requiring that the defendant foresee the specific triggering cause of the explosion? In recent decisions, the New York courts have limited the “specific-causal-mechanism” requirement to contexts that involve “a commercial or manufacturing process,” and have held it inapplicable where fires lead to fatalities in residential settings. See People v. Rios, 907 N.Y.S.2d 440 n.9 (Sup. Ct. 2010). But if the specific-causal-mechanism requirement is sound, shouldn’t it apply in residential situations as well? If we can’t determine how a fire started, should the person who creates a hazardous condition be liable anyway, because it is plausible to assume that the fatal spark was produced in some ordinary way? Or should that person escape liability, because the prosecution has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the fatal spark was <i>not</i> produced in some bizarre, unforeseeable way?</p>

<i>3. Questioning the foreseeability test.</i> Professor Michael Moore argues that the concept of foreseeability is inherently manipulable, because “there are many equally accurate ways to describe any particular [harm-causing event],” and thus conclusions about foreseeability inevitably depend on the level of generality at which we choose to describe what occurred.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1029E_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1029E_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> If Professor Moore is right, how <i>should</i> causation issues be decided?</p>

<p id="76d27cfa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose a defendant sells an illegal drug to a person who, not wanting to be seen ingesting it, takes it into his bathroom, and while he is there the bathroom ceiling collapses and kills him. Had he not ingested the drug, he would not have been killed. But it would be strange to think that the seller of the drug was punishable [for that death]. “Cause” in law [ordinarily is] the name we attach to a but-for cause . . . that we’re particularly interested in, often because we want to eliminate it. We want to eliminate arson, but we don’t want to <span title="614" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-614">p. 614</span>eliminate oxygen, so we call arson the cause of a fire set for an improper purpose rather than calling the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere the cause, though it is a but-for cause just as the arsonist’s setting the fire is. We say that the cause of the death of the drug taker in the bathroom was the improper design or construction of the ceiling rather than the sale of the drug. The reason is that the sale of the drug . . . did not increase the risk that this sort of mishap would occur. Punishing a drug seller does not reduce building accidents. Punishing him more severely because of the buyer’s death in the bathroom would not cause drug dealers to take care to prevent their sales of drugs from leading by so indirect a route to the death of a buyer.</p>

<p id="76d2cb30-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose that an intruder pushes a small child into a pool; the child’s babysitter deliberately refuses to come to its aid, and the child then drowns. The babysitter clearly had a duty to save the child, but can we say that the babysitter <i>caused</i> the child to drown? It is sometimes argued that only the intruder, not the babysitter, can be considered the cause of the child’s death. See Michael Moore, Act and Crime 78 et seq. (1993).</p>
<p id="76d2cb31-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the argument convincing? A result rarely has only one but-for cause. A number of conditions may be necessary for an event to occur (in the case of a fire—wood, paper, a breeze, the striking of a match). The babysitter’s omission is a necessary condition in the same sense: But for the sitter’s failure to aid, the child would not have died. Does it follow that every passer-by who failed to rescue the child also must be considered the cause of its death? One solution is to say that omissions by the passers-by are indeed necessary conditions, and thus causes—but nonculpable causes—of the result, because they have <i>no duty</i> to aid the child. Whatever we think of these conceptual difficulties, courts are uniformly willing to treat an omission as the legal cause of a result in situations where there is a duty to act. See, e.g., <i>Jones v. United States</i>, p. 234 supra.</p>

<i>1. A puzzle.</i> Defendant shoots at Lucky, intending to kill him. The bullet misses but strikes and kills Unlucky, perhaps because the bullet ricocheted in an odd way. Is Defendant guilty of murdering Unlucky, regardless of how unforeseeable that killing may have been? The answer in all jurisdictions is yes. The conceptual justification is the doctrine of transferred intent, according to which Defendant’s intent to kill Lucky is “transferred” to his action that killed Unlucky.</p>

[Defendant Kevorkian allegedly assisted in the deaths of Sherry Miller and Marjorie Wantz on October 23, 1991, roughly a year before Michigan enacted a statute that prohibited assisting a suicide. He was indicted on two counts of murder. The circuit judge dismissed the charges, concluding that assisting in suicide does not fall within the crime of murder. On appeal, the court of appeals concluded that the circuit court erred in quashing the information. Kevorkian appealed that ruling to the Michigan Supreme Court.]</p>

Each separately had sought defendant Kevorkian’s assistance in ending her life. The women and several friends and relatives met the defendant at a cabin in Oakland County on October 23, 1991.</p>
<p id="76d3408b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to the testimony presented at the defendant’s preliminary examination, the plan was to use his “suicide machine.” The device consisted of a board to which one’s arm is strapped to prevent movement, a needle to be inserted into a blood vessel and attached to IV tubing, and containers of various chemicals that are to be released through the needle into the <span title="621" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-621">p. 621</span>bloodstream. Strings are tied to two of the fingers of the person who intends to die. The strings are attached to clips on the IV tubing that control the flow of the chemicals. [T]he person raises that hand, releasing . . . anesthesia rapidly. When the person falls asleep, the hand drops, pulling the other string, which [allows] potassium chloride to flow into the body in concentrations sufficient to cause death.</p>
<p id="76d3408c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant tried several times, without success, to insert the suicide-machine needle into Ms. Miller’s arm and hand. He then left the cabin, returning several hours later with a cylinder of carbon monoxide gas and a mask apparatus. He attached a screw driver to the cylinder, and showed Ms. Miller how to use the tool as a lever to open the gas valve. The defendant then turned his attention to Ms. Wantz. He was successful in inserting the suicide-machine needle into her arm. The defendant explained to Ms. Wantz how to activate the device. . . . The device was activated, and Ms. Wantz died.</p>
<p id="76d3408d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant then placed the mask apparatus on Ms. Miller. The only witness at the preliminary examination who was present at the time said that Ms. Miller opened the gas valve by pulling on the screw driver. The cause of her death was determined to be carbon-monoxide poisoning. . . .

Roberts, 178 N.W. 690 (1920). . . . In <i>Roberts</i>, the defendant’s wife was suffering from advanced multiple sclerosis and in great pain. She previously had attempted suicide and, according to the defendant’s statements at the plea proceeding, requested that he provide her with poison. He agreed, and placed a glass of poison within her reach. She drank the mixture and died. The defendant was charged with murder. He pleaded guilty, and the trial court determined the crime to be murder in the first degree.</p>

<i>1. Subsequent Kevorkian cases.</i> Kevorkian allegedly continued to help others commit suicide after the enactment of Michigan’s assisted-suicide statute, and accordingly he was charged under the new statute as well. Meanwhile, in an effort to help another patient, he personally injected lethal drugs into a 52-year-old man suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease. He also made a videotape of his actions, gave the tape to CBS News (which aired it on prime-time television), and dared prosecutors to file charges against him. They did so, and in March 1999, Kevorkian was convicted of murder, not assisted suicide, because he himself had administered the fatal injection. He was sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison, served eight years, and was paroled in 2007, after assuring officials that he would never again participate in another person’s efforts to end his or her life.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105AF_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105AF_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span>

<i>2. Current law.</i> The <i>Campbell</i> and <i>Kevorkian</i> cases reflect generally prevailing American law: One who successfully urges or assists another to commit suicide is not guilty of murder, at least so long as the deceased was mentally responsible and was not forced or deceived. Most states also reject the possibility of a manslaughter or negligent homicide conviction, provided again that the deceased’s actions were fully voluntary.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105C4_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105C4_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> In accord, MPC §210.5(1) permits convicting a person of criminal homicide for causing another to take his life, but “only if he purposely causes such suicide by force, duress or deception.”</p>
<p id="76d367b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states that follow this approach do not permit defendants like Campbell and Kevorkian to act with impunity, however. A majority of the states now have statutes that define a separate offense for assisting a suicide. Many are similar to MPC §210.5(2), which makes the offense a felony (punishable at the same level as manslaughter).</p>

<span title="624" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-624">p. 624</span>Under this statutory scheme, what should be the result on the facts of People v. Minor, 898 N.Y.S.2d 440 (Sup. Ct. 2010)? Seeking to commit suicide, the decedent, sitting in the driver’s seat of his car, convinced the defendant to hold a knife against the steering wheel while the decedent repeatedly lunged into the knife, causing fatal wounds. Did the defendant murder the decedent or merely assist him in committing suicide?</p>
<p id="76d367b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutes that punish those who assist another to commit suicide are controversial. Many argue that there should be a constitutional right, statutory right, or criminal-law justification defense for doctors who help terminally ill patients or others in extreme pain to commit suicide. In Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997), the Supreme Court held that individuals who wish to commit suicide have no constitutional right to obtain assistance in doing so. But jurisdictions remain free to permit such assistance by statute; the Netherlands and at least two American states (Washington and Oregon) have done so. That aspect of the subject is explored in the material on justifications, Chapter 8.B, infra.</p>
<p id="76d367b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. An exception for reckless or negligent aid?</i> In footnote 70, the <i>Kevorkian</i> opinion draws an important distinction: One who intentionally provides another person with the means to commit suicide cannot be convicted of murder, but the court suggests that one who <i>recklessly or negligently</i> makes such means available to a person who is “intoxicated and despondent or agitated” can sometimes be convicted of a lesser degree of homicide, such as involuntary manslaughter. What is the logic of this position? The court’s footnote focuses on whether the person providing aid has a sufficiently reckless mens rea, but isn’t this the wrong question? If the decedent is sufficiently rational for his actions to constitute a superseding cause, how can the defendant be convicted of causing any homicide at all?</p>
<p id="76d38dc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the court meant to imply that intoxication or despondency can render the suicide victim’s act insufficiently voluntary to constitute a superseding cause. But recall that Campbell was not considered responsible for Basnaw’s suicide, even though Basnaw was heavily intoxicated and Campbell, though he realized this, still gave Basnaw a gun and encouraged him to use it. At what point does a suicide victim’s intoxication or despondency become sufficient to render the person who helps him guilty of homicide?</p>

<i>1. Foreseeability versus autonomy.</i> Basnaw’s suicide was a readily foreseeable result of Campbell’s actions. Likewise, the death of Kevorkian’s patients was readily foreseeable. Indeed, both Campbell and Kevorkian wanted their actions to have precisely the effects they had. If the applicable doctrine is the foreseeability test reflected in cases like <i>Acosta</i>, p. 604, Campbell and Kevorkian would surely be seen as causing the death of others. Why doesn’t the foreseeability test of causation apply in cases like theirs?</p>

<span title="625" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-625">p. 625</span>A leading explanation points to a strain in our culture that treats human action as different from physical events.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1060B_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1060B_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span> We tend to regard a person’s acts as the product of his or her choice, not as events governed by physical laws. This view (roughly, the hypothesis of free will) is of course hotly contested in philosophical literature. But whether accurate or not, the assumption of free will reflects the way most people in our culture respond to human action, and it reflects the premise on which notions of blame in the criminal law ultimately rest. Naturally, the rules of causation in the law tend to embody the same premise.</p>
<p id="76d38dcb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result, the law of causation treats <i>physical events</i> produced by a person’s actions as “caused” by him or her, but it ordinarily does not treat <i>human</i> action produced by an initial actor’s conduct as “caused” by the initial actor, even when the subsequent human action is entirely foreseeable.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1061D_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1061D_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span> The second person’s actions are chosen and caused by him or her alone.

Glanville Williams explains:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1062B_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1062B_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">7</a></span>

<p id="76d38dce-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The legal attitude, in general, rests on what is known to philosophers as the principle of autonomy, which enters deeply into our traditional moral perceptions, reinforced by language. . . . The autonomy doctrine, expressing itself through its corollary, the doctrine of <i>novus actus interveniens</i>, teaches that the individual’s will is the autonomous (self-regulating) prime cause of behavior.</p>
</div>
<p id="76d38dcf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This conception of human action creates the need for special rules to govern the responsibility of one person for the acts of another. The law of causation is not available to ground the responsibility of the first actor, so other doctrines must be created to hold responsible those who instigate or help another to commit a crime. These doctrines, principally those of complicity and conspiracy, are explored in Chapter 7, infra.</p>

<i>3. Encouraging the reluctant actor.</i> Consider the recent charges against a Massachusetts teenager who allegedly sent her boyfriend dozens of text messages urging him to commit suicide. Ultimately, he sat in a truck filled with carbon monoxide fumes, planning to take his own life. When he got out of the truck, uncertain whether to go through with the plan, the girl allegedly texted him to “get back in,” pressed him to follow through, and scolded him for having doubts; in another text message, she allegedly wrote: “You can’t think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it. Like I don’t get why you aren’t.”</p>
<p id="76d3b4e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Massachusetts does not have a law against encouraging or assisting suicide, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld an indictment for involuntary manslaughter. The court said there was evidence indicating that the defendant had put “constant pressure . . . on the victim, [who was] already [in a] delicate mental state,” “that there was probable cause to show that the coercive quality of the defendant’s verbal conduct overwhelmed whatever willpower the eighteen year old victim had to cope with his depression, and that but for the defendant’s admonishments, pressure, and instructions, the victim would not have gotten back into the truck and poisoned himself to death.” Commonwealth v. Carter, 2016 Mass. LEXIS 384, at *22, *24-25 (Mass. July 1, 2016).</p>
<p id="76d3b4e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are those alleged facts sufficient to support a judgment that the defendant “caused” the victim’s death?

Defendant had her drink a bottle of milk and offered to take her to a hospital, but she refused. Defendant then drove her home. On the way, deceased’s pain grew worse, and she screamed for a doctor. Defendant, however, did not stop until he reached his home. Soon thereafter she was taken to her parents. They summoned a doctor, who treated her, and in the ensuing ten days, all her wounds healed normally except one, which became infected. She grew worse and died, although the infected wound had healed at the time of her death. The medical cause of death was a combination of shock, loss of food and rest, action of the poison and the infection, and lack of early treatment, probably none of which, individually, would have been sufficient to produce death.</p><p id="76d3dbfb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The indictment charged defendant with murder arising from the following: that on March 16 he kidnapped the deceased, detained her on a railroad train en route to Chicago, struck, bit, and grievously wounded her with intent to rape in a drawing room on the train, and forced her to get off at Hammond and to occupy a hotel bed with him; that on March 17 deceased, “distracted with the pain and shame so inflicted upon her,” swallowed poison; that defendant neither administered an antidote nor called for medical help although able to do so; that the same day he forced her into a car and drove her back to Indianapolis where he kept her in his garage without administering an antidote or calling for medical help until March 18; and that she died on April 14 “from the effects of her wounds inflicted as aforesaid and said poison taken as aforesaid.”</p><p id="76d3dbfc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The jury found defendant guilty of murder, and the state supreme court affirmed.]</p><p id="76d3dbfd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">PER CURIAM</span>. [Appellant] argues that the evidence does not show appellant guilty of murder. He points out . . . that, after they reached the hotel, Madge Oberholtzer left the hotel and purchased a hat and the poison, and voluntarily returned to his room, and at the time she took the poison she was in an adjoining room to him, and that she swallowed the poison without his knowledge, and at a time when he was not present. From these facts he contends that she took her life by committing suicide; that her own act in taking poison was [the act of] an intervening responsible agent which broke the causal connection between his acts and the death; that . . . the taking of the poison was the proximate cause of death. . . . 
</p><p id="76d3dbfe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case of State v. Preslar, [48 N.C. 421 (1856)], the defendant in the nighttime fought with his wife, and she left to go in the house of her father. When she reached a point about two hundred yards from her father’s home, she, for some reason, did not want to go in the house till morning, laid down on a bed cover, which she had wrapped around her, till daylight. The weather was cold and the next morning she could not walk, but made herself known. She afterwards died. The court held that the wife without necessity exposed <span title="628" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-628">p. 628</span>herself, and the defendant was not guilty. . . . But we do not believe that the rule stated in the above case is controlling here. . . . 
</p><p id="76d3dbff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Rex v. Valade (Que.), 26 Can. Cr. Cas. 233, where the accused induced a young girl under the age of consent to go along with him to a secluded apartment, and there had criminal sexual intercourse with her, following which she jumped from a window to the street to get away from him, and was killed by the fall, the accused was held guilty of murder. Bishop in his work on Criminal Law, vol. 2 (9th Ed.), page 484, says: “When suicide follows a wound inflicted by the defendant his act is homicidal, if deceased was rendered irresponsible by the wound and as a natural result of it.”</p><p id="76d3dc00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not understand that by the rule laid down by Bishop, supra, that the wound which renders the deceased mentally irresponsible is necessarily limited to a physical wound. We should think the same rule would apply if a defendant engaged in the commission of a felony such as rape or attempted rape, and inflicts upon his victim both physical and mental injuries, the natural and probable result of which would render the deceased mentally irresponsible and suicide followed, we think he would be guilty of murder. In the case at bar, appellant is charged with having caused the death of Madge Oberholtzer while engaged in the crime of attempted rape. The evidence shows that . . . appellant’s control and dominion over the deceased was absolute and complete [both on the train and subsequently at the hotel]. The evidence further shows that the deceased asked for money with which to purchase a hat, and it was supplied her by “Shorty,” at the direction of appellant, and that she did leave the room and was taken by Shorty to a shop and purchased a hat and then, at her request, to a drug store where she purchased the bichloride of mercury tablets, and then she was taken back to the room in the hotel, where . . . she swallowed the poison.</p><p id="76d3dc01-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant argues that the deceased was a free agent on this trip to purchase a hat, etc., and that she voluntarily returned to . . . the hotel. This was a question for the jury, and the evidence would justify them in reaching a contrary conclusion. Appellant’s chauffeur accompanied her on this trip, and the deceased had, before she left appellant’s home in Indianapolis, attempted to get away, and also made two unsuccessful attempts to use the telephone to call help. She was justified in concluding that any attempt she might make . . . to escape or secure assistance, would be no more successful in Hammond than it was in Indianapolis. We think the evidence shows that the deceased was at all times from the time she was entrapped by the appellant at his home on the evening of March 15th till she returned to her home two days later, in the custody and absolute control of appellant. Neither do we think the fact that the deceased took the poison some four hours after they left the drawing-room on the train or after the crime of attempted rape had been committed necessarily prevents it from being a part of the attempted rape. . . . At the very moment Madge Oberholtzer swallowed the poison she was subject to the passion, desire, and will of appellant. She knew not what moment she would be subjected to the same demands that she was while in the drawing-room on the train. . . . The same forces, the same impulses, that would impel her to shoot <span title="629" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-629">p. 629</span>herself during the actual attack or throw herself out of the car window after the attack had ceased, [were] pressing and overwhelming her at the time she swallowed the poison. The evidence shows that she was so weak that she staggered as she left the elevator to go to the room in the hotel, and was assisted by appellant and Gentry; that she was very ill, so much that she could not eat, all of which was the direct and proximate result of the treatment accorded to her by appellant. . . . 
</p><p id="76d3dc02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To say that there is no causal connection between the acts of appellant and the death of Madge Oberholtzer, and that the treatment accorded her by appellant had no causal connection with the death of Madge Oberholtzer would be a travesty on justice. The whole criminal program was so closely connected that we think it should be treated as one transaction, and should be governed by the same principles of law as was applied in the case of . . .  <i>Valade</i>, supra. We therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient and justified the jury in finding that appellant . . . rendered the deceased distracted and mentally irresponsible, and that such was the natural and probable consequence of such unlawful and criminal treatment, and that the appellant was guilty of murder [as charged].</p></div>

</div><p id="76d3dc06-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the outset it is clear that homicide cannot be committed by the defendant unless the intervening actor who strikes the fatal blow has been rendered irresponsible by defendant’s unlawful act. This act may provide another with the opportunity, the instrument, or the motive for striking, but if it leaves him sane, the courts will not look behind the last responsible, self-determining actor. . . . Suppose a man commits suicide after losing all his money to a criminal swindler; is the swindler guilty of homicide? . . . Our common law, whatever may be said of divine law, does not hold him responsible for the death.</p><p id="76d40317-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A new element enters the situation when the intervening actor is insane. . . . Where a policeman was grappling with a lunatic to arrest him, and defendant by freeing his hand enabled the lunatic to shoot the policeman, defendant was held guilty of homicide. From this case we may derive the principle that an insane intervening actor will not break the causal connection between defendant’s act and the death.</p><p id="76d40318-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have been assuming, however, that the intervening actor is already insane at the time of defendant’s act. The facts of <i>Stephenson v. State</i> put a further strain on the causal connection. To convict of homicide there, it was necessary to prove, not only that deceased was irresponsible when she took the poison, but also that defendant’s unlawful acts caused her irresponsibility. For such a conviction no square precedent is to be found. Indeed the cases reveal, if anything, a marked reluctance to permit proof of any purely mental link in the causal chain. . . . 
</p><p id="76d40319-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that certain psychological phenomena have been admitted to proof when they have been induced by physical violence. The mentally paralyzing effect of fear and the mentally unbalancing effect of pain and fever are sufficiently familiar to the average man so that he can pass a sound judgment upon <span title="630" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-630">p. 630</span>their causal relation. . . . Where a dangerous wound has been inflicted, which unseats the mind of deceased through pain or fever and so causes him to kill himself, the courts are . . . ready to hold defendant for homicide.</p><p id="76d4031a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These last cases come nearest to supporting the majority opinion in <i>Stephenson v. State</i>, but they are not squarely in point. The prosecution did not seriously contend, nor did the court think, that deceased was rendered irresponsible by the physical injuries, the bruises and bites, inflicted by defendant. It was rather the shame and humiliation of having been raped. . . . 
</p><p id="76d4031b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have noted above that all prior unlawful actors in the causal chain are insulated from liability if the person who strikes the fatal blow is a responsible, self-determining actor. [H]owever, [if] a man who takes his own life or another’s is [insane,] . . . criminal liability for the death may then be cast on the next previous actor. So also the actual killer’s responsibility will be destroyed if he acts innocently in ignorance of fact, or in necessary self-defense, or instinctively as a result of fear, or in pursuance of public duty. [B]ecause the reaction is natural and instinctive, the law holds for homicide the previous actor who unlawfully created the situation. . . . 
</p><p id="76d4031c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is difficult to fit <i>Stephenson v. State</i> into this picture of liability. True, the law justifies the taking of life when necessary to prevent the commission of rape. And had deceased been helpless in the manual grasp of defendant at the time of her suicidal act, or had a third-party defender, bursting upon the scene, shot her to death through faulty aim, then defendant might have been liable for her death within the principles developed above. But [the] predominant motive for her suicide, clearly, was not to escape further assault but to escape the shame of what had already been done to her. The case represents a new and doubtful departure in so far as it suggests that the unlawful infliction of shame and disgrace may lead so naturally to suicide as to amount to a killing by him who inflicted it.</p></div>

<i>1. Variations on</i> Stephenson. The <i>Stephenson</i> court emphasizes that until the victim returned to her home in Indianapolis, she “was at all times  . . . in the custody and absolute control of the appellant.” Is the court implying that the result would be different if she had taken the poison after she returned home to Indianapolis? Why should that situation be treated differently from <i>Stephenson</i> itself?</p>
<p id="76d40320-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possible answer might be that the victim’s suicidal act in the last situation would no longer be foreseeable. But isn’t such an act at least as foreseeable as the collision of the helicopters in <i>Acosta</i>? Another possible answer is that the two situations are not significantly different—that Stephenson should be held liable in both or in neither. With respect to those possibilities, consider the cases that follow.</p>

<i>2. Destroying the will to live.</i> In February 1993, Garcia was indicted for sexually assaulting a 79-year-old woman. When the woman died of heart <span title="631" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-631">p. 631</span>failure a month after the attack, he was also indicted for murder. Prosecutors argued that the woman died because Garcia “destroyed her will to live,” and pointed to testimony that the deceased cried daily after the incident and ceased talking about her future. Prosecutors analogized this case to one where a victim collapses of a heart attack during or shortly after the crime. A rape prosecutor expressed doubts about this theory: “I think they’ll have a huge causation problem. I mean, how many of my victims, down the road, either commit suicide or die of drug or alcohol abuse because of rape?” Junda Woo, Murder Charge in a Case of Rape Stretches Limits of Legal Theory, Wall St. <span class="epub-small-caps">J.</span>, Aug. 23, 1993, at B4.</p>

<i>3. Removing life support</i>. In an automobile collision caused by the defendant’s negligent driving, Carol Suprenant suffered severe injuries and was kept alive for several days by a ventilator that allowed her to breathe. As her breathing difficulties and other discomfort increased, she demanded to be taken off the ventilator, even though she understood that without it “her death was probable . . . and that conversely, her injuries were potentially survivable if she remained on the ventilator.” See Commonwealth v. Carlson, 849 N.E.2d 790, 793 (Mass. 2006). The doctors complied with her wishes, and she died a few hours later. Defendant was convicted of negligent homicide. What should be the result on appeal? Did the defendant cause Suprenant’s death, or did she voluntarily choose to end her own life?</p>

<i>4. The victim’s religious beliefs.</i> In Regina v. Blaue, [1975] 3 All E.R. 446, defendant had stabbed a girl. With proper treatment and a blood transfusion, her wounds would not have proved fatal. But as a Jehovah’s Witness, she refused a transfusion and died. In a situation like that in the previous Note, many would argue that Ms. Suprenant’s response, in refusing treatment, was not voluntary, because that treatment could only prolong her pain and discomfort. But in <i>Blaue</i> the treatment apparently would have restored the stabbing victim to health. Should that fact make a difference? Or do the victim’s religious beliefs make the blood transfusion an unacceptable alternative? Does the stabbing victim’s religious commitment make <i>Blaue</i> a preexisting-condition case (thus liability for homicide) or an intervening-actor case (thus no liability for homicide)?</p>

<i>1. Exposing the victim to homicidal third parties.</i> Consider the story of Uriah the Hittite, as told in the Bible, 2 Samuel 11, 12. Uriah was a captain in King David’s army. David ordered his general to place Uriah in the “forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down and die.” David’s motive was to be rid of Uriah so he could marry Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba. The plan worked: Uriah was killed in battle with the Ammonites, and David married Bathsheba. The judgment of the Lord upon King David: “You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with a sword, the man himself you murdered by the sword of the Ammonites.” Would it be <span title="632" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-632">p. 632</span>proper for a court to so hold under American law? If so, would King David’s liability depend on the prosecution’s ability to prove that he had ordered his own troops to draw back, leaving Uriah exposed? What should be the result if King David had ordered his army to fight in the usual way but had nonetheless selected Uriah to lead the troops from the most dangerous position because he hoped that Uriah would be killed?

<p id="76d42a37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A distinguished writer recently raised the question whether a general who orders his troops to battle intentionally kills those of his men who fall in action. He was considering this as a problem [of] intention. There may be some argument on intentionality, but none on the subject of killing. Obviously, it is the enemy, not the general, who kills the men. The reason why the general cannot be said to kill them is . . . not because he does not expect the deaths of many of them to follow from obedience to his command; and not because he is justified in issuing the command; it is simply that he has not committed or helped the act of killing, or influenced anybody to do the deed.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> How cogent is this analysis? Recall an analogous problem considered in connection with felony murder, p. 551 supra: Felons <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, holed up in a house, are fighting off the police. Felon <i>A</i> tells felon <i>B</i> to run out the back door where, he says, the coast is clear. He says that, though he knows police have the door well covered, because he wants <i>B</i> dead. Felon <i>B</i> dashes out the back door and is shot dead by police. The police, of course, are duty-bound to shoot, so their actions are not fully “voluntary.” But the same is true of the enemy soldiers who kill opposing troops in Williams’s example. Is it “[obvious that] it is the enemy, not the general, who kills the men”?</p>

<i>2. Who was “the hoss that caused the loss”?</i> In Bailey v. Commonwealth, 329 S.E.2d 37 (Va. 1985), an appeal from a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, the court summarized the facts as follows:</p>

<p id="76d42a3b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bailey and Murdock lived about two miles apart.

Bailey knew [this and] also knew that Murdock owned a handgun and had boasted “about how he would use it and shoot it and scare people off with it.” Bailey knew further that Murdock was easily agitated and that he became especially angry if anyone disparaged his war hero, General George S.

<i>1. The distinction between intentional and reckless choices by the subsequent actor.</i> As the preceding section indicates, the voluntary-intervening-actor doctrine means that the first actor in a sequence of events usually cannot be considered responsible for subsequent human action when the subsequent action is entirely voluntary. As a result, the first actor cannot be said to “cause” resulting harm, even when that harm is perfectly foreseeable. In the situations of this kind that we have seen so far, the subsequent actor <i>intended</i> to cause the harm in question. However, in many situations <span title="634" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-634">p. 634</span>(drag races are one recurring example), the subsequent actor—though arguably reckless—did not intend to cause the resulting harm. Should this difference in the second actor’s intent affect the liability of the first actor? The material in this section addresses that problem.</p>

<i>2. The exception for</i> involuntary <i>choices by the subsequent actor.</i> As in the cases involving subsequent actions <i>intended</i> to cause harm, the voluntary-intervening-actor doctrine in the setting of reckless subsequent conduct can be invoked only when the subsequent action reflects a voluntary choice. Courts therefore readily hold that a subsequent actor’s risky choices do not negate the liability of the first actor, when those choices result from a predicament created by the first actor. Consider these examples:</p>
<p id="76d4515a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) People v. Kern, 545 N.Y.S.2d 4 (App. Div. 1989).</i> [This case arose from the infamous “Howard Beach incident,” in which a group of white teenagers assaulted several black men who were walking in the neighborhood after their car had broken down. The teenagers chased the men, while wielding bats, screaming racial epithets, and threatening to kill them. One of the men, Griffith, tried to escape by running across a highway; he was struck by a car and killed. The defendants were convicted of manslaughter and appealed, arguing that there was insufficient evidence of causation. Upholding the convictions, the court stated:] [U]nder these circumstances, the defendants’ actions were a “sufficiently direct cause” of Griffith’s ensuing death so as to warrant the imposition of criminal liability. . . . [T]he only reasonable alternative left open to Griffith while being persistently chased and threatened by the defendants and their friends, several of whom were carrying weapons, was to seek safety by crossing the parkway where he unfortunately met his death. [I]t cannot be said that the defendants’ despicable conduct was not a sufficiently direct cause of Griffith’s death. The defendants will not be heard to complain that, in desperately fleeing their murderous assault, Griffith chose the wrong escape route.</p>

<i>(b) People v. Matos, 83 N.Y.2d 509 (1994).</i> The defendant, running from the scene of a robbery he had just committed, climbed a ladder to the roof of a building and fled in the dark across the Manhattan rooftops. The police officer chasing him fell down an air shaft and plunged 25 feet to his death. The New York Court of Appeals upheld a conviction for felony murder on the ground that the officer’s risky pursuit was in the performance of his duty and that his death was a foreseeable result of the defendant’s crime and subsequent flight.</p>
<p id="76d4515c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The puzzle about the subsequent actor’s voluntary choices.</i> It might seem irrelevant whether the subsequent conduct is intentional or merely reckless. After all, so long as the second actor is making a voluntary choice, we cannot easily say that this choice was “caused” by the first actor. Nonetheless, judicial intuitions sometimes change when the subsequent actor was merely reckless or negligent. In thinking through the cases that follow, consider whether there is good reason to apply the voluntary-intervening-actor doctrine <i>only</i> when the subsequent actor intends to cause harm.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">JONES</span>, C.J. The appellant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the death of his competitor in the course of an automobile race between them on a highway. . . . 
</p><p id="76d45162-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony . . . discloses that, on the night of the fatal accident, the defendant accepted the deceased’s challenge to engage in an automobile race; that the racing took place on a rural 3-lane highway; that the night was clear and dry, and traffic light; that the speed limit on the highway was 50 miles per hour; that, immediately prior to the accident, the two automobiles were being operated at varying speeds of from 70 to 90 miles per hour; that the accident occurred in a no-passing zone on the approach to a bridge where the highway narrowed to two directionally opposite lanes; that, at the time of the accident, the defendant was in the lead and was proceeding in his right hand lane of travel; that the deceased, in an attempt to pass the defendant’s automobile, when a truck was closely approaching from the opposite direction, swerved his car to the left, crossed the highway’s white dividing line and drove his automobile on the wrong side of the highway head-on into the oncoming truck with resultant fatal effect to himself.</p><p id="76d45163-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This evidence would of course amply support a conviction of the defendant for speeding, reckless driving and, perhaps, other violations of The Vehicle Code. [But] unlawful or reckless conduct is only one ingredient of the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Another essential and distinctly separate element of the crime is that the unlawful or reckless conduct . . . was the <i>direct</i> cause of [death]. The first ingredient is obviously present in this case but, just as plainly, the second is not.</p><p id="76d47874-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While precedent is to be found for application of the tort law concept of “proximate cause” in fixing responsibility for criminal homicide, the want of any rational basis for its use in determining criminal liability can no longer be properly disregarded. When proximate cause was first borrowed from the field of tort law and applied to homicide prosecutions in Pennsylvania, the concept connoted a much more direct causal relation in producing the alleged culpable result than it does today. Proximate cause, as an essential element of a tort founded in negligence, has undergone in recent times, and is still undergoing, a marked extension. More specifically, this area of civil law has been progressively liberalized in favor of claims for damages for personal injuries to which careless conduct of others can in some way be associated. To persist in applying the tort liability concept of proximate cause to prosecutions for criminal homicide after the marked expansion of <i>civil</i> liability of defendants in tort actions for negligence would be to extend possible <i>criminal</i> liability to persons chargeable with unlawful or reckless conduct in circumstances not generally considered to present the likelihood of a resultant death. . . .

[T]he defendant’s reckless conduct was not a sufficiently direct cause of the competing driver’s death to make him criminally liable therefor.</p><p id="76d47878-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Reversed.]</p><p id="76d47879-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">EAGEN</span>, J., dissenting. . . . If the defendant did not engage in the unlawful race and so operate his automobile in such a reckless manner, this accident would never have occurred. He helped create the dangerous event. He was a vital part of it. The victim’s acts were a natural reaction to the stimulus of the situation. The race, the attempt to pass the other car and forge ahead, the reckless speed, all of these factors the defendant himself helped create. . . .  That the victim’s response was normal under the circumstances, that his reaction should have been expected and was clearly foreseeable, is to me beyond argument. That the defendant’s recklessness was a substantial factor is obvious. All of this, in my opinion, makes his unlawful conduct a direct cause of the resulting collision. . . .

<i>2.</i> Perez-Cervantes stabbed Thomas in the back and side. Thomas was treated at a hospital and released in stable condition. After his release, he resumed his prior consumption of cocaine. The drug raised his blood pressure and caused his internal wounds to bleed again; within a week he died from internal bleeding. Is Perez-Cervantes responsible for Thomas’s death? As we have seen, Note 4, p. 614 supra, when a defendant’s act proves fatal because of the victim’s unforeseeable but preexisting condition, the defendant can be held responsible for homicide, under the doctrine that “he takes his victim as he finds him.” Is Perez-Cervantes therefore guilty of homicide? Or is he not guilty, because Thomas’s act of taking cocaine after his release from the hospital constitutes an intervening cause? Should the answer depend on whether Thomas’s preexisting condition was simply prior experience with cocaine, or whether instead he was <i>addicted</i>, so that his actions after the offense could be considered “involuntary”? See State v. Perez-Cervantes, 6 P.3d 1160 (Wash. 2000).</p>
<p id="76d47880-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall that in <i>State v. Lane</i>, p. 614 supra, the defendant was found guilty of manslaughter after he punched a drunk, who then died from brain swelling attributable to the impact of the punch on a brain affected by chronic alcoholism. Thus, the upshot of the vulnerable-victim and intervening-actor doctrines seems to be that Lane is liable, because his victim’s substance abuse occurred before the illegal blow, but that Perez-Cervantes may not be liable because his victim’s substance abuse occurred, in part, after the illegal blow. Does this difference in results make sense? Is there any sound policy reason for treating the two cases differently?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">ALLBEE</span>, J. This case stems from a drag race between defendant Michael Dwayne McFadden and another driver, Matthew Sulgrove. . . . Sulgrove lost control of his automobile and swerved into a lane of oncoming traffic, where he struck a lawfully operated northbound vehicle. This third vehicle contained a six-year-old passenger, Faith Ellis, who was killed in the collision along with Sulgrove. Defendant’s automobile did not physically contact either of the two colliding vehicles.</p><p id="76d49f96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant was charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. . . . Having waived a jury, defendant was tried to the court and convicted and sentenced on both counts. In this appeal, . . . defendant’s main contention is that proof of the causation element . . . was lacking.</p><p id="76d49f97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="638" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-638">p. 638</span>[In the deaths of both Ellis and Sulgrove, the trial court found the defendant guilty under two distinct theories. One was that he had aided and abetted Sulgrove in Sulgrove’s commission of involuntary manslaughter and was therefore vicariously responsible for Sulgrove’s crimes. This kind of vicarious liability and the aiding-and-abetting doctrine are examined beginning at p. 691 infra. The trial court’s other theory was] that defendant himself committed the crime of involuntary manslaughter by recklessly engaging in a drag race so as to proximately cause the Sulgrove-Ellis collision.</p><p id="76d49f98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Although a vicarious liability theory may be sufficient to convict defendant for the death of Faith Ellis, the same is not true with regard to the death of Sulgrove. This is because the involuntary manslaughter statute requires proof that the perpetrator caused the death of “another person.” Obviously, Sulgrove could not have committed involuntary manslaughter with respect to his own death. Therefore, a theory under which defendant is only vicariously liable for Sulgrove’s crime would be inadequate to convict defendant for Sulgrove’s death. We turn, then, to consideration of the [other] theory of liability, i.e., that defendant’s reckless commission of the public offense of drag racing was a proximate cause of the Sulgrove and Ellis deaths. . . . 
</p><p id="76d49f99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant asserts that because Sulgrove was a competitor in the drag race, he assumed the risk of his own death, and therefore defendant could not be convicted or sentenced for that death. . . . [We disagree.] “The acts and omissions of two or more persons may work concurrently as the efficient cause of an injury and in such case each of the participating acts or omissions is regarded in law as a proximate cause.” [Commonwealth v. Peak, 12 Pa. D. &amp; C. 379, 382 (1961).]</p><p id="76d49f9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, defendant contends [that the] trial court erred in applying the civil standard of proximate cause in a criminal prosecution, rather than adopting the more stringent standard of “direct causal connection” used by the Pennsylvania court in Commonwealth v. Root, 170 A.2d 310, 314 (Pa. 1961). In <i>Root</i>, the court held that “the tort liability concept of proximate cause has no proper place in prosecutions for criminal homicide and more direct causal connection is required for conviction.” . . . We had occasion to consider a similar standard-of-causation issue in State v. Marti, 290 N.W.2d 570, 584-585 (Iowa 1980). [W]e said in <i>Marti</i> that we were “unwilling to hold as a blanket rule of law that instructions used in civil trials regarding proximate cause are inappropriate for criminal trials.” [D]efendant has suggested no specific policy differences, nor can we think of any, that would justify a different standard of proximate causation under our involuntary manslaughter statute than under our tort law. The <i>Root</i> court opined that “[l]egal theory which makes guilt or innocence of criminal homicide depend upon such accidental and fortuitous circumstances as are now embraced by modern tort law’s encompassing concept of proximate cause is too harsh to be just.” We do not agree. . . . We believe the foreseeability requirement, coupled with the requirement of recklessness . . . will prevent the possibility of harsh or unjust results in involuntary manslaughter cases. . . .

At some time in the afternoon, with reference to nothing specific so far as the record discloses, Marshall said, “I will settle this,” went out, and in a few minutes returned clicking a gun, from which he removed one bullet. Early in the evening Ronald left, and the conversation turned to “Russian roulette.”</p><p id="76d4c6b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he “game” was played.

First, Marshall examined the gun, saw that it contained one cartridge, and after spinning it on his arm, pointed it at his head, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He handed the gun to Atencio, who repeated the process, again without result. Atencio passed the gun to the deceased, who spun it, put it to his head, then pulled the trigger. The cartridge exploded, and he fell over dead. . . .

Here the Commonwealth had an interest that the deceased should not be killed by the wanton or reckless conduct of himself and others. . . . Such conduct could be found in the concerted action and cooperation of the defendants in helping to bring about the deceased’s foolish act. . . .

The testimony does not require a ruling that when the deceased took the gun from Atencio it was an independent or intervening act. . . . In the abstract, there may have been no duty on the defendants to prevent the deceased from playing. But there was a duty on their part not to cooperate or join with him in the “game.” . . . The defendants were much more than merely present at a crime.

<i>1. The drug provider.</i> Suppose Lydia gives Gus a gun, knowing or even hoping that he will kill himself. As we have seen in <i>Campbell</i> (p. 619 supra), if Gus uses the gun to intentionally kill himself, Lydia cannot be held for homicide; at most she might be guilty of assisting a suicide. But suppose Lydia provides Gus with cocaine or heroin, not expecting him to kill himself with it, but just to facilitate his desire to get high. If Gus dies of a drug overdose, a court would often ignore the intervening-act doctrine (just as the courts did in the <i>McFadden</i> and <i>Atencio</i> cases); courts are typically willing to hold the drug supplier responsible for the foreseeable, though freely chosen, acts of his purchaser. E.g., Pena v. State, 901 So. 2d 781 (Fla. 2005). How can we explain the paradox that if Lydia intends to help Gus enjoy the drug, she can be held liable for killing him, but if she intends for Gus to die, she cannot be? For discussion, see Lisa Cherkassky, Kennedy and Unlawful Act Manslaughter: An Unorthodox Application of Doctrine of Causation, 72 J. Crim. L. 387 (2008).</p>

<i>2. Statutory formulations.</i> MPC §2.03 holds an actor responsible for a result when his action is a but-for antecedent, if it involves the same kind of harm he intended or risked and is “not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the actor’s liability or on the gravity of his offense.” In Causation in the Law 398 (2d ed. 1985), H.L.A. Hart and Tony Honoré; criticize this formulation:</p>

<p id="76d4edd2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutory definitions of the crime of attempt are usually minimal. Consider some representative examples: “A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when, with intent to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime” (N.Y. Penal Law §110.00 (2016)); “Every person who attempts to commit any crime, but fails, or is prevented or intercepted in its perpetration shall be punished . . . ” (Cal. Penal Code §664) (2016)); “A person commits the offense of attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense” (720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-4(a) (2016)).</p>
<p id="76d4edd3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At common law, attempts were misdemeanors. Today, the usual punishment for attempt is a reduced factor of the punishment for the completed crime. In California (Cal. Penal Code §664 (2016)), attempt carries a maximum term of not more than one-half of the maximum term authorized for the completed offense.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A34_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A34_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">12</a></span> Under New York Penal Law, which uses punishment classification of offenses, the sentence for an attempt is generally one classification below that for the completed crime (§110.05 (2016)), except for certain offenses, notably drug offenses, where the punishment is the same. Since the MPC proposals, however, many states have departed from the predominant scheme by making the punishment the same for the attempt as for the crime attempted, except for crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment, such as murder, kidnapping, and aggravated rape. See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §53a-51 (2016).</p>
<p id="76d4edd5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is the justification for the traditional approach of punishing attempt less severely than the completed crime? The relationship of harm to the proper degree of punishment is a pervasive problem in criminal law. The issue is implicit in several topics we have already considered. Thus, causation cases require us to consider why conduct that causes harm should ever be treated differently from identical conduct that does not. A similar issue is implicit in the Chapter 5 materials dealing with homicidal risk. An actor whose recklessness or criminal negligence creates a substantial risk of death can be convicted <span title="642" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-642">p. 642</span>of manslaughter and sometimes even of murder when death results. But what crime has the actor committed if the person he endangers suffers only nonlethal injuries or escapes with no injuries at all? Because such an actor is not “attempting” to kill anyone, he normally cannot be convicted of any form of attempted homicide. (We explore this point in connection with the mens rea of attempt at p. 644 infra.) Absent some statutory risk-creation offense (such as MPC §211.2), such an actor may have committed no crime at all. But even if a criminal offense applies to his conduct, its penalties will be far lower than those applicable when a death occurs.</p>
<p id="76d4edd6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law of attempts poses the same issue in its starkest form. The actor who intentionally seeks to cause harm (the death of another person, for example) is traditionally punished much less severely if his attempt proves unsuccessful. Is it justified to attribute importance in punishment to the actual result of a defendant’s conduct? Consider the following comments.</p>

In one sense, each has committed an offence, but the one has had the bad luck to cause a horrible misfortune, and to attract public attention to it, and the other the good fortune to do no harm. Both certainly deserve punishment, but it gratifies a natural public feeling to choose out for punishment the one who actually has caused great harm, and the effect in the way of preventing a repetition of the offence is much the same as if both were punished.</p></div>

But it conflicts with important principles of justice as between different offenders which would prima facie preclude treating two persons, guilty of “the very same act” of negligence, differently because of a fortuitous difference in the outcome of these acts. No doubt there is often an inclination to treat punishment like compensation and measure it by the outcome alone. There may even be at times a public demand that this should be done. And no doubt if the machinery of justice were nullified or could not proceed unless the demand were gratified we might have to gratify it and hope to educate people out of this misassimilation of the principles of punishment to those of compensation. But there seems no good reason for adopting this misassimilation as a principle or to stigmatise as pedantic the refusal to recognise that the difference made by “bad fortune” and “good luck” to the outcome of the very same acts justifies punishing the one and not the other.</p></div>

Can severe punishment (in the case of completed crime, for example) be justified simply by reference to the fact that society “demands” or at least desires this? To what extent should the structure of penalties serve to express intuitive societal judgments that cannot be rationalized in terms of such instrumental goals as deterrence, isolation, rehabilitation, and even retribution—that is, condemnation reflecting the moral culpability of the act? Conversely, to what extent should the criminal justice system see its mission as one not of expressing the intuitive social demand for punishment, but rather as one of restraining that demand and of protecting from punishment the offender who, rationally speaking, deserves a less severe penalty?</p></div>

<p id="76d53c10-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The theory of this grading system may be stated simply. To the extent that sentencing depends upon the antisocial disposition of the actor and the demonstrated need for a corrective sanction, there is likely to be little difference in the gravity of the required measures depending on the consummation or the failure of the plan. It is only when and insofar as the severity of sentence is designed for general deterrent purposes that a distinction on this ground is likely to have reasonable force. It is doubtful, however, that the threat of punishment for the inchoate crime can add significantly to the net <span title="644" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-644">p. 644</span>deterrent efficacy of the sanction threatened for the substantive offense that is the actor’s object, which he, by hypothesis, ignores.

Rev. 951, 958, 973 (2003)) that “most criminals [have] been ‘profoundly disadvantaged by unjust social institutions,’” and “often have suffered from bad luck which we can hardly imagine”; thus, he argues, less severe punishment for attempts that miscarry does not really reward good luck but instead serves as a partial “counterweight” to the overall bad luck of the offender’s social circumstances.

[Smallwood was convicted in a non-jury trial of assault with intent to murder and three counts of attempted second-degree murder, based on evidence that despite his awareness that he was HIV positive and that he had been warned by a social worker of the need to practice “safe sex,” he committed three rapes and did not use a condom in any of the attacks.]</p>

The State disagrees, arguing that the facts of this case are sufficient to infer an intent to kill.

Earp, 319 Md. 156, 167 (1990). [Smallwood] was properly found guilty of attempted murder and assault with intent to murder only if there was sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that Smallwood possessed a specific intent to kill at the time he assaulted each of the three women. . . .

<p id="76d56330-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An intent to kill may be proved by circumstantial evidence. . . . As we have repeatedly stated, “under the proper circumstances, an intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the human body.” [In State v. Raines, 326 Md. 582 (1992),] we upheld the use of such an inference. In that case, Raines and a friend were traveling on a highway when the defendant fired a pistol into the driver’s side window of a tractor trailer in an adjacent lane. The shot killed the driver of the tractor trailer, and Raines was convicted of first-degree murder. . . . Raines shot at the driver’s window of the truck, knowing that the truck driver was immediately behind the window. We concluded that “Raines’s actions in directing the gun at the window, and therefore at the driver’s head on the other side of the window, permitted an inference that Raines shot the gun with the intent to kill.”</p>

The State argues that Smallwood similarly knew that HIV infection ultimately leads to death, and that he knew that he would be exposing his victims to the risk of HIV transmission by engaging in unprotected sex with them. Therefore, the State argues, a permissible inference can be drawn that Smallwood intended to kill each of his three victims. The State’s analysis, however, ignores several factors.</p>
<p id="76d56332-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, we must consider the magnitude of the risk to which the victim is knowingly exposed. The inference drawn in <i>Raines</i>, supra, rests upon the rule that “[i]t is permissible to infer that ‘one intends the natural and probable consequences of his act.’” . . . When a deadly weapon has been fired at a vital part of a victim’s body, the risk of killing the victim is so high that it becomes reasonable to assume that the defendant intended the victim to die as a natural and probable consequence of the defendant’s actions.</p>

 . . . While the risk to which Smallwood exposed his victims when he forced them to engage in unprotected sexual activity must not be minimized, the State has presented no evidence from which it can reasonably be concluded that death by AIDS is a probable result of Smallwood’s actions to the same extent that death is the probable result of firing a deadly weapon at a vital part of someone’s body. Without such evidence, it cannot fairly be concluded that death by AIDS was sufficiently probable to support an inference that Smallwood intended to kill his victims in the absence of other evidence indicative of an intent to kill.</p>
<p id="76d56334-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, we find no additional evidence from which to infer an intent to kill. Smallwood’s actions are wholly explained by an intent to commit rape and armed robbery, the crimes for which he has already pled guilty. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d56335-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases cited by the State demonstrate the sort of additional evidence needed to support an inference that Smallwood intended to kill his victims. The defendants in these cases have either made explicit statements demonstrating an intent to infect their victims or have taken specific actions demonstrating such an intent and tending to exclude other possible intents. In State v. Hinkhouse, 912 P.2d 921 (Or. App. 1996), for example, the defendant engaged in unprotected sex with a number of women while knowing that he was HIV positive. The defendant had also actively concealed his HIV-positive status from these women, had lied to several of them by stating that he was not HIV-positive, and had refused the women’s requests that he wear condoms. There was also evidence that he had told at least one of his sexual partners that “if he were [HIV-]positive, he would spread the virus to other people.” . . . The Oregon Court of Appeals found this evidence to be sufficient to demonstrate an intent to kill. . . . In State v. Caine, 652 So. 2d 611 (La. App. 1995), a conviction for attempted second-degree murder was upheld where the defendant had jabbed a used syringe into a victim’s arm while shouting “I’ll give you AIDS.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d58a46-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast with these cases, the State in this case would allow the trier of fact to infer an intent to kill based solely upon the fact that Smallwood exposed his victims to the risk that they might contract HIV. Without evidence showing that such a result is sufficiently probable to support this inference, we conclude that Smallwood’s convictions for attempted murder and assault with intent to murder must be reversed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B7D_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B7D_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

<i>1. The intent requirement.</i> Both the common law and most American statutes are in accord with the holding in <i>Smallwood</i> that an attempt requires <span title="647" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-647">p. 647</span>a purpose (or “specific intent”) to produce the proscribed result, even when recklessness or some lesser mens rea would suffice for conviction of the completed offense. See, e.g., People v. Beck, 24 Cal. Rptr. 3d 228, 230 (2005) (“[E]very attempt requires specific intent to commit the target crime even if the completed crime does not require specific intent.”); People v. Aponte, 944 N.E.2d 204 (N.Y. 2011). In Jones v. State, 689 N.E.2d 722 (Ind. 1997), defendant shot at a house full of people, wounding several and killing one. He was convicted of murder of the person he killed but acquitted of attempted murder of those he wounded. The court rejected defendant’s claim that this was an inconsistent verdict. Attempted murder requires a specific intent to kill, but it is sufficient for murder that defendant engages in conduct knowing of a high probability that in doing so he will kill someone.</p>
<p id="76d58a4b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Why specific intent?</i> Why should an attempt conviction require a “specific intent” or “purpose” if the defendant, though he lacked “purpose,” had the mental state sufficient for conviction of the substantive offense? Since an attempt is generally punished <i>less</i> severely, why should it require a <i>more</i> culpable mens rea? Consider three possible explanations. One is linguistic: To attempt something is to try to accomplish it, and one cannot be said to try if one does not intend to succeed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BB2_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BB2_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> Another explanation is moral: One who intends to commit a criminal harm does a greater moral wrong than one who does so recklessly or negligently. The third is utilitarian: As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. put it in The Common Law 68 (1881): “The importance of the intent is not to show that the act was wicked but that it was likely to be followed by hurtful consequences.”</p>
<p id="76d58a4d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does Justice Holmes’s explanation for the intent requirement apply in a case like Thacker v. Commonwealth, 114 S.E. 504 (Va. 1922)? A drunk, angered by the refusal of a woman who was camping in a tent to admit him, walked down the road, turned, and shot at the light shining through the canvas. If the bullet had accidentally killed the woman, the defendant could be convicted of murder. But in <i>Thacker</i>, the bullet fortunately missed the woman. The court held that the defendant, lacking intent to kill, could not be convicted of attempted murder. But why do we need the bullet to hit the woman to be assured that the action “was likely to be followed by hurtful consequences”? Moreover, if the defendant is not guilty of attempt, for what crime (if any) could he be convicted? Do the penalties provided for an offense such as MPC §211.2 (reckless endangerment) afford adequate punishment for a case of this kind? Consider another observation of Justice Holmes in The Common Law at 66:</p>

<p id="76d58a4e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be true in the region of attempts, as elsewhere, the law began with cases of actual intent, as those cases are the most obvious ones.

<p id="76d58a4f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider People v. Thomas, 729 P.2d 972 (Colo. 1986). The defendant fired three shots at a man he believed to be a fleeing rapist. Two of the shots struck the man. The defendant claimed that one of the shots had been fired accidentally and that the other two were warning shots. At trial, he was convicted of attempted reckless manslaughter under Colo. Rev. Stat. §18-2-101(1), which provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d58a50-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person commits criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense, he engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the offense.</p>
</div>
<p id="76d5b161-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Noting that the statute differed from MPC §5.01, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld a conviction for attempted reckless manslaughter, but the court declined to rest that result solely on the language of the attempt statute. Instead, the court reasoned that the traditional requirement of intent served to identify cases where conduct was likely to produce harmful consequences. The court found that the necessary potential for future harm is present not only in cases of intentional conduct but also when the defendant knows that the prohibited result is practically certain to occur or when he recklessly disregards a substantial risk. And where a defendant used an AK-47 to shoot wildly at an unoccupied parked vehicle and wounded two girls in a nearby home, the Colorado courts upheld an convicted for attempted murder on the basis of “malice manifesting extreme indifference to human life.” People v. Rubio, 222 P.3d 355, 359 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BD9_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BD9_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span>

<i>Question:</i> Under Colorado’s statute, is the crime of attempted negligent homicide committed every time that a Colorado motorist substantially exceeds the speed limit or drives while intoxicated? <i>Should</i> such conduct be punishable as an attempt? For an argument in favor of creating an offense of attempted homicide on the basis of recklessness—and careful analysis of the difficulties of relying solely on an offense like MPC §211.2 (reckless endangerment) as a gap-filler—see Michael T. Cahill, Attempt, Reckless Homicide, and the Design of the Criminal Law, 78 U. Colo. L. Rev. 879 (2007).</p>
<p id="76d5b164-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Attempted manslaughter?</i> Where, as in nearly all jurisdictions, an attempt requires specific intent, there clearly can be no crime of attempted involuntary manslaughter: The attempt charge requires proof of intent to kill, and the essence of involuntary manslaughter is unintentional killing, so such a charge is a contradiction in terms. See State v. Holbron, 904 P.2d 912 (Haw. 1995). But can there be a crime of attempted <i>voluntary</i> manslaughter? <span title="649" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-649">p. 649</span>Suppose that a defendant, acting under extreme provocation, shoots at his provoker, trying to kill him. Is he attempting to commit murder or manslaughter? In <i>Holbron</i>, supra, the court stated (id. at 922) that “the overwhelming weight of the case law” recognizes the offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter. See, e.g., State v. Mitchell, 894 So. 2d 1240 (La. 2005).</p>
<p id="76d5b165-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Attempted felony-murder?</i> Two felons fire at a guard in the course of their escape from a bank holdup. The guard is wounded but survives. The felons intended to frighten the guard but did not intend to kill him. Can they be convicted of attempted felony-murder on the ground that they had a specific intent to commit the felony? Most courts that have considered the issue have rejected the concept of attempted felony-murder. See, e.g., State v. Nolan, 25 N.E.3d 1016 (Ohio 2014). Arkansas is a rare exception. See White v. State, 585 S.W.2d 952 (Ark. 1979). Why this virtual unanimity? After all, a robber can be held for felony murder when his wounded victim dies, so shouldn’t he be held for attempted felony-murder if his wounded victim survives? Note the implications of that view: A robber is guilty of felony murder if his victim dies from a heart attack, so should it follow that a robber is guilty of attempted felony-murder if his victim has a <i>nonfatal</i> heart attack? Should every robber and burglar be guilty of attempted felony-murder, even if shots are never fired and none of the victims suffers any physical injury?</p>
<p id="76d5b166-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Meaning of specific intent.</i> While the specific intent requirement is broadly accepted, its meaning in practice is not always clear. When a harmful result has not materialized, what precisely is the difference between intent, belief that the result will occur, and recklessness? For example, in <i>Smallwood</i>, p. 644 supra, how much additional evidence would have been required to support an inference that Smallwood intended to kill? The court discussed several cases as examples. In <i>Hinkhouse</i>, the defendant, like Smallwood, knew he had HIV, both men failed to use condoms, and both failed to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners. But Smallwood did not affirmatively misrepresent his HIV status (instead he secured his victims’ submission by force), while Hinkhouse <i>lied</i> to his otherwise consenting sexual partners. Why should that difference make Hinkhouse (but not Smallwood) guilty of attempted murder? Taking account of his deliberate deception, was Hinkhouse’s mens rea (with respect to the risk of killing his partners) one of intention, belief, or mere recklessness?</p>
<p id="76d5b167-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another difference between the cases may have been important: Hinkhouse told one of his partners that he believed intercourse by an HIV-positive person “would” transmit the virus. But does that additional fact establish an <i>intent</i> to kill or only his <i>belief</i>? Under MPC §2.02(2)(a)(i), a person is deemed to act purposely with respect to a harmful result only when it is his “<i>conscious object</i>
 . . . to cause such a result” (emphasis added). Does this requirement mean that Hinkhouse could not be convicted of attempted murder under the Code? Consider this hypothetical: Defendant, in order to destroy a competitor’s experimental aircraft, plants a bomb on the plane and sets it to explode in midair, having no particular wish to injure the test pilot but <span title="650" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-650">p. 650</span>knowing that if the bomb goes off as intended, the pilot will be killed. The bomb fails to explode. May the defendant be convicted of attempted murder? Does she have a “purpose” or “specific intent” to kill? Note the solution to this problem in MPC §5.01(1)(b): The required mens rea is satisfied if the defendant acts “with the purpose of causing or with the belief that [his conduct] will cause” the prohibited result.</p>
<p id="76d5b168-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>6. Attendant circumstances.</i> Does the specific intent requirement extend to attendant circumstances that are necessary elements of the crime attempted? The issue can arise, for example, when a defendant is charged with attempted rape, in situations where the act of penetration was not completed. If the defendant claims a mistake of fact about the victim’s age or lack of consent, should an attempt conviction require only the mens rea required to convict for rape in cases where the act of penetration has been completed (a mens rea that often is recklessness or only negligence with respect to lack of consent and may only be strict liability with respect to age)? Or should an attempt conviction require proof that the defendant <i>knew</i> that valid consent was lacking? Consider the following efforts to address the issue:</p>
<p id="76d5b169-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) </i>In Regina v. Khan, [1990] 1 W.L.R. 813, the judge instructed the jury that the completed offense of rape requires proof that the defendant had intercourse and either knew that the woman did not consent or “was reckless as to whether [she] was consenting or not.” The judge then explained that when a defendant unsuccessfully seeks to have intercourse with the victim, “the principles relevant to consent apply in exactly the same way in attempted rape.” Defendant was convicted of attempted rape. The court of appeal affirmed, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d5b16a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he intent of the defendant is precisely the same in rape and in attempted rape and the mens rea is identical, namely, an intention to have intercourse plus a knowledge of or recklessness as to the woman’s absence of consent. . . . We believe this to be a desirable result which in the instant case did not require the jury to be burdened with different directions as to the accused’s state of mind, dependent upon whether the individual achieved or failed to achieve sexual intercourse.</p>

<i>(b) </i> In Commonwealth v. Dunne, 474 N.E.2d 538 (Mass. 1985), the defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit statutory rape, an offense that the court referred to as “attempted statutory rape.” The statutory age of consent was 16, and the victim was 15 years and 4 months old on the date of the offense. The defendant unsuccessfully sought to have intercourse with the victim and there was no allegation that he knew (or should have known) that the victim was underage. Affirming the conviction, the court said:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d5d87c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In Massachusetts,] in a prosecution for statutory rape “it is immaterial that the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was sixteen years of age or older.” This is the rule in most jurisdictions. Similarly, in a prosecution for an assault with intent to commit statutory rape, this court has held that whether <span title="651" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-651">p. 651</span>or not the defendant is aware of the victim’s age is irrelevant. . . . Indeed, it would be incongruous for us to posit one rule for the completed act and another for the attempt.</p>

<i>(c)</i> How the text of the MPC (§5.01) would handle these cases is less than clear, but the Commentary states that §5.01(1) is meant to reach the same conclusion as these cases. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comments to §5.01 at 301-304 (1985):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d5d87f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the statutory rape example, the actor must have a purpose to engage in sexual intercourse with a female in order to be charged with the attempt, and must engage in a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of that act [§5.01(1)(c)]. With respect to the age of the victim, however, it is sufficient if he acts “with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime” [§5.01(1)], which in the case supposed is none at all. Since, therefore, mistake as to age is irrelevant with respect to the substantive offense, it is likewise irrelevant with respect to the attempt.</p>

<p id="76d5d886-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the common law has recognized the distinction between acts of attempt and acts of preparation—between acts which are, and acts which are not, too remote to constitute a criminal attempt—is undoubted. . . . If, however, we proceed to inquire as to the precise nature of the distinction thus recognised and indicated, we find that the common law authorities are almost as silent as the Crimes Act itself. . . . The rule . . . suggested [by Baron Parke] in R. v. Eagleton [169 E.R. 826 (1855)] was that in order to constitute a criminal attempt, as opposed to mere preparation, the accused must have taken the last step which he was able to take along the road of his criminal intent. He must have done all that he intended to do and was able to do for the purpose of effectuating his criminal purpose. When he has stopped short of this, whether because he has repented, or because he has been prevented, or because the time or occasion for going <span title="652" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-652">p. 652</span>further has not arrived, or for any other reason, he still has a locus penitentiae<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C96_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C96_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> and still remains within the region of innocent preparation. . . . On this principle the act of firing a pistol at a man would be attempted murder, although the bullet missed him. . . . But the prior and preliminary acts of procuring and loading the pistol, and of going with it to look for his enemy, and of lying in wait for him, and even of presenting the pistol at him, would not constitute criminal attempts, none of these being the proximate and final step towards the fulfillment of his criminal purpose. . . .

<p id="76d5ff98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent authorities make it clear that the [<i>Eagleton</i>] test is not the true one. [I]n R. v. White, [1910] 2 K.B. 124 it was held that the first administration of poison in a case of intended slow poisoning by repeated doses amounted in itself to attempted murder. It is said by the Court: “The completion [or attempted completion] of one of a series of acts intended by a man to result in killing is an attempt to murder, even though the completed act would not, unless followed by other acts, result in killing.” It might be the beginning of an attempt but would none the less be an attempt.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CAE_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CAE_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>

<span class="epub-small-caps">CRANE.</span> J. The police of the city of New York did excellent work in this case by preventing the commission of a serious crime. It is a great satisfaction to realize that we have such wide-awake guardians of our peace. Whether or not the steps which the defendant had taken up to the time of his arrest amounted to the commission of a crime, as defined by our law, is, however, another matter. He has been convicted of an attempt to commit the crime of robbery in the first degree, and sentenced to state’s prison. There is no doubt that he had the intention to commit robbery, if he got the chance. An examination, however, of the facts is necessary to determine whether his acts were <span title="653" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-653">p. 653</span>in preparation to commit the crime if the opportunity offered, or constituted a crime in itself, known to our law as an attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Charles Rizzo, the defendant, appellant, with three others, . . . on January 14th planned to rob one Charles Rao of a pay roll valued at about $1,200 which he was to carry from the bank for the United Lathing Company. These defendants, two of whom had firearms, started out in an automobile, looking for Rao or the man who had the pay roll on that day. Rizzo claimed to be able to identify the man, and was to point him out to the others, who were to do the actual holding up. The four rode about in their car looking for Rao. They went to the bank from which he was supposed to get the money and to various buildings being constructed by the United Lathing Company. At last they came to One Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park avenue. By this time they were watched and followed by two police officers. As Rizzo jumped out of the car and ran into the building, all four were arrested. The defendant was taken out from the building in which he was hiding. Neither Rao nor a man named Previti, who was also supposed to carry a pay roll, were at the place at the time of the arrest. The defendants had not found or seen the man they intended to rob. . . . The four men intended to rob the pay roll man, whoever he was. They were looking for him, but they had not seen or discovered him up to the time they were arrested.</p><p id="76d5ffa0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does this constitute the crime of an attempt to commit robbery . . . ? The Penal Law prescribes, “An act, done with intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its commission, is an attempt to commit that crime.” The word “tending” is very indefinite. It is perfectly evident that there will arise differences of opinion as to whether an act in a given case is one tending to commit a crime. “Tending” means to exert activity in a particular direction. Any act in preparation to commit a crime may be said to have a tendency towards its accomplishment. The procuring of the automobile, searching the streets looking for the desired victim, were in reality acts tending toward the commission of the proposed crime. The law, however, has recognized that many acts in the way of preparation are too remote to constitute the crime of attempt. The line has been drawn between those acts which are remote and those which are proximate and near to the consummation. The law must be practical, and therefore considers those acts only as tending to the commission of the crime which are so near to its accomplishment that in all reasonable probability the crime itself would have been committed, but for timely interference. The cases which have been before the courts express this idea in different language, but the idea remains the same. The act or acts must come or advance very near to the accomplishment of the intended crime. [As said by Justice Holmes, dissenting in Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 387 (1912):] “There must be dangerous proximity to success.” . . . 
</p><p id="76d5ffa1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How shall we apply this rule of immediate nearness to this case? The defendants were looking for the pay roll man to rob him of his money. . . . To constitute the crime of robbery, the money must have been taken from Rao by means of force or violence, or through fear. . . . Did the acts above described <span title="654" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-654">p. 654</span>come dangerously near to the taking of Rao’s property? Did the acts come so near the commission of robbery that there was reasonable likelihood of its accomplishment but for the interference? Rao was not found; the defendants were still looking for him; no attempt to rob him could be made, at least until he came in sight; he was not in the building at One Hundred and Eightieth street and Morris Park avenue. There was no man there with the pay roll for the United Lathing Company whom these defendants could rob. Apparently no money had been drawn from the bank for the pay roll by anybody at the time of the arrest. In a word, these defendants had planned to commit a crime, and were looking around the city for an opportunity to commit it, but the opportunity fortunately never came. Men would not be guilty of an attempt at burglary if they had planned to break into a building and were arrested while they were hunting about the streets for the building not knowing where it was. Neither would a man be guilty of an attempt to commit murder if he armed himself and started out to find the person whom he had planned to kill but could not find him. So here these defendants were not guilty of an attempt to commit robbery . . . when they had not found or reached the presence of the person they intended to rob.</p></div>

<i>1. The dangerous proximity test.</i> The New York attempt statute now requires that the defendant engage in conduct “which tends to effect the commission” of the crime. N.Y. Penal Law §110.00 (2016). The court of appeals has held that this language makes no change in the law, which continues to be as stated in <i>Rizzo.</i> People v. Acosta, 609 N.E.2d 518, 521 (N.Y. 1993). Many jurisdictions continue to apply <i>Rizzo</i>’s dangerous-proximity approach. E.g., Commonwealth v. Buswell, 9 N.E.3d 276 (Mass. 2014). In Commonwealth v. Bell, 917 N.E.2d 740 (Mass. 2009), an undercover police officer met the defendant in a parking lot and agreed that for $200, she would take him to a nearby park, one mile away, where she would allow him to have sexual intercourse with her (fictitious) four-year-old child. After telling the defendant to follow her in his car, she drove out of the parking lot, with the defendant close behind. As he turned out of the lot, he was arrested and subsequently convicted of two offenses: soliciting an act of prostitution and attempted rape. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld his solicitation conviction but reversed the conviction for attempted rape because “he had yet to see a child and did not know the exact location of the child. He . . . had not yet paid for the child.” Relying on Justice Holmes’s formulation of the proximity requirement (quoted in <i>Rizzo</i>), the court explained: “[W]e look to the actions left to be taken, or the ‘distance or gap between the defendant’s actions and the (unachieved) goal of the consummated crime—the distance must be relatively short, the gap narrow, if the defendant is to be held guilty of a criminal attempt.’” Id. at 748. A dissenting opinion observed (id. at 760):</p>

<span title="655" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-655">p. 655</span>Even if an actual, potential child victim did exist, the Commonwealth, for all practical purposes, would not be able to prosecute any defendant for attempted rape because the police would not (and should not) endanger the psychological health of the child by permitting the defendant to reach the place where the defendant could commit the sexual crime. [T]he Commonwealth will need to make a perilous choice between allowing a suspect to reach the time and place of the commission of his intended crime . . . or intervening earlier and thereby forfeiting any possibility of ever convicting him of the crime of attempt. On television and in the movies, the police always arrive in the nick of time; in real life, waiting so long does not always work out so well.</p>

<i>2. Proximity evaluated.</i> Are the results in <i>Rizzo</i> and <i>Bell</i> justifiable? What are their implications for effective law enforcement? Consider Glanville Williams, Police Control of Intending Criminals, [1955] Crim. L. Rev. 66, 69:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d626b7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a rational system of justice the police would be given every encouragement to intervene early where a suspect is clearly bent on crime. Yet in England, if the police come on the scene too early they may find that they can do nothing with the intending offender except admonish him. This is largely because of the rule that an attempt, to be indictable, must be sufficiently “proximate” to the crime intended. . . . One is led to ask whether there is any real need for the requirement of proximity in the law of attempt. Quite apart from this requirement, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to commit the crime . . . and that he did some act towards committing it. If only a remote act of preparation is alleged against him, that will weigh with the court in deciding whether he had the firm criminal intention alleged against him. If, however, the court finds that this intention existed, is there any reason why the would-be criminal should not be dealt with by the police and by the criminal courts?</p>

<i>NOTE ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ACTUS REUS AND ABANDONMENT</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76d626ba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One reason for judicial reluctance to move the threshold of criminality to an earlier point in time has been the desire to preserve for the defendant a “locus penitentiae”—an opportunity to repent, to change one’s mind. It is important to see how that opportunity to desist could be lost once the defendant crosses the threshold of criminality. First, a defendant who has crossed that threshold, but still must do several things in order to complete the crime, may be arrested before she has the chance to take the necessary steps. Such a defendant would be liable for attempt even though we cannot be sure she would have taken those steps. Second, a defendant may fully abandon the criminal plan and be arrested later. Here the defendant could be held liable for committing an attempt (by crossing the threshold of criminality), even though she subsequently did everything in her power to prevent any actual harm.</p>
<p id="76d626bb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should defendant’s abandoning her criminal purpose afford a defense to liability? For most offenses, the answer is no: If a defendant steals cash from his employer but later returns it, his remorse and restitution may affect the <span title="656" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-656">p. 656</span>sentence, but they cannot erase liability once the elements necessary for conviction are complete. See Alec Walen, Criminalizing Statements of Terrorist Intent, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 803 (2011). Applying this reasoning, the law traditionally denied any defense of abandonment, and many courts adhere to that view. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 613 F.3d 735 (8th Cir. 2010) (“[A] defendant cannot abandon an attempt once it has been completed”); State v. Robins, 646 N.W.2d 287, 295 (Wis. 2002) (“There is no . . . defense of voluntary abandonment once an attempt is completed”). To minimize the resulting potential for unfairness, many courts therefore insist that the threshold of criminality be placed very close to the last act, even when this approach means freeing some defendants who almost certainly would <i>not</i> have repented. Recall the facts of <i>Rizzo</i> and <i>Bell.</i>
</p>
<p id="76d626bc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A way to avoid this dilemma is to recognize abandonment (sometimes called renunciation) as a complete defense. A number of states have done so, either by statute or judicial decision. A typical requirement is that the abandonment occur “under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of [the] criminal purpose.” N.Y. Penal Code §40.10(3) (2016). MPC §5.01(4) is similar. For the definition of when the renunciation is considered “voluntary” and “complete,” see §5.01(4). Most of the revised codes adopt a renunciation defense substantially similar to that of the MPC. See Daniel G. Moriarty, Extending the Defense of Renunciation, 62 Temp. L. Rev. 1, 7-11 (1989).</p>
<p id="76d64dcd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider these cases:</p>

<i>(a)</i> In People v. Johnston, 448 N.Y.S.2d 902, 902-903 (App. Div. 1982), defendant entered a gas station, pulled a gun, and demanded money. When the station attendant produced only $50 and said that this was all the cash available, defendant departed, stating, “I was just kidding, forget it ever happened.” The court denied a renunciation defense, but several commentators favor a defense in these circumstances. See, e.g., George P. Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law 191-192 (1978). Which is the better view?</p>
<p id="76d64dcf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> In People v. McNeal, 393 N.W.2d 907 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986), defendant accosted a girl who had been waiting at a bus stop and forced her at knife point to accompany him to a house, with the intent to rape her. After an extended conversation in which the girl pleaded with him to let her go, defendant released the girl, saying that he was sorry and would never engage in such behavior again. The court affirmed a conviction for attempted sexual assault, upholding a finding that because of the victim’s “unexpected resistance,” the defendant’s renunciation was not voluntary. On similar facts, the court in Ross v. State, 601 So. 2d 872, 875 (Miss. 1992), found abandonment as a matter of law and reversed a conviction for attempted rape, stating: “[Defendant] did not fail in his attack. No one prevented him from completing it. [The victim] did not sound an alarm. She successfully persuaded Ross, of his own free will, to abandon his attempt.”</p>

<i>1. </i>McQuirter <i>and race.</i> What is troublesome about the conviction in this case? The context of racial bigotry certainly is—black man, white woman, small town in the South in the 1950s. Indeed, the opinion cites, among other authorities, a case involving a slave charged with the attempted rape of a white woman, in which the Alabama Supreme Court held that “the jury should be instructed to give due consideration to the manner of the slave.” See Bernard E. Harcourt, Imagery and Adjudication in the Criminal Law: The Relationship Between Images of Criminal Defendants and Ideologies of Criminal Law in Southern Antebellum and Modern Appellate Decisions, 61 Brook. L. Rev. 1165, 1244 (1995) (explaining the slavery-era origins of <i>McQuirter</i>). Consider also Bennett Capers, The Unintentional Rapist, 87 Wash. U. L. Rev. 1345, 1385 (2010):</p>

<p id="76d674f1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When I first read <i>McQuirter</i>, what troubled me as much as McQuirter’s conviction was the appellate court’s ruling that, “In determining the question of <span title="659" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-659">p. 659</span>intention the jury may consider social conditions and customs founded upon racial differences, such as that the prosecutrix was a white woman and the defendant was a negro man.” Now, . . . I appreciate the court’s honesty, though faced with the court’s instruction, I might have applied the instruction differently. The court suggested that McQuirter’s intent was inferable from racial mores. But would not the mores of the time have supported a finding of the absence of intent? Is it really likely that McQuirter, alone in the white part of town in Alabama in 1951, and observing Mrs. Ted Allen walking along a residential street with two children, intended to assault her, let alone rape her? With neighbors on either side of the street? With Suell Lufkin’s house right there and with Mr. Simmons watching him? With Mrs. Allen watching him from Mrs. Simmons’s porch? In the state . . . that had a history of lynching black men, and where two black men had been lynched just the year before? But then again, . . . perhaps the “social conditions and customs” that allowed the jury to infer guilt trumped the “social conditions and customs” that suggested the absence of intent.</p>

<i>2. </i>McQuirter <i>and confessions.</i> Whatever weight the jury may have given to the “social conditions,” notice that the only <i>direct</i> evidence of culpable intent came from the sheriff’s testimony about what the defendant said in jail. Reliance on confessions allegedly given in police custody continues to be common in criminal cases, even though defendants often deny making such statements or claim that they were coerced. Our system leaves the trier of fact to sort out the relative credibility of the police (who may have a strong incentive to exaggerate the incriminating character of the defendant’s statements) and the defendant (who inevitably has a strong incentive to understate or deny the incriminating character of any statements he may have made.) Under these circumstances, even if the context involved no racial element, wouldn’t the conviction still be troublesome? Recall the criticism that the dangerous-proximity test makes justified convictions too difficult to obtain. Does a case like <i>McQuirter</i> redeem that test?</p>

<i>3. The equivocality test.</i> Another approach that would foreclose conviction in a case like <i>McQuirter</i> is the equivocality test. Unlike the dangerous proximity test for determining what acts suffice for attempt (once intent is proven), the equivocality test looks not to how far the defendant has gone but to how clearly his acts bespeak his intent. The principle was formulated as follows in The King v. Barker, [1924] N.Z.L.R. 865, 874-875:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d674f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A criminal attempt is an act which shows criminal intent on the face of it. The case must be one in which <i>Res ipsa loquitur.</i> An act, on the other hand, which is . . . on the face of it innocent . . . cannot be brought within the scope of criminal attempt by [admission or confession] as to the criminal purpose with which it is done. . . . The law does not punish men for their guilty intentions or resolutions in themselves. Nor does it commonly punish them even for the expression, declaration, or confession of such intentions . . . . That a man’s unfulfilled criminal purposes should be punishable they must be manifested not by his words merely, or by acts which are in themselves of innocent or ambiguous significance, but by overt acts which are sufficient in themselves to declare and proclaim [his] guilty purpose. . . . The reason for thus holding a man innocent <span title="660" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-660">p. 660</span>who does an act with intent to commit a crime is the danger involved in the admission of evidence upon which he may be punished for acts which in themselves and in appearance are perfectly innocent.</p>

 . . . To buy a box of matches with intent to use them in burning a haystack is not an attempt to commit arson, for it is in itself and in appearance an innocent act, there being many other reasons than arson for buying matches. . . . But he who takes matches to a haystack and there lights one of them and blows it out on finding that he is observed, has done an act which speaks for itself, and he is guilty of criminal attempt accordingly. . . . The purchaser of matches would not be guilty of attempted arson even if he declared to the vendor or to any other person the guilty purpose with which he bought them. Such evidence is relevant for the purpose of satisfying the jury that the requisite criminal intent existed, but it is not relevant in determining the prior question of law whether the act charged amounts in law to an attempt or is too remote for that purpose.</p>

Miller, 2 Cal. 2d 527, 531-532 (1935), the defendant, who had threatened to kill Jeans, entered a field where Jeans and the local constable were planting hops. The defendant was carrying a rifle, and he walked straight toward them. He stopped once to load his rifle, but at no time did he lift it to take aim. Jeans fled, and the constable disarmed the defendant. The court reversed a conviction of attempted murder, stating:</p>

<i>D</i> goes up to a haystack, fills his pipe, and lights a match. The act of lighting the match, even to a suspicious-minded person, is ambiguous. It may indicate only that <i>D</i> is going to light his pipe; but perhaps, on the other hand, the pipe is only a “blind” and <i>D</i> is really bent on setting fire to the stack. We do not know. Therefore, on the equivocality test, the act is not proximate. But suppose that as a matter of actual fact <i>D</i>, after his arrest, confesses to the guilty intent, and suppose that that confession is believed.

<i>NOTES ON SUBSTANTIVE CRIMES OF PREPARATION</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76d69b0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many inchoate substantive crimes do not require resort to the law of attempt with its various restrictions. Several come from the common law. These include the crimes of solicitation (or incitement) and conspiracy, both of which we deal with later in this book. Two other important common-law crimes that consist solely of preparatory behavior are burglary and assault.</p>
<p id="76d69b0f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Burglary.</i> Common-law burglary was defined as breaking and entering a dwelling of another at night with the intent to commit some felony inside. Under the common law of attempt, a person apprehended while breaking into a dwelling with intent to commit a felony (for example, theft) would not be guilty of attempting that felony because he would not be ready to commit it—for example, he would not yet have seen specific property worth stealing. The offense of burglary helped solve this problem.</p>
<p id="76d6c220-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today, cases and statutes have greatly enlarged the offense. See Mathis v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 2243 (2016); id. at 2263-2264 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Some burglary statutes still apply only to entries at night but no longer require a physical “breaking”; the entry can simply be without permission or under false pretenses. See, e.g., Wagner v. State, 864 A.2d 1037, 1055-1056 (Md. Spec. App. 2005). Other statutes extend the offense to include <i>any entry</i>, in day as well as at night, into <i>any structure</i>, with intent to commit <i>any crime</i>. For example, in People v. Salemme, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 398 (Ct. App. 1992), the court held that the defendant had committed burglary when he entered a person’s home with the intent to perpetrate a fraudulent sale of securities. Iowa Code §713.1 (2016) is somewhat narrower, limiting burglary to unauthorized entry into an “occupied structure” with intent to commit a felony or theft, but §702.12 (2016) defines “occupied structure” to include “appurtenances to buildings” and any “land, water or air vehicle”; moreover a structure is deemed occupied “whether or not a person is actually present.” Accordingly, in Iowa a person commits burglary if he steps into an unoccupied rowboat with intent to steal its fishing tackle or bait, and because a homeowner’s driveway is an “appurtenance” to the building, Iowa courts have held that <span title="662" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-662">p. 662</span>entry onto the driveway with felonious intent qualifies as burglary. See State v. Rooney, 862 N.W.2d 367, 376 (2015).</p>
<p id="76d6c221-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Assault.</i> Assault is sometimes defined as a completed substantive offense—the infliction of harm upon another person (often called a battery). See, e.g., MPC §2.11(1)(a). But in addition, the same term (assault) typically includes <i>an attempt</i> to commit a battery. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code §240 (2015): “An assault is an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.”</p>
<p id="76d6c222-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that under this traditional definition, the <i>crime</i> of assault is narrower than the <i>tort</i> of assault: A person who deliberately places another in fear of a battery, but does not actually intend to carry out the attack, would not be guilty of a criminal assault under statutes like California’s, although she might be liable for damages in tort. Today, most jurisdictions extend the crime of assault to include conduct that deliberately places another in fear of a battery, even in the absence of intent to carry out the attack. See, e.g., Carter v. Commonwealth, 606 S.E.2d 839, 841 (Va. 2005); Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law §16.3, at 823 (4th ed. 2003). The MPC extends the crime of assault to cover such conduct, but only under limited circumstances. See MPC §211.1(1)(c).</p>
<p id="76d6c223-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Mere preparation as an offense.</i> The law today contains many instances of merely preparatory behavior defined as a substantive crime. See State v. Young, 271 A.2d 569 (N.J. 1970):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d6c224-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is nothing necessarily wrong in teaching or demonstrating the use, application or making of a firearm . . . , but 18 U.S.C. §231(a)(1) makes it a crime to do so “intending that the same will be unlawfully employed for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder which may . . . adversely affect commerce.” [A number of statutes] make possession criminal if there is an intent to do some hostile act. [For example, laws] relating to possession of burglar tools. [These statutes punish] an act only because of the evil purpose it pursues, without regard to whether the act would constitute an attempt to commit the offense the statutes seek to head off, and even though the act, absent such purpose, may be one protected by the Constitution.</p>

<p id="76d6c225-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Policing measures.</i> Other approaches that avoid the restrictions of the law of attempt include measures for dealing with persons who engage in suspicious activity not amounting to an attempt to commit a crime. One approach is procedural, allowing police to stop and detain a suspect in circumstances short of those sufficient under the Fourth Amendment to justify an arrest. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). The other approach is substantive, for example, making it a crime to loiter in circumstances giving rise to apprehension that a crime may be afoot. See <i>City of Chicago v. Morales</i>, p. 185 supra.</p>

<i>1.

<i>Question:</i> Do anti-stalking laws cast the net of criminal punishment too widely, or is their reach too limited, so that the problem of stalking remains unsolved? Consider the following issues:</p>
<p id="76d6e944-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Overbroad?</i> Are statutes like California’s too vague to give adequate notice of what is prohibited and to confine the discretion of prosecutors and judges?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F52_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F52_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">18</a></span> Most courts have rejected constitutional challenges, finding that the crucial element of “harassment” is not overly vague when defined objectively (for example, California’s requirement of conduct that “would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress”). See, e.g., State v. Bernhardt, 338 S.W.2d 830 (Mo. Ct. App. 2011); People v. Ewing, 76 Cal. App. 4th 199 (1999). The Kansas Supreme Court found its anti-stalking statute unconstitutionally vague because that statute, unlike California’s, made liability depend on the personal sensibilities of the victim. After the legislature limited the statute to conduct that would cause “a reasonable person” to suffer emotional distress, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected a new vagueness challenge and upheld the amended statute. State v. Rucker, 987 P.2d 1080 (Kan. 1999).</p>
<p id="76d6e946-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Underinclusive?</i> As limited by the requirements of harassment and a “credible threat,” both defined objectively, is the California statute too narrow to deal effectively with the problem of stalking? Consider “cyber-stalking.” The ease and reach of e-communication exponentially expands the frequency and potential impact of stalking behavior. In a number of cases, individuals have used e-mail and Internet Web postings to harass and frighten their estranged spouses or others. E-mail messages containing threats of rape or assault easily meet the requirements of traditional stalking statutes, and nearly all state statutes explicitly apply to electronic transmission of threats. See Ashley N.B. Beagle, Modern Stalking Laws: A Survey of State Anti-Stalking Statutes, 14 Chap. L. Rev. 457, 482 (2011). Intimidating comments posted on a defendant’s public Facebook page were held sufficient when they addressed the victim by name, even though he did not send them directly to her. State v. Craig, 112 A.3d 559 (N.H. 2015).</p>
<p id="76d71057-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nonetheless, existing regimes are often unable to reach many common forms of cyber-stalking. See Naomi Harlin Goodno, Cyberstalking, a New Crime, 72 Mo. L. Rev. 125 (2007). In Elonis v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2001 (2015), the Supreme Court held that Facebook posts in which the defendant repeatedly talked about wanting to kill his wife, fire mortars at her house, and commit other violent acts did not qualify as a “threat” unless the defendant himself was aware that the statements would be considered threatening. See p. 270 supra. Moreover, endlessly repeated sexual proposals or requests for dates often are difficult to classify as implied threats.</p>
<p id="76d71058-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="665" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-665">p. 665</span>Another concern is the problem of “stalking apps”—software secretly implanted in a victim’s cell phone and then used to track the victim’s location 24 hours a day. The Fourth Amendment prohibits GPS tracking by the government (at least when the tracking device is attached to a person’s car without his or her consent). United States v. Jones, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012). But the Constitution does not prohibit such conduct by private parties, and current statutes do not necessarily make such conduct a crime, absent the extra elements required under anti-stalking statutes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F6E_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F6E_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">19</a></span> And since “stalking apps” are clandestine, the victim is typically unaware of the stalker’s attention, and the statutory requirements of “threat” or “harassment” may be missing until the stalker attempts some other offense. Some observers propose legislation to curtail the manufacture and sale of spyware and other stealth surveillance equipment. Danielle Keats Citron, Spying, Inc., 72 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1243 (2015). Another hard-to-reach form of cyber-stalking was illustrated in a recent case where a man deluged his former girlfriend with messages filled with obscenities and demands for attention.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F76_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F76_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span> Does such conduct amount to “stalking” under a statute like California’s? If not, <i>should</i> a law be crafted to cover it? If so, how?</p>
<p id="76d7105b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a New York case, the defendant approached a young woman in his neighborhood, offered her a Valentine’s Day gift, repeatedly asked her for dates, and often followed her, even after she emphatically told him to leave her alone. Would such conduct constitute stalking in California? If not, should stalking laws be amended to cover it? In the New York case, a stalking conviction was upheld under a statute that, unlike California’s, does not require a “credible threat” to the victim’s safety but instead extends to any course of conduct that “causes material harm to the victim’s mental or emotional health,” after the defendant has been “clearly told to stop.” See People v. Stuart, 100 N.Y.2d 412, 426 (2003). Is this an appropriate way to address the problem, or does it extend criminal liability too widely? Would it criminalize the actions of a tenant who persists in calling and e-mailing her landlord because the leaky faucet in her apartment has not been repaired?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F85_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F85_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">21</a></span>

<span class="epub-small-caps">FREDERICK VAN PELT BRYAN, J.</span>: Robert Jackson, William Scott, and Martin Allen appeal from judgments of conviction entered . . . after a trial before Chief Judge Jacob Mishler without a jury.</p>
<p id="76d73775-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Count one of the indictment alleged that between June 11 and June 21, 1976, the appellants conspired to commit an armed robbery of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust. . . . Counts two and three each charged appellants with an attempted robbery of the branch on June 14 and on June 21, 1976, respectively. . . . Chief Judge Mishler filed a memorandum of decision finding each defendant guilty on all . . . counts.</p>
<p id="76d73776-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellants’ principal contention is that the court below erred in finding them guilty on counts two and three.

<p id="76d73778-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On June 11, 1976, Hodges recruited Allen to rob the Manufacturers Hanover branch. Allen agreed, proposed the date of June 14, and told her he had guns and a car. On June 14, Allen arrived with a confederate, Jackson, in a car containing a sawed-off shotgun, shells, materials intended as masks, and handcuffs to bind the bank manager. After picking up another confederate, <span title="667" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-667">p. 667</span>Scott, they drove to the bank, where Allen entered to check the surveillance cameras, while Jackson installed a false cardboard license plate on the car. Scott then entered the bank too, but returned with the news that the tellers were separating the weekend deposits and many patrons were still there. They then rescheduled the robbery for June 21.</p>
<p id="76d73779-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On June 18, Hodges was arrested on an unrelated offense and decided to cooperate with the police. She told FBI agents of the robbery planned for June 21, and early on that date FBI agents took surveillance positions around the bank. They saw a brown Lincoln with a New York license on the front and a cardboard facsimile of a license plate on the rear. It stopped near the bank and was occupied by three men fitting the description Hodges had provided. One of the men got out, stood for a while in front of the bank, and returned to the car. The Lincoln drove up and down the streets near the bank and then stopped for several minutes a few blocks away. When it returned and parked near the bank, agents noticed that its front license plate was now missing. After parking for 30 minutes, the car began moving in the direction of the bank.]</p>
<p id="76d7377a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At some point near the bank . . . , the appellants detected the presence of the surveillance agents.

The agents then observed a black and red plaid suitcase in the rear of the car [and in it they found] two loaded sawed-off shotguns, a toy nickel-plated revolver, a pair of handcuffs, and masks. . . . Chief Judge Mishler concluded that the evidence against Jackson, Scott, and Allen was “overwhelming” on [the conspiracy count]. In contrast, he characterized the question of whether the defendants had attempted a bank robbery as charged in counts two and three or were merely engaged in preparations as “a close one.” After canvassing the authorities . . . Chief Judge Mishler applied the following two-tiered inquiry formulated in United States v. Mandujano, 499 F.2d 370, 376 (5th Cir. 1974):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d7377b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the defendant must have been acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime which he is charged with attempting. . . . Second, the defendant must have engaged in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime. A substantial step must be conduct strongly corroborative of the firmness of the defendant’s criminal intent.</p>
</div>
<p id="76d7377c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">He concluded that on June 14 and again on June 21, the defendants took substantial steps, strongly corroborative of the firmness of their criminal intent, toward commission of the crime of bank robbery and found the defendants guilty on each of the two attempt counts. These appeals followed.</p>
<p id="76d7377d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]here is no comprehensive statutory definition of attempt in federal law. [Our court has] selected the two-tiered inquiry of <i>United States v. Mandujano</i>, supra, as stating the proper test for determining whether . . . conduct constituted an attempt.

The following differences between this test and previous approaches to the preparation-attempt problem were noted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d7377f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, this formulation shifts the emphasis from what remains to be done—the chief concern of the proximity tests—to what the actor <i>has already done.</i> The fact that further major steps must be taken before the crime can be completed does not preclude a finding that the steps already undertaken are substantial. It is expected, in the normal case, that this approach will broaden the scope of attempt liability.</p>
<p id="76d75e90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, although it is intended that the requirement of a substantial step will result in the imposition of attempt liability only in those instances in which some firmness of criminal purpose is shown, no finding is required as to whether the actor would probably have desisted prior to completing the crime. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d75e91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the requirement of proving a substantial step generally will prove less of a hurdle for the prosecution than the <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> approach, which requires that the actor’s conduct must itself manifest the criminal purpose. . . . 
</p>

<p id="76d75e92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Model Penal Code §5.01, Comment at 47 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1960).</p>
<p id="76d75e93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The draftsmen concluded that, in addition to assuring firmness of criminal design, the requirement of a substantial step would preclude attempt liability, with its accompanying harsh penalties, for relatively remote preparatory acts. At the same time, however, by not requiring a “last proximate act” or one of its various analogues it would permit the apprehension of dangerous persons at an earlier stage than the other approaches without immunizing them from attempt liability. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d75e94-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Judge Mishler [concluded that on both June 14 and June 21,] these men were seriously dedicated to the commission of a crime, had passed beyond the stage of preparation, and would have assaulted the bank had they not been dissuaded by certain external factors, <i>viz.</i>, the breaking up of the weekend deposits and crowd of patrons in the bank on June 14 and the detection of the FBI surveillance on June 21.</p>
<p id="76d75e95-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot say that these conclusions . . . were erroneous. On two separate occasions, appellants reconnoitered the place contemplated for the commission of the crime and possessed the paraphernalia . . . —loaded sawed-off shotguns, extra shells, a toy revolver, hand-cuffs, and masks—which was specially designed for such unlawful use and which could serve no lawful purpose under the circumstances. Under the Model Penal Code formulation, either type of conduct, standing alone, was sufficient as a matter of law to constitute a “substantial step” if it strongly corroborated their criminal purpose. Here both types of conduct coincided on both June 14 and June 21, along with numerous other elements strongly corroborative of the firmness of appellants’ <span title="669" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-669">p. 669</span>criminal intent.

<p id="76d75e98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Model Penal Code draws on elements of both the proximity and the equivocality tests. Its approach has proved influential with many jurisdictions. Altogether, roughly half the states and two-thirds of the federal circuits now use a “substantial step” test comparable to that of the MPC. See Robert Batey, Book Review (Paul Robinson’s Criminal Law), 73 Notre Dame L. Rev. 781, 794 (1998). Some states have adopted the Code’s substantial step formula without the requirement that the actor’s conduct strongly corroborate the intent. E.g., Ga. Code §16-4-1 (2016); 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-4 (2016). Several of the statutes include significant variations on the MPC approach. Colo. Rev. Stat. §18-2-101 (2016) defines a “substantial step” as one that is “strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor’s purpose.”</p>

<i>1. </i>In United States v. Harper, 33 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 1994), the defendants were found in a car parked in a lot adjacent to a branch of the Bank of America. Under a bush six feet from their car, police discovered two handguns, and in the car they found a stun gun, surgical gloves, and ammunition for the two hand guns. An ATM camera showed that one of the defendants, Harper, had used a stolen ATM card to withdraw $20 from the ATM, but had not removed the cash. As Harper knew, this created a “bill trap,” causing the ATM to shut down and summon technicians to repair it, their response time being between 45 and 90 minutes. The prosecution obtained a conviction for conspiracy and attempted bank robbery, the latter on the theory that Harper had deliberately set the “bill trap” in order to rob the technicians of the money in the machine when they arrived to repair it. The court of appeals affirmed the conspiracy conviction but reversed the attempt conviction, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d785ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">True, Harper had [caused] a bill trap that would eventually bring service personnel to the ATM. That act, however, is equivocal in itself. The robbery was in the future and . . . the defendants never made a move toward the victims or the Bank to accomplish the criminal portion of their intended mission. They had not taken a step of “such substantiality that, unless frustrated, the crime would have occurred.” Their situation is therefore distinguishable from that of the defendant in United States v. Moore, 921 F.2d 207 (9th Cir. 1990). . . . In <i>Moore</i>, the defendant was apprehended “walking toward the bank, wearing a ski mask, and carrying gloves, pillowcases and a concealed, loaded gun.” These actions were a true commitment toward the robbery, which would be in progress the moment the would-be robber entered the bank. . . . That stage of the crime had not been reached by [the defendants]; <span title="670" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-670">p. 670</span>their actual embarkation on the robbery lay as much as 90 minutes away from the time when Harper left money in the ATM, and that time had not expired when they were apprehended. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d785ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When criminal intent is clear, identifying the point at which the defendants’ activities ripen into an attempt is not an analytically satisfying enterprise. There is, however, a substantial difference between causing a bill trap, which will result in the appearance of potential victims, and moving toward such victims with gun and mask, as in [<i>Moore</i>]. Making an appointment with a potential victim is not of itself such a commitment to an intended crime as to constitute an attempt, even though it may make a later attempt possible. Little more happened here. . . . Accordingly, we reverse the appellants’ convictions for attempted bank robbery.</p>

<i>2.</i> In United States v. Joyce, 693 F.2d 838 (8th Cir. 1982), informant Gebbie told Joyce that cocaine was available for purchase in St. Louis. Joyce agreed to travel there from Oklahoma City, bringing with him $22,000 in cash, the agreed price for purchasing a pound of cocaine. The next day he flew to St. Louis and met both Gebbie and undercover officer Jones, who was posing as a cocaine seller. In a hotel room, after discussing prices for various quantities of cocaine, Jones produced a wrapped package said to contain a kilogram of cocaine. Without unwrapping it, Joyce returned the package, stating that he could not see the cocaine. Jones then unwrapped about half of the tape covering the package and handed it back to Joyce, but Joyce again returned the package and asked Jones to open it up so that Joyce could examine the cocaine more closely. Jones answered that he would only open the package when Joyce showed the money he had brought for the purchase.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110B3_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N110B3_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span> Joyce insisted that he would not produce his money until Jones opened the package and would not deal with Jones no matter how good the cocaine was. Realizing that Joyce was not going to show his money or purchase the cocaine, Jones told Joyce to leave, and Joyce then left, with no apparent intention of returning later to purchase drugs.</p>
<p id="76d7acc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Joyce left the hotel, he was arrested by DEA agents, and a subsequent search found $22,000 in cash in his luggage. He was convicted of attempting to purchase cocaine with intent to distribute, but the Eighth Circuit, applying the MPC test, reversed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d7acc3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever intention Joyce had to procure cocaine was abandoned prior to the commission of a necessary and substantial step to effectuate the purchase.

Joyce’s motive for refusing to purchase the cocaine here is no different than had he refused to purchase because he disagreed with Jones as to the price for which the cocaine was offered. And, while we may agree with the government’s suggestion that Joyce, who was presumably “street-wise,” may have been tipped off that Jones was a DEA undercover agent when Jones refused to open the package, we fail to see how an increased awareness of the risk of apprehension converts what would otherwise be “mere preparation” into an attempt.</p>

<i>3. </i> In United States v. Howard, 766 F.3d 414 (5th Cir. 2014), the defendant conversed several times over the course of three weeks with a government agent who impersonated a mother offering her two minor daughters for sex. Howard sent the agent sexually explicit photographs of himself and asked that she show the photographs to the girls. He also suggested that the “mother” get birth control for the daughters and perform sex acts on them to get them ready for him. He discussed various possible arrangements for his travel from California to Corpus Christi, Texas, where the fictitious mother and daughters lived, but he did not commit to any specific plan. When the government agent tried to get Howard to book a flight, instructing him to “take it or leave it,” he responded, “Okay, I’ll leave it.” They had no subsequent contact.</p>
<p id="76d7acc7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three months later, Howard was arrested. He was convicted of attempting to induce a minor to engage in sexual activity with him. Applying the MPC test, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that “a definite plan to travel is not necessary to constitute a ‘substantial step’” toward committing that offense. Howard had approached the line of attempt through “sexually explicit conversations, transmission of sexual photographs, and discussion of specific travel details,” and crossed it when “he instructed the undercover police officer to perform sex acts on and procure birth control for the girls to get them ready for him.” Id. at 426.</p>

<i>Questions</i>: <i>(a)</i> Is this a correct application of the MPC test? Or does it risk “criminalizing improper thoughts rather than dangerous acts” (Michal Buchhandler-Raphael, Overcriminalizing Speech, 36 Cardozo L. Rev. 1667, 1693 (2015))?</p>
<p id="76d7acc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Suppose that Howard had bought a plane ticket to Corpus Christi and made plans to have the fictitious mother meet him at the airport. On those facts, a conviction would easily be sustained under the MPC test. See United States v. Roman, 795 F.3d 511 (6th Cir. 2015). How would such a case be decided under the <i>Rizzo</i> (proximity) test? Which approach offers the better way to analyze such cases?</p>

<i>4. Omissions.</i> Note that under MPC §5.01(1)(c), the actus reus of attempt can include “an act or omission constituting a substantial step. . . . ” How (or when) can <i>an omission</i> constitute a substantial step? Suppose that a nursing home attendant who has a duty to care for an elderly patient chooses not to bring the patient her medicine because the attendant can no longer tolerate the patient’s complaints and wants to see the patient dead. A few hours later, another attendant discovers the patient in distress because of the missed medications but manages to rectify the situation. Has the first attendant taken “a substantial step” sufficient to make him guilty of attempted murder? See Michael T. Cahill, Attempt by Omission, 94 Iowa L. Rev. 1208 (2009).</p>

He asked Leverton to help him find an ex-convict to do the job, but Leverton disclosed the plot to Dill, a police officer, who decided to pose as the ex-convict. Defendant paid Dill $600 to carry out plans he had devised for killing Lourie. A scheme was arranged whereby Dill was to appear at the Lourie home, kill Edmon, and feign a robbery by “mussing up” Alberdina and taking her jewels. At the appointed hour Dill appeared at the Lourie home but at that point revealed his identity. He then proceeded to defendant’s home where he made an arrest.

We take it that the state means by the foregoing declarations that overt acts were shown. To that we do not agree. The evidence goes no further than developing a verbal arrangement with Dill, the selection of Dill as the one to kill Lourie, the delivery of a certain drawing and two photographs of Lourie to Dill, and the payment of a portion of the agreed consideration.

<i>1. Solicitation as an attempt.</i> Near the end of its opinion in <i>Davis</i>, the court states: “It was not shown that Dill committed an act that could be construed as an attempt.” Would it matter if Dill had gone further? Would the <span title="675" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-675">p. 675</span>prosecution’s problem have been solved if Dill had been instructed to play the scene to the hilt, for example, by aiming his pistol at the husband’s chest? Since Dill was only a feigned participant, traditional common-law doctrines would not permit him to be treated as Davis’s <i>accomplice</i>, and therefore Davis could not be held accountable for the steps taken by Dill, no matter how far those steps went. Davis’s liability would have to rest on <i>his own</i> actions. See <i>State v. Hayes</i>, p. 733 infra.</p>
<p id="76d82217-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts differ over the question whether the solicitation itself constitutes an attempt by the person making it. In accord with <i>Church</i>, many courts hold that solicitation can constitute a punishable attempt if it represents a “substantial step” under the circumstances. See Ashford v. Commonwealth, 626 S.E.2d 464 (Va. Ct. App. 2006). MPC §5.01(2)(g) is in accord. But many states adhere to the view that “no matter what acts the solicitor commits, he cannot be guilty of an attempt because it is not his purpose to commit the offense personally.” Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §5.02 at 369 (1985).</p>

<i>2. Solicitation as an independent crime.</i> At common law, inciting or soliciting another to commit a crime was a crime itself, independent of any other offense that either party might commit. Most American codes originally did not incorporate this offense, but instead made criminal the solicitation of particular crimes. However, a substantial number of states now have general solicitation statutes. They are usually patterned after MPC §5.02. The Commentary defends that formulation as follows (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §5.02 at 365-366, 375-378 (1985)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76d82219-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has been argued [that the solicitor’s] conduct is not dangerous because the resisting will of an independent moral agent is interposed between the solicitor and the commission of the crime. . . . By the same token it is urged that the solicitor, manifesting his reluctance to commit the crime himself, is not a significant menace. The opposing view is that a solicitation is, if anything, more dangerous than a direct attempt, because it may give rise to the special hazard of cooperation among criminals. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76d8221a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There should be no doubt on this issue. Purposeful solicitation presents dangers calling for preventive intervention and is sufficiently indicative of a disposition towards criminal activity to call for liability. Moreover, the fortuity that the person solicited does not agree to commit or attempt to commit the incited crime plainly should not relieve the solicitor of liability, when otherwise he would be a conspirator or an accomplice.</p>

<i>3. Free speech.</i> Suppose the speaker at a political rally harshly attacks the party in power and says, “These bums deserve to die.” Is the speaker guilty of solicitation to commit murder? Could a prosecutor satisfy the requirements for conviction under MPC §5.02? In United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 297-299 (2008), the Court held that “offers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded from First Amendment protection.” But advocacy that might implicitly encourage violence raises complex issues, and in some circumstances, solicitation of crime may be protected speech under the First Amendment. For a sustained discussion of this and related issues, see Kent <span title="676" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-676">p. 676</span>Greenawalt, Speech, Crime, and the Uses of Language (1989). On the line between punishable and protected speech, see Rice v. Paladin Enterprises, 128 F.3d 233 (4th Cir. 1997), where the publisher of a how-to-do-it murder manual was held civilly liable for the murder of three people committed by a person who had used the manual.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BARTLETT</span>, J. The indictment charged that the defendant on the 6th day of October, 1902, in the county of New York, feloniously received 20 yards of cloth, of the value of 25 cents a yard, belonging to the copartnership of J.W. Goddard &amp; Son, knowing that the said property had been feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away from the owners. It was found under section 550 of the Penal Code, which provides that a person who buys or receives any stolen property knowing the same to have been stolen is guilty of criminally receiving such property. The defendant was convicted of an attempt to commit the crime charged in the indictment. The proof clearly showed, and the district attorney conceded upon the trial, that the goods which the defendant attempted to purchase on October 6, 1902, had lost their character as stolen goods at the time when they were offered to the defendant and when he sought to buy them. In fact the property had been restored to the owners and was wholly within their control and was offered to the defendant by their authority and through their agency. The question presented by this appeal, therefore, is whether upon an indictment for receiving goods, knowing them to have been stolen, the defendant may be convicted of an attempt to commit the crime where it appears without dispute that the property which he sought to receive was not in fact stolen property.</p><p id="76d84933-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The conviction was sustained by the Appellate Division chiefly upon the authority of the numerous cases in which it has been held that one may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime notwithstanding the existence of facts unknown to him which would have rendered the complete perpetration of the crime itself impossible. Notably among these are what may be called the “Pickpocket Cases,” where, in prosecutions for attempts to commit larceny from the person by pocketpicking, it is held not to be necessary to allege or prove that there was anything in the pocket which could be the subject of larceny. [Similarly,] a conviction of an attempt to commit the crime of extortion was upheld, although the woman from whom the defendant sought to obtain money by a threat to accuse her of a crime was not induced to pay the money by fear, but was acting at the time as a decoy for the police, and hence could not have been subjected to the influence of fear.</p><p id="76d84934-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="677" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-677">p. 677</span>[I]t is important to bear in mind precisely what it was that the defendant attempted to do. He simply made an effort to purchase certain specific pieces of cloth. He believed the cloth to be stolen property, but it was not such in fact. The purchase, therefore, if it had been completely effected, could not constitute the crime of receiving stolen property, knowing it to be stolen, since there could be no such thing as knowledge on the part of the defendant of a nonexistent fact, although there might be a belief on his part that the fact existed. . . . 
</p><p id="76d84935-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crucial distinction between the case before us and the pickpocket cases, and others involving the same principle, lies not in the possibility or impossibility of the commission of the crime, but in the fact that, in the present case, the act, which it was doubtless the intent of the defendant to commit, would not have been a crime if it had been consummated. If he had actually paid for the goods which he desired to buy and received them into his possession, he would have committed no offense under section 550 of the Penal Code, because [it is] an essential element of the crime that the accused shall have known the property to have been stolen. . . . No man can know that to be so which is not so in truth and in fact. He may believe it to be so but belief is not enough under this statute. In the present case . . . the goods which the defendant intended to purchase had lost their character as stolen goods at the time of the proposed transaction. Hence, no matter what was the motive of the defendant, and no matter what he supposed, he could do no act which was intrinsically adapted to the then present successful perpetration of the crime . . . , because neither he nor any one in the world could know that the property was stolen property inasmuch as it was not, in fact, stolen property. In the pickpocket cases the immediate act which the defendant had in contemplation was an act which, if it could have been carried out, would have been criminal, whereas in the present case the immediate act which the defendant had in contemplation (to wit, the purchase of the goods which were brought to his place for sale) could not have been criminal under the statute even if the purchase had been completed. . . . 
</p><p id="76d84936-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If all which an accused person intends to do would, if done, constitute no crime, it cannot be a crime to attempt to do with the same purpose a part of the thing intended. The crime of which the defendant was convicted necessarily consists of three elements: First, the act; second, the intent; and third, the knowledge of an existing condition. There was proof tending to establish two of these elements, the first and second, but none to establish the existence of the third. . . . The defendant could not know that the property possessed the character of stolen property when it had not in fact been acquired by theft. . . . A particular belief cannot make that a crime which is not so in the absence of such belief. Take, for example, . . . the case of a prosecution under the statute of this state, which makes it rape in the second degree for a man to perpetrate an act of sexual intercourse with a female not his wife under the age of 18 years. There could be no conviction if it was established upon the trial that the female was in fact over the age of 18 years, although the defendant believed her to be younger and intended to commit the crime. <span title="678" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-678">p. 678</span>No matter how reprehensible would be his act in morals, it would not be the act forbidden by this particular statute. “If what a man contemplates doing would not be in law a crime, he could not be said, in point of law, to intend to commit the crime. If he thinks his act will be a crime, this is a mere mistake of his understanding where the law holds it not to be such, his real intent being to do a particular thing. If the thing is not a crime, he does not intend to commit one whatever he may erroneously suppose.” 1 Bishop’s Crim.

When Geller again pressed his demand for rent money, Bush drew his .38 caliber pistol, aimed it at Geller and fired three times. Geller fell to the floor. After the passage of a few minutes, perhaps two, perhaps as much as five, defendant walked over to the fallen Geller, drew his .25 caliber pistol, and fired approximately five shots in the victim’s head and face.

Thus, a man could be held for attempted grand larceny when he picked an empty pocket. . . .

<p id="76d8976a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As can be seen from even this abbreviated discussion, the distinction between “factual” and “legal” impossibility was a nice one indeed and the courts tended to place a greater value on legal form than on any substantive danger the defendant’s actions posed for society. The approach of the draftsmen of the Model Penal Code was to eliminate the defense of impossibility in virtually all situations. [See §5.01(1).] Under the code provision, to constitute an attempt, it is still necessary that the result intended or desired by the actor constitute a crime. However, the code suggested a fundamental change to shift the locus of analysis to the actor’s mental frame of reference and away from undue dependence upon external considerations. The basic premise of the code provision is that what was in the actor’s own mind should be the standard for determining his dangerousness to society and, hence, his liability for attempted criminal conduct. . . . In the belief that neither of the two branches of the traditional impossibility arguments detracts from the offender’s moral culpability . . . the Legislature substantially carried the [MPC] treatment of impossibility into the 1967 revision of the Penal Law. . . . Thus, a person is guilty of an attempt when, with intent to commit a crime, he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime. (Penal Law, §110.00.) It is no defense that, under the attendant circumstances, the crime was factually or legally impossible of commission, “if such crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as such person believed them to be.” Thus, if defendant believed the victim to be alive at the time of the shooting, it is no defense to the charge of attempted murder that the victim may have been dead. . . .

<p id="76d89770-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Factual impossibility.</i> When attempts misfire because of poor aim or the use of an inadequate weapon, such as an unloaded gun, courts have traditionally classified the situation as one of factual impossibility and denied a defense. In State v. Smith, 621 A.2d 493 (N.J. Super. 1993), the defendant was a county jail inmate who had tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. During an altercation with several guards, defendant spat in one officer’s face, bit his hand, and said, “[N]ow die you pig, die from what I have.” At his trial for attempted murder of the officer, defendant offered evidence that it was medically impossible to transmit HIV by spitting or biting, but the court held, affirming the conviction, that such evidence was irrelevant so long as the defendant believed it possible to infect the officer and intended to kill him.</p>
<p id="76d89771-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Legal impossibility.</i> Prior to the enactment of statutes addressed to the issue of impossibility, courts had used the term “legal impossibility” to apply to two distinct situations. The first, best described as <i>true legal impossibility</i>, arises when a person engages in conduct that she believes to be prohibited, but it turns out that no such crime exists. For example, a person might secretly carry $9,000 in cash out of the country, thinking that this is a crime and not realizing that it is permissible to do so. All courts agreed that this kind of legal impossibility was a complete defense.</p>
<p id="76d89772-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second situation was often treated as a kind of legal impossibility, but it involves a distinct problem that should not be confused with the first situation. In this second situation, the actor hopes or expects to achieve a result that the legislature has indeed prohibited (such as receiving stolen property), but success is impossible because the circumstances are not what he thinks (for example, because the property he wants to take has not actually been stolen). Courts disagreed about whether this sort of impossibility (often <i>mislabeled</i> as “legal impossibility”) could be a defense, and if so, how it was distinguished from “factual impossibility,” which was not a defense. For example, in People v. Rojas, 358 P.2d 921 (Cal. 1961), a case virtually identical to <i>Jaffe</i>, the California Supreme Court reached the opposite result, quoting this criticism of <i>Jaffe</i> in Jerome Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 127 (1947):</p>

The fact that defendant was mistaken regarding the external realities did not alter his intention, but simply made it impossible to effectuate it.</p>
</div>
<p id="76d89774-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC has had a major influence on this debate. About two-thirds of the states have revised their codes since the MPC proposals were formulated. Nearly all of them have rejected defenses both for factual impossibility and for mislabeled “legal impossibility” situations like <i>Jaffe</i>; true legal impossibility, in contrast, is always a defense. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §5.01 at 317 (1985). Another factor driving recent resistance to the <i>Jaffe</i> view has been the perceived importance of police use of undercover officers who impersonate minors, as a way to catch adults who use the Internet to arrange encounters in which they can victimize underage children. See Audrey Rogers, Protecting Children on the Internet: Mission Impossible?, 61 Baylor L. Rev. 323 (2009). Where the mislabeled defense of legal impossibility is recognized, the suspect in such a situation could have a defense if the intended victim turned out to be an adult. In King v. State, 921 N.E.2d 1288 (Ind. 2010), the court upheld an attempt conviction in this situation, overruling prior decisions that had permitted this kind of impossibility defense.</p>
<p id="76d89775-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the federal courts of appeals now follow the MPC approach. See United States v. Yang, 281 F.3d 534, 542 (6th Cir. 2002). But a few have resisted it. The following cases illustrate two approaches that differ from that of the MPC.</p>

The conviction was based on evidence that Berrigan had smuggled letters into and out of a prison through a courier, believing that the warden was ignorant of what was going on.

The court reversed the conviction:] Generally speaking factual impossibility is said to occur when extraneous circumstances unknown to the actor or beyond his control prevent consummation of the intended crime. The classic example is the man who puts his hand in the coat pocket of another with the intent to steal his wallet and finds the pocket empty. . . . Legal impossibility is said to occur where the intended acts, even if completed, would not amount to a crime.

Where a circumstance is not known to the actor, there is no way consistent with straight thought that she can be regarded as intending that circumstance.</p><p id="76d8e5b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, it is hardly unknown for courts to adopt strained and artificial reasoning to support a sound result. Is that the case here? Is it sound to conclude that the type of conduct engaged in by Lady Eldon should not be punishable? Let us consider if it is.</p><p id="76d8e5b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose Lady Eldon believed she had purchased an inexpensive English lace but in fact had purchased an expensive French lace. Certainly she could not be found guilty of smuggling if she got past the customs inspector; nor could she be convicted of attempt if she had tried but failed to do so. The reason is that the intent to smuggle French lace, necessary to establish either offense, does not exist. (We are assuming this is not a crime of strict liability.) And that intent does not exist because her intent is judged by what she <span title="686" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-686">p. 686</span>believed she was doing and not by what she in fact did. Now why should it make any more difference in Wharton’s hypothetical that her act was objectively lawful than it does in our variation that her act was objectively unlawful? In both cases intent should be judged by the same standard—what she believed she was doing, not what she did in fact.</p><p id="76d8e5b5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be argued that while an innocent mind can exculpate, a criminal mind by itself cannot inculpate. The reasoning might be that although a purpose could be served by punishing a person who decides to commit a crime, it is undesirable to do so, because merely thinking evil is not a reliable indication that a person will do evil; the criminal law may properly concern itself only with acts. See pp. 232-234 supra.</p><p id="76d8e5b6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But has Lady Eldon merely <i>thought</i> to smuggle French lace? No. She has <i>done</i> everything she thought necessary to smuggle French lace. Has she shown herself to be less eligible for the imposition of criminal sanctions merely because she failed? Surely not.</p><p id="76d90cc7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps it may be argued that there is a different policy supporting exculpation in cases like Lady Eldon’s—namely, that in real cases, as opposed to hypotheticals, it is too dangerous to permit juries to speculate on a defendant’s intent in the absence of actions that strongly evidence that intent. One may fully agree with this point, however, without concluding that Lady Eldon should be acquitted. Even if the lace found at the border had been dutiable French lace, that fact would only be <i>evidence</i> of her intent to smuggle—after all, she might have thought it was English lace, or it might have been put with her things by her maid without her knowledge. So in the reverse situation, where the lace turned out <i>not</i> to be dutiable, why should it be held (as it was in <i>United States v. Oviedo</i>, supra) that a finding of intent will necessarily be suspect, regardless of the strength of the evidence that Lady Eldon believed otherwise? Suppose, for example, that the lace were carefully hidden in a specially tailored, concealed pocket of the coach; that a letter from Lady Eldon to her sister described her newly bought “French lace” in exquisite detail. There would seem little danger to the innocent in allowing a jury to find an attempt to smuggle French lace on these facts. Indeed, in cases like <i>Jaffe</i> and <i>Berrigan</i>, “attempt” is charged only because of the involvement of an undercover agent, whose participation prevents completion of the intended crime. Whatever else one may say about such investigatory tactics, they do not necessarily render suspect the evidence of the defendant’s intent; indeed, in practice, they usually render that evidence <i>less</i> speculative than it otherwise would be. The proper remedy for speculative and unreliable jury findings of intent is a court alert to preclude such findings in particular cases where the evidence is insufficient.</p><p id="76d90cc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the end, then, the arguments in favor of Lady Eldon (and those which have been used to reverse convictions in cases like <i>Jaffe, Oviedo</i>, and <i>Berrigan</i>) rest on unpersuasive policy considerations rationalized by a peculiar interpretation of what it means to intend an act, one that is utterly at odds both with the common usage of our language and its usage elsewhere in the criminal law. <i>We conclude that the apparently innocuous character of the <span title="687" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-687">p. 687</span>action actually done (innocuous in the sense that it could not constitute a crime under the actual circumstances) will not save her from an attempt conviction if she believed that the facts were otherwise, and if, had her belief been correct, what she set out to do would constitute a crime.</i> This is the principle that has found favor in virtually every serious statutory effort to deal with the problem, and in numerous decisions reached without benefit of a specific statute to tell the court that a person intends to do what he thinks he is doing.</p><p id="76d90cc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We must say a few words more about the final qualification to the principle just asserted; namely, that “had her belief [in the circumstances] been correct, what she set out to do would constitute a crime.” The point can best be made by altering the hypothetical. Suppose the lace that Lady Eldon had purchased was in fact the expensive French lace she meant to buy. The customs officer at Dover brings it to light. He then says to Lady Eldon: “Lucky you returned to England today rather than yesterday. I just received word this morning that the government has removed French lace from the duty list.” Could Lady Eldon be held for attempt to smuggle French lace in these circumstances? Certainly what she did and what she intended to do were not different simply because she acted one day later, when French lace was removed from the duty list. But there is this important difference: At the time she acted, what she intended to do (always judged, of course, from her own perspective) was not a violation of the criminal law, even though she thought it was.</p><p id="76d90cca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that Lady Eldon’s action showed her to be a person who would break some law under some circumstances. But what law? The law against smuggling French lace? There no longer was such a law. The criminal laws generally? Our law does not hold that <i>any</i> antisocial attitude is sufficient to justify criminal punishment. That a person was willing to violate what she thought was the law raises the odds of her violating an actual law in the future. But as Professor Williams has pointed out, “if the legislature has not seen fit to prohibit the consummated act, a mere approach to consummation should a fortiori be guiltless. Any other view would offend against the principle of legality; in effect the law of attempt would be used to manufacture a new crime, when the legislature has left the situation outside the ambit of the law.” Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part 633-634 (2d ed. 1961). Had the customs-duty list been changed as supposed, therefore, it would be just as wrong to convict her as to convict a person of marijuana possession where the defendant purchased the drug without realizing that the marijuana-possession law had been repealed. These are the cases of true legal impossibility.</p><p id="76d90ccb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But these cases of true legal impossibility are totally different from cases like <i>Jaffe</i> and <i>Berrigan</i>, even though the courts in each case made it seem otherwise, by asserting that what the defendants intended to do could not have constituted a crime. What the drug purchaser intended to do (and did) could not constitute a crime because there was no such crime. What Jaffe and Berrigan intended to do (and thought they did) was indeed a crime. It is only through a perverse use of intent that we can say that Jaffe intended to receive honestly obtained property or that Berrigan intended to <span title="688" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-688">p. 688</span>send out a letter the warden knew about, and therefore that what they intended to do was not a crime.</p><p id="76d90ccc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lady Eldon, in the initial hypothetical, in contrast to the modified hypothetical, presents no more a case of genuine legal impossibility than do <i>Jaffe</i> and <i>Berrigan.</i> She will be convicted of attempt to smuggle French lace.</p></div>

<p id="76d90cd1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>First:</i> Consider a safecracker who tries to open a safe with magic incantations. Under the <i>Lady Eldon</i> analysis, the safecracker would merely have made a mistake of fact, and he could be convicted of attempt. Or consider the case of Leroy Ivy and John Henry Ivy, two brothers who tried to use voodoo to kill a judge who had sentenced one of them to prison for robbery.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114D5_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N114D5_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> The brothers paid the judge’s housekeeper $100 for his photo and a lock of his hair, which they planned to mail to a voodoo practitioner in Jamaica. Police officers in Tupelo, Mississippi, foiled the plot by arresting Leroy Ivy before he could send off the items needed to cast the spell. Charged with attempting to kill the judge, the brothers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to five and ten years respectively. But these defendants, like the safecracker, are more pathetic than dangerous.</p>
<p id="76d933e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC, recognizing this problem, gives a court the power to dismiss a prosecution or decrease the penalty if the alleged attempt “is so inherently unlikely to result or culminate in the commission of a crime that neither such conduct nor the actor presents a public danger.” Section 5.05(2). But this solution leaves the matter to the discretion of the judge; it is not a rule of law. A better approach is that developed by Professor Robbins, who proposes that a person be guilty of attempt only when “he purposely does or omits to do anything that, <i>under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be</i>,” is a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in commission of the crime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114E4_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N114E4_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> Yet this proposal arguably goes too far in the opposite direction. It succeeds in excluding the voodoo case from attempt liability, but it could run into difficulty in the case of an actor who, intending to kill, fires a gun he incorrectly believes to be loaded with live bullets. Should that actor be able to avoid liability, even though he thought his shot would be lethal, by arguing that a reasonable person would have realized that in fact the gun was loaded with blanks?</p>
<p id="76d933e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Second:</i> The effort to deal with the so-called true legal impossibility problem is not convincing. Consider the following case. Two friends, Mr. Fact and Mr. Law, go hunting in the morning of October 15 in the fields of the state <span title="689" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-689">p. 689</span>of Dakota, whose law allows hunting on that date but makes it a misdemeanor to hunt before October 1. Both men kill deer on their first day out. Mr. Fact thinks he has committed a crime because he is under the erroneous belief that the date is September 15 (when hunting is illegal). Mr. Law thinks he has committed a crime because he is under the erroneous belief that hunting is permitted only in November (as it was the previous year). Under the principle proposed by the editors to deal with Lady Eldon’s case, Mr. Fact could be convicted of an attempt to hunt out of season, but Mr. Law could not be. We fail to see how any rational system of criminal law could justify convicting one and acquitting the other on the fragile and unpersuasive distinction that one made a mistake of fact, while the other made a mistake of law. If the ultimate test is the dangerousness of the actor (i.e., readiness to violate the law), as the <i>Lady Eldon</i> analysis argues, no distinction is warranted—Mr. Law has shown himself to be no less “dangerous” than Mr. Fact.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114F8_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N114F8_12a1c298-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76d933e8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same point can be made with the very example that the editors use to support their <i>Lady Eldon</i> analysis—the case in which, unbeknownst to Lady Eldon, French lace has just been removed from the duty list. The editors ask, in effect, <i>What law</i> is she likely to break? Not smuggling French lace, they say, because there’s no longer such a law. Correct. Not criminal laws generally, they say, because that would rest criminality on mere speculation. Correct again. But how about the law against smuggling? Has she shown herself to be less a smuggler, just because she arrived right after French lace had been removed from the duty list? The editors err in treating the case as if duties had been repealed on all goods, whereas only one item had been removed from the duty list.</p>
<p id="76d933e9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Third:</i> The opinion overlooks the strong case for retaining the defense in one class of <i>factual</i> impossibility cases. These are the cases in which the acts done by the defendant are consistent with an innocent state of mind. Take, for example, the old saw about the professor who takes his own umbrella thinking it belongs to his colleague. The act is utterly neutral. A man taking his own umbrella conveys no evidence of guilt. Of course, the matter changes if it can be proved that he believed it was his colleague’s umbrella. But proof of state of mind is inherently unreliable where there are only ambiguous acts to support the inference.</p>
<p id="76d95afa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="690" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-690">p. 690</span>Consider how the MPC deals with this very concern when it addresses itself to a different problem, i.e., drawing the line between preparation and attempt. This is typically the situation in which the actor has not yet completed all he set out to do. In §5.01, the MPC requires that his acts be “strongly corroborative of the actor’s criminal purpose.” The primary function of this requirement is to avoid the risk of false convictions. Where the evidence of intent falls below a certain level we are not willing to allow the jury to speculate.</p>
<p id="76d95afb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both the <i>Lady Eldon</i> opinion and the MPC are short-sighted for not seeing that the same concern exists in the class of impossibility cases under discussion. In this respect the court in <i>Oviedo</i>, p. 683 supra, and cases that have followed its lead, are on solid ground. If concern about false convictions calls for the requirement that the acts strongly corroborate the intent when the actor had to do further acts to achieve his objective, then the same concern calls for the same requirement where the actor believed he had done all he needed to do. The professor taking his own umbrella is just such a case.</p>
<p id="76d95afc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To put the suggestion in statutory form, we propose the following amendment to MPC §5.01:</p>

It provides that one who assists a voluntary suicide ordinarily cannot be convicted of homicide (§210.5(1)), but it also creates a separate offense for a person who aids or encourages a suicide, with felony penalties applicable when “his conduct <i>causes</i> such suicide” to occur. (§210.5(2)). The latter provision appears to presuppose that one can “cause” the entirely voluntary suicide of another person. (When a suicide is not fully voluntary, a person who causes it can be prosecuted for homicide under §210.5(1).)</p>

In the present case, defendant Jackson received a two-year sentence on the conspiracy count and a suspended sentence on the other counts; Scott received a five-year sentence on the conspiracy count and concurrent seven-year terms on the attempt counts; Allen received a five-year sentence on the conspiracy count and concurrent ten-year terms on the attempt counts.—<span class="epub-small-caps">EDS.</span>

In a related proposal, Professor Fletcher suggests that attempts be punishable only when two conditions are met: “[T]he actor must attempt an act punishable under the law, and, further, this attempt must be dangerous on its face.” George P.
