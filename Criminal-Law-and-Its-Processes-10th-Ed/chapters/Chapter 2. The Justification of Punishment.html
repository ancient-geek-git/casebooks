<p id="767541e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Punishing wrongdoers for their misconduct seems self-evidently appropriate. But this straightforward idea becomes complex and controversial when we seek to apply it to actual cases, because there are many distinct reasons <i>why</i> punishment of wrongdoers may be appropriate. Although these explanations sometimes overlap or reinforce each other, often they conflict, pointing toward different legal responses. It therefore becomes essential to examine the distinct explanations for punishment in depth, in order to understand their application in real-world situations. This chapter focuses on those explanations. But before exploring them in detail, it will be useful for students first to have a concrete sense of what criminal punishment is in our society.</p>

<p id="767541ea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In broad outline, the principal forms of criminal punishment are familiar. Punishment may consist of a fine, probation, imprisonment or, in especially serious cases, the death penalty. Less obviously, the conviction itself is a form of punishment, carrying with it a social stigma and a host of collateral consequences, including an impediment to future employment, a risk of enhanced punishment in the event of a future offense, as well as possible loss of voting rights, public housing access, and deportation. See Michael Pinard, Freedom in Decline: Reflections and Perspectives on Reentry and Collateral Consequences, 100 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1213 (2010). A state-by-state listing of collateral consequences of conviction can be found at the Collateral Consequences Resource Center website, http://ccresourcecenter.org/resources-2/state-specific-resources/.</p>
<p id="767541eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts have also developed “intermediate sanctions” that are less harsh than imprisonment but more severe than probation. These include weeks or months of home detention, mandated community service, or “intensive-supervision” probation (which often includes mandatory counseling or drug treatment).</p>
<p id="767568fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Imprisonment, of course, represents the quintessential criminal punishment. Though not inflicted in every case, it is almost always an option that the judge has <span title="82" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-82">p. 82</span>discretion to impose. And even when not imposed, imprisonment remains in the background as a possible consequence of any failure to meet conditions of a fine, probation, or intermediate sanction. The material that follows takes a close look at what imprisonment actually entails in America today.</p>

</div><p id="76756901-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Average citizens stereotype prisons as either hell-holes filled with every imaginable evil, or country clubs (complete with swimming pools and golf courses) where inmates are sent to work on their tans. Neither of these stereotypes captures the central realities of incarceration for inmates: crushing routine and relentless boredom. . . . 
</p><p id="76756902-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal and most state correctional systems include an impressive array of institutions with different security level designations. Maximum security prisons [which house some 20 percent of the prison population] operate as armed fortresses, complete with steel gates, high walls (sometimes extending many feet underground to prevent escapes through tunnels), perimeter fences (topped with multiple layers of razor-sharp concertina barbed wire), gun towers, and floodlights. Some of these prisons are marvels in advanced technology, containing a complex network of electronic surveillance that includes metal detectors, concealed video cameras, and heat and touch sensors in the walls, floors, and ceilings. Correctional officers in these prisons carefully supervise and control the every move of inmates through detailed schedules and constant head counts.</p><p id="76756903-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inmates in maximum security prisons have little freedom and autonomy; their lives are ruled by the same mind-numbing routines for months and years on end. These prisoners lead a depersonalized existence with little privacy: passersby can gaze into their cells to watch them eat, sleep, or use the toilet. They even shower together in large, open stalls that are closely monitored by correctional officers. In an effort to control the proliferation of drugs, weapons, and other contraband, there are frequent shakedowns (or random searches) of cellblocks in maximum security units. It is little wonder that inmates in these prisons often bitterly complain that they are displayed and managed like animals in a zoo.</p><p id="76756904-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While life in maximum security prisons is usually monotonous and boring, the tedium is sometimes broken by outbursts of violence. Threats, assaults, and killings are fairly commonplace in these institutions. . . . The threat of violence is real enough in maximum security prisons to produce a constant undercurrent of tension, fear, and wariness among inmates and staff; smarter prisoners in these institutions make a habit of looking over their shoulders or standing with their backs to walls whenever they venture outside their cells.</p><p id="76756905-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="83" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-83">p. 83</span>A more relaxed atmosphere prevails in most medium and minimum security prisons. Violence is much less common [and] conditions of confinement are usually much better. . . . Inmates have greater freedom of movement and . . . are also given more privileges. . . . These prisons sometimes offer community release programs, where inmates leave the facility during the day to attend school or for work. . . . 
</p><p id="76759016-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even within prisons, living arrangements vary considerably. Large maximum security penitentiaries usually have at least three forms of confinement: segregation units, the general population, and honor blocks. Inmates in segregation units are isolated from other prisoners, either for administrative purposes, for disciplinary infractions, or for protective custody. . . . 
</p><p id="76759017-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those confined in segregation units have less freedom of movement and autonomy than the typical mainline inmate confined in the general population cellblocks of maximum security prisons. Unlike prisoners in segregation, those in the general population have unrestricted prison yard, gymnasium, and commissary privileges, and eat together in the prison cafeteria. . . . 
</p><p id="76759018-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] number of factors since the 1970s have combined to increase the pains of imprisonment experienced by most inmates. . . . The deteriorating conditions of confinement, longer prison sentences, and overcrowding together have increased the suffering that inmates experience in prison. Levels of violence, fear, and hopelessness rise in crowded cellblocks that are saturated with drugs and overrun by gang bangers. This has led to the emergence of new, indigenous prison gangs organized for self-defense and for buying and sharing drugs. [A] study of men’s prisons in California found that for every gang imported into prison from the streets, another gang forms inside for protection. Some of these new prison gangs will be exported into the free world once their members are paroled.</p><p id="76759019-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The turmoil in modern prisons means that inmate subcultures are in a precarious state. If prison conditions worsen, the pains of imprisonment could become severe enough to breed new values and roles among inmates, fundamentally altering the criminal and conventional personalities imported from the streets. This could signal a return to the “bad old days” in corrections where convicts were irreparably damaged through prisonization, or exposure to the inmate subculture. Some commentators already sense the growing unrest and despair in the cellblocks: Victor Hassine compares the modern prison to a “runaway train” filled with prisoners only concerned about “how they are going to survive this madness.”</p></div>

Though the number of assaults in both categories increased by about 30 percent from five years earlier, the rate per thousand remained roughly stable because the total inmate population had increased by a comparable amount. Data on excessive violence by correctional officers are not provided by the Bureau. As for homicide victimization rates, they dipped sharply from 1960 (54 per 100,000) to 1990 (8 per 100,000). By 2011, prison homicide rates had declined further, to 5 per 100,000, but they rose 24 percent to 7 per 100,000 in 2012, a rate significantly higher than homicide victimization rates for the population at large.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100C4_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100C4_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span>

Even the corrections officers feel unsafe. In a vivid account, a journalist who became a corrections officer reported that the New York prison where he worked was “a world of adrenaline and aggression. . . . It was an experience of living with fear—fear of inmates . . . and fear of our own capacity to [slip up]. [M]ake a mistake around the inmates and you might get hurt.” Ted Conover, Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing 95 (2000).

High rates of disease and illness among prisoners, coupled with inadequate funding for correctional health care, endanger prisoners, staff, and the public. . . . The increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release.</p>

<i>2. Sexual violence.</i> Although accurate estimates of the incidence of sexual assault in prisons are difficult to obtain, the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA), 42 U.S.C.A. §15601, sought to improve our knowledge by requiring the Department of Justice to collect data on sexual victimization in the country’s prisons and jails.

<i>3. Crowding.</i> One characteristic of American prisons that is important, both as a cause of prison violence and as a serious problem in its own right, is pervasive overcrowding. A surge in prison construction during the 1990s was accompanied by a nearly equivalent surge in incarceration rates, with the result that overcrowding in state prisons declined only slightly. While experts believe that efficient prison management requires prisons to operate significantly <i>below</i> their full capacity levels, 17 states had prisons over capacity in 2013.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10124_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10124_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> The federal prison system was operating at 39 percent above its design capacity in medium security facilities and 52 percent over capacity in its highest security facilities.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10130_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10130_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">9</a></span>

<p id="7675de4a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The consequences of overcrowding include poor health care, interference with rehabilitative and educational services (which are often minimal in any event), increased idleness, constant noise, and oppressive living arrangements, all of which magnify interpersonal conflict among prisoners and create even greater impetus for inmate-on-inmate violence; such conditions also create many additional opportunities for inmates to perpetrate such violence with impunity. See Sharon Dolovich, Cruelty, Prison Conditions, and the Eighth Amendment, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 881, 886-889 (2009). These impacts on inmate psychology and mental health also aggravate the likelihood of recidivism when prisoners are released. See Alan Elsner, Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons (2d ed. 2006). One prison psychiatrist, quoted in Dolovich, supra, at 887 n.20, observes:</p>

<i>5. Incarceration without imprisonment.</i> Although imprisonment is the quintessential criminal sanction, many measures that look very much like imprisonment are not considered “punishment” at all, and are therefore subject to much less stringent constitutional safeguards. This important territory just outside the boundaries of criminal law is examined in the Note that follows.</p>

<i>NOTE ON CIVIL SANCTIONS</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76760566-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some forms of involuntary confinement are classified as “civil” measures rather than criminal punishments. Civil commitment of the mentally ill is a prominent example. The distinction between civil and criminal measures (or between “regulation” and “punishment”) has enormous practical importance. Before imposing “punishment,” the government must comply with stringent safeguards, including the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And the duration of criminal punishment is limited by the perceived imperative (moral, statutory, and constitutional) of proportionality to an offender’s fault. In a civil proceeding, in contrast, the burden of proof is typically lower, many other safeguards of criminal procedure do not apply, and the defendant may face loss of liberty for an indefinite period, potentially for life.</p>
<p id="76760567-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What features make a proceeding civil rather than criminal? Government cannot escape the usual criminal law restrictions simply by attaching the “civil” label to a sanction that is punitive in its purpose or effect. To determine whether a nominally civil measure is legally deemed to be punishment (and thus whether criminal law safeguards apply), courts must consider<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1019E_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1019E_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span>

<p id="76760569-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of <i>scienter</i>, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment—retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.</p>
</div>
<p id="7676056a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Involuntary commitment of the mentally ill, for the protection of themselves or others, is universally considered a civil proceeding. The person committed has a right to treatment, and he or she must be released when he or she is no longer mentally ill or dangerous. Nonetheless, such a person may, if not cured, be confined for life. See p. 1027 infra.</p>
<p id="7676056b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other restrictions on liberty are more difficult to classify. In the early 1990s, many states enacted sexually violent predator (SVP) laws in order to permit long-term confinement of sex offenders who finish serving their criminal sentences. The typical SVP law permits indefinite commitment of persons on the basis of a finding that they have a “mental abnormality” or “personality disorder” and are “likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.” SVP laws typically do not bar the provision of treatment, but many of them acknowledge that the SVP condition is difficult or impossible to treat.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101B8_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N101B8_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76762c7d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can offenders be committed under such a law, after they have served their sentences, without violating the rule against double jeopardy? Can such a law <span title="88" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-88">p. 88</span>be applied retroactively to a person whose sex offense was committed before the law was enacted? Can a person be adjudicated an SVP and committed indefinitely, without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that future sexual misconduct is “likely”? If the SVP proceeding is properly classified as civil, the answer to all these questions is yes. In Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997), the Supreme Court upheld the civil classification of one such law. The Court emphasized that under the Kansas regime, inmates are not subject to punitive conditions of confinement and are entitled to immediate release whenever it is determined that they are no longer dangerous. Four dissenting justices argued that the Kansas regime should nonetheless be considered criminal because treatable inmates had been afforded little or no treatment and because the committing authorities were not required to consider using less restrictive means of social protection, short of incarceration. Following the lead of the <i>Hendricks</i> majority, many state courts have upheld schemes for indefinite confinement of persons designated as sexually violent predators, even when the procedures fall short of those required in criminal prosecutions and do not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., State v. Ploof, 34 A.3d 563 (N.H. 2011).</p>
<p id="76762c7e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similar issues arise under laws that require convicted sex offenders, upon release from prison, to register with local police. Such laws, modeled on the “Megan’s Law” first enacted in New Jersey, typically require the police to make such registration lists publicly available. In many instances, police must also notify schools, day care centers, and local residents of the individual’s presence in the community. Should such laws be considered civil measures to which criminal law safeguards do not apply? In New Jersey, Megan’s Law was upheld as a civil measure only after the state supreme court required modifications to restrict the degree of public disclosure, depending on whether the ex-offender was found to pose a low, medium, or high risk of reoffending. See E.B. v. Verniero, 119 F.3d 107 (3d Cir. 1997). And even with this limitation, several courts hold that public disclosure is unconstitutional in the absence of a careful adversary procedure to determine the ex-offender’s level of risk. E.g., State v. Williams, 952 N.E.2d 1108 (Ohio 2011); Paul P. v. Farmer, 92 F. Supp. 2d 410 (D.N.J. 2000); People v. David W., 733 N.E.2d 206 (N.Y. 2000). In contrast, a Tennessee version of Megan’s Law was upheld as a civil measure even though it imposed no limits on public disclosure of information about ex-offenders who had registered. Cutshall v. Sundquist, 193 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 1999). The issues are explored in depth in Wayne A. Logan, Knowledge as Power: Criminal Registration and Community Notification Laws in America (2009).</p>
<p id="76762c7f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another area of concern about the line between civil sanctions and criminal punishment involves immigration detention. Immigration proceedings are classified as civil, but one commentator has argued that immigration detention should be seen as punishment. Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, Immigration Detention as Punishment, 61 UCLA L. Rev. 1346 (2014). He argues that Congress’s intent in establishing the immigration detention system was based on the same punitive impulses behind the war on drugs and that <span title="89" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-89">p. 89</span>“the legal divide between criminal law and immigration law is contradicted by the lived experience of hundreds of thousands of people who every year occupy immigration detention centers.” Id. at 1414.</p>

<p id="76762c84-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next case, one of the most famous in the history of the common law, arose under circumstances that were unusual, to say the least. Nonetheless, many generations of lawyers, law students, legal scholars, and philosophers have debated—and continue to debate—the issues it poses and their implications for more commonplace problems of criminal justice. In reading the court’s decision, consider whether there were good reasons to impose any punishment on these defendants. If so, what punishment was called for?</p>
<p id="76762c85-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More broadly, the case also raises questions about the role of courts, about the legal method, and about the very meaning of “the law.” How should a judge ascertain the correct legal principle and apply it when the facts of a case are unlike those present in prior precedents? Is a court duty-bound to enforce existing rules, even when they were established in very different circumstances? Alternatively, should judges have the right (or the obligation) to craft new rules specifically tailored to the facts before them?</p>
<p id="76765296-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider whether the court gives persuasive answers to these questions concerning the reasons for punishment and the proper role of the courts.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">LORD COLERIDGE</span>, C.J. The two prisoners, Thomas Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were indicted for the murder of Richard Parker on the high seas on the 25th of July in the present year. They were tried before my Brother Huddleston at Exeter on the 6th of November, and, under the direction of my learned Brother, the jury returned a special verdict, the legal effect of which has been argued before us, and on which we are now to pronounce judgment. The special verdict . . . is as follows.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7676529c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That on July 5, 1884, the prisoners, . . . with one Brooks, all able-bodied English seamen, and the deceased also an English boy, between seventeen and eighteen years of age, the crew of . . . a registered English vessel, were cast away in a storm on the high seas 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and were compelled to put into an open boat belonging to the said [vessel]. That in this boat they had no supply of water and no supply of food, except two 1 lb. <span title="90" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-90">p. 90</span>tins of turnips, and for three days they had nothing else to subsist upon. That on the fourth day they caught a small turtle, upon which they subsisted for a few days, and this was the only food they had up to the twentieth day when the act now in question was committed. That on the twelfth day the remains of the turtle were entirely consumed, and for the next eight days they had nothing to eat. That they had no fresh water, except such rain as they from time to time caught in their oilskin capes. That the boat was drifting on the ocean, and was probably more than 1,000 miles away from land. That on the eighteenth day, when they had been seven days without food and five without water, the prisoners spoke to Brooks as to what should be done if no succour came, and suggested that some one should be sacrificed to save the rest, but Brooks dissented, and the boy, to whom they were understood to refer, was not consulted. That on the 24th of July, the day before the act now in question, the prisoner Dudley proposed to Stephens and Brooks that lots should be cast who should be put to death to save the rest, but Brooks refused to consent, and it was not put to the boy, and in point of fact there was no drawing of lots. That on the day the prisoners spoke of their families, and suggested it would be better to kill the boy that their lives should be saved, and Dudley proposed that if there was no vessel in sight by the morrow morning the boy should be killed. That next day, the 25th of July, no vessel appearing, Dudley told Brooks that he had better go and have a sleep, and made signs to Stephens and Brooks that the boy had better be killed. The prisoner Stephens agreed to the act, but Brooks dissented from it. That the boy was then lying at the bottom of the boat quite helpless and extremely weakened by famine and by drinking sea water, and unable to make any resistance, nor did he ever assent to his being killed. The prisoner Dudley offered a prayer asking forgiveness for them all if either of them should be tempted to commit a rash act, and that their souls might be saved. That Dudley, with the assent of Stephens, went to the boy, and telling him that his time was come, put a knife into his throat and killed him then and there; that the three men fed upon the body and blood of the boy for four days; that on the fourth day after the act had been committed the boat was picked up by a passing vessel, and the prisoners were rescued, still alive, but in the lowest state of prostration. . . . That if the men had not fed upon the body of the boy they would probably not have survived to be so picked up and rescued, but would within four days have died of famine. That the boy, being in a much weaker condition, was likely to have died before them. That at the time of the act in question there was no sail in sight, nor any reasonable prospect of relief. That under these circumstances there appeared to the prisoners every probability that unless they then fed or very soon fed upon the boy or one of themselves they would die of starvation. That there was no appreciable chance of saving life except by killing some one for the others to eat. That assuming any necessity to kill anybody, there was no greater necessity for killing the boy than any of the other three men. But whether upon the whole matter by the jurors found the killing of Richard Parker by Dudley and Stephens be felony and murder the jurors are ignorant, and pray the advice of the Court thereupon, and if upon the whole matter the Court shall be of opinion that the killing of Richard Parker be felony and murder, then the jurors say that Dudley and Stephens were each guilty of felony and murder as alleged in the indictment. . . .

<p id="7676529d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="91" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-91">p. 91</span>From these facts, stated with the cold precision of a special verdict, it appears sufficiently that the prisoners were subject to terrible temptation, to sufferings which might break down the bodily power of the strongest man, and try the conscience of the best. Other details yet more harrowing, facts still more loathsome and appalling, were presented to the jury, and are to be found recorded in my learned Brother’s notes. But nevertheless this is clear, that the prisoners put to death a weak and unoffending boy upon the chance of preserving their own lives by feeding upon his flesh and blood after he was killed, and with the certainty of depriving <i>him</i> of any possible chance of survival. The verdict finds in terms that “if the men had not fed upon the body of the boy they would <i>probably</i> not have survived,” and that “the boy being in a much weaker condition was <i>likely</i> to have died before them.” They might possibly have been picked up [the] next day by a passing ship; they might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and profitless act. It is found by the verdict that the boy was incapable of resistance, and, in fact, made none; and it is not even suggested that his death was due to any violence on his part attempted against, or even so much as feared by, those who killed him. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767679ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he real question in the case [is] whether killing under the circumstances set forth in the verdict be or not be murder. The contention that it could be anything else was, to the minds of us all, both new and strange, and we stopped the Attorney General in his negative argument in order that we might hear what could be said in support of a proposition which appeared to us to be at once dangerous, immoral, and opposed to all legal principle and analogy. . . . First it is said that it follows from various definitions of murder in books of authority, which definitions imply, if they do not state, the doctrine, that in order to save your own life you may lawfully take away the life of another, when that other is neither attempting nor threatening yours, nor is guilty of any illegal act whatever towards you or any one else. But if these definitions be looked at they will not be found to sustain this contention. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767679af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he doctrine contended for receives no support from the great authority of Lord Hale. . . . Lord Hale regarded the private necessity which justified, and alone justified, the taking the life of another for the safeguard of one’s own to be what is commonly called “self-defence.” [H]e thus expresses himself:—“If a man be desperately assaulted and in peril of death, and cannot otherwise escape unless, to satisfy his assailant’s fury, he will kill an innocent person then present, the fear and actual force will not acquit him of the crime and punishment of murder, if he commit the fact [sic], for he ought rather to die himself than kill an innocent; but if he cannot otherwise save his own life the law permits him in his own defence to kill the assailant, for by the violence of the assault, and the offence committed upon him by the assailant himself, the law of nature, and necessity, hath made him his own protector. . . . ” (Hale’s Pleas of the Crown, vol. i. 51.)</p>
<p id="767679b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, further still, Lord Hale in the following chapter deals with the position asserted . . . he says, by Grotius and Puffendorf, that in a case of extreme <span title="92" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-92">p. 92</span>necessity, either of hunger or clothing; “theft is no theft, or at least not punishable as theft, as some even of our own lawyers have asserted the same.” “But,” says Lord Hale, “I take it that here in England, that rule . . . is false; and therefore, if a person, being under necessity for want of victuals or clothes, shall upon that account clandestinely and animo furandi steal another man’s goods, it is felony, and a crime by the laws of England punishable with death.” (Hale, Pleas of the Crown, i. 54.) If, therefore, Lord Hale is clear—as he is—that extreme necessity of hunger does not justify larceny, what would he have said to the doctrine that it justified murder? . . . 
</p>
<p id="767679b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there, then, any authority for the proposition which has been presented to us? Decided cases there are none. . . . The American case cited by my Brother Stephen in his Digest . . . in which it was decided, correctly indeed, that sailors had no right to throw passengers overboard to save themselves, but on the somewhat strange ground that the proper mode of determining who was to be sacrificed was to vote upon the subject by ballot, can hardly, as my Brother Stephen says, be an authority satisfactory to a court in this country.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10268_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10268_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>
 . . . 
</p>
<p id="767679b5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The one real authority of former time is Lord Bacon, who . . . lays down the law as follows:—“Necessity carrieth a privilege in itself. [I]f a man steals viands to satisfy his present hunger, this is no felony nor larceny. So if divers be in danger of drowning by the casting away of some boat or barge, and one of them get to some plank, . . . and another to save his life thrust him from it, whereby he is drowned, this is neither se defendendo nor by misadventure, but justifiable.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1028F_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1028F_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>
 . . . Lord Bacon was great even as a lawyer; but it is permissible to much smaller men, relying upon principle and on the authority of others, . . . to question the soundness of his dictum. There are many conceivable states of things in which it might possibly be true, but if Lord Bacon meant to lay down the broad proposition that man may save his life by killing, if necessary, an innocent and unoffending neighbour, it certainly is not law at the present day. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7676a0c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now it is admitted that the deliberate killing of this unoffending and unresisting boy was clearly murder, unless the killing can be justified by <span title="93" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-93">p. 93</span>some well-recognised excuse admitted by the law. It is further admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing was justified by what has been called “necessity.” But the temptation to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it. . . . To preserve one’s life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of instances in which it is a man’s duty not to live, but to die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, of soldiers to women and children impose[s] on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk. It is not correct, therefore, to say that there is any absolute or unqualified necessity to preserve one’s life.<i>
 . . . 
</i>It would be a very easy and cheap display of commonplace learning to quote from Greek and Latin authors, from Horace, from Juvenal, from Cicero, from Euripides, passage after passage, in which the duty of dying for others has been laid down in glowing and emphatic language as resulting from the principles of heathen ethics; it is enough in a Christian country to remind ourselves of the Great Example whom we profess to follow. It is not needful to point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been contended for. Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity? By what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to be strength, or intellect, or what? It is plain that the principle leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will justify him in deliberately taking another’s life to save his own. In this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was chosen. Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? The answer must be “No”—</p>

<p id="7676a0cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not suggested that in this particular case the deeds were “devilish,” but it is quite plain that such a principle once admitted might be made the legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious crime. There is no safe path for judges to tread but to ascertain the law to the best of their ability and to declare it according to their judgment; and if in any case the law appears to be too severe on individuals, to leave it to the Sovereign to exercise that prerogative of mercy which the Constitution has intrusted to the hands fittest to dispense it.</p>
<p id="7676a0cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and <span title="94" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-94">p. 94</span>to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime. It is therefore our duty to declare that the prisoners’ act in this case was wilful murder, that the facts as stated in the verdict are no legal justification of the homicide; and to say that in our unanimous opinion the prisoners are upon this special verdict guilty of murder.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102D8_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102D8_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span>

<p id="7676c7e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For discussion of the background of <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, see Neil Hanson, The Custom of the Sea (2000); A.W.B. Simpson, Cannibalism and the Common Law (1984). As both books report, cannibalism was an accepted fact of life at sea before the era of modern communications and rescue capabilities, because seamen occasionally found themselves stranded far from help. Through most of the nineteenth century, such cases were treated as tragedies, either celebrated or discreetly ignored; the survivors were received with sympathy or perverse fascination but were seldom considered candidates for prosecution. The “custom of the sea” (cannibalism) was so well established that Dudley talked freely about the episode with an apparently clear conscience. But British officials, concerned that the custom of the sea set a potentially bad precedent, were determined to make a test case of the incident, and the prosecution of Dudley and Stephens ensued. See also Allen D. Boyer, Crime, Cannibalism and Joseph Conrad: The Influence of <i>Regina v. Dudley and Stephens</i> on <i>Lord Jim</i>, 20 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 9 (1986).</p>
<p id="7676c7e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Prudential concerns.</i> On facts like those in <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, does punishment serve any practical purpose? Is the threat of the death penalty adequate to deter this sort of conduct? If not, should murder at sea under circumstances such as those in <i>Dudley and Stephens</i> be punished by some especially painful sort of capital punishment? Conversely, what was the rationale for <i>reducing</i> the punishment, commuting the death sentence to a six months’ prison term? If a severe sentence is inappropriate when a defendant faces powerful temptation to commit a prohibited act, why bother imposing any punishment at all?</p>
<p id="7676c7e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Would the convictions be defensible if the “custom of the sea” was having a prejudicial impact on the British maritime industry? Would punishment on that ground be justified even if the defendants’ actions were not blameworthy, or is it essential to limit punishment to those who <i>deserve</i> it? If so, <i>did</i> Dudley and Stephens deserve punishment?</p>
<p id="7676c7e6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="95" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-95">p. 95</span>The specific situation faced by Dudley and Stephens was unusual even at the time, but in a sense the underlying problem is a recurrent one for our own criminal justice system, because harmful conduct is often the product of great pressure or temptation. Should defendants who commit crimes in such circumstances receive especially severe punishment, especially lenient punishment, or no punishment at all?</p>
<p id="7676c7e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The problem of desert.</i> Are there legitimate grounds to conclude that Dudley and Stephens did not <i>deserve</i> to be punished, despite their deliberate, carefully premeditated decision to kill Parker? Note that there are several distinct reasons why punishment may not be deserved, even when a person intentionally causes serious harm. Consider the following possibilities:</p>
<p id="7676c7e8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Justification.</i> Any reasonable legal system must provide for self-defense as a justification, and of course ours does. But should Dudley and Stephens be permitted to rely on this concept? Should a claim of self-defense fail because Parker was not threatening them? Or should self-defense be available because they sought to save their own lives? After all, it was necessary (or reasonably seemed necessary) to kill one person so that the two others had a chance of survival. In a severe storm it is desirable for a ship’s captain to jettison cargo (whose owner of course has done nothing wrong) in order to keep his ship from sinking. Is it also desirable, therefore, to sacrifice one person in order to save two, rather than to let all three die? Legal doctrine governing these issues is explored in Chapter 8.B, Principles of Justification, infra, but it is worth pausing now to consider what approach makes sense in terms of the underlying purposes of punishment.</p>
<p id="7676c7e9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the problem in <i>Dudley and Stephens</i> simply that the defendants did not draw straws or use some other fair means to determine who would be sacrificed? Lord Coleridge mocks that idea and indicates that the defendants would have been guilty of murder even if the person to be sacrificed had been chosen fairly. What possible purpose would punishment serve in such a case?</p>
<p id="7676c7ea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Excuse.</i> The law provides a defense to certain limited classes of defendants whose actions are harmful and unjustified, when we believe they could not reasonably be expected to have done better. Children and insane people are examples. Should the same principle excuse Dudley and Stephens? Could they fairly have been expected to do better? The judges in <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, just prior to sentencing the two defendants to death, acknowledge that they were imposing a standard of conduct that they themselves might well have been unable to reach. But how can we fairly punish an act that a law-abiding person might commit? Current law governing these issues is explored in Chapter 8.C, Principles of Excuse, infra.</p>

<i>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="7676ef00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Punishment is unpleasant. And unlike other potentially unpleasant experiences (paying taxes, military service in wartime), punishment is <i>intended</i> to be unpleasant. There is universal agreement, therefore, that government must have a strong justification when it deliberately seeks to inflict physical or emotional pain on an individual.</p>
<p id="7676ef01-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Broadly speaking, the justifications for punishment fall into two large categories, retributive and utilitarian. “[A] retributivist claims that punishment is justified because people deserve it; a utilitarian believes that justification lies in the useful purposes that punishment serves (the latter approach is sometimes referred to as ‘consequentialist,’ or ‘instrumentalist’).”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1037F_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1037F_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">15</a></span> These are rough groupings, because precise definitions vary from one commentator to another. We will look more closely at these concepts and their implications in a moment, but for present purposes, it is sufficient to bear in mind that retributive rationales are essentially backward looking; in order to decide what sanction that behavior deserves, they attribute crucial importance to the offender’s behavior in the past, and in particular to the blameworthiness of that behavior. Utilitarian or “consequentialist” rationales are essentially forward looking; they seek to justify punishment on the basis of the good consequences it is expected to produce in the future. Three consequences in particular are paramount: deterrence (of the offender and others), incapacitation of the offender, and rehabilitation of the offender.</p>
<p id="7676ef03-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Debate about such justifications sometimes seems purely academic, because both retributive and utilitarian purposes often appear self-evidently sound and mutually reinforcing. Thus, when a contract killer is convicted of murder, with no extenuating circumstances, severe punishment seems appropriate for both retributive and utilitarian reasons. But even in cases of intentional killing, the justifications can sometimes be troubling or in conflict with each other. <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, supra pp. 89-94, is a rare but classic instance of this sort: Considerations of moral blame might suggest a lenient sentence, while considerations of deterrence might suggest a severe one. And tension between the objectives of punishment is by no means confined to such unusual situations; a need to choose between justifications arises almost routinely in the criminal justice system. For mentally disturbed offenders, or offenders driven to commit predatory crime because of addiction or economic need, a focus on moral blame again might suggest reducing the severity of punishment, while concern for deterrence might suggest increasing it. Both the theory of criminal law and its real world application therefore require working with these purposes and understanding their limitations.</p>
<p id="7676ef04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="97" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-97">p. 97</span>The present section examines the various justifications for punishment and the ways that commentators, statutes, and criminal law practitioners seek to piece them together into a coherent framework. Section C.1 considers utilitarianism. That concept’s basic approach, judging social policy by its costs and benefits, is familiar. But in the context of punishment, utilitarianism often is criticized for paying insufficient attention to individual rights, and to the perceived need for a connection between punishment and the offender’s <i>moral blame.</i> Section C.2 turns to retribution—the concept most often called upon to supply that connection. But retribution has its own perceived shortcomings, which Section C.2 explores. Section C.3 considers various “cousins” of retributivism—vengeance, social cohesion, and similar theories that share the retributive focus on the past offense, but depart from classic retributivism’s emphasis on moral blame as the decisive factor determining the justice of a punishment.</p>
<p id="7676ef05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The supposed limitations of both utilitarian and retributive approaches prompt the search for a “mixed” theory that can incorporate the strengths of each without their respective weaknesses. Such “mixed” theories are the subject of Section C.4. Finally, to the extent that a utilitarian approach plays any role in the overall framework of just punishment, many practical issues arise when we seek to achieve the utilitarian objective of crime control in the setting of contemporary American society. Section C.5 examines the complexities of deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation as crime-prevention strategies.</p>
<p id="7676ef06-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following these materials on the justifications for punishment, Section D will present concrete cases that provide a basis for examining the ideas introduced in the present section and testing their implications. The concept of proportional punishment also relies on theories of punishment, and that topic is taken up in Chapter 3, Section C.</p>

</p><p id="76771622-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The observation of rules of proportion between crimes and punishments has been objected to as useless, because they seem to suppose, that a spirit of calculation has place among the passions of men, who, it is said, never calculate. But dogmatic as this proposition is, it is altogether false. In matters of importance every one calculates. Each individual calculates with more or less correctness, according to the degrees of his information, and the power of the motives which actuate him, but all calculate. It would be hard to say that a madman does not calculate. Happily, the passion of cupidity, which on account of its power, its constancy, and its extent, is most formidable to society, is the passion which is most given to calculation. This, therefore, will be more successfully combated, the more carefully the law turns the balance of profit against it.</p></div>

<p id="76773d35-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jeremy Bentham, who lived from 1748 to 1832, was a leading social reformer of his day. At the time, England punished all felonies with death, and Bentham’s writings were in part a reaction against those draconian sanctions. By insisting that punishment “ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil,” Bentham sought to promote “rules of proportion between crimes and punishments.”</p>
<p id="76773d36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But does the cost-benefit approach necessarily lead to proportionality? Couldn’t it be “efficient” to punish all offenses by imprisonment for life? Bentham’s answer is that for trivial offenses, the cost of imprisonment would exceed the benefit in terms of the minor offenses that would be deterred. But even so, for truly serious crimes, such as robbery and rape, couldn’t Bentham’s approach require life imprisonment? Here the utilitarian can respond that, if robbery is subject to the highest possible punishment, the offender would suffer no additional sanction for committing additional robberies or for killing all possible witnesses. Bentham wrote, “Where two offenses are in conjunction, the greater offense ought to be subjected to severer punishment, in order that the delinquent may have a motive to stop at the lesser.”

<p id="76773d38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although utilitarians like Bentham have an answer for why maximum punishments for all crimes do not serve utilitarian theory, the theory suggests <span title="99" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-99">p. 99</span>other intuitively unappealing conclusions if no other limiting principles apply. Consider these problems:</p>
<p id="76773d39-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Punishment of the innocent.</i> Suppose that a string of robberies has gone unsolved and police hear rumors that many people are talking about committing similar crimes, convinced that they will not get caught. From the utilitarian perspective, would the police chief be justified in seizing and framing an innocent person, in order to send a strong deterrent message that such crimes cannot be committed with impunity? If this step is unacceptable, is that because its costs would ultimately outweigh its benefits?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10412_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10412_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">17</a></span> Or is there some reason to resist such a step, regardless of how all details of the cost-benefit calculus might work out?</p>
<p id="76773d3b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Disproportionate punishment</i>. Bentham gives a plausible utilitarian objection to imposing long prison sentences on those who are guilty only of a minor offense. But is it clear that the costs of doing so will always outweigh the benefits? For example, suppose that convenience stores lose millions of dollars every year as a result of shoplifting, and even with security cameras, it is very difficult for them to catch individuals who walk off without paying for a candy bar. On utilitarian grounds, would it be justified to authorize a 20-year prison term for a teenager who steals a 75-cent piece of candy? To be sure, there can be many subtle, indirect costs of such a policy, and a good utilitarian must be careful to consider all such effects. If the 20-year prison term is unjustified, is that because the costs, properly measured, outweigh the benefits? Is it because less costly alternatives to incarceration would have the same deterrent effect? Or are such elaborate cost-benefit calculations (the next excerpt calls them “the serpent-windings of utilitarianism”) essentially beside the point? Is there, again, a more basic reason to reject the punishment, regardless of how its costs and benefits add up?</p>
<p id="76773d3c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These and other discomforts with the utilitarian framework lead many to conclude that it cannot account for strong, unshakeable intuitions about what we know to be wrong. That conclusion prompts many to turn to retributivism as a potentially preferable grounding for our punishment practices, though we will see there are objections to that theory as well.</p>

<p id="76776451-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Retributive” views (of which there are many) share an insistence that punishment must be justified by the seriousness of the offense committed, <span title="100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-100">p. 100</span>rather than by the future benefits to be obtained by punishing. But those who prefer a retributive approach often disagree about precisely what such an approach requires.</p>
<p id="76776452-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One school of thought holds a just society <i>may</i> and indeed <i>must</i> punish the blameworthy. This view is called <i>positive retributivism</i>. Another view sees retributive justice operating as a constraint, where moral guilt is a necessary, but not automatically a sufficient condition of just punishment; under this view (often called <i>negative retributivism</i>), retributivism sets the upper limit to a permissible punishment (i.e., one cannot get <i>more</i> than one deserves), but the state may opt to punish less than that.</p>
<p id="76776453-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another point of disagreement concerns the appropriate focus to use in establishing how much punishment an offender deserves. Retributive views usually link desert to the offender’s <i>moral culpability.</i> But the term retribution is sometimes associated, perhaps inaccurately, with a rather different notion that might be thought of as <i>retaliation</i>—that desert is linked to the <i>harm</i> caused by an offense. Because that shift from blame to harm marks a fundamental change in the focus of the theory of punishment, we postpone consideration of retaliation until Section C.3.a below.</p>

For one man ought never to be dealt with merely as a means subservient to the purpose of another. . . . He must first be found guilty and punishable, before there can be any thought of drawing from his punishment any benefit for himself or his fellow-citizens. The penal law is a categorical imperative; and woe to him who creeps through the serpent-windings of utilitarianism to discover some advantage that may discharge him from the justice of punishment, or even from the due measure of it, according to the Pharisaic maxim: “It is better that one man should die than that the whole people should perish.” For if justice and righteousness perish, human life would no longer have any value in the world. What, then, is to be said of such a proposal as to keep a criminal alive who has been condemned to death, on his being given to understand that if he agreed to certain dangerous experiments being performed upon him, he would be allowed to survive if he came happily through them? It is argued that physicians might thus obtain new information that would be of value to the commonweal. But a court of justice would repudiate with scorn any proposal of this kind if made to it by the medical faculty; for justice would cease to be justice if it were bartered away for any consideration whatever. . . .

It is just the principle of equality, by which the pointer of the scale of justice is made to incline no more to the one side than the other. It may be rendered by saying that the undeserved evil which any one commits on another is to be regarded as perpetrated on himself. Hence it may be said: “If you slander another, you slander yourself; if you steal from another, you steal from yourself; if you strike another, you strike yourself; if you kill another, you kill yourself.” This is the right of retaliation (<i>jus talionis</i>); and properly understood, it is the only principle which in regulating a public court, as distinguished from mere private judgment, can definitely assign both the quality and the quantity of a just penalty. All other standards are wavering and uncertain; and on account of other considerations involved in them, they contain no principle conformable to the sentence of pure and strict justice. . . .

Even if a civil society resolved to dissolve itself with the consent of all its members—as might be supposed in the case of a people inhabiting an island resolving to separate and scatter themselves through the whole world—the last murderer lying in the prison ought to be executed before the resolution was carried out. This ought to be done in order that every one may realize the desert of his deeds, and that bloodguiltiness may not remain upon the people; for otherwise they might all be regarded as participators in the murder as a public violation of justice.</p></div>

A retributivist punishes because, and only because, the offender deserves it. Retributivism thus stands in stark contrast to utilitarian views that justify punishment of past offenses by the greater good of preventing future offenses. . . .

Yet retributivism answers a [different] question. . . . True enough, retributivists at some point have to answer the “how much” and “what type” questions for specific offenses, and they are committed to the principle that punishment should be graded in proportion to desert; but they are not committed to any particular penalty scheme. . . . It is quite possible to be a retributivist and to be <span title="102" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-102">p. 102</span>against both the death penalty and <i>lex talionis</i>, the idea that crimes should be punished by like acts being done to the criminal.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104CB_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N104CB_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

 . . . Retributivism is not the view that punishment of offenders satisfies the desires for vengeance of their victims. . . . A retributivist can justify punishment as deserved even if the criminal’s victims are indifferent (or even opposed) to punishing the one who hurt them. Indeed, a retributivist should urge punishment on all offenders who deserve it, even if <i>no</i> victims wanted it. [Nor is p]unishment for a retributivist . . . justified by the need to prevent private violence, which is an essentially utilitarian justification. Even in the most well-mannered state, those criminals who deserve punishment should get it, according to retributivism. . . . 
</p><p id="76778b73-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Retributivism is a very straightforward theory of punishment: We are justified in punishing because and only because offenders deserve it. Moral culpability (“desert”) . . . gives society more than merely a right to punish culpable offenders. . . . For a retributivist, the moral culpability of an offender also gives society the <i>duty</i> to punish. Retributivism, in other words, is truly a theory of justice such that, if it is true, we have an obligation to set up institutions so that retribution is achieved.</p></div>

Applying to the conduct of <span title="103" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-103">p. 103</span>these men are a group of rules . . . that prohibit violence and deception and compliance with which provides benefits for all persons. . . . Making possible this mutual benefit is the assumption by individuals of a burden. The burden consists in the exercise of self-restraint by individuals over inclinations that would, if satisfied, directly interfere or create a substantial risk of interference with others in proscribed ways. If a person fails to exercise self-restraint even though he might have and gives in to such inclinations, he renounces a burden which others have voluntarily assumed and thus gains an advantage which others, who have restrained themselves, do not possess. This system, then, is one in which the rules establish a mutuality of benefit and burden and in which the benefits of noninterference are conditional upon the assumption of burdens.</p><p id="7677d99b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Connecting punishment with the violation of these primary rules, and making public the provision for punishment, is both reasonable and just. First, it is only reasonable that those who voluntarily comply with the rules be provided some assurance that they will not be assuming burdens which others are unprepared to assume. Their disposition to comply voluntarily will diminish as they learn that others are with impunity renouncing burdens they are assuming. Second, fairness dictates that a system in which benefits and burdens are equally distributed have a mechanism designed to prevent a maldistribution in the benefits and burdens. Thus, sanctions are attached to noncompliance with the primary rules so as to induce compliance . . . among those who may be disinclined to obey. In this way the likelihood of an unfair distribution is diminished.</p><p id="7677d99c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, it is just to punish those who have violated the rules and caused the unfair distribution of benefits and burdens. A person who violates the rules has something others have—the benefits of the system—but by renouncing what others have assumed, the burdens of self-restraint, he has acquired an unfair advantage. Matters are not even until this advantage is in some way erased. Another way of putting it is that he owes something to others, for he has something that does not rightfully belong to him. Justice—that is punishing such individuals—restores the equilibrium of benefits and burdens by taking from the individual what he owes, that is, exacting the debt.</p></div>

The rules benefit all concerned and, as a kind of debt for the benefits derived, each man owes obedience to the rules. In the absence of such obedience, he deserves punishment in the sense that he owes payment for the benefits.

<i>Annulment:</i> This notion . . . seems to be that as long as a criminal goes scot-free, the crime itself still exists, still flourishes, but when the criminal is adequately punished the crime itself is somehow wiped out. It is not, therefore, by any sort of repayment or restitution that “right is restored,” but just by trampling on the previously flourishing crime.

<i>Fair play:</i> Here the suggestion is that the . . . criminal has gained an unfair advantage by breaking the rules; to restore fairness this advantage must be taken away from him. Unlike our last two approaches, this one is not incoherent; it makes perfectly good sense in certain contexts. It has its clearest exemplification in the award of a penalty in football . . . when there has been a foul. . . . It is also retributivist in our basic sense of being retrospective; the justification is complete when the penalty has been imposed; fairness has then (roughly at least) been restored, irrespective of whether there are or are not any further desirable consequences. The trouble with this approach, however, is that it has little relation to most cases of punishment. Any serious attempt to apply it would lead to bizarre results. . . . Thus if a businessman has secured a contract worth $100,000, but has exceeded the speed limit in order to get to the relevant appointment on time, he should presumably be fined $100,000, whereas a fine of $1 would be enough for someone who murders a blind cripple to rob him of $1. . . . Unsuccessful attempts at murder (or anything else) should not be punished at all. . . . What is basically wrong with the fair play approach . . . is that it focuses on the advantage that may have been gained by the criminal in some sort of social competition, whereas the point of punishment surely lies not in this but in the wrongness of his act and the harm that he has done or tried to do. . . .

<p id="767827d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preceding excerpts from Morris, Murphy, Hampton, and Mackie focus on <i>positive</i> retribution—the claim that a just society <i>must</i> impose punishment equivalent in severity to the seriousness of the crime. This is the most controversial form of retributivism; there has been much less discomfort with <i>negative</i> retribution—the claim that the seriousness of the offense sets an upper limit to permissible punishment but does not mandate that the state punish to that extent. But what does this upper limit actually mean in practice? The notion that justice imposes a constraint on punishment is intuitively appealing, but unless that upper limit has some content, it can hardly serve as a significant constraint. So it becomes essential to know how the upper limit is fixed.</p>
<p id="767827d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Kant, for example, insists (p. 101 supra) that the amount of punishment must not be “wavering and uncertain,” and he requires “equality” between crime and punishment. His analysis seems to imply an “eye for an eye” approach, but neither Kant nor other retributivists take such a formula literally. (Even capital punishment, Kant says, “must be kept free from all maltreatment that would make the humanity suffering in his person loathsome.”) <span title="106" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-106">p. 106</span>But how, then, can we prevent the upper limit on punishment from becoming “wavering and uncertain”?</p>

Professor Paul H. Robinson, who has done much of the leading work on empirical desert, also notes (The Ongoing Revolution in Punishment Theory: Doing Justice as Controlling Crime, 42 Ariz. St. L.J. 1089, 1108 (2010)) that adhering to this approach “may do injustice that is not apparent to the present community.” And beyond that concern, does <i>any</i> conception of deserved punishment really set a meaningful constraint in practice? Specific constitutional doctrines relevant to a proportionality requirement are examined at pp. 202-221 and 566-590, infra.

<p id="76784eea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, the essence of a retributive approach is its focus on the nature of the offender’s crime. More specifically, classic retributivism emphasizes the blameworthiness of that crime, and views blame as a decisive concern in itself, without regard to its possible bearing on the consequences of imposing punishment. Several efforts to justify punishment are closely <span title="107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-107">p. 107</span>related to retributivism, in the sense that they too give central importance to the past offense. Indeed for that reason, some of these close relatives are often confused with retributivism or equated with it. But these theories differ in respects that are fundamental. Some of these theories—often called theories of retaliation or vengeance—focus less on the <i>blameworthiness</i> of the past offense than on the <i>harm</i> it caused. Others look to the harmfulness or blameworthiness of the past offense, but do so not because those concerns are considered sufficient in their own right but instead because that emphasis is thought to have certain beneficial <i>consequences.</i> In this section we consider these “cousins” of retributivism—first retaliation and vengeance, and then the theories of social cohesion.</p>

It converts into a permanent final judgment what might otherwise be a transient sentiment. The mere general suspicion or knowledge that a man has done something dishonest may never be brought to a point, and the disapprobation excited by it may in time pass away, but the fact that he has been convicted and punished as a thief stamps a mark upon him for life. In short, the infliction of punishment by law gives definite expression and a solemn ratification and justification to the hatred which is excited by the commission of the offence, and which constitutes the moral or popular as distinguished from the conscientious sanction of that part of morality which is also sanctioned by the criminal law. The criminal law thus proceeds upon the principle that it is morally right to hate criminals, and it confirms and justifies that sentiment by inflicting upon criminals punishments which express it.</p></div>

<i>PROBLEM: UNEXPECTED HARM</i>

<p id="76787607-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2003, a catastrophic fire at a Rhode Island nightclub killed 100 people and injured more than 200.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1069B_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1069B_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span> The fire was the result of a publicity stunt on the part of Daniel Biechele, the tour manager for the heavy metal band Great White. Biechele arranged for fireworks, which he ignited on stage at the club, as part of the performance. The plan went disastrously wrong when the fireworks ignited flammable soundproofing foam, setting off a maelstrom consuming the crowded wooden building. Biechele pleaded guilty to 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter pursuant to a plea agreement that authorized the judge to impose a maximum ten-year prison term. The prosecutor sought that maximum, arguing that Biechele’s failure to obtain a permit for the fireworks was “not simply an unwitting and innocuous oversight, but a deliberate and intentional decision not to abide by Rhode Island law. . . . A child could have foreseen the harm” of setting off fireworks in the club jammed with people. He added, “If this isn’t the case that deserves a serious sentence, what one is?” The judge, however, sentenced Biechele to serve four years in prison, leaving him eligible for parole release after serving one-third of his sentence. The judge pointed to the defendant’s clean record, remorse, willingness to accept responsibility, and potential for rehabilitation. He further emphasized that the defendant never intended to harm anyone.</p>
<p id="76787609-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The sentence provoked outrage among relatives of some of the victims. One called the sentence “a joke” and said of Biechele’s mother, “She’ll get her son in four years, and they’ll go back to being a happy family. What do we have?” Another parent, whose son was killed and daughter injured, said: “One year for every 25 people that died—it’s crazy. You can do what you want in Rhode Island and get away with it.” But other victims’ relatives disagreed. A mother who lost her son said: “I think it’s a fair and just reaction. He didn’t set out to kill anybody. It was a horrendous accident.” The father of an 18-year-old killed in the fire testified that his son would have wanted the family to accept Biechele’s apology. Other relatives placed more blame on the club’s owners, who had installed the highly flammable soundproofing. They were later convicted, and one of them received the same sentence as Biechele. Some relatives also blamed the fire on building inspectors for failing to issue citations for the soundproofing material.</p>

<i>PROBLEM: VICTIM-IMPACT STATEMENTS</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76789d1d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In state and federal sentencing proceedings, it has become common for the court to consider statements from victims and family members describing the damaging consequences of the crime. See Victoria Schwartz, The Victims’ Rights Amendment, 42 Harv. J. on Legis. 525 (2005); Symposium on Crime Victim Law, Theory and Practice, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 481-668 (2005). Such statements typically detail the grief of victims and their families, physical illnesses that may have ensued, financial and emotional consequences, and the like. Sometimes such statements also recommend what the victim or family members regard as suitable punishment. The rationale for considering such statements is by no means clear. Which theory of punishment justifies the use of these statements? Consider People v. Levitt, 156 Cal. App. 3d 500, 516 (1984):</p>

Such bereavement is relevant to damages in a civil action, but it has no relationship to the proper purposes of sentencing in a criminal case.</p>

<i>(b) Foreseeability.</i> What is the “moral relevance” of the fact that a foreseeable consequence did or did not come about? Would the murderer in <i>Young</i> be less deserving of punishment if the victim’s aunt had not died of a heart attack? Would the murderer in <i>Griffith</i> be less deserving of punishment if the victim’s father had not given up his job? Another kind of problem arises if a given defendant, either because of age or a mental disability, did not foresee that his actions would cause harm to members of the victim’s family.

<p id="7678c43a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are harms that happen to result considered in sentencing because of a social interest in assessing the defendant’s degree of fault, or are they considered because of a social interest in using punishment to compensate the victim? In the latter case, one could view the victim’s satisfaction as a social benefit, but many would argue that the suffering experienced by the offender should count as a social cost, especially if it involves suffering in excess of that called for by his moral blame. On what basis can we <i>justify</i> the choice to give satisfaction to a victim, at the cost of inflicting extra, arguably <i>undeserved</i> suffering on an offender? For discussion, see Paul G. Cassell, In Defense of Victim Impact Statements, 6 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 611 (2009).</p>

But note that the effort to reinforce social cohesion suggests an independent justification for punishment; it is not necessarily linked to the concept of revenge and might even be antithetical to it. In assessing the social-cohesion theories, consider whether they tend to reinforce or undermine the argument for tying punishment to desires for victim satisfaction, retaliation, or revenge.</p>

But this form of theory has also at least two different forms: in one of them the public expression of condemnation of the offender by punishment of his offence may be conceived as something valuable in itself; in the other it is valuable only because it tends to certain valuable results, such as the voluntary reform of the offender, his recognition of his moral error, or the maintenance, reinforcement or “vindication” of the morality of the society against which the person punished has offended.

It is a sign indicating that the sentiments of the collectivity are still unchanged, that the communion of minds sharing the same beliefs remains absolute, and in this way the injury that the crime has inflicted upon society is made good. This is why it is right to maintain that the criminal should suffer in proportion to his crime, and why theories that deny to punishment any expiatory character appear, in the minds of many, to subvert the social order. In fact such theories could only be put into practice in a society from which almost every trace of the common consciousness has been expunged. . . . Thus, without being paradoxical, we may state that punishment is above all intended to have its effect upon honest people. . . . Undoubtedly, by forestalling in minds already distressed any further weakening of the collective psyche, punishment can indeed prevent such attacks from multiplying. But such a result, useful though it is, is merely a particular side-effect. In short, . . . the two opposing theories [of retribution and prevention] must be reconciled: . . . Certainly [punishment] does fulfil the function of protecting society, but this is because of its expiatory [i.e., retributive] nature. Moreover, if it must be expiatory, this is not because suffering redeems error by virtue of some mystic strength or another, but because it cannot produce its socially useful effect save on this one condition.</p></div>

Some scholars treat the expressive dimension as a <span title="113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-113">p. 113</span>means to achieve socially desirable effects, such as enhanced compliance with the law. Other work in this vein bears a close affinity to classic retributivism because its proponents view the expressive dimension of punishment as worthwhile for its own sake. See especially Dan Markel, What Might Retributive Justice Be?, in Retributivism: Essays on Theory and Policy 49 (Mark D. White ed., 2011), arguing that retributive punishment is intrinsically good because it affirms the dignity of the victim and communicates respect for the offender as a responsible moral agent. See also Jean Hampton, Correcting Harms Versus Righting Wrongs: The Goal of Retribution, 39 UCLA L. Rev. 1659 (1992), explaining that in an “expressive” theory of retribution, punishment serves to repudiate the offender’s claim of superiority over the victim. Compare Heidi M. Hurd, Expressing Doubts About Expressivism, 2005 U. Chi. Legal F. 405. Professor Hurd argues that neither crimes nor punishments have coherent “social meanings,” and she questions why an attempt to communicate such meanings should be viewed as intrinsically good, regardless of its consequences.</p>

<p id="76791274-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No single approach to the justification of punishment has been able to win widespread (much less universal) support. Consider just a few of the principal problems: Pure utilitarianism arguably could, under some circumstances, require extremely severe punishments that would be disproportionate to a defendant’s blameworthiness, merely because those punishments produce some other beneficial consequence for society. Alternatively, pure utilitarianism arguably could sometimes require a punishment that is too lenient in the eyes of society, say because an offender intentionally committed a horrible act but—because of some change in circumstances—is no longer likely to offend again. Likewise, pure retributivism arguably could, under some circumstances, call for punishments that do much more harm than good—for example, requiring incarceration of an offender whose small children will be forced into foster care as a result. Pure retributivism could also, under some circumstances, call for a punishment that reflects a just desert for a particular defendant but fails adequately to deter future criminal conduct.</p>
<p id="76791275-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-114">p. 114</span>One solution to this dilemma would be to permit sentencing authorities to decide, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, which theory to follow, according to whatever outcome the circumstances seem to warrant. But this approach leaves so much room for choice among punishments that many commentators feel it is less a theory than the complete absence of one. (Despite its conceptual shortcomings, this tends to be the practice in most jurisdictions, which authorize their sentencing policy makers to consider all the purposes of punishment, prioritizing them in whatever way the decision maker prefers at a given time.) Apart from its conceptual messiness, however, what are the practical drawbacks of that approach?</p>
<p id="76791276-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different and more rigorous solution, prominently proposed by H.L.A. Hart, stresses the need to distinguish between the <i>aim</i> of punishment, and the <i>limits</i> on its permissible use. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility 8-12 (1968). Hart argued that the aim of punishment is utilitarian—to enhance social welfare, especially by preventing crime. But we can justly pursue this aim only within retributive limits—by never punishing an innocent person and never punishing a guilty person to an extent disproportionate to his blame. Thus, utilitarian and retributive principles both play a role, but we do not simply “mix and match” them at will. Social benefit is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of just punishment, and likewise, desert is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of just punishment. As Professor Stephen P. Garvey explains (Lifting the Veil on Punishment, 7 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 443, 450 (2004)): “Punishment’s purpose is utilitarian: to reduce crime and thus protect the rights of all to be secure in their persons and property. But that purpose must be pursued within retribution’s [just deserts] limits. [Thus,] a person can legitimately be punished only if he committed a crime, only in proportion to that crime, and only if doing so would produce a world with less crime.” This approach bars disproportionate punishment, even if a cost-benefit calculus would arguably support it. But this approach also bars punishment that is perfectly proportionate to an offender’s blame, if that punishment would not be socially beneficial under all the circumstances.</p>
<p id="76791277-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does Hart’s approach, which can be called the <i>classic mixed theory</i>, finally produce a satisfactory framework? Or does it too yield unacceptable results? This “classic” mixed theory has strong support in criminal law commentary, as well as in American statutes and precedents; it is, for example, the foundation for the Supreme Court’s death penalty jurisprudence.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10813_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10813_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span> Nonetheless, important misgivings have been expressed.

</p><p id="76791282-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The thought experiment such a case begins to pose for us is as follows: Imagine . . . that after the rape but before sentencing the defendant has gotten into an accident so that his sexual desires are dampened to such an extent that he presents no further danger of rape; if money is also one of his problems, suppose further that he has inherited a great deal of money, so that he no longer needs to rob. Suppose, because of both of these facts, we are reasonably certain that he does not present a danger of either forcible assault, rape, robbery, or related crimes in the future. Since Chaney is (by hypothesis) not dangerous, he does not need to be incapacitated, specially deterred, or reformed. Suppose further that we could successfully pretend to punish Chaney, instead of actually punishing him, and that no one is at all likely to find out. Our pretending to punish him will thus serve the needs of general deterrence and maintain social cohesion, and the cost to the state will be less than if it actually did punish him. Is there anything in the mixed theory of punishment that would urge that Chaney nonetheless should really be punished? I think not, so that if one’s conclusion is that Chaney and people like him nonetheless should be punished, one will have to give up the mixed theory of punishment.</p></div>

<i>1.</i> Do you share Professor Moore’s intuition that in the hypothetical circumstances “Chaney . . . should be punished”? If so, is that because you agree <span title="116" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-116">p. 116</span>that deserved punishment <i>must</i> be imposed even if there are no societal benefits? Does something specific to the crimes at issue here demand that punishment be imposed? Or do you agree on the need to punish only because you resist the hypothetical’s assumption that we can <i>pretend</i> to punish him, without having the pretense discovered?</p>
<p id="76793996-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2.</i> In response to discomfort with the classic mixed theory, some recent scholarship has sought to combine the rationales for punishment in more flexible ways, so that desert alone will <i>sometimes</i> be sufficient to justify the imposition of punishment. See, e.g., Michael T. Cahill, Punishment Pluralism, in Retributivism: Essays on Theory and Policy (Mark D. White ed., 2011); Mitchell N. Berman, Punishment and Justification, 118 Ethics 258 (2008). Is the relative indeterminacy of such approaches an important drawback? Or is that flexibility a strength for a theory designed to guide social practices in a society that is itself far from uniform in its values? Although the “classic” mixed approach holds a strong position in criminal law theory and in the law itself, criminal law doctrine and practice often tend to be eclectic or (in Professor Cahill’s term) “pluralistic.” The next section considers the manner in which judges and legislatures actually resolve (or fail to resolve) these issues.</p>

<i>1. The effect of</i> variations <i>in punishment.</i> Recall that for Bentham (p. 98 supra), the point of criminal punishment was to deter offenses by threatening to inflict painful consequences on those who commit them: “If the apparent magnitude, or rather value of that pain be greater than the apparent magnitude or value of the pleasure or good he expects to be the consequence of the act, he will be absolutely prevented from performing it.” Like Bentham, modern scholars who favor the economic approach to law posit that potential criminals consciously or subconsciously calculate costs and benefits, even in the context of “crimes of passion.” But others argue that for the most important kinds of criminal behavior, perpetrators do not calculate at all or calculate only in bizarre ways, ignoring ordinary sorts of benefits and costs (including punishment).</p>
<p id="767986e1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Few people, if any, doubt, that crime would increase, probably dramatically, if no criminal punishments were ever imposed at all. In that sense, the institution of criminal punishment surely does have a substantial deterrent <span title="119" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-119">p. 119</span>effect. The debate centers around the question whether <i>variations</i> in punishment—for example, increasing its severity, either generally or for particular offenses—will lead to <i>variations</i> in the amount of crime. Many empirical studies appear to show a link between expected punishment and the crime rate,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109B7_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109B7_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span> but it is hard to determine the strength of the relationship or the factors that affect it. Younger people seem particularly impervious to changes in sentence length; a 10 percent increase in sentence length resulted in no changes to their arrest rates. Council of Economic Advisers, Economic Perspectives on Incarceration and the Justice System 37 (Apr. 2016). But methodological problems, such as the unreliability of reported arrest rates, make all such findings fragile or difficult to interpret.</p>
<p id="767986e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, while an increase in punishment might deter future crimes by setting a higher price for criminal behavior and by incapacitating people for a longer period of time, longer sentences could also tend to increase crime, because those who spend more time in prison may be more likely to re-offend when released because they will encounter greater difficulty readjusting to society. A recent White House report noted that, for every additional year of incarceration, there is “an average increase in future offending of 4 to 7 percentage points.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109C3_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109C3_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">26</a></span> Perhaps as a result, studies that have attempted to figure out the relationship between longer sentences and recidivism have failed to find a consistent impact in either direction. The Pew Charitable Trusts Fact Sheet, Prison Time Served and Recidivism, Oct. 8, 2013, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2013/10/08/prison-time-served-and-recidivism" class="epub-externalref">http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2013/10/08/prison-time-served-and-recidivism</a>.</p>
<p id="767986e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But regardless of whether empirical studies confirm particular deterrent effects, isn’t a link between the expected costs of committing a crime and the willingness to commit it virtually inevitable, as a matter of human nature? When an activity becomes more expensive, people typically don’t engage in it as often. Why might that theory not play out that way in the real world of criminal justice? Consider these comments:</p>

<p id="767986ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lawmakers have sought to optimize the control of crime by . . . assign[ing] criminal punishments of a magnitude sufficient to deter a thinking individual from committing a crime. Although this seems initially an intuitively compelling strategy, we suggest it is a poor one. . . . If a criminal law rule is to deter violators, three prerequisites must be satisfied: The potential offender must know of the rule; he must perceive the cost of violation as greater than the perceived benefit; and he must be able and willing to bring such knowledge to bear on his conduct decision at the time of the offense. But . . . one or more of these hurdles typically block any material deterrent effect of doctrinal manipulation. The social science literature suggests that potential offenders commonly do not know the law, do not perceive an expected cost for a violation that outweighs the expected gain, and do not make rational self-interest choices.</p>
<p id="767986ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. What about actors who are rational and well informed?</i> Note that many crimes are committed by individuals who can and surely do (at least implicitly) calculate the potential costs and benefits of violating the law. Tax evasion, insider trading, and some sophisticated drug distribution schemes often fit that description. But many analysts suggest that even in such cases, increased punishment can sometimes induce more crime than it deters. How could this happen? One complication is the “income” effect. Severe punishments are intended to induce rational actors to shift from illegal to legal pursuits. But if severe punishment of drug dealers raises an addict’s cost of buying the drugs he requires, he may have to commit more predatory crimes (robbery and burglary) in order to finance his habit.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A13_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A13_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">27</a></span> Another complication, confirmed by many studies, is that very severe penalties can reduce the likelihood that significant sanctions will be imposed at all—witnesses become less willing to report crime or to cooperate in prosecution, prosecutors become reluctant to file the highest charges, and juries hesitate to convict. Thus, in practice, attempts to increase the severity of punishment sometimes have the opposite of their intended effect. For detailed exploration of these and related problems, see Neal Kumar Katyal, Deterrence’s Difficulty, 95 Mich. L. Rev. 2385 (1997).</p>
<p id="7679ae00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Certainty versus severity.</i> The two plausible ways to increase the direct deterrent effect of punishment are, first, to increase the risk of conviction, and second, to increase the severity of punishment. The first alternative appears to be the more effective. A 2016 report by the President’s Council of Economic Advisers found that a $10 billion increase in spending on incarceration would reduce crime between 1 and 4 percent, whereas spending that same amount instead on hiring new police officers would decrease crime between 5 and 16 <span title="121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-121">p. 121</span>percent—roughly four times as much.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A24_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A24_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">28</a></span> It is important to note, however, that increased enforcement does not by itself increase general deterrence. Since the effectiveness of the threat of punishment must be judged from the viewpoint of the potential criminal, increased enforcement and any resulting increase in the certainty of punishment are important only as they contribute to the <i>appearance</i> of certainty.</p>
<p id="7679ae02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But even with its limitations, improving the certainty of punishment is a better strategy for deterrence than increasing the severity of punishment. A panel of the National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1993 that a 10 percent increase in the probability of apprehension would prevent twice as much violent crime as the same increase in the severity of punishment, partly because, as just noted, increases in severity can tend to reduce the probabilities of apprehension and conviction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A33_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A33_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">29</a></span>

<i>4. Moral influence.</i> Can the law’s threat of punishment induce conformity in ways other than through cost-benefit calculations of the rational actor? Consider these observations (Paul H. Robinson &amp; John M. Darley, The Utility of Desert, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 453, 468 (1997)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7679ae05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More than because of the threat of legal punishment, people obey the law (1) because they fear the disapproval of their social group if they violate the law, and (2) because they generally see themselves as moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it. In social science, these two factors are referred to as (1) compliance produced by normative social influence, and (2) behavior produced by internalized moral standards and rules. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae06-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence reviewed suggests that the influences of social group sanctions and internalized norms are the most powerful determinants of conduct, more significant than the threat of deterrent legal sanctions. But, we argue, the law is not irrelevant to the operation of these powerful forces. Criminal law . . . influences the powerful social forces of normative behavior control through its central role in the creation of shared norms. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae07-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The passage and subsequent failure of National Prohibition shows the law’s limited ability to change norms even when the change is supported by a significant portion of the public. . . . The law is, rather, a vehicle by which the community debates, tests, and ultimately settles upon and expresses its norms. . . . The act of criminalization sometimes nurtures the norm, as does faithful enforcement and prosecution, and over time the community view may mature into a strong consensus. . . . We have seen the process at work recently in enhancing prohibitory norms against sexual harassment, hate speech, drunk driving, and domestic violence. It has also been at work in diluting existing norms against homosexual conduct, fornication, and adultery. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae08-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps more than any other society, ours relies on the criminal law for norm-nurturing. Our greater cultural diversity means that we cannot expect a <span title="122" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-122">p. 122</span>stable pre-existing consensus on the contours of condemnable conduct that is found in more homogeneous societies. . . . [W]e share no religion or other arbiter of morality that might perform this role. Our criminal law is, for us, the place we express our shared beliefs of what is truly condemnable. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae09-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal law also has a second effect. . . . If it has developed a reputation as a reliable statement of existing norms, people will be willing to defer to its moral authority in cases where there exists some ambiguity as to the wrongfulness of the contemplated conduct. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is evidence, largely collected and analyzed by Tyler, that people are inclined to accept the law as a source of moral authority that they themselves should take seriously. [Tom R. Tyler, Why People Obey the Law 60 (1990).] . . . Tyler reviews a number of studies that suggest that the level of commitment to obey the law is proportional to what Tyler calls the law’s perceived “legitimacy.” . . . [I]f one regards the law as a legitimate source of rules, if it has what we have called “moral credibility,” then one should be more likely to regard the law’s judgments about right and wrong actions as an appropriate input to one’s own moral thinking; in turn, one should be more likely to obey the law. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the criminal law can only hope to shape moral thinking or to have people follow its rules in ambiguous cases if it has earned a reputation as an institution whose focus is morally condemnable conduct. . . . The criminal law’s power in nurturing and communicating societal norms and its power to have people defer to it . . . is directly proportional to criminal law’s moral credibility. If criminalization or conviction (or decriminalization or refusal to convict) is to have an effect in the norm-nurturing process, it will be because the criminal law has a reputation for criminalizing and punishing only that which deserves moral condemnation, and for decriminalizing and not punishing that which does not. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Enhancing the criminal law’s moral credibility requires, more than anything, that the criminal law make clear to the public that its overriding concern is doing justice. . . . The criminal law must earn a reputation for (1) punishing those who deserve it under rules perceived as just, (2) protecting from punishment those who do not deserve it, and (3) where punishment is deserved, imposing the amount of punishment deserved, no more, no less. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7679ae0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The point is that every deviation from [desert] can incrementally undercut the criminal law’s moral credibility, which in turn can undercut . . . its power to gain compliance by its moral authority. Thus, contrary to the apparent assumptions of past utilitarian debates, such deviations from desert are not cost free, and their cost must be included in the calculation when determining which distribution of liability will most effectively reduce crime.</p>

</div><p id="7679d523-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The debate between proponents of retributive justice and rehabilitation has roots dating back at least to the colonial period. In Puritan America, the law was used to advance the dominant religious beliefs and to enforce “proper <span title="123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-123">p. 123</span>standards of moral behavior.” Based on the Calvinist belief in the innate depravity of human beings, the criminal law served to keep people from temptation. Punishment was not intended to save the criminal[,] because humans were inherently sinful. . . . Punishment served to keep the rest of the community from temptation. . . . 
</p><p id="7679d524-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Quaker views contrasted sharply with the Puritan conception of the criminal law. Early in our history, the Quakers led a movement away from capital and corporal punishment to a system of workhouses and prisons. Viewed as grim in retrospect, that system was generally enlightened by comparison to earlier treatment of criminals. At root, it was based on an optimism about human capacity for transformation.</p><p id="7679d525-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Quakers believed that crime was the product of society, rather than a result of inherent sinfulness. But the method chosen for transformation was not “treatment.” Instead, they believed that the offender could be reformed through a process of rationality. Freed from the corrupting influences and permitted to reflect on moral questions, the offender could be “restored to fellowship with God and humanity.”</p><p id="7679d526-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Around the time of the American Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution, Quaker idealism was a powerful force in penology. It led to the establishment of penitentiaries, first in Pennsylvania where Quaker influence was strongest. Modeled on monastic prisons of the Middle Ages, the penitentiary used solitary confinement, religious instruction, and hard labor to facilitate repentance.</p><p id="7679d527-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Early prison reformers also stressed the community’s responsibility for corrupting the individual. For example, one Boston clergyman inquired, “‘How can it be justice to punish as a crime that which the institutions of society render unavoidable?’” Recognition that social conditions were a cause of crime did not render society incapable of punishing the offender, but it created a moral imperative to offer the offender a chance at moral transformation. Nor was the prescription mollycoddling; devices that look unabashedly punitive, like hard labor, were believed to have the beneficial effect of aiding the transformation of the offender.</p></div>

</div><p id="7679d52b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rehabilitation is perhaps the most complex of the theories of punishment, because it involves two quite different ideals of rehabilitation that are usually confused. . . . 
</p><p id="7679d52c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first sort of rehabilitative ideal is one that is achieved when we make criminals safe to return to the streets. This sort of rehabilitative theory justifies punishment, not by appeal to how much better off criminals will be at the end of the process, but rather by how much better off all of us will be if “treatment” is completed because the streets will be that much safer. The second sort of rehabilitative ideal . . . seeks to rehabilitate offenders not just so they can be returned safely to the streets, but so they can lead flourishing and successful lives. Such a theory justifies punishment, not in the name of all of us, but rather in the offenders’ own name; since it does so in their name, but contrary to their own expressed wishes (few <span title="124" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-124">p. 124</span>offenders want to be punished), this kind of rehabilitative theory is paternalistic in character.</p><p id="7679d52d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This paternalistic type of rehabilitative theory has no proper part to play in any theory of punishment, even in the minimal sense of constituting a prima facie justification of punishment. There are three reasons why this is so. First, such a paternalistic reform theory allocates scarce societal resources away from other, more deserving groups that want them [such as individuals with mental disabilities or the poor]. . . . Second, in any political theory according high value to liberty, paternalistic justifications are themselves to be regarded with suspicion. Criminals are not in the standard classes in society for which paternalistic state intervention is appropriate, such as [those] whose capacity for rational choice is diminished. . . . Third, such recasting of punishment in terms of “treatment” for the good of the criminal makes possible a kind of moral blindness that is dangerous in itself. As C.S. Lewis pointed out some years ago, adopting a “humanitarian” conceptualization of punishment makes it easy to inflict treatments and sentences that need bear no relation to the desert of the offender. We may do more to others “for their own good” than we ever allow ourselves to do when we see that it is really for our good that we act.</p></div>

<i>NOTE—THE RISE AND FALL OF THE MEDICAL MODEL</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="7679fc40-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the early twentieth century, rehabilitation had taken a firm hold in the ideology (if not in the practices) of American punishment. The state agency responsible for criminal punishment came to be known as the “Department of Corrections” (a terminology that remains with us to this day). In 1949, the Supreme Court stated: “Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law. Reformation and rehabilitation of offenders have become important goals of criminal jurisprudence.” Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 248 (1949). The prevailing conception of rehabilitation, moreover, was that described by Professor Vitiello—the Quaker conception that reformation could be achieved by religious instruction and hard labor.</p>
<p id="7679fc41-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By the 1960s, this view of rehabilitation came increasingly to be replaced by a “medical” model. As Professor Vitiello notes, id. at 1016, “growing faith in psychiatry and science had strongly influenced penology. Based on a perception of the criminal as sick and in need of treatment or rehabilitation, legislatures entrusted to judges wide latitude in imposing indeterminate sentences: if the offender is ill . . . , his sentence ought to be conditioned on his cure. Parole boards . . . helped to administer indeterminate sentences by determining when the ‘patient’ was cured.”</p>
<p id="7679fc42-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within a decade, however, the medical model came under attack from multiple directions. Many (especially critics on the left) saw it as paternalistic and coercive, as well as dangerously discretionary and biased against low-income, minority defendants. There was also considerable evidence that, far from benefiting the offender, it often led to longer penal confinement. At the same time, other observers (especially critics on the right) saw the <span title="125" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-125">p. 125</span>rehabilitative approach as too costly and too lenient. A crucial point for both groups was the perception that efforts to rehabilitate offenders simply were not (and perhaps could not be) successful. By the late 1970s, rehabilitation had fallen almost entirely out of favor; when Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984, it specifically noted that “imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.” 18 U.S.C. §3582(a). Thus, federal judges may not “impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.” Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 334 (2011). Similarly, a federal court of appeals rejected a judge’s decision, at the urging of a probation officer, to revoke a term of supervised release so that the defendant would be sent back to prison in order to receive alcohol abuse and anger management treatment. United States v. Deen, 706 F.3d 760 (6th Cir. 2013).</p>
<p id="7679fc43-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although there remains skepticism about value of providing rehabilitation services in prisons, see p. 126 infra, there has been a substantial resurgence of interest in rehabilitation in other contexts, especially in so-called problem-solving courts that divert individuals from incarceration into programming, with the judge playing a strong oversight role. While some applaud the creation of these approaches as improvements over imprisonment, others raise many of the same objections to rehabilitation in this context as well. For overviews, see Erin R. Collins, Status Courts, 105 Geo. L.J. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> (forthcoming 2017); Allegra M. McLeod, Decarceration Courts: Possibilities and Perils of a Shifting Criminal Law, 100 Geo. L.J. 1587 (2012). And the question remains today, as it always has, whether rehabilitation can be effective.</p>

<p id="7679fc46-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The actual effects of rehabilitation efforts have been questioned. In an important 1974 paper (Robert Martinson, What Works?—Questions and Answers About Prison Reform, 36 Pub. Int. 22, 25 (1974)), the author concluded: “With few and isolated exceptions, the rehabilitative efforts that have been reported so far have no appreciable effect on recidivism.” Martinson soon withdrew that conclusion, having found evidence that some programs do reduce recidivism for some offenders under some circumstances.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B35_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B35_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">30</a></span> Subsequent research provided further support for this cautiously optimistic view.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B3D_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B3D_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">31</a></span> Nonetheless, the conclusion that “nothing works” had become fixed in the public mind, and it has proved difficult to dislodge.

<p id="767a2359-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Martinson—quite unintentionally—found a remarkably receptive audience from both sides of the political spectrum in the U.S.A. On the right, the period <span title="126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-126">p. 126</span>from the second half of the sixties into the seventies was seen as a time of serious disorder and instability; Vietnam, black power and youth protest were seen to threaten the traditional order. And out of all this “crime . . . became a codeword for all that was wrong with American society.” The right, therefore, welcomed Martinson’s attack on the rehabilitative ideal which was seen as being soft on offenders and looked forward to new, tougher methods of punishing criminals. The perspective from the left was, of course, rather different. Here, the benevolence of the state was subject to sustained questioning, a process which inevitably touched upon criminal justice. Rehabilitation and treatment . . . were criticised as theoretically faulty, discriminatory and unjust, and the unfettered discretion entrusted to criminal justice professionals was attacked as leading to abuse of power and injustice. . . .

<p id="767a235a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Martinson’s argument is fundamentally flawed in two ways: first, by reliance upon recidivism as the sole measure of success of a sentence; and second, by a failure to address the issue of how sentences are implemented . . . in practice. . . . If, for example, a considerable number of the [treatment programs] included in Martinson’s analysis . . . had been starved of resources, had used badly trained and uncommitted staff, and had been studied in the first year or so of operation, would it be any surprise that the sentences had failed?

If the question is how to prevent at-risk youths from becoming stone-cold predators in the first place, then, of course, incarceration is no solution. But if the question is how to restrain known convicted criminals from murdering, raping, robbing, assaulting and stealing, then incarceration is a solution, and a highly cost-effective one. On average, it costs about $25,000 a year to keep a convicted criminal in prison. For that money, society gets four benefits: Imprisonment punishes offenders and expresses society’s moral disapproval. It teaches felons and would-be felons a lesson: Do crime, do time. Prisoners get drug treatment and education. And, as the columnist Ben Wattenberg has noted, “A thug in prison can’t shoot your sister.”</p><p id="767a7190-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

Langan calculated that tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 may have reduced “violent crime by 10 to 15 percent below what it would have been,” thereby preventing a “conservatively estimated 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in 1989 alone.” . . . [T]he violent crimes committed each year will cost victims and society more than $400 billion in medical bills, lost days from work, lost quality of life—and lost life. . . . All told, research shows it costs society at least twice as much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.

<i>1. Estimating the benefits.</i> DiIulio and others argue that “it costs society at least twice as much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.” But critics contend that these claims rest on greatly exaggerated estimates of the number of crimes that can be averted by incarcerating offenders for longer terms. Note DiIulio’s claim that “prisoners in New Jersey and Wisconsin committed an <i>average</i> of 12 crimes a year when free” (emphasis added). Does this mean that extending an offender’s sentence for an additional year will avert 12 crimes? Consider John J. Donohue III &amp; Peter Seligman, Allocating Resources Among Prisons and Social Programs in the Battle Against Crime, 27 J. Legal Stud. 1, 10-12 (1998):</p>

<p id="767a7195-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A common error among researchers [is] the failure to distinguish between the average number of crimes committed by the total <i>stock</i> of prisoners and the mean criminality of the group of prisoners who are poised to leave prison. . . . If there is a positive correlation between sentence length and prior record, as seems likely, then the cohort of released prisoners will tend to have lower than average [rates of offending]. Thus, the crimes prevented by keeping the current group of released prisoners incarcerated for an additional year will tend to be less than the average number of crimes committed by all prisoners—and probably dramatically so.</p>
<p id="767a7196-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Studies like DiIulio’s] assume that incarcerating a prisoner for an additional year will reduce crime by the number of crimes that the prisoner committed in the year prior to his incarceration. This may be plausible for some crimes but is certainly not true for others. Many crimes are committed by criminal rings or gangs; under these circumstances, the loss of one gang member will probably just lead to the recruitment of another.</p>
<p id="767a7197-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[M]ost criminals do not commit offenses uniformly over their entire adult lifetimes. Instead, criminal behavior is disproportionately concentrated over a much shorter period, typically in the late teens and early twenties. This fact has obvious implications for the efficacy of imprisonment as a means of controlling crime. Consider a 20-year-old who committed 40 crimes in the year prior to receiving a 10-year sentence. Simply multiplying 40 crimes/year by 10 years suggests that imprisoning this person would forestall 400 crimes over the next 10 years. But if the prisoner’s criminal career would in any case have ended at age 25, the true crime reduction is only 200, and 5 years of the 10-year sentence produce no incapacitative benefit.</p>

<i>3. Empirical problems of prediction.</i> Even if ethical objections to selective incapacitation are set aside, a major difficulty lies in the inaccuracy of the judgments on which it rests. Predictions of future criminality based on intuitive clinical assessments typically have “false-positive” rates of more than 60 percent; in other words, of every three individuals predicted to offend in the future, approximately two do not. As a result, when offenders are held for longer periods on the basis of such predictions, two-thirds of the individuals suffer unnecessary curtailment of their liberty, and of course society incurs costs of incarceration that can easily exceed the costs of the crimes prevented. An alternative approach is based on risk-assessment instruments that rely on objective risk indicators such as age, gender, mental disorder, substance abuse, and prior criminal record. These “actuarial” prediction methods have achieved much greater success, at least for smaller groups and certain types of offenders, such as the mentally ill. In some instances, such tools have had <span title="131" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-131">p. 131</span>accuracy rates of over 50 percent and occasionally up to 75 percent. See Christopher Slobogin, The Civilization of the Criminal Law, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 121, 145 (2005). Nonetheless, false-positive rates remain well above 50 percent for larger groups and for more typical offenders convicted of offenses like robbery, burglary, and theft. See John Monahan, A Jurisprudence of Risk Assessment: Forecasting Harm Among Prisoners, Predators, and Patients, 92 Va. L. Rev. 391, 408-413 (2006). For a broad critique of the use of risk instruments in sentencing, see Sonja B. Starr, Evidence-Based Sentencing and the Scientific Rationalization of Discrimination, 66 Stan. L. Rev. 803, 806 (2014) (arguing against risk instruments on constitutional, methodological, and policy grounds because they use “demographic, socioeconomic, family, and neighborhood variables to determine whether and for how long a defendant is incarcerated”).</p>

During the same period, crime rates fell dramatically; in cities of more than 1 million inhabitants, for example, the homicide rate fell by 55 percent from 1991 to 1998.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C8E_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C8E_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">33</a></span> Many attribute these crime-control successes to the incapacitation effect of the prison population boom, but many states with much smaller increases in prison population nonetheless experienced significant crime-control successes as well. As a result, many competing explanations have been offered for the drop in crime during the 1990s, including demographic trends, community policing innovations, the waning of the crack epidemic, the decreasing use of lead in paint and gasoline, and even the possibility that legalized abortion may have reduced the number of “unwanted” children who began reaching their crime-prone teen years during this period.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C96_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C96_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">34</a></span> Efforts to sort out the impact of these diverse factors are necessarily speculative and imprecise; studies range from crediting incarceration as being 58 percent responsible for the 1990s crime decline to <i>blaming</i> incarceration because it may have caused violent crime to decline 3 percent <i>less</i> than it otherwise would have.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CA4_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CA4_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">35</a></span>

<i>5. Cost-effective alternatives?</i> Three years after declaring that “prisons are a bargain,” Professor DiIulio qualified his position. In a 1999 article, he insisted that increasing the incarceration rate was a justified policy in 1996 (when there were 1.6 million prisoners nationwide),<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CB7_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CB7_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">36</a></span> but with the U.S. prison and jail population then near the 2 million mark (it is now well over that figure), he argued that “the nation has ‘maxed out’ on the public-safety value of <span title="132" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-132">p. 132</span>incarceration” and “[t]he justice system is becoming less capable of distributing sanctions and supervision rationally, especially where drug offenders are concerned.” Accordingly, DiIulio maintained, “[i]t’s time for policy makers to change focus, aiming for zero prison growth,” and devoting more resources to drug treatment and effective supervision of offenders on probation and parole. Signaling that his changed assessment was the result of more than just a shift in the cost-benefit calculus, DiIulio concluded, “In the end, whether or not we achieve this goal [of zero prison growth] will be a profound measure not merely of how nimble we are when it comes to managing public safety cost-effectively, but also of how decent we are, despite our many differences, when it came to loving all God’s children unconditionally.”

<p id="767abfcf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until the 1970s, the punishment decision was entrusted almost entirely to the discretion of the trial judge. Statutory limits on sentences, the prosecutor’s charging power, and the releasing authority of the parole board qualified the trial judge’s power, but the individual judge formally controlled the penalty. That situation still prevails in the majority of the states, but many have moved to limit the trial judge’s power (1) by mandating specified punishments (particularly mandatory <i>minimum</i> sentences), (2) by establishing an administrative agency to promulgate sentencing guidelines that narrow the sentencing range within which judges can sentence, or (3) by providing for appellate review of trial-court sentencing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D01_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D01_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span> Chapter 10, infra, explores these trends in greater detail as well as the broader question of how much discretion the sentencing judge should have. In this section, we examine two distinct and more general questions: (1) How long should a sentence be; and (2) What kinds of punishments are acceptable, regardless of who the decision maker may be?</p>

 . . . [T]he hearing made clear that Mr. Madoff is refusing to help the government build a case against anyone else. . . . The 11 counts of fraud, money laundering, perjury and theft to which Mr. Madoff, 70, pleaded guilty carry maximum terms totaling 150 years. . . .

The fraud’s collapse erased as much as $65 billion that his customers thought they had. It remains unclear how much victims will recover. A court-appointed trustee liquidating Mr. Madoff’s business has so far been able to identify only about $1 billion in assets to satisfy claims.</p></div>

Not only would it not reflect the seriousness and the scope of the defendant’s crimes, but, also, it would not promote the goals of general deterrence going forward.”]</p><p id="767b0e03-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Judge Chin then offered his analysis and sentence:] I take into account what I have read in the presentence report, the parties’ sentencing submissions, and the e-mails and letters from victims.

</p><p id="767b0e04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Objectively speaking, the fraud here was staggering.

Mr. Madoff disputes that the loss amount is $65 billion or even $13 billion. . . . [T]he fraud here is unprecedented. [The sentencing guidelines offense level] is calculated by using a chart for loss amount that only goes up to $400 million. By any of these measures, the loss figure here is many times that amount.

The breach of trust was massive. Investors—individuals, charities, pension funds, institutional clients—were repeatedly lied to, as they were told their moneys would be invested in stocks when they were not. . . . As the victims’ letters and e-mails demonstrate, as the statements today demonstrate, investors made important life decisions based on these fictitious account statements—when to retire, how to care for elderly parents, whether to buy a car or sell a house, how to save for their children’s college tuition. Charitable organizations and pension funds made important decisions based on false information about fictitious accounts. . . .

</p><p id="767b3517-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Madoff argues a number of mitigating factors but they are less than compelling. It is true that he essentially turned himself in and confessed to the FBI. But the fact is that with the turn in the economy, he was not able to keep up with the requests of customers to withdraw their funds, and it is apparent that he knew that he was going to be caught soon. . . . Moreover, the [trustee of the funds recovered] has advised the Court Mr. Madoff has not been helpful, and I simply do not get the sense that Mr. Madoff has done all that he could or told all that he knows. . . .

But not a single letter has been submitted attesting to Mr. Madoff’s good deeds or good character or civic or charitable activities. The absence of such support is telling.</p><p id="767b351a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have heard much about life expectancy analysis. Based on this analysis, Mr. Madoff has a life expectancy of 13 years, and therefore asks for a sentence of 12 years or alternatively 15 to 20 years. If [this] life expectancy analysis is correct, any sentence above 20 or 25 years would be largely, if not entirely, symbolic.</p><p id="767b351b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the symbolism is important, for at least three reasons. First, retribution. One of the traditional notions of punishment is that an offender should be punished in proportion to his blameworthiness. Here, the message must be sent that Mr. Madoff’s crimes were extraordinarily evil, and that this kind of irresponsible manipulation of the system is not merely a bloodless financial crime that takes place just on paper, but that is instead, as we have heard, one that takes a staggering human toil. The symbolism is important because the message must be sent that in a society governed by the rule of law, Mr. Madoff will get what he deserves, and that he will be punished according to his moral culpability.</p><p id="767b351c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, [a]nother important goal of punishment is deterrence, and the symbolism is important here because the strongest possible message must be sent to those would engage in similar conduct that they will be caught and that they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.</p><p id="767b351d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, symbolism is also important for the victims. . . . Mr. Madoff’s very personal betrayal struck at the rich and the not-so-rich, the elderly living on retirement funds and social security, middle class folks trying to put their kids through college, and ordinary people who worked hard to save their money and who thought they were investing it safely, for themselves and their families.</p><p id="767b351e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="136" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-136">p. 136</span>I received letters, and we have heard from, for example, a retired forest worker, a corrections officer, an auto mechanic, a physical therapist, a retired New York City school secretary, who is now 66 years old and widowed, who must deal with the loss of her retirement funds. . . . 
</p><p id="767b351f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I was particularly struck by one story that I read in the letters. A man invested his family’s life savings with Mr. Madoff. Tragically, he died of a heart attack just two weeks later. The widow eventually went in to see Mr. Madoff. He put his arm around her, as she describes it, and in a kindly manner told her not to worry, the money is safe with me. And so not only did the widow leave the money with him, she eventually deposited more funds with him, her 401(k), her pension funds. Now, all the money is gone. She will have to sell her home, and she will not be able to keep her promise to help her granddaughter pay for college.</p><p id="767b3520-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A substantial sentence will not give the victims back . . . their financial security or the freedom from financial worry. But more is at stake than money. . . . The victims put their trust in Mr. Madoff. That trust was broken in a way that has left many—victims as well as others—doubting our financial institutions, our financial system, our government’s ability to regulate and protect, and sadly, even themselves. . . . A substantial sentence, the knowledge that Mr. Madoff has been punished to the fullest extent of the law, may, in some small measure, help these victims in their healing process.</p><p id="767b3521-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Madoff, please stand.

<i>1. Reflections of Judge Denny Chin.</i> In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i> given two years after the sentence, Judge Chin explained that one of the “struggles” in sentencing Bernard Madoff was whether to give him any hope of being released in his lifetime. “In the end, I just thought that he didn’t deserve it,” he said. “The benefits of giving him hope were far outweighed by all of the other considerations.” Benjamin Weiser, Judge Explains 150-Year Sentence for Madoff, N.Y. Times, June 28, 2011. What were those other considerations? If retribution and symbolism are put aside, is the 150-year sentence justified on utilitarian grounds?</p>
<p id="767b5c36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Reflections of Bernard Madoff.</i> In the same article, Madoff questioned the judge’s sentence: “Explain to me who else has received a sentence like that. . . . I mean, serial killers get a death sentence, but that’s virtually what he gave me.” Is Madoff’s sentence proportionate to the harms caused? Should Judge Chin have contemplated how the sentence compares to sentences for other kinds of crimes, including violent crimes and homicides?</p>

<i>3. Mitigating circumstances.</i> Judge Chin notes that white-collar offenders typically submit letters of support from people who know them, attesting to their good character and charitable contributions. While the <i>presence</i> of these letters may not help a defendant get a lower sentence, Judge Chin suggested that these letters have become so commonplace in white-collar cases as to become necessary to avoid a higher sentence. Their <i>absence</i>, in Judge Chin’s words, “is telling.” If individuals had submitted letters on Madoff’s behalf describing his charitable works or good character, is it likely they would have made a difference in Madoff’s sentence? If the answer is no, given the scope of the fraud, should Judge Chin have mentioned their absence at all?</p>
<p id="767b5c38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Arriving at a number.</i> Judge Chin further explained that “because none of the counts against Mr. Madoff carried a sentence of life imprisonment,” a life sentence was not an option and a term of some years had to be selected. The term of 150 years was arrived at by stacking the maximum sentences of each count. In an article addressing the ten-year sentence of Michael Milken, another infamous white-collar offender, Stanton Wheeler made the following observations about setting the specific term of years (Reflections on the Sentencing of Michael Milken, 3 Fed. Sent’g Rep. 167 (1990)):</p>

<p id="767b5c39-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Surely there is a basis in the common sense wisdom of sitting judges for sanctioning heavily those who occupy special positions of authority and responsibility and who abuse those positions . . . , especially when the crimes are sophisticated and of substantial duration. The argument for stiff sentences in such cases goes both to the gravity of the offense and the importance of sending a deterrent message. Judges feel strongly about violations of trust, and about violations that have the capacity to affect the fabric of financial transactions.</p>
<p id="767b5c3a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, there is little working out of the precise reasoning behind the numbers. Federal judges often talk about the harm caused by an offense, the blameworthiness of the offender, and the consequence the sentence is likely to have, especially the consequence for general deterrence. [B]ut in the end we have little idea of how much of the [sentence] is due to the seriousness of the offense, how much to [the defendant’s] culpability, and how much to the capacity of a long sentence to deter others.

<p id="767b5c3b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Chin picked a number—150 years—that obviously cannot be satisfied in Madoff’s lifetime. What is the purpose of selecting a sentence that extends beyond the defendant’s life expectancy? Would the same sentence have been appropriate if Madoff were 40 years old instead of 71? Should a defendant’s age and life expectancy be part of a court’s calculus? Should a court consider how much it costs to incarcerate a defendant? During a budget crisis in 2013, one district court judge sentenced a defendant who committed a tax offense to probation instead of prison because of his view that the government could not afford the cost of incarcerating the defendant. The <span title="138" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-138">p. 138</span>appellate court reversed because the relevant federal statute did not include the cost of incarceration as a valid sentencing consideration.

<span class="epub-small-caps">EASTERBROOK,</span> J. Thirty minutes after being released from prison, to which he had been sent on conviction of two bank robberies, Dwight Jackson robbed another bank. He was let out as part of a “work release program” and returned to his old line of work. Told to get a job, he decided to do a bank job. A passer-by saw a suspicious person flee the bank and noted the license plate of the car. . . . Jackson was back in prison before the sun set on the day of his release. His principal sentence—life in prison without possibility of parole—came under a statute forbidding possession of weapons by career criminals, 18 U.S.C. App. §1202. . . . 
</p><p id="767b8352-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1202 provided that anyone “who . . . possesses . . . any firearm and who has three previous [felony] convictions for robbery or burglary, or both, . . . shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person . . . , and such person shall not be eligible for parole with respect to the sentence imposed under this subsection.” Jackson, who had been convicted of four armed bank robberies and one armed robbery, brandished his revolver and robbed the Continental Bank of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, on May 30, 1986, while this statute was in force. . . . 
</p><p id="767b8353-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The imposition of life in prison on Jackson was permissible. The selection of a sentence within the statutory range is essentially free of appellate review. Armed bank robbery on the day of release—following earlier armed robbery convictions back to 1973—marked Jackson as a career criminal. Specific deterrence had failed. The court was entitled to consider general deterrence and incapacitation. Although life without possibility of parole is the upper end of the scale of sanctions (short of capital punishment), the statute reflects a judgment that career criminals who persist in possessing weapons should be dealt with most severely. . . . If this sentence is unduly harsh, the holder of the clemency power may supply a remedy. . . . Affirmed.</p><p id="767b8354-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

<span class="epub-small-caps">POSNER</span> J., concurring. I join the opinion and judgment of the court; but I think the sentence Jackson received is too harsh and I think it appropriate to point this out even though he presents no ground on which we are authorized to set aside an excessively severe sentence.</p><p id="767b8355-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jackson is unquestionably a dangerous and hardened criminal. He has been convicted of armed robbery four times (three were bank robberies—all of the same bank!); in each robbery he was carrying a loaded gun. I do not mean to denigrate the gravity of his offenses by pointing out that he has never inflicted a physical injury; but that fact is relevant to deciding whether the sheer enormity of his conduct warrants imprisonment for the rest of his life as a matter of retributive justice. It does not. Few murderers, traitors, or rapists are punished so severely. . . . The grounds for the sentence in this case must be sought elsewhere.</p><p id="767b8356-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One ground, the one articulated by the district judge, is the need to prevent Jackson from committing further crimes. There is little doubt that if he were released tomorrow he would commit a bank robbery, perhaps on the same day. But it is extremely unlikely that if he were released 25 or 30 years from now (he is 35 years old) he would resume his career as a bank robber. We know that criminal careers taper off with age, although with the aging of the population and the improvements in the health of the aged the fraction of crimes committed by the elderly is rising. Crimes that involve a risk of physical injury to the criminal are especially a young man’s game. In 1986 more than 62 percent of all persons arrested for robbery . . . were below the age of 25, and only 3.4 percent were 60 years old or older. . . . Bank robbery in particular, I suspect, is a young man’s crime. A bank robber must be willing to confront armed guards and able to make a quick getaway. To suppose that if Jackson is fortunate enough to live on in prison into his seventies or eighties it would still be necessary to detain him lest he resume his life of crime after almost a lifetime in prison is too speculative to warrant imprisoning him until he dies of old age. . . . 
</p><p id="767b8357-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining possibility is that this savage sentence is proper <i>pour encourager les autres.</i> Indeed, deterrence is the surest ground for punishment, since retributive norms are so unsettled and since incapacitation may, by removing one offender from the pool of offenders, simply make a career in crime more attractive to someone else. . . . Thus, even if one were sure that Jackson would be as harmless as a mouse in the last 10, or 15, or 20 years of his life, his sentence might be justified if the example of it were likely to deter other people, similarly situated, from committing such crimes. This is possible, but speculative; it was not mentioned by the district judge.</p><p id="767b8358-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We should ask how many 35 year olds would rob a bank if they knew that if they were caught it would mean 20 years in prison with no possibility of parole (the sentence I would have given Jackson if I had been the sentencing judge), compared to the number who would do so if it would mean life in prison. Probably very few would be deterred by the incremental sentence. Bank robbery is a crime of acquisition, not of passion; the only gains are financial—and are slight (in 1986 the average “take” from a bank robbery <span title="140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-140">p. 140</span>was $2,664). The net gains, when the expected cost of punishment is figured in, must be very small indeed. Clearance rates for bank robbery are very high; of all bank robberies investigated by the FBI during 1978 and 1979 . . . , 69 percent had been cleared by arrest by 1982. Conviction rates are high (90 percent in federal prosecutions for bank robbery) and average punishments severe (more than 13 years for federal defendants). It’s a losers’ game at best. Persons who would go ahead and rob a bank in the face of my hypothetical 20-year sentence are unlikely to be deterred by tightening the punishment screws still further. A civilized society locks up such people until age makes them harmless but it does not keep them in prison until they die.</p></div>

<i>1. Postscript.</i> In a subsequent proceeding, the sentencing judge denied a motion for reduction of sentence, stating that Judge Richard Posner’s concerns in dissent had not persuaded him to reconsider. The sentencing judge mentioned, among other factors, that Jackson had persisted in denying his guilt; that his prior record, in addition to seven armed robbery convictions, included an attempt to murder his army colonel in Vietnam and an assault on a sergeant; and that the possession of firearms by this “incorrigible and hostile recidivist” created a distinct possibility that severe injury or death could result from any future criminal conduct. See United States v. Jackson, 780 F. Supp. 1508 (N.D. Ill. 1991).</p>
<p id="767baa6c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Criminal history and age.</i> What sentence <i>should</i> be imposed on Jackson? For what purpose? How important should an offender’s criminal history be in determining the sentence? Is Judge Posner right that Jackson’s age should play a significant role in the length of the sentence? If so, why was Madoff’s age not a bigger factor in his sentence? Elderly inmates cost significantly more to imprison because of their increased medical needs. Should judges take the increased prison costs of the elderly into account? For a discussion of the relevance of the age of the offender to sentencing, see Dawn Miller, Sentencing Elderly Criminal Offenders, 7 NAELA J. 221 (2011).</p>
<p id="767baa6d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does Judge Posner’s view suggest that an 18-year-old should receive a longer sentence than an offender who has the same criminal history and commits the same offense, but is 30 years older and thus less likely to commit future crimes? If being older should be a mitigating factor (because of the lower risk of recidivism), does it follow that being younger should be—or inevitably must be—an aggravating factor (because of the higher risk of recidivism? For a discussion of the accuracy of such predictions, see John Monahan, A Jurisprudence of Risk Assessment, 92 Va. L. Rev. 391 (2006).</p>

<i>3. Three strikes and you’re out.</i> Several states have enacted or considered legislation providing that, upon conviction of a felony (or <i>violent</i> felony) after two prior felony convictions, a defendant must be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. What purpose is such a sentence intended to serve—in particular, is such a sentence explained by retribution <span title="141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-141">p. 141</span>or incapacitation? As to the former, are recidivists who have served their sentences for prior crimes <i>more culpable</i> than first-time offenders? For an argument that they <i>deserve</i> greater punishment, see Youngjae Lee, Recidivism as Omission: A Relational Account, 87 Tex. L. Rev. 571 (2009). For a more critical view, arguing that recidivist enhancements fail to serve the purposes of punishment, see Sarah F. Russell, Rethinking Recidivist Enhancements: The Role of Prior Drug Convictions in Federal Sentencing, 43 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1135 (2010). In light of the empirical research discussed at pp. 118-121 supra, do the additional benefits of a life sentence in such cases (compared, for example, to a 15-year or 20-year sentence) justify the additional costs? On what basis? Deterrence? Incapacitation? See Michael Vitiello, Three Strikes: Can We Return to Rationality?, 87 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 395 (1997).</p>
<p id="767baa6f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Punishment is not just about incarceration and terms of years.

<span class="epub-small-caps">O’SCANNLAIN</span>, Circuit Judge: . . . Shawn Gementera pilfered letters from several mailboxes along San Francisco’s Fulton Street on May 21, 2001. . . . After indictment, Gementera entered a plea agreement pursuant to which he pled guilty to mail theft.</p>
<p id="767bd187-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The offense was not Gementera’s first encounter with the law. Though only twenty-four years old at the time, Gementera’s criminal history was lengthy for a man of his relative youth, and it was growing steadily more serious. At age nineteen, he was convicted of misdemeanor criminal mischief. He was twice convicted at age twenty of driving with a suspended license. At age twenty-two, a domestic dispute led to convictions for driving with a suspended license and for failing to provide proof of financial responsibility. By twenty-four, the conviction was misdemeanor battery. Other arrests and citations listed in the Presentence Investigation Report included possession of drug paraphernalia, additional driving offenses (most of which involved driving on a license suspended for his failure to take chemical tests), and, soon after his twenty-fifth birthday, taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent.</p>
<p id="767bd188-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range was two to eight months incarceration; Judge Walker sentenced Gementera to the lower bound of the range, imposing two months incarceration and three years supervised release. He also imposed conditions of supervised release. One such condition required Gementera to “perform 100 hours of community service,” to consist of <span title="142" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-142">p. 142</span>“standing in front of a postal facility in the city and county of San Francisco with a sandwich board which in large letters declares: ‘I stole mail. This is my punishment.’” Gementera later filed a motion to correct the sentence by removing the sandwich board condition. Judge Walker modified the sentence after inviting both parties to present “an alternative form or forms of public service that would better comport with the aims of the court.” In lieu of the 100-hour signboard requirement, the district court imposed a four-part special condition in its stead. Three new terms, proposed jointly by counsel, mandated that the defendant observe postal patrons visiting the “lost or missing mail” window, write letters of apology to any identifiable victims of his crime, and deliver several lectures at a local school. It also included a scaled-down version of the signboard requirement:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767bd189-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant shall perform 1 day of 8 total hours of community service during which time he shall either (i) wear a two-sided sandwich board-style sign or (ii) carry a large two-sided sign stating, “I stole mail; this is my punishment,” in front of a San Francisco postal facility identified by the probation officer. For the safety of defendant and general public, the postal facility designated shall be one that employs one or more security guards. Upon showing by defendant that this condition would likely impose upon defendant psychological harm or effect or result in unwarranted risk of harm to defendant, the public or postal employees, the probation officer may withdraw or modify this condition or apply to the court to withdraw or modify this condition.</p>
</div>
<p id="767bd18a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">We first address Gementera’s argument that the eight-hour sandwich board condition violates the Sentencing Reform Act. See 18 U.S.C. §3583(d). The Sentencing Reform Act affords district courts broad discretion in fashioning appropriate conditions of supervised release, while mandating that such conditions serve legitimate objectives. In addition to [specified conditions] the statute explicitly authorizes the court to impose “<i>any other condition it considers to be appropriate</i>.” Such special conditions, however, [must be] “reasonably related” to “the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.” See 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(1). Moreover, it must be both “reasonably related” to and “involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary” to “afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” “protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,” and “provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.” Accordingly, the three legitimate statutory purposes of deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation frame our analysis. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767bd18b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gementera first urges that the condition was imposed for an impermissible purpose of humiliation. See 18 U.S.C. §3553(a). He points to certain remarks of the district court at the first sentencing hearing. . . . 
</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767bd18c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[H]e needs to understand the disapproval that society has for this kind of conduct, and that’s the idea behind the humiliation.

<span title="143" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-143">p. 143</span>According to Gementera, these remarks, among others, indicate that the district court viewed humiliation as an end in itself and the condition’s purpose. Reading the record in context, however, we cannot but conclude that the district court’s stated rationale aligned with permissible statutory objectives. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767bd18e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court expressed particular concern that the defendant did not fully understand the gravity of his offense. Mail theft is an anonymous crime and, by “bring[ing] home to defendant that his conduct has palpable significance to real people within his community,” the court aimed to break the defendant of the illusion that his theft was victimless or not serious. In short, it explained:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767bd18f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While humiliation may well be—indeed likely will be—a feature of defendant’s experience in standing before a post office with such a sign, the humiliation or shame he experiences should serve the salutary purpose of bringing defendant in close touch with the real significance of the crime he has acknowledged committing. Such an experience should have a specific rehabilitative effect on defendant that could not be accomplished by other means, certainly not by a more extended term of imprisonment. Moreover, “[i]t will also have a deterrent effect on both this defendant and others who might not otherwise have been made aware of the real legal consequences of engaging in mail theft.”</p>
</div>
<p id="767bd190-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Read in its entirety, the record unambiguously establishes that the district court imposed the condition for the stated and legitimate statutory purpose of rehabilitation and, to a lesser extent, for general deterrence and for the protection of the public. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767bf8a1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming the court articulated a legitimate purpose, Gementera asserts . . . that humiliation or so-called “shaming” conditions are not “reasonably related” to rehabilitation. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767bf8a2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reflecting upon the defendant’s criminal history, the court expressed concern that he did not fully understand the consequences of his continued criminality, and had not truly accepted responsibility. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767bf8a3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he district court concluded that public acknowledgment of one’s offense—beyond the formal yet sterile plea in a cloistered courtroom—was necessary to his rehabilitation.</p>
<p id="767bf8a4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, of course, that much uncertainty exists as to how rehabilitation is best accomplished. Were that picture clearer, our criminal justice system would be vastly different, and substantially improved. By one estimate, two-thirds of the 640,000 state and federal inmates who will be released in 2004 will return to prison within a few years. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, Dep’t of Justice, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1994 (2002) (finding 67.5% recidivism rate among study population of 300,000 prisoners released in 1994). The cost to humanity of our ignorance in these matters is staggering.</p>
<p id="767bf8a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gementera and amicus contend that shaming conditions cannot be rehabilitative because such conditions necessarily cause the offender to withdraw from society or otherwise inflict psychological damage, and they would erect a per se bar against such conditions. (“When it works, it redefines a person in a <span title="144" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-144">p. 144</span>negative, often irreversible way” and the “psychological core” it affects cannot thereafter be rebuilt.) Though the district court had no scientific evidence before it, as Gementera complains, we do not insist upon such evidence in our deferential review. Moreover, the fact is that a vigorous, multifaceted, scholarly debate on shaming sanctions’ efficacy, desirability, and underlying rationales continues within the academy. By no means is this conversation one-sided.</p>
<p id="767bf8a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Criminal offenses, and the penalties that accompany them, nearly always cause shame and embarrassment. The fact that a condition causes shame or embarrassment does not automatically render a condition objectionable; rather, such feelings generally signal the defendant’s acknowledgment of his wrongdoing. . . . While the district court’s sandwich board condition was somewhat crude, and by itself could entail risk of social withdrawal and stigmatization, it was coupled with more socially useful provisions, including lecturing at a high school and writing apologies, that might loosely be understood to promote the offender’s social reintegration. See John Braithwaite, Crime, Shame and Reintegration 55 (1989) (“The crucial distinction is between shaming that is reintegrative and shaming that is disintegrative (stigmatization). Reintegrative shaming means that expressions of community disapproval, which may range from mild rebuke to degradation ceremonies, are followed by gestures of reacceptance into the community of law-abiding citizens.”). . . . In short, here we consider not a stand-alone condition intended solely to humiliate, but rather a comprehensive set of provisions that expose the defendant to social disapprobation, but that also then provide an opportunity for Gementera to repair his relationship with society—first by seeking its forgiveness and then by making, as a member of the community, an independent contribution to the moral formation of its youth.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F87_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F87_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> These provisions, tailored to the specific needs of the offender, counsel in favor of concluding that the condition passes the threshold of being reasonably related to rehabilitation. . . .

<p id="767bf8a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we hold that the condition imposed upon Gementera reasonably related to the legitimate statutory objective of rehabilitation. In so holding, we are careful not to articulate a principle broader than that presented by the facts of this case. With care and specificity, the district court outlined a sensible logic underlying its conclusion that a set of conditions, including the signboard provision, but also including reintegrative provisions, would better promote this defendant’s rehabilitation and amendment of life than would a lengthier term of incarceration. By contrast, a per se rule that the mandatory public airing of one’s offense can never assist an offender to reassume his duty of obedience to the law would impose a narrow penological <span title="145" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-145">p. 145</span>orthodoxy not contemplated by the Guidelines’ express approval of “any other condition [the district court] considers to be appropriate.” 18 U.S.C. §3583(d). . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">HAWKINS</span>, Circuit Judge, dissenting: . . . Although I believe that the sandwich board condition violates the Sentencing Reform Act and we should reverse the district court for that reason, I also believe that this is simply bad policy. A fair measure of a civilized society is how its institutions behave in the space between what it may have the power to do and what it should do. The shaming component of the sentence in this case fails that test. “When one shames another person, the goal is to degrade the object of shame, to place him lower in the chain of being, to dehumanize him.” Dan Markel, Are Shaming Punishments Beautifully Retributive?

<i>1. Other shaming conditions.</i> The <i>Gementera</i> opinion mentions some examples and distinguishes them from the shaming penalty imposed in <i>Gementera</i> itself (379 F.3d at fn. 9):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767bf8ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In People v. Hackler, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 681 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993), a California court vacated a condition requiring a defendant during his first year of probation to wear a t-shirt whenever he was outside his home. The t-shirt read, “My record plus two-six packs equal four years,” and on the back, “I am on felony probation for theft.” [Defendant had been convicted of shoplifting beer from a supermarket.] Noting with disapproval the trial court’s stated intention of “going back to some extent to the era of stocks” and transforming the defendant into “a Hester Prim,” [sic] the court held that the t-shirt could not serve the rehabilitative purpose because it would render the defendant unemployable. By contrast, Gementera’s condition was sharply limited temporally (eight hours) and spatially (one post office in a large city), eliminating any risk that its effects would similarly spill over into all aspects of the defendant’s life. Indeed, the district court’s imposition of the condition in lieu of lengthier incarceration enables Gementera to enter the private labor market.</p>
<p id="767bf8af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">People v. Johnson, 528 N.E.2d 1360 (Ill. 1988), involved a condition that a DWI offender publish a newspaper advertisement with apology and mug shot. Interpreting the state supervision law as intended “to aid the defendant in rehabilitation and in avoiding future violations,” and for no other purpose, the court held that the publication requirement “possibly, adds public ridicule as a condition” of supervision and could inflict psychological harm that disserves the goal of rehabilitation (noting that the Illinois statute does not “refer to deterrent to others”). Relying on the fact that defendant was a young lady and a good student with no prior criminal record, had injured no one, and <span title="146" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-146">p. 146</span>otherwise had no alcohol or drug problem, it found the condition impermissible, given the perceived mental health risk. By contrast, we have specifically held that mandatory public apology may be rehabilitative. Moreover, the condition specifically provided that the signboard requirement would be withdrawn if the defendant showed that the condition would inflict psychological harm.</p>
<p id="767bf8b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant’s third case, People v. Letterlough, 655 N.E.2d 146 (N.Y. 1995), also involved a probation condition imposed upon a DWI offender. If he regained driving privileges, the offender was required to affix a fluorescent sign to his license plate, stating “CONVICTED DWI.” The court imposed the condition under a catch-all provision of the New York law authorizing “any other conditions reasonably related to his [or her] rehabilitation.” Under the New York statute, rehabilitation “in the sense of that word that distinguishes it from the societal goals of punishment or deterrence” was the “singular focus of the statute.” Because the condition’s “true design was not to advance defendant’s rehabilitation, but rather to ‘warn the public’ of the threat presented by his presence behind the wheel,” the court voided the condition. . . . In contrast to the New York scheme, the district court [in <i>Gementera</i>] made plain the rehabilitative purpose of the condition. We also note that in the federal system, unlike the New York system, rehabilitation is not the sole legitimate objective. See 18 U.S.C. §§3583(d), 3553(a).</p>
</div>
<p id="767bf8b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are these distinctions persuasive? Consider the following case: A Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice was convicted of corruption offenses committed during her election campaign. As part of her sentence, she was ordered to pose in handcuffs for a photograph, write an apology for her criminal conduct on the face of the photograph, and then send a copy to every member of the Pennsylvania judiciary. See Commonwealth v. Melvin, 103 A.3d 1 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014). Would the <i>Gementera</i> court uphold that sentence?</p>

</p>
<p id="767c1fd4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shame sanctions, in this regard, are very different from prisons or fines. However much prisons may have declined into chaos, they are in principle controllable. However monstrous they may have become, we all agree that the state has the duty to manage them: to establish rules, to call review boards, to answer complaints in court. None of that apparatus exists to control the enforcement of shame. . . . [A] system of shaming . . . means abandoning [courts’] duty to be the imposers of <i>measured</i> punishment. . . .

<i>3. Other controversial conditions.</i> Conditions other than shaming can raise controversial issues. Consider Wisconsin v. Oakley, 629 N.W.2d 200 (Wis. 2001). The defendant was convicted of intentionally refusing to support his nine children. The trial judge imposed a condition of probation that required the defendant to avoid having another child unless he could show that he could support that child and his current children. The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the condition in a 4–3 decision. The majority stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767c46e8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="148" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-148">p. 148</span>We conclude that in light of Oakley’s ongoing victimization of his nine children and extraordinarily troubling record manifesting his disregard for the law, this anomalous condition—imposed on a convicted felon facing the far more restrictive and punitive sanction of prison—is not overly broad and is reasonably related to Oakley’s rehabilitation. Simply put, because Oakley was convicted of intentionally refusing to pay child support—a felony in Wisconsin—and could have been imprisoned for six years, which would have eliminated his right to procreate altogether during those six years, this probation condition, which infringes on his right to procreate during his term of probation, is not invalid under these facts. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not erroneously exercise its discretion.</p>
</div>
<p id="767c46e9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The dissent concluded otherwise:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767c46ea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This condition of probation subjects Oakley to imprisonment if he fathers another child without advance permission from the State. Illegitimacy and child poverty, abuse, and neglect are among our society’s most serious and intractable problems. Conditioning the right to procreate upon proof of financial or other fitness may appear on the surface to be an appropriate solution in extreme cases such as this, but it is unprecedented in this country, and for good reason. The State can order non-custodial parents to financially support their children, and can criminally prosecute those who intentionally do not. The State can remove a child from a parent’s custody when the child is in need of protection from parental abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and can criminally prosecute parents who mistreat their children. But I know of no authority for the proposition that the State can order that a child not be conceived or born, even to an abysmally irresponsible parent, unless the State first grants its consent.</p>
</div>
<p id="767c46eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another area of some controversy involves restrictions on supervised release that dictate where a defendant can or cannot live. In United States v. Woods, 547 F.3d 515 (5th Cir. 2008), the Fifth Circuit rejected a trial judge’s condition of supervised release that the defendant not reside with anyone with whom she was not related or married. The trial court imposed the condition based on the view that the defendant’s “lack of stability” in her home life contributed to her involvement in crack cocaine distribution. Id. at 519. The appeals court rejected the provision and drew a distinction between restrictions on associating with individuals with whom a defendant has a relevant criminal history, which it thought were acceptable, and the trial court’s restriction, which the court thought was too broad.</p>
<p id="767c46ec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> What is the purpose of restricting where a defendant can live? Does the restriction at issue in <i>Woods</i> serve that goal? Is the court right to distinguish between restricting association with previous partners in crime and restricting the defendant’s living arrangements more generally? Which is more burdensome? Which contributes more effectively to social protection? Contrast the Fifth Circuit’s view with the Ninth Circuit’s acceptance in United States v. Watson, 582 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. 2009), of a condition of supervised release that prohibited the defendant from entering San Francisco without approval of a probation officer. The court said the restriction gave it “some <span title="149" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-149">p. 149</span>pause” but accepted it on the view that “the district court was persuaded that the only way to prevent Watson from returning to a life of further misconduct was to force him to make a new life somewhere else.” Id. at 983. Should a court uphold a probation condition that requires a defendant to have probation-officer approval before knowingly entering or staying in any dwelling where there is active consumption or abuse of alcohol? See United States v. Richter, 609 Fed. Appx. 503 (9th Cir. 2015).</p>
<p id="767c46ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Sex offenders</i>. Sex offenders face many sanctions beyond their terms of incarceration. In addition to imposing residency restrictions (such as restricting offenders from living within a certain distance from schools), state and federal laws create registries containing information about convicted sex offenders for use by law enforcement and to notify the public of the identities and addresses of sex offenders. The stated idea behind these notification and registration requirements is that they will assist law enforcement and the public by enabling them to monitor offenders and by deterring future violations. One study casts doubt on whether registration laws achieve these goals. It finds that, while the frequency of sex offenses decreases with registration requirements, that effect is due to a reduction in reported attacks by offenders who are known to their victims; the frequency of sex offenses committed by strangers appears to be unaffected by registration. The study also finds a reduction in the frequency of sex offenses with notification laws when registries are small, but the benefits dissipate as registries grow larger and more offenders are included within them. J.J. Prescott &amp; Jonah E. Rockoff, Do Sex Offender Notification and Registration Laws Affect Criminal Behavior?, 54 J.L. &amp; Econ. 161, 164-165 (2011). Meanwhile, the restrictions on sex offenders make their reentry much more difficult because such restrictions can hinder their ability to find housing, impede employment prospects, and limit their ability to interact with their own children at their schools.</p>
<p id="767c46ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> What do these results suggest about how notification and registration laws should be formulated? Which offenders should be covered by the requirements? (Note that the term “sex offender” can include a variety of offenders, from child molesters to individuals who urinate in public to teenagers who engage in sexting.) Are such laws bound to afford at least <i>some</i> social protection benefits, or could they conceivably <i>aggravate</i> dangers of recidivism? (Reconsider Professor Massaro’s and Professor Gilligan’s concerns about shaming penalties, p. 146-147 supra.) If these laws are not achieving their deterrence goals, can they be justified on expressive or retributive grounds? Or should they be considered unwarranted and unjust, even if commensurate with an offender’s desert, if they actually <i>impede</i> social protection goals?</p>
<p id="767c46ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the desirability of a registry depend on the triggering offense? In February of 2016, Utah created a White Collar Crime Offender Registry that lists people who have committed various fraud offenses against their friends, employers, and investors. The lawmakers who created the list say it will protect the public by providing a resource they can use to access information about potential fraudsters. Is the argument about public notification <span title="150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-150">p. 150</span>more or less persuasive in the context of white-collar crime than it is in the context of sex offenses?</p>
<p id="767c46f0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if these laws contribute to the overall reduction of offenses, are there other reasons to doubt whether their benefits outweigh their costs? Recent legislation bans sex offenders from using social networking sites. Are these bans likely to serve the goals of punishment? Which ones? See Jasmine S. Wytnon (Note), Myspace, Yourspace, But Not Theirspace: The Constitutionality of Banning Sex Offenders from Social Networking Sites, 60 Duke L.J. 1859 (2011).</p>

<p id="767c46f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Theories of criminal punishment help guide the inquiry of <i>what</i> to punish. A retributivist will not impose punishment on behavior that is not morally blameworthy. But even if conduct is morally blameworthy, there may be reasons for a free society to treat certain conduct as a matter of personal choice rather than seeking to prohibit it. Section E.1 addresses the question of when it is appropriate to criminalize conduct viewed as immoral. The utilitarian perspective raises a different set of questions. Even if conduct entails moral blame, criminal punishment will be inappropriate when it produces more harm than good, as Section E.2 explores.</p>

<p id="767c6e0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the field of constitutional law, a large body of doctrine deals with identifying conduct that is protected against government interference. Religious worship and political speech are two obvious examples. The constitutional right to privacy has invalidated many prohibitions that were long embedded in Anglo-American criminal law, such as laws criminalizing abortion (struck down in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)) and sodomy (struck down in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)). Within the wide domain of conduct that government has constitutional power to regulate, however, there was at one time intense debate about whether the criminal law <i>should</i> be used to punish conduct simply on the ground that society considered it “immoral.” Defending criminal laws of that sort, a British judge once wrote:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11108_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11108_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">41</a></span>

There is disintegration when no common morality is observed . . . , so that society is justified in taking the same steps to preserve its moral code as it does to preserve its government and other essential institutions.</p>

<p id="767c6e0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This view has been subjected to widespread criticism. In Britain, it was largely rejected in a 1957 government report concluding that “legislation which covers acts [committed between consenting adults in private] goes beyond the proper sphere of the law’s concern.”

<p id="767c6e11-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mill’s approach—the harm principle—is widely accepted today as the basis for decisions about criminalization. But it has turned out to have little practical bite. As Professor Bernard Harcourt explains (The Collapse of the Harm Principle, 90 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 109, 192-193 (1999)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767c6e12-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the past two decades, the proponents of regulation and prohibition of a wide range of human activities—activities that have traditionally been associated with moral offense—have turned to the harm argument. Catharine MacKinnon has focused on the multiple harms to women and women’s sexuality caused by pornography. The broken windows theory of crime prevention has emphasized how minor crimes, like prostitution and loitering, cause major crimes, neighborhood decline, and urban decay. . . . The debate on drugs has focused on the harms caused by drug use and the harms caused by the war on drugs. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767c9423-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This shift has significantly changed the structure of the debate over the legal enforcement of morality. [In the nineteenth century,] moralists could argue that the immorality of the offense was sufficient to enforce a prohibition, and the proponents of the harm principle could argue that the lack of harm precluded legal enforcement. . . . Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. . . . The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms. . . .

<p id="767c942a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a wide range of situations, use of the criminal sanction to deter misconduct may produce more harm than good. It does not follow, however, that the conduct must be left unregulated; society may attempt to discourage it in other ways. Governments can tax it or provide for tort liability. They may try to govern it through licenses or administrative rules and regulations. And finally, they may leave it to be dealt with by informal social pressure.</p>
<p id="767c942b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following material considers the implications of choosing criminal law as the preferred means of social control. It does so by focusing on two suggestive problems: voluntary transactions that cause social harm indirectly (so-called victimless crimes), and aggressive and common conduct aimed primarily at causing emotional harm (“bullying”).</p>

<i>PROBLEM—INDIRECT HARM AND “VICTIMLESS” CRIME</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="767c942e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An important part of the criminal law is addressed to the behavior of adults who willingly participate in transactions that society wishes to discourage. Non-coercive prostitution is a classic example, as is the purchase of drugs for personal use. It is common to refer to such offenses as “victimless” crimes, but this terminology begs a crucial question, because in the eyes of those who support these prohibitions, the conduct is anything but victimless. Prostitution can spread AIDS and venereal disease, and can encourage the exploitation and abuse of vulnerable young men and women. Drug use allegedly makes some users more violent or draws them into predatory crime to support their habit. The extent of these indirect harms is debatable, but crimes of this sort have one characteristic that is distinctive and incontrovertible: Unlike murder, robbery, or rape, they center on a <i>consensual</i> transaction. This feature turns out to have pervasive implications for criminal law enforcement. Consider Sanford H. Kadish, The Crisis of Overcriminalization, 394 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. &amp; Soc. Sci. 157 (Nov. 1967):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="767c942f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prostitution has perdured in all civilizations; indeed, few institutions have proven as hardy. The inevitable conditions of social life unfailingly produce the supply to meet the ever-present demand. . . . The costs [of criminal <span title="153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-153">p. 153</span>prohibition], on the other hand, [include] diversion of police resources; encouragement of use of illegal means of police control ( . . . harassment arrests to remove suspected prostitutes from the streets; and various entrapment devices, usually the only means of obtaining convictions); degradation of the image of law enforcement; discriminatory enforcement against the poor; and official corruption.</p>
<p id="767cbb40-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the extent that spread of venereal disease, corruption of the young, and public affront are the objects of prostitution controls, [there are many] modes of social control short of [criminalization] which would at the same time prove more effective and less costly. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767cbb41-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Laws against . . . narcotics present serious problems for law enforcement. Despite arrests, prosecutions and convictions, and increasingly severe penalties, the conduct seems only to flourish. The irrepressible demand for . . .  drugs, like the demand for alcohol during Prohibition days, survives the condemnation of the criminal law. . . . Nor have the laws and enforcement efforts suppressed sources of supply. . . . [I]llicit suppliers enter the market to seek the profits made available by . . . the criminal law’s reduction of legitimate sources of supply, while “pusher”-addicts distribute narcotics as a means of fulfilling their own needs. Risk of conviction, even of long terms of imprisonment, appears to have little effect. Partly, this is because the immediate and compelling need of the “pusher”-addict for narcotics precludes any real attention to the distant prospect of conviction and imprisonment. For large-scale suppliers, who may not be addicts, the very process of criminalization and punishment serves to raise the stakes—while the risk becomes greater, so do the prospects of reward. . . . 
</p>
<p id="767cbb42-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our indiscriminate policy of using the criminal law against selling what people insist on buying has spawned large-scale, organized systems, often of national scope, [for] distribution of the illicit product on a continuous and thoroughly businesslike basis. Not only are these organizations especially difficult for law enforcement to deal with; they have the unpleasant quality of producing other crimes as well. . . . To enhance their effectiveness, these organized systems engage in satellite forms of crime, of which bribery and corruption of local government are the most far-reaching in their consequences. Hence the irony that, in some measure, crime is encouraged and successful modes of criminality are produced by the criminal law itself. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="767cbb43-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Given the collateral costs and counterproductive side effects inherent in attempting to punish individuals who sell what others want to buy, would it make sense for the criminal law to withdraw entirely from this domain, leaving to other processes the task of discouraging voluntary transactions between consenting adults?</p>
<p id="767cbb44-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument for decriminalization is strongest when the harms to be prevented are speculative or alternative tools of social policy are likely to be equally effective. For example, although alcohol and tobacco pose serious harms, heavy taxation—not criminal prohibition—is the means now used to discourage consumption. Similarly with respect to prostitution and narcotics, alternative methods of social control are potentially available, including taxation, regulation, and public health initiatives. Consider which of the harms allegedly associated with prostitution or narcotics could be addressed <span title="154" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-154">p. 154</span>by alternatives to the criminal process. Can we be optimistic about their likely effectiveness? And, if so, what would be the symbolic or expressive effects of “decriminalizing” or “legalizing” transactions in these areas? How much should the symbolic “message” of the criminal law play a role in determining whether decriminalization should be the preferred policy? Assessing whether such alternatives will reduce the relevant harms in practice, without unwanted side effects, is of course an enormous challenge, but one that is pervasive throughout the criminal law and not just for victimless crimes.</p>

<i>PROBLEM—EMOTIONAL HARM AND “BULLYING”</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="767cbb47-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impact of bullying on the emotional well-being of school children and others has recently become a matter of heightened public concern. One reason may involve changing social sensitivity to emotional harm. Intensified concern also reflects the proliferation of social media, the ease and relative costlessness of electronic communication, and the potential for almost limitless dissemination of embarrassing or hurtful material online. In 2010, Tyler Clementi, a New Jersey college freshman, committed suicide after his roommate secretly recorded him kissing another man in their dorm room and then live-streamed the video on the Internet.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111E1_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111E1_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">44</a></span> Other suicides and emotional breakdowns have been attributed to online harassment, manipulation, or invasion of privacy. Many of these episodes have led to criminal prosecution, and as of the end of 2015, every state had an “anti-bullying” law on the books.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111E9_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111E9_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">45</a></span>
</p>
<p id="767cbb4a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most of the new laws are predominantly non-criminal in nature; they focus on mandating local schools to adopt bullying-awareness training for students and staff, as well as programs to facilitate the reporting of bullying incidents and prompt responses to them. As such, they illustrate the potential to address seriously harmful behavior through means other than the criminal process. Nonetheless, some of the new laws have a punitive dimension; New Jersey’s law, for example, permits suspension or expulsion of students who engage in any sort of bullying, including even minor forms of teasing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111F9_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111F9_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">46</a></span>
</p>
<p id="767ce25c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prosecutions for bullying have relied on a variety of existing criminal statutes. In the Tyler Clementi case, a New Jersey prosecutor used that state’s bias-intimidation and invasion-of-privacy laws to file charges carrying two potential five-year prison terms.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11205_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11205_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">47</a></span> In Missouri, a suicide apparently prompted by manipulative use of a fictitious MySpace account led to a federal prosecution for computer fraud.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1120D_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1120D_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">48</a></span> A Massachusetts case, prompted by the suicide of <span title="155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-155">p. 155</span>South Hadley teenager Phoebe Prince, offers an even more vivid illustration of this criminalization strategy, because the prosecution was based almost entirely on teasing and emotional harassment, without the invasion-of-privacy or computer-fraud arguments that were available in other such prosecutions.</p>
<p id="767ce25f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Phoebe Prince moved to South Hadley from Ireland in the fall of 2009.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1121B_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1121B_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">49</a></span> Before moving, she had been emotionally troubled and on several occasions had mutilated herself. She was an attractive teenager, popular with boys, and as a result she became the target of persistent teasing by a group of jealous girls. She also got into conflict with several girls as a result of her flirtations (or relationships) with their boyfriends. Accounts differ as to precisely who said what, and why, but there is general agreement that taunts like “whore,” “stupid slut,” and “Irish bitch” were repeatedly directed to her by several girls and by at least one boy she had dated; one student referred to her on a Facebook page as an “Irish slut.” (The town has a large Irish-American population and many of the students allegedly responsible for these insults were themselves of Irish descent.) Reacting to the stress, Phoebe resumed cutting herself, had crying spells, and confided to friends that she was desperate. Soon thereafter, she hung herself in the stairwell outside her bedroom.</p>
<p id="767ce261-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Five South Hadley students eventually pleaded guilty in adult or juvenile court to criminal charges involving either harassment or civil rights violations. They were expelled from school, and each was sentenced to a year of probation and 100 hours of community service.</p>
<p id="767ce262-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One result of the tragedy was new Massachusetts legislation that strengthens both criminal and non-criminal efforts to address the problem. Mass. Session Laws, 2010, ch. 92. On the non-criminal side, the law defines “bullying” to include “written, verbal or electronic expression . . . that . . . causes physical or emotional harm to the victim . . . [or] creates a hostile environment at school for the victim.” Id. §5. It requires schools to prohibit bullying and provide clear procedures for reporting, investigating, and responding to it.</p>
<p id="767ce263-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the criminal side, the Massachusetts law significantly expands the prohibitions addressed to such behavior. Harassment statutes typically impose only light penalties and in any event include limiting requirements designed to shelter ordinary verbal conflict and legitimate communication from even mild penal sanctions. Under the MPC, for example, the offense of harassment—a petty misdemeanor—is limited to taunts “likely to provoke a violent or disorderly response,” repeated communications in “offensively coarse language,” or “alarming conduct serving no legitimate purpose of the actor.” See MPC §250.4, Appendix. In contrast, under the new Massachusetts statute, harassment is punishable by imprisonment for up to two and a half years, and it is committed whenever someone “willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing pattern of conduct . . . which seriously alarms [a specific] <span title="156" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-156">p. 156</span>person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.” Mass. Session Laws, supra, §10.</p>
<p id="767ce264-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Are penal sanctions an appropriate way to address the problem of bullying? Are they excessively severe in relation to the culpability of the offenders? Are non-criminal tools better suited to addressing this problem, or will they fail to convey how serious and morally unacceptable such behavior is? For discussion of these issues, see Xiyin Tang, Shame: A Different Criminal Law Proposal for Bullies, 61 Clev. St. L. Rev. 649 (2013); Leah M. Christensen, Sticks, Stones, and Schoolyard Bullies: Restorative Justice, Mediation and a New Approach to Conflict Resolution in Our Schools, 9 Nev. L.J. 545 (2009). Do criminal laws addressing bullying go too far in regulating speech, such that they cross the line of what is permissible under the First Amendment? The New York Court of Appeals struck down a county anti-cyberbullying ordinance as “alarmingly overbroad.” The law covered “any act of communicating . . . by mechanical or electronic means, including posting statements on the internet or through a computer or email network . . . disseminating private, personal, false or sexual information, or sending hate mail, with no legitimate private, personal, or public purpose, with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm on another person.” People v. Marquan M., 24 N.Y.3d 1 (2014).</p>
<p id="767ce265-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is little doubt that bullying can lead to tragic consequences. And electronic media magnify enormously the reach and permanence of insults that at one time would have been heard by only one or two people and then quickly forgotten. Of course, few of these defendants, if any, likely considered that their taunts could lead to suicide. Does that fact suggest an absence of criminal culpability? Or does it suggest even greater need to heighten awareness of the consequences of such behavior? Does criminalization do a good job of raising awareness or would other avenues work better?</p>
<p id="767ce266-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At her sentencing, one of Phoebe Prince’s classmates said, “I am immensely ashamed of myself that I allowed my emotions to spiral into acts of unkindness.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1124C_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1124C_12a17474-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">50</a></span> Should verbal cruelty of that sort be considered a crime? Some school officials worry that the prospect of stringent sanctions for those found guilty of bullying may deter some bullying victims from reporting their situation. From another direction, one school administrator “cautioned that an unintended consequence of the new law could be that students, or their parents, will find it easier to label minor squabbles bullying than to find ways to work out their differences. ‘Kids have to learn to deal with conflict,’ she said. ‘What a shame if they don’t know how to effectively interact with their peers when they have a disagreement.’”

Our purpose is not, as the dissent characterizes it, to suggest that an improper condition may be cured merely by setting it alongside proper conditions. Rather, our obligation is to assess whether an individual provision reasonably relates to the purpose of rehabilitation. Where that provision is part of an integrated rehabilitative scheme, we see no bar to looking at other aspects of the scheme in evaluating the purpose and reasonableness of the individual provision at issue. . . .
