What are those attitudes (and are they the same for women as for men)? Has the focus on male sexual abuse of women obscured the gravity of same-sex sexual violence and the sexual victimization of men? Has the law paid sufficient attention to transgender individuals? If prevalent social attitudes remain unfair to victims of sexual offenses, should the criminal law move beyond them?</p>

But in connection with rape, these questions are acutely controversial. An understanding of the legal issues therefore requires attention to the nature of the targeted behavior and the social dynamics underlying it. We begin by considering several contrasting perspectives on the social and behavioral aspects of rape. We then examine the legal doctrines relevant to actus reus, mens rea, and problems of proof.</p>

Data from police department records are especially affected by under-reporting and department practices that determine which victim reports to record as rape. Looking closely at law enforcement records, Professor Corey Rayburn Yung found that many police departments significantly undercounted the rapes reported to them. He concluded that roughly a million “[reported] forcible vaginal rapes of female victims nationwide disappeared from the official records from 1995 to 2012,” and that rates of forcible rape may actually have risen during this period.

<p id="76a579a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The prevalence of victimization is now widely accepted, but some of the reported figures have stirred controversy. One critic notes that 73 percent of the women counted as rape victims in one major study did not label their own experience as “rape,” and 42 percent of them subsequently dated and had sex again with their supposed attackers. See Neil Gilbert, The Phantom Epidemic of Sexual Assault, 103 Pub. Int. 54, 60, 63 (Spring 1991). That argument raises important questions about the evolving social conception of what rape is. Does the apparent anomaly that Gilbert emphasized—that rape seemed to occur more frequently in the eyes of researchers than in the eyes of the college women themselves—suggest that the studies are flawed? Or does it suggest that victims still assume that coercion on a date cannot be “rape”? Even today, when date-rape sensitivity discussions are common on college campuses, one-third to one-half of the college women who describe an incident of <i>physically coerced sex</i> still do not label such an encounter as rape.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1011F_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1011F_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span>

<i>(c)</i> To keep the victimization estimates in perspective, it is essential to stress that even the estimates at the “low” end represent an enormous amount of abuse. But the debate over the prevalence of rape remains important for understanding the nature of the task that criminal law confronts: Is the law addressing serious but infrequent, aberrational behavior? Or should the law condemn (and does it already condemn) a type of conduct that is commonplace among ordinary, otherwise law-abiding people?</p>

<i>3. The harm of rape—and why it matters.</i> What precisely is the nature of the wrong that a victim of rape suffers? Many think of rape as a crime of violence. On this view, some argue that the harm to a rape victim is similar to that experienced in a severe beating. Men who view the offense in these terms often see the threat of rape faced by women as not fundamentally different from the threat of non-sexual assault to which men are often exposed. In contrast, many victim advocates suggest that the important harm in rape is not violence but unwanted sexual intrusion. Taking this view, they argue that men often have difficulty understanding what women fear about male behavior and that these “male” attitudes lead to inappropriate conceptions about the kind of force necessary to constitute rape. Consider Catharine A. MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified 86-87 (1987):</p>

<i>4. Race and racism.</i> Deeply embedded in the history (and perhaps current practice) of rape-law enforcement is concern that race—even more dramatically in this area than in other crimes—can distort the even-handed administration of justice. There is solid evidence that when the death penalty was constitutionally permissible for rape (it no longer is<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1020E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1020E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span>), it was frequently imposed in rape cases involving a black defendant and a white complainant, but was rarely imposed in any other racial configuration. See Susan Estrich, Rape, 95 Yale L.J. 1087, 1089 &amp; n.2 (1986). And concern persists that we may have yet to transcend this history—that black men may still be at exceptionally high risk of unjust conviction and disproportionate punishment, id., while black women—even more than other rape victims—may have exceptional difficulty getting effective protection from police, prosecutors, and juries. See Angela P. Harris, Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 581, 598-599 (1990). Many would argue that such discrimination (if it continues) calls for remedies in criminal procedure, law-enforcement hiring/training and law-enforcement practices but should not influence the way the crime itself is defined. For others, however, the potential for racially discriminatory administration of rape law must prominently affect the scope of the offense and the care with which it is defined.</p>

<i>5. Reasonable disagreements and “right” answers.</i> One reason that disputes about rape law continue is that underlying attitudes about sexual relationships remain highly controversial and are constantly in flux.

More than 20 years ago, Professor Susan Estrich, who had written of her experience as a rape victim, offered a perspective on the issues that remains strikingly relevant to the passionate disagreements that persist to this day (Teaching Rape Law, 102 Yale L.J. 509, 514-515 (1992)):</p>

</p></h3></div>

<p id="76a5eefa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the eighteenth century, William Blackstone defined rape as “carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10250_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10250_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">23</a></span> Until the 1950s, most American statutes preserved Blackstone’s definition, with only minor verbal differences. This uniformity began to erode with a wave of reforms initiated in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with changes to procedures and rules of evidence (considered in Section E below), the reforms addressed such substantive issues as the gender-specific character of the crime (traditionally, only a woman could be raped), the degree of force and/or resistance required, the need to differentiate between degrees of the offense, and the traditional exemption for men who forcibly raped their wives.</p>
<p id="76a5eefc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The upshot is enormous diversity in state approaches today. Many states still adhere closely to traditional conceptions; in Maryland, for example, rape is defined, as in Blackstone’s day, as “vaginal intercourse . . . by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1025E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1025E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">24</a></span> In other jurisdictions, statutory provisions make a sharp break with the past or combine new features with vestiges of the older concepts. To illustrate these variations, we present the 1950 California provision, which was typical of the rape statutes of its time, the 1962 Model Penal Code proposal, and three contrasting regimes currently in effect—those of California, New York, and Wisconsin.</p>

<span title="360" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-360">p. 360</span>For an initial overview, we suggest that students note how statutory regimes have changed over time and how states now differ in the way they label, grade, and punish the offense. In addition, note variations in the kinds of facts required to obtain a conviction. Is the legal definition of rape or sexual assault in these jurisdictions broader or narrower than the definition used by the FBI (p. 352, Note 1(a) supra) for statistical purposes? We also suggest returning to these regimes, after considering the cases that follow, to assess which statutory approach affords the best framework for resolving concrete problems.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">COLE</span>, J., dissenting. [The majority] concludes that “ . . . the reasonableness of Pat’s apprehension of fear was plainly a question of fact for the jury to determine.” In so concluding, the majority has skipped over the crucial issue. It seems to me that whether the prosecutrix’s fear is reasonable becomes a question only after the court determines that the defendant’s conduct <span title="368" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-368">p. 368</span>under the circumstances was reasonably calculated to give rise to a fear on her part to the extent that she was unable to resist. . . .

<p id="76a74dff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While courts no longer require a female to resist to the utmost or to resist where resistance would be foolhardy, they do require her acquiescence in the act of intercourse to stem from fear generated by something of substance. She may not simply say, “I was really scared,” and thereby transform consent or mere unwillingness into submission by force. . . . She must follow the natural instinct of every proud female to resist, by more than mere words, the violation of her person by a stranger or an unwelcomed friend. She must make it plain that she regards such sexual acts as abhorrent and repugnant to her natural sense of pride. She must resist unless the defendant has objectively manifested his intent to use physical force to accomplish his purpose. The law regards rape as a crime of violence. The majority today attenuates this proposition. It declares the innocence of an at best distraught young woman. It does not demonstrate the defendant’s guilt of the crime of rape.</p>

 . . . The majority suggests that “from her testimony the jury could have reasonably concluded that the taking of her keys was intended by Rusk to immobilize her alone, late at night, in a neighborhood with which she was unfamiliar. . . . ” But on what facts does the majority so conclude? There is no evidence descriptive of the tone of his voice; her testimony indicates only the bare statement quoted above. . . .

<p id="76a77512-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority further suggests that the jury could infer the defendant’s affirmative response [to her question “If I do what you want, will you let me go without killing me?”]. The facts belie such inference since by the prosecutrix’s own testimony the defendant made <i>no</i> response. <i>He said nothing!</i>

<p id="76a77513-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">She then testified that she started to cry and he “started lightly to choke” her, whatever that means. Obviously, the choking was not of any persuasive significance. During this “choking” she was able to talk. She said “If I do what you want will you let me go?” It was at this point that the defendant said yes.</p>
<p id="76a77514-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I find it incredible for the majority to conclude that on these facts, without more, a woman was <i>forced</i> to commit oral sex upon the defendant and then to engage in vaginal intercourse.

Company policies may limit the scope of permissible behavior, and sexual harassment laws may provide for civil liability under some circumstances.

Thus, employees like Jane often face pressure to <span title="372" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-372">p. 372</span>acquiesce in the sexual advances of a boss or supervisor.

There is continuing disagreement in the law about whether a defendant who obtains submission in that manner should be guilty of rape or sexual assault, and we will consider that question at p. 405 infra.</p>
<p id="76a7ea62-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But notice that the <i>DiPetrillo</i> case did not necessarily turn on this controversial issue, because Jane <i>did not</i> acquiesce or submit. In spite of the incentives for her to accommodate her employer’s wishes, she made plain that she would not cooperate. Under those circumstances, why is there doubt about DiPetrillo’s guilt? Was the problem for the prosecution the fact that Jane did not flee more quickly or resist more forcefully? If so, should the employment relationship (or their relative ages and sizes) affect the significance of any perceived lack of resistance on her part? In what way is the evidence unclear with respect to any element of the offense under Rhode Island law?</p>

<i>2. Must “force or coercion” be physical?</i> Notice that the last sentence of the majority opinion states that a judgment convicting DiPetrillo for using “force or coercion” must be “based solely on physical force.” How can that conclusion be reconciled with the court’s holding that there was “force or coercion” in <i>Burke</i>? Notice that the police officer in <i>Burke</i> didn’t merely threaten the victim with a traffic ticket; the court viewed him as an armed individual who “coerced the victim to submit ‘by threatening to use force or violence.’” Thus, if narrowly read, <i>Burke</i> merely reaffirms that “force or coercion” in the Rhode Island statute means physical force; the case would not necessarily open the door to “psychological coercion” arguments. But why should the statutory requirement of “force or coercion” be interpreted so narrowly?</p>
<p id="76a7ea64-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, recall that DiPetrillo <i>did</i> use physical force, but the trial judge described it as only a “modicum” and did not rest his judgment solely on that basis. Why wasn’t that “modicum” of force sufficient by itself? Notice that Justice Flaherty draws attention to an additional statutory requirement: The force used must be strong enough to “<i>overcome</i> the complaining witness” (emphasis added). Rhode Island doesn’t expressly require a complainant to resist a forcible rape, but the upshot of the statute arguably is to prevent conviction when physical force was used but <i>could have been</i> resisted. Is <i>that</i> a justifiable requirement?</p>

<i>3. Comparing</i> Rusk <i>and</i> DiPetrillo. As we saw above, the <i>Rusk</i> court, ruling in 1981, might not have upheld the conviction in the absence of the evidence of “light” choking. If so, would that result—reversal of the conviction in the absence of choking evidence—be different today? How would the <i>DiPetrillo</i> court apply the current Rhode Island statute to such facts? In states like Maryland and Rhode Island, how much have the requirements for a rape conviction changed in the past three decades?</p>

<i>1. The force requirement.</i> Traditionally, perpetrating intercourse without consent was not necessarily a crime. The absence of consent was sufficient to trigger criminal liability only under special circumstances—when the victim was below a given age (“statutory” rape), unconscious, or mentally incompetent. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code §261 (1950), p. 360 supra; Deborah W. Denno, Sexuality, Rape, and Mental Retardation, 1997 U. Ill. L. Rev. 315. A growing number of American jurisdictions, departing from this traditional view, now criminalize all instances of nonconsensual intercourse. Yet this approach, which we explore at pp. 396-407 infra, remains in the minority for liability at the felony level, and in a substantial number of American jurisdictions, intercourse without consent is not a crime at all in the absence of force. See Model Penal Code: Sexual Assault and Related Offenses, Tent. Draft No. 2, at 15 &amp; n.24 (Apr. 15, 2016).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10737_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10737_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span>

Jones, 299 P.3d 219, 228 (Idaho 2013); it “does not mean the force inherent in all sexual penetration . . . but physical compulsion, or a threat of physical compulsion, that causes the victim to submit to the sexual penetration against his or her will.” People v. Denbo, 868 N.E.2d 347, 355 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007). See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Lopez, 745 N.E.2d 961, 965 (Mass. 2001):</p>

<i>2. The resistance requirement. (a) Current law.</i> In some states, resistance is included among the formal statutory elements, but more often resistance has been read into the statutes as a requirement implicit in the elements of force or non-consent. No American state retains the old requirement that a rape conviction always requires the victim to resist “to the utmost,” but several require “earnest resistance,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10753_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10753_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">26</a></span> and in roughly half the states, contemporary statutes or court decisions still require at least “reasonable resistance.” See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §566.30 (2016), requiring “physical force that overcomes reasonable resistance”; Hull v. State, 687 So. 2d 708, <span title="374" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-374">p. 374</span>723 (Miss. 1996), holding that a rape victim must use “all reasonable physical resistance available to her under the circumstances.” In the remaining states, resistance is no longer formally required, but recent research finds that even when potential jurors declare themselves opposed to a resistance requirement and are “well versed in the socially ‘appropriate’ attitudes to be voiced at [an] abstract level,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1075D_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1075D_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">27</a></span> nonetheless in deliberations some of the same individuals argue strongly for acquittal based on the complainant’s lack of clear physical resistance.</p>

<i>(b) Policy concerns.</i> California’s statutory resistance requirement was repealed in 1980. Compare Cal. Penal Code §261(3) (1950) with Cal. Penal Code §261(a)(2) (2005), pp. 360-361 supra. The concerns that led to the repeal are summarized in People v. Barnes, 721 P.2d 110, 117-120 (Cal. 1986):</p>

<i>(c) Exceptions to the resistance requirement.</i> All courts recognize at least some occasions when resistance is unnecessary—for example, when a victim is thrown to the ground by a stranger pointing a gun at her head. In such a situation the question whether the victim offered “reasonable” resistance is in effect displaced by the question whether the victim “reasonably” feared serious bodily harm—so that the “reasonable” amount of resistance, under the circumstances, was no resistance at all. See Merzbacher v. State, 697 A.2d 432, 442 (Md. 1997).</p>

<i>3. The requirement of a reasonable apprehension.</i> In <i>Rusk</i>, all the judges accepted the rule that the victim’s fear must be reasonably grounded; they divided only over the question whether a jury could properly find that it was, on the facts. But why should the absence of resistance have to be explained by fears that are objectively “reasonable”? One obvious concern is to assure that the defendant realizes the woman is submitting out of fear rather than desire. But suppose the defendant <i>knows</i> that the victim is genuinely afraid. Suppose that he subtly but deliberately reinforces those fears. (Reconsider the facts of <i>Rusk.</i>) Shouldn’t a conviction be proper regardless of the “reasonableness” of the fears?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107D0_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N107D0_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">28</a></span> Conversely, suppose that the victim’s fears are reasonable but that the defendant is totally unaware of them.

<i>1. Implicit threats.</i>
</b> In State v. Alston, 310 N.C. 399, 312 S.E.2d 470 (1984), the defendant and his victim had lived together for six months. After Alston repeatedly struck the victim, she moved out and ended their relationship. A month later, Alston encountered her at her school, said he was going to “fix” her face to show he “was not playing,” and told her that he had a “right” to have sex with her one more time. He led her to the house of one of his friends, and when she told him she did not want to have sex, he pulled her up from a chair, took off her clothes, pushed her legs apart, and penetrated her. Alston was convicted of rape, but the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed. The court conceded that the evidence of non-consent was “unequivocal,” but held that the evidence did not establish the element of “force.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN107FB_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N107FB_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">29</a></span> Do you agree?

<p id="76a886d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term “force” and its derivative, “forcible,” when used to define the crime of rape, have historically been understood by the courts and legal scholars to mean physical force or violence. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76a886d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To define “forcible compulsion” so as to permit a conviction for rape whenever sexual intercourse is induced by “any threat” or by “physical, moral or intellectual means or by the exigencies of the circumstances” will undoubtedly have unfortunate consequences. If a man takes a destitute widow into his home and provides support for her and her family, such a definition of forcible compulsion will convict him of attempted rape if he threatens to withdraw his support and compel her to leave unless she engages in sexual intercourse. Similarly, a person may be guilty of rape if he or she extorts sexual favors from another person upon threat of discharging the other or his or her spouse from a position of employment, or upon threat of foreclosing the mortgage on the home of the other’s parents, . . . or upon threat of disclosing the other’s adultery. [S]uch an interpretation of forcible compulsion will place in the hands of jurors almost unlimited discretion to determine which acts, threats or promises will transform sexual intercourse into rape. Without intending to condone any of the foregoing, reprehensible acts, our use of them serves to illustrate the intolerable uncertainty which a wholly elastic definition of rape will create. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76a886da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that rape, as defined by the legislature . . . requires actual physical compulsion or violence or a threat of physical compulsion or violence sufficient to prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution. . . .

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1968) provides eleven definitions of “force,” some of these being subdivided. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76a886dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As one considers the range and tone of these several definitions it becomes evident that appellant’s threat . . . might, or might not, have been a “threat of forcible compulsion.” It was <i>not</i> such a threat if “forcible” is to be considered as limited to meaning “to do violence to”; it <i>might</i> have been such a threat if “forcible” is to be construed as meaning “to constrain or compel by physical, moral, or intellectual means or by the exigencies of the circumstances,” or as meaning “to press, impose, or thrust urgently, importunately, inexorably.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76a886dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our problem, therefore, is not to choose <i>the</i> “plain meaning” of the phrase, “threat of forcible compulsion,” but, rather, to decide <i>which of several</i> plain meanings the legislature had in mind. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76a886de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I have no hesitancy in concluding that the legislature did <i>not</i> mean force in the limited sense of “to do violence to,” and <i>did</i> mean force in the more general sense of “to constrain or compel by physical, moral, or intellectual means or by <span title="379" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-379">p. 379</span>the exigencies of the circumstances.” Only this conclusion is consistent with the legislature’s manifested agreement with the Model Penal Code that a “fresh approach” should be taken, and the focus of inquiry shifted away from the victim’s consent to the actor’s force.</p>

Furthermore, a woman’s decision to submit to physical force may be less agonizing than her decision to have intercourse with a person who holds economic or emotional power over her and her family. Although one can argue that a man who obtains intercourse through threats of nonphysical harm should be punished less severely than a violent rapist, the growing legal appreciation of the reality of mental injury and the power of economic duress suggests that he nonetheless should be punished. [T]he freedom of sexual choice which is to be protected by rape law can be as effectively negated by nonphysical as by physical coercion.</p>

<i>(b) The Model Penal Code.</i>
</b> MPC §213.1(2) permits a conviction for “gross sexual imposition” in cases where submission is compelled by threat of force or “by any threat that would prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution.” Reconsider State v. Thompson, Note 2 supra. Would the principal’s threat in that case “prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution”? Are the requirements for conviction under §213.1(2) too stringent?</p>
<p id="76a8adf3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conversely, as applied to the hypothetical posed by the <i>Mlinarich</i> court (the destitute widow who submits to sexual intercourse with a man who threatens to stop supporting her) does MPC §213.1(2) extend criminal liability too far? Note that the MPC offense of “gross sexual imposition” requires two distinct findings. First, the defendant’s proposal must “prevent resistance by a woman of ordinary resolution.” Can we say, in the case of the destitute widow, that it would? Second, <i>even if it would</i>, the defendant still would not be guilty under the Code unless he has made a “threat.” Is the proposition to the destitute widow a threat or just an offer? The choice of labels may seem arbitrary, but it has large implications for the scope of criminal liability. And perhaps surprisingly, the Code’s drafters did not intend to cover all inducements that would cause a woman of ordinary resolution to submit. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries §213.1, at 314 (1980):</p>

Stat. §3101. Does a defendant commit rape in Pennsylvania if he uses <i>psychological</i> pressure, for example, if “the victim had an adolescent crush on the Defendant and the Defendant was aware of her feelings for him” and obtained her consent by taking advantage of those feelings?

<i>4. Problem.</i>
</b> In State v.

When the drifter tried to break off the affair, Lovely pressured him to submit to further sexual acts by threatening to stop paying the man’s rent, to kick him out of Lovely’s home, and to get him fired from his liquor store job. The New Hampshire statute made it a felony to coerce submission to sexual penetration “by threatening to retaliate against the victim.” Lovely’s conviction was upheld; the court ruled that the trial judge had properly allowed the jury to consider, as impermissible retaliation, not only Lovely’s threat to get the man fired but also his threats to stop paying the <span title="381" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-381">p. 381</span>man’s rent and to evict the man from Lovely’s home.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10971_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10971_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">33</a></span> Does this mean that a man who asks the destitute widow to move out of his apartment, because she is no longer willing to continue their affair, is guilty of a felony in New Hampshire or Pennsylvania?

<i>5. Sex trafficking.</i>
</b> Until recently, the traditional refusal to consider psychological and financial pressures as impermissible coercion applied even to the use of these methods to control vulnerable women who are pressured to work as prostitutes. A federal statute enacted after the Civil War makes it a crime to “knowingly and willfully [hold] to involuntary servitude . . . any other person.” 18 U.S.C. §1584. But <i>involuntary</i> servitude was not defined. In a 1988 case, defendants accused of forcing individuals with intellectual disabilities to work in oppressive conditions were convicted of violating §1584 on the basis of purely psychological coercion. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute extended only to physical or legal compulsion. United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988). Congress responded by expressly overturning <i>Kozminski.</i> Finding that “[t]raffickers primarily target women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by poverty, the lack of access to education, chronic unemployment, discrimination, and the lack of economic opportunities in countries of origin,” Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, 18 U.S.C. §1591.

<span class="epub-small-caps">HANDLER</span>, J. Under New Jersey law a person who commits an act of sexual penetration using physical force or coercion is guilty of second-degree sexual assault. The sexual assault statute does not define the words “physical force.” The question posed by this appeal is whether the element of “physical force” is met simply by an act of non-consensual penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish that result.</p><p id="76a9234e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[M.T.S.], a seventeen-year-old boy, engaged in consensual kissing and heavy petting with a fifteen-year-old girl and thereafter engaged in actual sexual penetration of the girl to which she had not consented.

According to C.G., M.T.S. said “he was going to tease [her] a little bit.” C.G. testified that she “didn’t think anything of it”; she used the bathroom and returned to bed, falling into a “heavy” sleep within fifteen minutes. The next event C.G. claimed to recall was waking up with M.T.S. on top of her, her underpants and shorts removed.] She said “his penis was into [her] vagina.” As soon as C.G. realized what had happened, she said, she immediately slapped M.T.S. once in the face, then “told him to get off [her], and get out.” She did not scream or cry out.

Once they were in bed, he said, they undressed each other and . . . proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse. According to M.T.S., [he] “did it [thrust] three times, and then the fourth time . . . , that’s when [she] pulled [him] off of her.” M.T.S. said that as C.G. pushed him off, she said “stop, get off,” and he “hopped off right away.” [He] asked C.G. what was wrong; she replied with a back-hand to his face. He recalled asking C.G. what was wrong a second time, and her replying, “how can you take advantage of me or something like that.” M.T.S. said that he proceeded to get dressed and told C.G. to calm down, but that she then told him to get away from her and began to cry. Before leaving the room, he told C.G., “I’m leaving. . . . I’m going with my real girlfriend, . . . stay out of my life . . . don’t tell anybody about this . . . it would just screw everything up.” He then walked downstairs and went to sleep.</p><p id="76a94a66-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

A showing of sexual penetration coupled with a lack of consent would satisfy the elements of the statute. The Public Defender urges an interpretation of “physical force” to mean force “used to overcome lack of consent.” That definition equates force with violence and leads to the conclusion that sexual assault requires the application of some amount of force in addition to the act of penetration. . . . 
</p><p id="76a9bea0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under traditional rape law, in order to prove that a rape had occurred, the State had to show both that force had been used and that the penetration had been against the woman’s will. [A] woman who was above the age of consent had actively and affirmatively to withdraw that consent for the intercourse to be against her will. . . . Critics of rape law agreed that the focus of the crime should be shifted from the victim’s behavior to the defendant’s conduct, and particularly to its forceful and assaultive, rather than sexual, character. [T]he reform goal was not so much to purge the entire concept of consent from the law as to eliminate the burden that had been placed on victims to prove they had not consented.</p><p id="76a9bea1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Similarly, [t]raditional interpretations of force were strongly criticized for failing to acknowledge that force may be understood simply as the invasion of “bodily integrity.” Susan Estrich, Rape, 95 Yale L.J. 1087, 1105 (1986).</p><p id="76a9bea2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] Model Penal Code (MPC) proposed provisions did not present a break from traditional rape law.

Rather, it passed a fundamentally different proposal in 1978. . . . The new statutory provisions covering rape were formulated by a coalition of feminist groups assisted by the National Organization of Women (NOW) National Task Force on Rape. The stated intent of the drafters . . . had been to remove all features found to be contrary to the interests of rape victims. . . . 
</p><p id="76a9bea4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reform statute defines sexual assault as penetration accomplished by the use of “physical force” or “coercion,” but it does not define either “physical force” or “coercion.” . . . The task of defining “physical force” therefore was left to the courts. . . . 
</p><p id="76a9bea5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Legislature’s concept of sexual assault and the role of force was significantly colored by its understanding of the law of assault and battery. . . . Thus, just as any unauthorized touching is a crime under traditional laws of assault and battery,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B56_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B56_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>
 . . . so is any unauthorized sexual penetration a crime under the reformed law of sexual assault. . . . Under the new law, the victim no longer is required to resist and therefore need not have said or done anything in order for the sexual penetration to be unlawful. . . . [A]n interpretation of the statutory crime of sexual assault to require physical force in addition to that entailed in an act of involuntary or unwanted sexual penetration would be fundamentally inconsistent with the legislative purpose to eliminate any consideration of whether the victim resisted or expressed non-consent.</p><p id="76a9bea7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We note that the contrary interpretation of force—that the element of force need be extrinsic to the sexual act—would not only reintroduce a resistance requirement into the sexual assault law, but also would immunize many acts of criminal sexual contact short of penetration.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B6B_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B6B_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>
 . . . That the Legislature would have wanted to decriminalize unauthorized sexual intrusions on the bodily integrity of a victim by requiring a showing of force in addition to that entailed in the sexual contact itself is hardly possible.</p><p id="76a9bea9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . We conclude, therefore, that any act of sexual penetration engaged in by the defendant without the affirmative and freely given permission of the victim to the specific act of penetration constitutes the offense of sexual assault. . . . The definition of “physical force” is satisfied under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2c(1) if the defendant applies any amount of force against another person in the absence of what a reasonable person would believe to be affirmative and freely given permission to the act of sexual penetration. [The requirement] of “physical force” [is] neither inadvertent nor redundant. [It] acts to qualify the nature and character of the “sexual penetration.” Sexual <span title="388" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-388">p. 388</span>penetration accomplished through the use of force is unauthorized sexual penetration. . . . 
</p><p id="76a9e5ba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it is possible to imagine a set of rules in which persons must demonstrate affirmatively that sexual contact is unwanted or not permitted, such a regime would be inconsistent with modern principles of personal autonomy. The Legislature recast the law of rape as sexual assault to bring that area of law in line with the expectation of privacy and bodily control that long has characterized most of our private and public law. . . . Each person has the right not only to decide whether to engage in sexual contact with another, but also to control the circumstances and character of that contact.</p><p id="76a9e5bb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[P]ermission to the specific act of sexual penetration . . . can be indicated either through words or through actions that, when viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, would demonstrate to a reasonable person affirmative and freely given authorization for the specific act of sexual penetration. The role of the factfinder is not to decide whether reasonable people may engage in acts of penetration without the permission of others. The Legislature answered that question when it enacted the reformed sexual assault statute: reasonable people do not engage in acts of penetration without permission, and it is unlawful to do so. The role of the factfinder is . . . only [to decide] whether the defendant’s belief that the alleged victim had freely given affirmative permission was reasonable.</p><p id="76a9e5bc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he law places no burden on the alleged victim to have expressed non-consent or to have denied permission, and no inquiry is made into what he or she thought or desired or why he or she did not resist or protest. . . . Under the reformed statute, a person’s failure to protest or resist cannot be considered or used as justification for bodily invasion.</p><p id="76a9e5bd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We acknowledge that cases such as this are inherently fact sensitive and depend on the reasoned judgment and common sense of judges and juries.

<i>1. Statutory interpretation.</i> Professor David P. Bryden comments (Redefining Rape, 3 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 317, 397 (2000)): “As a matter of statutory interpretation, <i>M.T.S.</i> is easy to criticize. If all sex is forcible, then why did the statute require force in addition to penetration?”</p>
<p id="76a9e5c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>M.T.S.</i> court notes that those who worked to revise New Jersey law wanted “the focus of the crime [to] be shifted from the victim’s behavior to the defendant’s conduct, and particularly to its forceful and assaultive, rather than sexual, character.” Is the court’s interpretation of the statute consistent with that goal? Or does it shift the focus of the crime <i>away from</i> the assaultive character of the defendant’s conduct and back to the nature of the <i>victim’s</i> <span title="389" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-389">p. 389</span>behavior? The court seems to suggest that the reformer’s real concern was not so much to shift attention away from the victim’s behavior as it was to change the kind of victim behavior that was important—not resistance indicating <i>non</i>-consent but affirmative behavior indicating <i>authorization.</i> Did the statute, as written, accomplish that shift?</p>

<i>2. Legislative developments.</i> Although extrinsic force or threat of physical force remains a prerequisite to felony conviction in most jurisdictions, more than a dozen states make intercourse without consent a felony in the absence of extrinsic force, and altogether roughly half the states make such conduct criminal at either the felony or misdemeanor levels. See p. 371, Note 1, supra. Consider how the grading structures described below differ from each other and from New Jersey’s statute, as interpreted in <i>M.T.S.</i> Which approach is preferable?</p>
<p id="76a9e5c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) </i>Under Wis. Stat. §940.225 (2016) (p. 363 supra), first-degree and second-degree sexual assault include intercourse without consent by “use or threat of force or violence.” Third-degree sexual assault is defined as “sexual intercourse with a person without the consent of that person,” and consent is defined as “words or actions by a person who is competent to give informed consent indicating a freely given agreement to have sexual intercourse.” The third-degree offense is punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment.</p>

<i>(b) </i>In Florida, nonconsensual penetration committed by a threat of force likely to cause serious injury is a first-degree felony punishable by up to 30 years’ imprisonment. Nonconsensual penetration committed without using such force is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BE3_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BE3_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">36</a></span> The preamble to the statute, enacted in 1992 (Fla.

<p id="76aa0cd6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For development of the argument that sexual offense statutes should distinguish more sharply between crimes involving violence and those based on the absence of consent, and should fashion distinct levels of punishment appropriate to these distinct forms of misconduct, see Meredith J.

<i>3. Law in action.</i> Even in jurisdictions that have abolished the force requirement in theory, prosecutors in practice often refuse to go forward in the absence of evidence of physical force or resistance. A recent survey of practice on the ground in states that have an affirmative consent standard like New Jersey’s found that prosecutors “are more hesitant to charge . . . in the <span title="390" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-390">p. 390</span>absence of physical injury, threats of force, or clear verbal protests. But resistance to affirmative-consent provisions, where they are now on the books, is much less evident in some jurisdictions than in others.” Model Penal Code: Sexual Assault and Related Offenses, Preliminary Draft No. 5 at 66 (Sept. 8, 2015). That pattern may reassure those who believe that the <i>M.T.S.</i> decision goes too far, but it frustrates those who consider nonconsensual intercourse a serious crime. And American law affords the victim no legal right to challenge a prosecutor’s decision not to proceed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BFD_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BFD_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">37</a></span> The next Note and the next principal case provide an opportunity to examine the force requirement and the issues of acquaintance rape against this background.

<p id="76aa0cdb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issues discussed in <i>M.T.S.</i> have become prominent concerns throughout the world. They were always present in ordinary prosecutions in national courts. More recently, they have been addressed in international tribunals, reflecting a now-widespread view that rape and other acts of violence against women violate fundamental human rights. See Rape and Sexual Violence: Human Rights Law and Standards in the International Criminal Court (Amnesty International, 2011). International human rights law is a complex topic far outside the scope of an introductory criminal law course. Nonetheless, developments in this area can shed light on issues confronting American courts and policy makers. For these reasons, it is increasingly useful for American lawyers to have some exposure to legal principles now evolving around the world, and especially so in connection with the law of rape. The next case, which arose in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), touches directly on many concerns of this chapter. Our present interest is not with the European human rights system but rather with problems that are common to criminal law in any jurisdiction. And the European court must inevitably concentrate on these widely shared concerns, since its judgments govern diverse cultures and legal systems, from the common law of Britain to the civil law of Germany, from Western nations like France to former Soviet-bloc nations like Hungary, and from Catholic Spain to Muslim Turkey. In examining <i>M.C. v. Bulgaria</i>, the ECHR case that follows, consider how that court approaches the following questions, which are present in rape law everywhere:</p>
<p id="76aa0cdc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, how should rape be defined? Should physical force or resistance be required?

<p id="76aaa946-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Prosecutorial discretion?</i> Under the <i>M.T.S.</i> approach, the victim’s testimony, if believed, clearly would suffice to support a conviction. Would it, therefore, be inappropriate for an American prosecutor to decline to pursue the case? Or could there be legitimate reasons for an American prosecutor to decide not to proceed?</p>
<p id="76aaa947-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The European court acknowledges that, regardless of the legal standard technically applicable, prosecutors in practice typically refuse to go forward in the absence of evidence of physical force or resistance. As we have noted (p. 390 supra), American law gives the victim no legal right to challenge such a decision. If an American prosecutor chose to drop the charges in a case like <i>M.C. v.

<b>
<i>3. Policy concerns.</i>
</b> If prosecutors and juries continue to look for physical force, is that a reason to retain it as a formal requirement, or does that fact reinforce the need for the law to “send a message” that nonphysical coercion is also unacceptable? Alternatively, are there substantive reasons <i>not</i> to extend the criminal law in the manner suggested by the courts in the <i>M.C.</i> and <i>M.T.S.</i> cases? Consider the next excerpt, in which Professor David Bryden argues that requiring proof of force, in addition to non-consent, serves legitimate functions.</p>

Under the approach reflected in <i>M.T.S.</i>, consent becomes even more important, because it is the only fact (apart from mens rea) that separates lawful sexual intercourse from a criminal offense. But what is “consent”? The seemingly simple concept has many distinct meanings in ordinary usage and in law. Most fundamentally, is consent a <span title="397" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-397">p. 397</span><i>state of mind</i> (something a person <i>feels</i>, like willingness)? Or is it an <i>action</i> (something a person <i>does</i>, like giving authorization)? Statutes and case law sometimes use one meaning rather than the other, and one common formula, found in the <i>Rusk</i> statute, p. 364 supra, emphasizes both, prohibiting intercourse by force “against the will and without the consent of the other person.” Sometimes the usage in statutes and cases is unclear or internally inconsistent. For rigorous analysis of the concept of consent, see Vera Bergelson, The Meaning of Consent, <span class="epub-small-caps">12</span> Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 171 (2014); Peter Westen, The Logic of Consent (2003); Alan Wertheimer, Consent to Sexual Relations (2003); Kenneth W. Simons, The Conceptual Structure of Consent in Criminal Law, 9 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 577 (2006).</p>

<i>2. The range of possible answers.</i> Traditional law avoided having to choose between the two most basic alternatives (consent as a state of mind versus consent as an action) by requiring non-consent in both senses; the evidence had to establish both subjective unwillingness and external acts refusing consent. Physical resistance was essential, and verbal protests were considered insufficient because “a woman may desire sexual intercourse, [but] it is customary for her to say ‘no, no, no’ (although meaning ‘yes, yes, yes’) and to expect the male to be the aggressor. . . . It is always difficult in rape cases to determine whether the female really meant ‘no.’”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E4B_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10E4B_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span>

<p id="76aad06e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, does the third approach go <i>too</i> far?

With much of the public debate focused on campus parties and dating situations, partisans on all sides often picture as typical the scenario in which two people engage in mutually agreeable kissing and sexual foreplay. One of them then makes gradual, increasingly intimate advances while the other person does not protest. Those who object to the affirmative-permission approach argue that this requirement is far removed from the actual behavior of willing participants. Supporters of requiring affirmative permission often have the same scenario in mind but insist that for a person to commit an act of sexual penetration while simply assuming consent is presumptuous, disrespectful, and risky.</p>
<p id="76aad070-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Often missing from these debates is a focus on cases where the definition of consent most matters in criminal prosecutions. Criminal law conceptions of affirmative consent, like those of Wisconsin and New Jersey, include agreement communicated by words <i>or conduct</i>, and when a sexual act is clearly foreshadowed and expected, a person’s failure to object to it is a form of <i>conduct</i> that signals consent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EA7_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10EA7_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">40</a></span> In contrast, a standard that requires <i>permission</i> and one that requires expressed <i>unwillingness</i> produce different outcomes when sexual contact is <i>not</i> clearly foreshadowed, for example when the person who remains silent is a massage customer who is caught by surprise, having no reason to expect a sexual intrusion. One survey of case-processing practice found that “the affirmative-consent standard can be essential to winning convictions in circumstances involving surprise, tonic immobility [sometimes called ‘frozen fright’], or severe intoxication.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EB8_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10EB8_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">41</a></span> Professor Deborah Tuerkheimer (Rape On and Off Campus, 65 Emory L.J. 1 (2015)) has analyzed an extensive list of recent cases in which convictions were overturned, under standards requiring extrinsic force or at least verbal resistance, because complainants had not expressly protested when they were heavily intoxicated, intimidated in ongoing relationships, or partially asleep.</p>

<i>3. Current state of the law.</i> Many courts and contemporary statutes continue to presume consent in the absence of some affirmative expression of unwillingness. And some of these jurisdictions remain committed to the first approach—a verbal “no” does not necessarily suffice to communicate that unwillingness. A recent survey found that among 53 American jurisdictions (the 50 states and the D.C., U.S., and military codes), 21 provide no definition of consent at all. Of the 32 that define consent, only six adhere to the older view that consent exists until negated by physical or verbal resistance.

</b>For forceful criticism of arguments for requiring affirmative permission, see Dan Subotnik, “Hands Off”: Sex, Feminism, Affirmative Consent, and the Law of Foreplay, 16 S. Cal. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Justice 249 (2007). Professor Subotnik argues that requiring verbal consent is unrealistic for most people and that rules designed to ensure greater clarity in communication can be undesirable because “the speed of the roller coaster is central to the experience” and because “talking may damage romantic relationships.” (Id. at 294). Do you agree? If there is intense disagreement on such an issue, is it inappropriate for the criminal law to take a stand? Or—if the conduct risks serious harm—is it all the more important for it to do so?</p><p id="76ab45ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For an assessment of the debate and a conclusion supporting the affirmative-permission approach, see Model Penal Code: Sexual Assault and Related Offenses, Preliminary Draft No. 5, at 61-72 (Sept. 8, 2015).

<p id="76ab45cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When is consent “freely given” within the meaning of <i>M.T.S.</i> and the Wisconsin statute (p. 389 supra)? When is it “voluntary” within the meaning of the Florida statute (p. 389, n.36 supra)? When does a person lack the <i>capacity</i> to give valid consent? Consider the following issues.</p>
<p id="76ab45ce-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Maturity.</i> With respect to youth, statutes always draw a bright line, setting a specific age of consent. This form of rape (“statutory rape”) reflects a combination of concerns, including not only the young person’s capacity to make a mature decision, but also (1) the social goal of deterring teen pregnancy and (2) the risk of implicit coercion, especially when one party is older than the other. Reflecting this last concern, many statutory rape provisions apply only when the perpetrator is several years older than the minor victim. But many states have no such provision, and the person prosecuted may also be a minor, equal in age or even younger than the victim. See Michele Goodwin, Law’s Limits: Regulating Statutory Rape Law, <span class="epub-small-caps">2013</span> Wis. L. Rev<span class="epub-small-caps">. 481</span>.</p>
<p id="76ab45cf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Intellectual disability, another ground for invalidating consent, is more difficult to define. The MPC imposes liability when the defendant knows that the person consenting to sex “suffers from a mental disease or defect which renders her incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct.” §213.2(b). How can we set a standard that protects vulnerable victims from exploitation, without making it illegal for them ever to have fulfilling sexual relationships? See Deborah W. Denno, Sexuality, Rape, and Mental Retardation, 1997 U. Ill. L. Rev. 315.</p>
<p id="76ab45d0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Incapacity—drugs and alcohol.</i> All states impose liability for rape when a defendant has intercourse with a person who was completely unconscious. And similarly, nearly all states impose liability when the defendant has intercourse with a person who—though not completely unconscious—was severely incapacitated by drugs or alcohol he gave her without her knowledge. But many rape statutes do not impose liability if the victim was in an incapacitated condition short of complete unconsciousness, and if <i>someone other than the defendant</i> had secretly drugged the victim. Why should that last fact afford a defense when, as is typically the case, the defendant is well aware that the victim is severely intoxicated? The MPC is especially restrictive, imposing liability in these situations only when (1) the defendant has administered an intoxicant, (2) without the victim’s knowledge, and (3) “for the purpose of preventing resistance.” See §213.1(1)(b).</p>
<p id="76ab45d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The barriers to liability are even higher when the defendant has intercourse with a conscious (perhaps just barely conscious) person who is incapacitated as a result of alcohol she herself knowingly chose to consume. Yet heavy drinking, in combination with immaturity and inexperience with both sex and alcohol, is a major factor in sexual overreaching and sexual abuse, on <span title="404" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-404">p. 404</span>college campuses and elsewhere. See Karen M. Kramer, Rule by Myth: The Social and Legal Dynamics Governing Alcohol-Related Acquaintance Rapes, 47 Stan. L. Rev. 115 (1994). One analysis found that “in student populations, up to 81% of incidents can involve drinking on the part of the victim.” Sharon Cowan, The Trouble with Drink: Intoxication, (In)capacity, and the Evaporation of Consent to Sex, 41 Akron L. Rev. 899, 904-905 (2008).</p>
<p id="76ab45d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In State v. Haddock, 664 S.E.2d 339 (N.C. Ct. App. 2008), the victim, after drinking heavily during a New Year’s Eve celebration, accompanied the defendant to his apartment and collapsed on his bed, where he then had intercourse with her. He was convicted of rape under a statute prohibiting intercourse with a person “who, due to any act committed upon the victim, is rendered substantially incapable of either appraising the nature of his or her conduct, or of resisting the act.” Id. at 345. The court held that the statute was not “intended for the protection of . . . alleged victims who have voluntarily ingested intoxicating substances through their own actions.” Id. at 346. Because the incapacity was not caused by acts of the defendant himself, the court reversed the conviction. Most states impose a similar restriction. See Lori E. Shaw, Title IX, Sexual Assault, and the Issue of Effective Consent: Blurred Lines—When Should “Yes” Mean “No”?, 91 Ind. L.J. 1363, 1414-1415 (2016). Is the idea behind this restriction that the victim’s willingness to drink should be equated with consent to have sex? Or that her willingness to drink should forfeit her right to protection against <i>nonconsensual</i> sex?</p>
<p id="76ab45d3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several states have addressed the risks of abuse in these situations, by providing that intoxication—even when voluntary—can negate consent. See Patricia J. Falk, Rape by Drugs: A Statutory Overview and Proposals for Reform, 44 Ariz. L. Rev. 131, 173 (2002). But how should incapacity be defined in this context? One approach is to let the jury reach its own judgment about how much intoxication is too much. In Massachusetts the test is simply whether “the complainant was so impaired as to be incapable of consenting.” Commonwealth v. Bache, 880 N.E.2d 736, 743 n.14 (Mass. 2008). The Kansas courts reason that “[l]ay persons are familiar with the effects of alcohol. If the jury concluded [the victim] was drunk enough to be unable to consent to sex, we should give great deference to that finding.” State v. Smith, 178 P.3d 672, 877 (Kan. Ct. App. 2008). Is that the best any court can do, or is it unduly (and impermissibly) vague? Alternatively, should incapacity be defined by a bright line, such as the level of intoxication sufficient to render a person too drunk to drive (usually a blood-alcohol level of 0.1 or 0.08)? Consider these alternatives:</p>
<p id="76ab45d4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) </i>In People v. Giardino, 82 Cal. App. 4th 454, 462-463 (2000), the 16-year-old victim drank several glasses of bourbon, became “tipsy,” and then actively participated in numerous acts of intercourse and oral sex. The court held that intoxication could invalidate consent even when it was not physically incapacitating. Rather, the court said, the focus should be on “the effect of the intoxicants on the victim’s powers of judgment rather than on the victim’s powers of resistance.” The court suggested two ways to formulate <span title="405" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-405">p. 405</span>the test for the jury—whether alcohol rendered the victim “unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct,” or, more simply, whether the victim “would not have engaged in intercourse with [the defendant] had she not been under the influence of the [intoxicants].” In a subsequent decision, the court explained that “even a poor judgment is a reasonable judgment so long as the woman is able to understand and weigh the physical nature of the act, its moral character, and probable consequences.” People v. Smith, 191 Cal. App. 4th 199, 205 (2010). Is this standard appropriate or too broad?</p>
<p id="76ab45d5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) </i>In State v. Al-Hamdani, 2001 WL 1645773 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001), the defendant was convicted on the basis of an expert’s testimony that a blood-alcohol level of 0.15 was sufficient to render the victim incapable of meaningful consent because individuals in that condition cannot “appreciate the consequences of their actions.” Is that the right standard? And should a blood-alcohol level of 0.15 be considered sufficient to meet it?</p>
<p id="76ab45d6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) </i>Because blood-alcohol levels can result in different levels of disorientation for different people, Professor Shaw rejects that criterion and instead suggests that incapacitation be defined as a readily observable state of disorientation. Shaw, supra, at 1420-1412. In contrast, Professor Christine Chambers Goodman argues that the best way to address the problem is to demand <i>explicit</i> consent. Goodman, Protecting the Party Girl: A New Approach for Evaluating Intoxicated Consent, 2009 BYU L. Rev. 57, 58. She adds that “[a]lcohol, like fear, can have an impact on a woman’s ability to resist,” and therefore “silence never should be adequate to constitute consent when either of the parties has consumed alcohol.” Id. at 60.</p>
<p id="76ab45d7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Pressure without a technical threat.</i> Suppose that a woman sleeps with her supervisor because he threatens to block her promotion unless she submits to his sexual advances. As we saw in connection with nonviolent coercion, the supervisor’s threat might result in criminal liability under the MPC and in jurisdictions that similarly extend rape liability to situations involving this sort of duress. See pp. 377-382 supra. But what if the woman sleeps with the supervisor because he promises, in return for sex, to help her get a promotion that will otherwise go to someone else? This sort of proposal, even if it is merely an “offer,” can be considered “<i>quid pro quo</i> sexual harassment” and would ordinarily violate laws against sex discrimination in the work place. But is it also a crime? If the woman accepts the proposal, has she given voluntary consent or is she the victim of criminal sexual assault? Does it matter whether her company has a grievance procedure for sexual harassment?</p>
<p id="76ab45d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall the case of the destitute widow who submits to sexual intercourse with a man who will otherwise kick her and her children out of his house and refuse to continue supporting them. As we saw, p. 379 supra, the man’s proposal would not be classified as a threat under MPC §213.1(2). But in states such as New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Florida, where consent must be <span title="406" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-406">p. 406</span>“voluntary” or “freely given,” is that a case of voluntary consent or a case of criminal sexual assault?</p>
<p id="76ab6ce9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Authority and trust.</i> Is a patient in psychotherapy capable of giving valid consent to the sexual advances of the psychiatrist who is treating her? Such relationships violate medical ethics, and in the majority of states they are criminalized as a form of sexual assault. But some types of mental health professionals and marriage counselors are not governed by similar rules of professional ethics, and in many states such sexual relationships are not illegal. Should they be? Is it justified to assume that an adult patient being treated for anxiety or depression is inherently incapable of giving valid consent?</p>
<p id="76ab6cea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the criminal law prohibit, as potentially or inherently coercive, any sexual relationship between a job supervisor and his subordinate? Consider this observation:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11087_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11087_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">44</a></span>

<p id="76ab6ced-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Outside the context of psychiatrist-patient relationships, criminal law generally does not invalidate consent in adult relationships, even when they are strongly influenced by authority or trust. See Stephen J. Schulhofer, Unwanted Sex 168-253 (1998); Patricia J. Falk, Rape by Fraud and Rape by Coercion, 64 Brook. L. Rev. 39, 89-132 (1998). Are there areas in which that approach is no longer justifiable? For example, should the law prohibit, on grounds of coerced or inauthentic consent, a sexual relationship between a divorce lawyer and her client? Or between a teacher and his student?</p>
<p id="76ab6cee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a proposal to prohibit abuse of power in sexual relationships on the job and in academic settings, see Michal Buchhandler-Raphael, Criminalizing Coerced Submission in the Workplace and in the Academy, 19 Colum.

Coercion, including circumstances of social coercion, tend (with social hierarchies) to build upon and leave forensic tracks in the real world that are subject to investigation, observation, and evidence. There are uniforms, positions of authority, traditions and triggers of dominance, well-worn consequences that flow from refusal of the desires of the dominant.

<span class="epub-small-caps">GREENFIELD</span>, J. The question presented in this case is whether the sexual conquest by a predatory male of a resisting female constitutes rape or seduction. [A] jury has been waived [and] the Court first makes the following findings of fact:</p><p id="76ab6cf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant, a bachelor of approximately thirty-seven years of age, aptly described in the testimony as “glib,” . . . met an incoming plane at LaGuardia Airport, from which disembarked L.E.P., of Charlotte, North Carolina, a twenty-year-old petite, attractive second-year student at Wellesley College, an unworldly girl, evidently unacquainted with New York City and the sophisticated city ways, a girl who proved to be, as indicated by the testimony, incredibly gullible, trusting and naive. [The] defendant struck up a conversation with her, posing as a psychologist doing a magazine article and using a name that was not his, inducing Miss P. to answer questions for an interview.</p><p id="76ab6cf9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he defendant invited Miss P. to accompany him by automobile to Manhattan, [and then he] and a girl named Bridget took Miss P. to [a singles’ bar], which the defendant explained was for the purpose of conducting a sociological experiment in which he would observe her reactions and the reactions of males towards her. . . . After several hours there, . . . she was induced to come up to [the defendant’s] apartment. . . . She had been there for one to two hours <span title="408" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-408">p. 408</span>when the defendant made his move and pulled her on to the opened sofa-bed in the living room . . . and attempted to disrobe her. [S]he was able to ward off these advances and to get herself dressed again. At that point, the defendant’s tactics . . . changed.</p><p id="76ab6cfa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, he informed her of his disappointment that she had failed the test, that this was all part of his psychological experiment, that, in fact, this was a way in which he was trying to reach her innermost consciousness. [Then,] he took steps to cause doubt and fear to arise in [her] mind. He said, “Look where you are. You are in the apartment of a strange man. . . . How do you know that I am really a psychologist? . . . I could kill you. I could rape you. I could hurt you physically.”</p><p id="76ab940b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Miss P. testified that at that point she became extremely frightened, that she realized, indeed, how vulnerable she was. . . . Then there was . . . an abrupt switch in which the defendant attempted to play on the sympathy of Miss P. by telling her a story about his lost love, how Miss P. had reminded him of her, and the hurt that he had sustained when she had driven her car off a cliff. Obviously, Miss P.’s sympathy was engaged, and at that time acting instinctively, she took a step forward and reached out for him and put her hand on his shoulders, and then he grabbed her and said, “You’re mine, you are mine.” There thereupon followed an act of sexual intercourse, an act of oral-genital contact; a half-hour later a second act of sexual intercourse, and then, before she left, about seven o’clock that morning, an additional act. . . . The testimony indicates that during these various sexual acts Miss P., in fact, offered little resistance. . . . Finally, at approximately seven <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M</span>. Miss P. dressed and left the apartment. . . . 
</p><p id="76ab940c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question is whether having had sexual intercourse by the . . . means described constitutes rape in the first degree. The essential element of rape in the first degree is forcible compulsion. The prevailing view in this country is that there can be no rape which is achieved by fraud, or trick, or stratagem. Provided there is actual consent, the nature of the act being understood, it is not rape, absent a statute, no matter how despicable the fraud, even if a woman has intercourse with a man impersonating her husband . . . or even if a doctor persuades her that sexual intercourse is necessary for her treatment and return to good health. . . . 
</p><p id="76ab940d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be noted that seduction, while not considered to be a criminal act at common law, has been made a criminal offense by statute in some jurisdictions. In seduction, unlike rape, the consent of the woman, implied or explicit, has been procured, by artifice, deception, flattery, fraud or promise. The declared public policy of this state looks with disfavor on actions for seduction since the civil action was abolished more than forty years ago[;] there are no presently existing penal sanctions against seduction. The law recognizes that there are some crimes [such as larceny] where trickery and deceit do constitute the basis for a criminal charge. . . . But of course, for a larceny there has to be a taking of property of value. I do not mean to imply that a woman’s right to her body is not a thing of value, but it is not property in the sense which is defined by the law.</p><p id="76ab940e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="409" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-409">p. 409</span>It is clear [that] P. was intimidated; that she was confused; that she had been drowned in a torrent of words and perhaps was terrified. But it is likewise clear . . . that the defendant did not resort to actual physical force. . . . 
</p><p id="76ab940f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the question here is . . . whether threats uttered by the defendant had paralyzed her capacity to resist and had, in fact, undermined her will. . . . He said, “ . . . I could kill you. I could rape you. I could hurt you physically.” Those words, as uttered, are susceptible to two possible and diverse interpretations. The first would be in essence that—you had better do what I say, for you are helpless and I have the power to use ultimate force should you resist. That clearly would be a threat which would induce fear and overcome resistance. The second possible meaning of those words is, in effect, that—you are a foolish girl. . . . You put yourself in the hands of a stranger, and you are vulnerable and defenseless. The possibility would exist of physical harm to you were you being confronted by someone other than the person who uttered this statement.</p><p id="76ab9410-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, it is entirely possible that Miss P. . . . construed [the statement] as a threat, even though it may not have been intended as such. . . . The question arises as to which is the controlling state of mind—that of a person who hears the words and interprets them as a threat, or [that] of the person who utters such words. It appears to the Court that the controlling state of mind must be that of the speaker. [T]his being a criminal trial, it is basic that the criminal intent of the defendant must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . And so, if he utters words which are taken as a threat by the person who hears them, but are not intended as a threat by the person who utters them, there would be no basis for finding the necessary criminal intent. . . .  Since the Court, therefore, can find neither forcible compulsion nor threat beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is found not guilty on the charges of rape, sodomy and unlawful imprisonment.</p><p id="76ac3051-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now, acquittal on these charges does not imply that the Court condones the conduct of the defendant. The testimony in the case reveals that the defendant was a predator, and that naive and gullible girls like . . . P. were his natural prey. He posed. He lied. . . . He used psychological techniques to achieve vulnerability and sympathy, and the erosion of resistance. A young and inexperienced girl like . . . P. was then unable to withstand the practiced onslaught. . . . The Court finds his conduct, if not criminal, to be reprehensible. [Nevertheless,] the Court must conclude that the defendant’s conduct towards Miss P. cannot be adjudged criminal so as to subject him to the penalty of imprisonment for up to twenty-five years. . . .

The latter, nonsurgical procedure would only cost $4,500. When the victim replied that she lacked sufficient funds the “doctor” suggested that $1,000 would suffice as a down payment. The victim thereupon agreed to the nonsurgical alternative and consented to intercourse with the mysterious donor, believing “it was the only choice I had.”</p>

[W]hile the Legislature in section 261.6 did not expressly repeal the legalisms distinguishing “fraud in the factum” and “fraud in the inducement,” its intention certainly was to restrict “consent” to cases of true, good faith consent, obtained without substantial fraud or deceit.

<i>1. A California “fix.”</i> In 2002, almost 20 years after the <i>Boro</i> decision, California amended the provision at issue, §261(a)(4), to specify that a victim will be considered “unconscious of the nature of the act” when she was “not aware . . . of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator’s fraudulent representation that the sexual penetration served a professional purpose when it served no professional purpose.” That fix would have produced a different result in <i>Boro</i> but did not reach many other egregious frauds. Consider People v. Morales, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 920 (Ct. App. 2013). The victim went into her darkened bedroom to sleep while her boyfriend Victor and the defendant remained talking in her living room. After Victor left, the defendant entered the bedroom and had sex with her, allegedly aware that she thought he was her boyfriend. He was convicted of rape under the “unconscious of the nature of the act” test of Cal. Penal Code §261(a)(4). As in <i>Boro</i>, the court reversed the conviction, holding (id. at 929) that “a person who accomplishes sexual intercourse by impersonating someone other than a married victim’s spouse is not guilty of the crime of rape.” A few months later, the California legislature again amended §261, this time to specify that fraudulent impersonation can support a rape charge not only when the actor impersonates the victim’s husband but whenever the victim “submits under the belief that the person committing the act is someone known to the victim other than the accused, and this belief is induced by any artifice, pretense, or concealment practiced by the accused, with intent to induce the belief.” Cal. Penal Code §261(a)(5).</p>
<p id="76ac7e87-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why has the legislature limited each of these fixes to such narrow circumstances? Shouldn’t the law prohibit obtaining sexual consent by <i>any</i> material misrepresentation? See Russell L. Christopher &amp; Kathryn H. Christopher, Adult Impersonation: Rape by Fraud as a Defense to Statutory Rape, 101 Nw. U. L. Rev. 75 (2007).</p>

<i>2. Deception and the</i> M.T.S. <i>standard.</i> How should <i>Evans</i> and <i>Boro</i> be decided under the <i>M.T.S.</i> standard, which permits a conviction for sexual assault any time there is intercourse in the absence of “affirmative and freely given permission”? Should use of any deceptive inducement suffice to make the actor guilty of sexual assault?</p>
<p id="76ac7e89-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Fraud in other contexts.</i> Courts typically hold that deception invalidates sexual consent only when a doctor convinces a woman to have sex as part of a supposed medical procedure or when a man impersonates a woman’s husband; there is generally neither civil nor criminal liability when other false representations are used to obtain sex. See Laurent Sacharoff, Trespass and Deception, <span class="epub-small-caps">2015</span> BYU L. Rev. 359, 390. Yet a person who knowingly uses materially false representations to obtain tangible personal property is universally held guilty of a criminal offense, usually theft or fraud. See, e.g., MPC §223.3, Appendix.</p>

<span title="413" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-413">p. 413</span>Why the distinction? Susan Estrich argues that respect for sexual autonomy requires that material misrepresentations invalidate sexual consent, just as they always invalidate consent to a property transfer. Estrich, Real Rape 103 (1987). If our laws <i>don’t</i> consider the fraudster a rapist, does that judgment imply that our culture values sexual autonomy less than it values property rights? Consider Model Penal Code: Sexual Assault and Related Offenses, Discussion Draft No. 2, at 102, 105-106 (April 28, 2015):</p>

<p id="76ac7e8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a truism, of course, that different rights often warrant different remedies. The boundaries of the right to control one’s property are by no means congruent with those that define, for example, . . . the right to vote. Indeed, the law allows practices of misrepresentation and deception in connection with efforts to obtain a person’s vote that would be intolerable in connection with efforts to obtain that person’s property. Thus, it need not deprecate the right to control one’s sexual boundaries—or the right to vote—to recognize that the safeguards attached to those rights may differ from each other and from the safeguards appropriate to protecting property. [T]he issue calls for discriminating judgment, sensitive to context.</p>
<p id="76ac7e8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]hatever logic might suggest about continuities between false promise to induce sexual consent and false promise to induce a property transfer, [the] inter-personal dynamic [is] radically different in the two settings. [Consider situations involving an extramarital affair.] Judged by the standards that govern <i>property</i> transactions in a fiduciary setting, disclosure [of the affair] would be obligatory, and any consent procured in its absence would have to be treated as a product of fraud. Yet the law surely risks dramatic overreach if it treats every instance of sex between spouses as a sexual crime when one of them has failed to disclose an ongoing sexual affair. [Moreover, affirmative] denials of adultery are all too common as well. [T]he dishonesty is egregious and obviously central to the wronged spouse’s continued willingness to give sexual consent. Should the lying spouse therefore be subject to prosecution for a sexual crime? [D]oing so would come close to re-criminalizing adultery. . . . [These and other] policy impediments to criminalizing sexual fraud far exceed any plausible concerns associated with criminalizing sexual <i>coercion</i> or [<i>non-sexual</i>] fraud . . . .</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BECK, J</span>.: . . . Appellant, an eighteen-year-old college freshman, was charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI), . . . and related offenses in connection with an incident that occurred in a Lafayette College campus dormitory. The victim was another freshman. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76acf3db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, both the victim and appellant testified that a couple of hours prior to the incident at issue, the two went to appellant’s dorm room and engaged in intimate contact. The victim testified that the couple’s conduct was limited to kissing and fondling. Appellant, on the other hand, testified that during this initial encounter, he and the victim engaged in “rough sex” which culminated in the victim performing fellatio on him. According to appellant, the victim acted aggressively at this first rendezvous by holding appellant’s arms above his head, biting his chest, stating “You know you want me,” and initiating oral sex.</p>
<p id="76acf3dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After the encounter, the students separated and went to the dining hall with their respective friends. They met up again later and once more found themselves in appellant’s dorm room. While their accounts of what occurred at the first meeting contained significant differences, their versions of events at the second meeting were grossly divergent. The victim testified that appellant locked the door, pushed her onto the bed, straddled her, held her wrists above her head and forced his penis into her mouth. She struggled with appellant throughout the entire encounter. . . . She also . . . repeatedly stated that she did not want to engage in sex, but her pleas went unheeded. <span title="417" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-417">p. 417</span>According to the victim, appellant [said] “I know you want it,” . . . and “Nobody will know where you are.” When the victim attempted to leave, appellant blocked her path. Only after striking him in the groin with her knee was the victim able to escape.</p>
<p id="76acf3dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant characterized the second meeting in a far different light. He stated that as he led the victim into his room, she told him it would have to be “a quick one.” . . . Thereafter, according to appellant, he began to engage in the same type of behavior the victim had exhibited in their previous encounter. Appellant admitted that he held the young woman’s arms above her head, straddled her and placed his penis at her mouth. . . . When she [said] “no,” appellant answered “No means yes.” After another verbal exchange that included the victim’s statement that she had to leave, appellant again insisted that “she wanted it.” This time she answered “No, I honestly don’t.” Upon hearing this, appellant no longer sought to engage in oral sex and removed himself from her body. However, as the two lay side by side on the bed, they continued to kiss and fondle one another. . . . According to appellant, the victim enjoyed the contact and responded positively to his actions. At some point, however, she stood up and informed appellant that she had to leave. When appellant again attempted to touch her, this time on the thigh, she told him she was “getting pissed” [and] abruptly left the room.</p>
<p id="76acf3de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, [a]ppellant’s college friends testified that after the first encounter, but before the second, appellant showed them bite marks on his chest that he had received from the victim during the first encounter. Numerous character witnesses testified on appellant’s behalf. Medical personnel testified to treating the victim on the night in question. Many of the victim’s friends and classmates described her as nervous, shaken and upset after the incident.</p>
<p id="76acf3df-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defense counsel argued throughout the trial and in closing that appellant, relying on his previous encounter with the victim, did not believe his actions were taken without her consent. . . . In light of his limited experience and the victim’s initially aggressive behavior, argued counsel, appellant’s beliefs were reasonable. Further . . . as soon as appellant realized that the victim truly did not wish to engage in oral sex a second time, appellant stopped seeking same. As a result, appellant’s actions could not be deemed forcible compulsion.</p>
<p id="76acf3e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on virtually all counts. Appellant was sentenced to two to five years in prison. On direct appeal, he retained new counsel who has raised a single issue[—]that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to request a jury charge on the defense of mistake of fact. Specifically, appellant claims that counsel should have asked the court to instruct the jurors that if they found appellant reasonably, though mistakenly, believed that the victim was consenting to his sexual advances, they could find him not guilty. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76acf3e1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a baseless claim. Further, the quality of counsel’s stewardship is based on the state of the law as it existed at time of trial; counsel is not ineffective if he fails to predict future developments or changes in the law.</p>

<span title="418" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-418">p. 418</span>The Commonwealth relies . . . on an opinion by a panel of this court. Commonwealth v. Williams, 439 A.2d 765 (Pa. Super. 1982), concerned the rape and assault of a Temple University student. The facts established that the victim accepted a ride from the appellant on a snowy evening in Philadelphia. Instead of taking the young woman to the bus station, appellant drove her to a dark area, threatened to kill her and informed her that he wanted sex. The victim told Williams to “go ahead” because she did not wish to be hurt.</p>
<p id="76ad1af3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Appellant there] argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury “that if the defendant reasonably believed that the prosecutrix had consented to his sexual advances that this would constitute a defense. . . . ” This court rejected Williams’s claim and held:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ad1af4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . When one individual uses force or the threat of force to have sexual relations with a person not his spouse and without the person’s consent he has committed the crime of rape. <i>If the element of the defendant’s belief as to the victim’s state of mind is to be established as a defense to the crime of rape then it should be done by our legislature which has the power to define crimes and offenses. We refuse to create such a defense.</i>
</p>
</div>
<p id="76ad1af5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Id. (emphasis supplied.) The Commonwealth insists that under <i>Williams</i>, appellant was not entitled to the instruction he now claims trial counsel should have requested.</p>
<p id="76ad1af6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response, appellant makes two arguments. First, he argues that the “stranger rape” facts of <i>Williams</i> were far different from those of this case, making the case inapplicable. Second, he maintains that the law with respect to rape and sexual assault has changed significantly over the last decade, along with our understanding of the crime and its permutations, making a mistake of fact instruction in a date rape case a necessity for a fair trial. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ad1af7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the rape and IDSI laws have always required the element of “forcible compulsion,” that term was not initially defined. [In 1995,] the legislature amended the sexual assault law by adding a definition for forcible compulsion:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ad1af8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Forcible Compulsion.” Compulsion by use of physical, intellectual, moral, emotional or psychological force, either express or implied. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76ad1af9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is this broader definition, argues appellant in this case, that prompts the necessity for a mistake of fact jury instruction. . . . According to appellant: “The language of the present statute inextricably links the issues of consent with mens rea. To ask a jury to consider whether the defendant used ‘intellectual or moral’ force, while denying the instruction as to how to consider the defendant’s mental state at the time of alleged encounter is patently unfair to the accused.”</p>
<p id="76ad1afa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant’s argument is bolstered by the fact that the concept of “mistake of fact” has long been a fixture in the criminal law. The concept is codified in Pennsylvania and provides [18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §304]:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ad1afb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact, for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse, is a defense if . . . the ignorance or mistake negatives <span title="419" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-419">p. 419</span>the intent, knowledge, belief, recklessness, or negligence required to establish a material element of the offense; or the law provides that the state of mind established by such ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ad1afc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Courts in other jurisdictions have likewise held that jury instructions regarding the defendant’s reasonable belief as to consent are proper.</p>
<p id="76ad1afd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the logic of these other cases is persuasive, we are unable to adopt the principles enunciated in them because of the binding precedent with which we are faced, namely, <i>Williams.</i> In an effort to avoid application of <i>Williams,</i> appellant directs our attention to the Subcommittee Notes of the Pennsylvania Criminal Suggested Standard Jury Instructions. The possible conflict between <i>Williams</i> and §304 (Mistake of Fact) was not lost on the Subcommittee. . . . 
</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ad1afe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the opinion of the Subcommittee there may be cases, especially now that . . . the definition of force [includes] psychological, moral and intellectual force, where a defendant might non-recklessly or even reasonably, but wrongly, believe that his words and conduct do not constitute force or the threat of force and that a non-resisting female is consenting. An example might be “date rape” resulting from mutual misunderstanding. The boy does not intend or suspect the intimidating potential of his vigorous wooing. The girl, misjudging the boy’s character, believes he will become violent if thwarted; she feigns willingness, even some pleasure. In our opinion the defendant in such a case ought not to be convicted of rape.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ad1aff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . We agree with the Subcommittee that the rule in <i>Williams</i> is inappropriate in the type of date rape case described above. Changing codes of sexual conduct, particularly those exhibited on college campuses, may require that we give greater weight to what is occurring beneath the overt actions of young men and women. Recognition of those changes, in the form of specified jury instructions, strikes us an appropriate course of action.</p>
<p id="76ad1b00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite appellant’s excellent presentation of the issues, there remain two distinct problems precluding relief in this case. First [t]his case . . . is not one of the “new” varieties of sexual assault contemplated by the amended statute. . . . This is a case of a young woman alleging physical force. . . . We are keenly aware of the differences between <i>Williams</i> and this case. Most notable is the fact that Williams and his victim never met before the incident in question. Here, appellant and the victim not only knew one another, but had engaged in intimate contact just hours before the incident in question. It is clear, however, that the <i>Williams</i> court’s basis for denying the jury instruction was its conclusion that the law did not require it and, further, that the judiciary had no authority to grant it. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ad4111-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In any event, distinguishing <i>Williams</i> on the basis of the parties’ previous contacts . . . is not enough to allow appellant the relief he seeks. Even if we . . . are persuaded by appellant’s arguments chronicling the history of sexual assault law . . . , we face a second barrier. Because this appeal raises ineffective assistance of counsel, we are required to find that appellant’s trial lawyer made a mistake. That mistake is the failure to ask the trial court for <span title="420" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-420">p. 420</span>an instruction that the <i>Williams</i> case held is unwarranted. In other words, we would have to find that counsel’s failure to argue for a change in the law constituted ineffectiveness. This, of course, is not possible. . . . The relief appellant seeks represents a significant departure from the current state of the law. Despite its compelling nature, it cannot be the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>

<i>1. Strict liability?</i> Note that the defendants in <i>Sherry</i> did not seek acquittal on the ground that their alleged mistake was both honest and reasonable. In a subsequent acquaintance rape case, Commonwealth v. Simcock, 575 N.E.2d 1137, 1142-1143 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991), the trial judge not only refused a defense request for instructions on reasonable mistake but also told the jury (in a context where force was an element of the offense) that “a belief that the victim consented would not be a defense even if reasonable.” The appellate court affirmed the rape conviction, stating that the result was “in harmony with the analogous rule that a defendant in a statutory rape case is not entitled to an instruction that a reasonable mistake as to the victim’s age is a defense.”</p>
<p id="76ad411a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is the analogy flawed? Or is the court right in suggesting that defendants should be held strictly accountable for the existence of consent by their sexual partners?</p>
<p id="76ad411b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Commonwealth v. Lopez, 745 N.E.2d 961 (Mass. 2001), the Massachusetts court defended its refusal to allow any mistake-of-fact defense on the issue of consent; the court reasoned that the prosecution is in any event required to prove that the defendant used force and that subjective culpability is therefore inherent in his actions. The argument poses two sets of questions:</p>
<p id="76ad411c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) </i>As a factual matter, is it true that subjective culpability is inherent in actions involving the use of “force”? Suppose that after the complainant went to the defendant’s apartment for a drink, the defendant showed her his collection of combat knives and then made sexual comments and sexual <span title="421" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-421">p. 421</span>advances, after which complainant submitted to his sexual advances. If a jury finds his behavior implicitly threatening and sufficient to meet the element of force, is it inevitable that the defendant will have <i>realized</i> that the victim perceived his actions as threatening?</p>
<p id="76ad411d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) </i>If courts feel that a finding of culpability is important, and if they are relying on the element of “force” to ensure that culpability is present, will they resist efforts to expand the concept of what counts as force? If so, is it desirable to define the offense in such a way that the mens rea element is easy to establish, while the actus reus element of force remains relatively difficult to establish? Compare the approach of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>M.C. v. Bulgaria</i>: The court held that European states must extend their definitions of force to encompass subtly coercive circumstances, but it also assumed that a conviction of rape requires proof of the defendant’s <i>awareness</i> that the victim felt coerced. See p. 393 supra. Is this solution more protective or less protective of victims than the <i>Lopez</i> strict-liability approach?</p>
<p id="76ad411e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The weight of American authority now runs strongly against strict liability on the consent issue, but a few states appear to have joined Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in opting for this approach. See, e.g., State v. Hernandez, 2010 WL 3119379 (Minn. App. Aug. 10, 2010); State v. Reed, 479 A.2d 1291 (Me. 1984).</p>
<p id="76ad411f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Recklessness or only negligence?</i> Most of the American cases permit a mistake defense, but only when the defendant’s error as to consent is reasonable. See, e.g., Davis v. United States, 873 A.2d 1101, 1104 (D.C. 2005); State v. Oliver, 627 A.2d 144 (N.J. 1993). See Robin Charlow, Bad Acts in Search of a Mens Rea: Anatomy of a Rape, 71 Fordham L. Rev. 263, 272-279 (2002). In England, in contrast, the House of Lords ruled that the prosecution must prove that the defendant either knew consent was absent or was willing to proceed “willy-nilly, not caring whether the victim consents or no.” See Regina v. Morgan, [1976] A.C. 182:</p>

<p id="76ad4120-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once one has accepted, what seems to me abundantly clear, that the prohibited act in rape is non-consensual sexual intercourse, and that the guilty state of mind is an intention to commit it, it seems to me to follow as a matter of inexorable logic that . . . honest belief . . . negatives intent, [and that] the reasonableness or otherwise of that belief can only be evidence for or against the view that the belief and therefore the intent was actually held. . . . Any other view . . . can only have the effect of saying that a man intends something which he does not. . . .

The relationship between culpability and punishment?</i> An offender convicted of rape, even under a strict liability or negligence standard, generally faces a substantial term of imprisonment, as well as mandatory sex-offender registration, and identification on publicly available websites, often with a designation as a “sexually violent predator.” In some jurisdictions, conviction can carry a mandatory <i>minimum</i> term,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN114A8_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N114A8_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">46</a></span> and sex-offender registration can be coupled with strict prohibitions on certain kinds of employment and on residing near schools or parks. See Michael Vitiello, Punishing Sex Offenders: When Good Intentions Go Bad, 40 Ariz. St. L.J. 651, 667-674 (2008). Should the proliferation of these often mandatory sanctions affect the acceptability of negligence as a sufficient mens rea on the issue of consent?</p>

<i>4. Victim consent in other crimes.</i> Although victim consent is not a defense to homicide and other offenses involving serious bodily injury, consent in other situations can deprive conduct of its criminal character. See MPC §2.11, Appendix. Sexual contact is but one of many situations in which liability may turn on the consequences of a mistake about consent. Consider State v. Kelly, 338 S.E.2d 405 (W. Va. 1985). The defendant, a construction contractor, removed oak fireplace mantels from two unoccupied houses and sold the mantels to an antique dealer. Evidence suggested that the defendant had broken into the houses and torn locks off the front doors to gain access. He testified that a man named Bradley had called, met him at the houses, and discussed tearing them down or salvaging their contents. After the defendant sold the mantels, he paid the $140 proceeds to Bradley and received $40 for his efforts. He also testified that a neighbor told him that Bradley and his wife owned the houses. In fact, the houses were owned by Bradley’s estranged wife, who had not consented to removal of the mantels. The defendant was convicted of larceny. The appellate court reversed:</p>

<i>Questions:</i> If knowledge of the owner’s non-consent is required for a larceny conviction, why shouldn’t knowledge of the woman’s non-consent be required for a rape conviction? Does the requirement that a defendant be aware of the facts that make his conduct wrongful flow from the essential character of conviction for any serious crime? Or does the need for that requirement depend on the particular kind of harm caused by failing to assure consent? Consider Andrew E. Taslitz, Willfully Blinded: On Date Rape and Self-Deception, 28 Harv. J.L. &amp; Gender 381, 387-388 (2005): “[M]ale self-deception about whether a woman has consented . . . is morally worse than ordinary forms of criminal negligence.” Do you agree?</p>

Tyson was convicted of rape, and the court of appeals affirmed (id. at 295):</p>

What if the jury believes that <i>both</i> parties are exaggerating? State v.

<i>7. Applying a reasonableness standard.</i> What factors determine whether a person’s mistake about consent was “reasonable”? Recall Dean Anderson’s observation (p. 402 supra) that “study after study indicates that men consistently misinterpret women’s nonverbal behavior. They impute erotic innuendo and sexual intent where there is none.” Does this mean that men who make these mistakes are behaving reasonably (i.e., typically) or unreasonably (i.e., unjustifiably)?</p>
<p id="76ad6842-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judgments about reasonableness often depend on context, but it can nonetheless be helpful to focus on a simplified scenario. Consider these situations:</p>
<p id="76ad8f53-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> At a college party, David places his hand on the inner thigh of his classmate Tyler. Tyler says “no, don’t” but does not push David’s hand away, and David then commits an act of sexual penetration. Did Tyler consent? If not (for example, when the rule is “no means no”), but David mistakenly thought Tyler had consented, was his mistake <i>unreasonable</i>?</p>
<p id="76ad8f54-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> At a college party, Dan places his hand on the inner thigh of his classmate Jordan. Jordan remains passive, saying nothing, and Dan then commits an act of sexual penetration. Did Jordan consent? If not (for example, <span title="425" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-425">p. 425</span>when consent requires affirmative permission), but Dan mistakenly thought Jordan had consented, was his mistake <i>unreasonable</i>?</p>
<p id="76ad8f55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> Consider whether the answers to these questions should depend on background details, such as how well the parties knew each other or whether either Tyler or Jordan was drunk. For example, in case (b), if Jordan was perfectly sober, can Dan reasonably interpret Jordan’s silence and lack of resistance as consent? Does the answer change if instead Jordan had been heavily drinking and, although still conscious, was unable to stand; in those circumstances would it still be reasonable for Dan to interpret Jordan’s silence as consent? On one view, it is unrealistic to decide on reasonable mistake without taking all contextual details into account. On another view, it is crucial to rely on bright-line standards like “no means no” and “yes means yes,” precisely to avoid allowing the person who takes the sexual initiative to make assumptions that too often are inaccurate and self-serving. Which is the better view?</p>

<i>8. Evidence and implications.</i> Differences of interpretation can be especially wide when there is neither “yes” nor “no” (as in example 7(b) above). But people’s opinions also diverge when victims clearly do say “no.” In a 2009 study of a “date rape” scenario involving a victim who repeatedly said no but was sexually penetrated without extrinsic physical force, a diverse sample of 1,500 adults split sharply over whether there was consent and (if not) whether the defendant had made a reasonable mistake. When these respondents were provided a legal definition that “no means no” and told “if [the man] knows that the woman has said ‘no,’ a mistaken belief that the woman consented is not a defense,” the percentage willing to convict rose somewhat (from 57 percent to 65 percent). But even when given this instruction to apply the no-means-no standard, 35 percent of the respondents said they would find the defendant not guilty. See Dan M. Kahan, Culture, Cognition, and Consent: Who Perceives What, and Why, in Acquaintance-Rape Cases, 158 U. Pa. L. Rev. 729, 764, 774-775 (2010).</p>

<i>1. The impact of statutory revision.</i> Most empirical studies find that reform efforts have had little impact on rape reporting, processing of complaints, and conviction rates.

A detailed <span title="430" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-430">p. 430</span>study of one of the nation’s most ambitious reforms found a Michigan statute relatively unsuccessful in extending the criminal prohibition to conduct previously thought to be permissible or “borderline”; one law enforcement official dismissed the law’s expanded coverage as “messing with the folkways.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11710_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11710_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">50</a></span> Another report analyzed data from six jurisdictions with widely differing approaches to reform, from the far-reaching Michigan effort to relatively minor reforms in Texas and Georgia.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11718_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11718_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">51</a></span> The study found only small improvements in Michigan and virtually none in the other jurisdictions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11720_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11720_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">52</a></span> Researchers attributed these disappointing results to the wide discretion exercised by criminal justice officials, who “continue[d] to use the informal norms developed in the courtroom work group to guide the processing of cases.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11728_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11728_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">53</a></span> And there is considerable evidence that even when prosecutions are brought, juries still seem guided by traditional assumptions about the importance of physical force and resistance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11730_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11730_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">54</a></span>

<i>2. The implications of de facto resistance to law reform.</i> Do the findings described in the preceding Note suggest that legislative reform is bound to prove futile? One researcher observes that “passage of the reforms sent an important symbolic message regarding the seriousness of rape cases,” and that “[i]n the long run this symbolic message may be more important than the instrumental change that was anticipated.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1173F_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1173F_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">55</a></span> But if cultural change is the key to improving attitudes and behavior, what is the best way to achieve it? Why should <i>criminal</i> law be the instrument for producing such change?

L. Rev. 581 (2009)) that because of criminal law’s harsh sanctions, reform efforts should reject the punitive approach and seek to change social attitudes in other ways. Professor Katharine K. Baker also points to a pragmatic difficulty in relying on the criminal law (Why Rape Should Not (Always) Be a Crime, 100 Minn. L. Rev. 221, 222-223 (2015)):</p>

<p id="76ae52f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Making consent the determinative factor in rape does little good if proving the absence thereof—beyond a reasonable doubt, no less—is all but impossible. . . . If behavior is not punished criminally because it cannot be proved, then the public’s understanding of criminal behavior will not change. [In addition,] [t]ough-on-rapists measures enacted in the 1990s reflect an understanding of rapists as profoundly deviant and distinctly criminal, [posing an additional obstacle to conviction in the context of male behavior that appears] commonplace and completely understandable given heterosexual scripts and norms of sexual pursuit.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ae52f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Donald Dripps proposes a way to make criminal law more effective, despite “the gap between elite and popular opinion”: Cases involving nonconsensual sex but no physical force would be prosecuted in “a special sex-crimes court” where non-jury trials would be constitutionally permissible because the court would not have authority to impose more than a six-month sentence. See Dripps, After Rape Law: Will the Turn to Consent Normalize the Prosecution of Sexual Assault?, 41 Akron L. Rev. 957, 976-979 (2008). Is it appropriate—and effective—to use criminal punishment in this way, as a means to alter social norms that are prevalent in the community (or in substantial segments of it)?</p>
<p id="76ae52f7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Better ways to effect social change?</i> The pitfalls of criminal prosecution have led reformers to explore a variety of other remedies, including protective orders against the offender, protection of the victim’s employment rights when a sexual assault occurs at work, college grievance procedures in cases that arise on campus, victim compensation funds, tort suits against offenders, and suits against third parties such as employers, universities and hotel owners. See Carol Withey, Rape and Sexual Assault Education, 13 New Crim. L. Rev. 802 (2010); Michelle J. Anderson, Sex Education and Rape, 17 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 83 (2010); Susan H. Vickers ed., Beyond the Criminal Justice System: Our Nation’s Response to Rape (Victim Rights Law Center 2003).</p>
<p id="76ae52f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">University campuses have become an important site for such efforts. More than 800 colleges and universities have adopted policies against sexual assault that require students to obtain some version of “affirmative consent” to sexual activity,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1177E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1177E_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">57</a></span> and both New York and California require colleges receiving state <span title="432" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-432">p. 432</span>funds to adopt and enforce affirmative consent requirements.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1178C_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1178C_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">58</a></span> The U.S. Department of Education has been particularly active in these matters; the Department does not require colleges and universities to use any particular definition of consent, but those receiving federal funds are expected to comply with detailed procedures to ensure that allegations of sexual abuse on campus are effectively investigated and remedied; the theory here is that such abuse interferes with equal opportunity in education. See U.S. Dept. of Educ., Office of Civil Rights, Dear Colleague Letter (Apr. 4, 2011). Professor Baker, supra, sees this as a way to achieve more lasting progress, while also giving victims more control over the process than is possible in criminal prosecutions.</p>
<p id="76ae52fb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet these options pose many problems of their own. Professor Gruber, supra, at 658 n.428, cautions that the various non-criminal alternatives are “not necessarily effective and can reinforce stereotypes and actually do harm.” College disciplinary sanctions for sexual misconduct, though less harsh than most criminal punishments, can have severe, potentially life-changing consequences for an accused student who is found responsible. Accordingly, the need for clearly defined standards of conduct and due process procedural safeguards is acutely felt. Some difficulties of the criminal justice system may be avoided through this approach, but others may be replicated in different form or even aggravated. Partly as a consequence, the push to emphasize campus remedies, as an alternative to the criminal process, has been met by strong objections to the fairness of college disciplinary procedures. E.g., Tamara Rice Lave, Ready, Fire, Aim: How Universities Are Failing the Constitution in Sexual Assault Cases<span class="epub-small-caps">,</span> Ariz. St. L.J. (forthcoming Fall 2016). And as a result, some critics insist that sexual assault cases should be handled <i>only</i> in the criminal justice system. For a lively debate on this issue, see <a target="_blank" href="http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1402-courts-not-campuses-should-decide-sexual-assault-cases" class="epub-externalref">http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1402-courts-not-campuses-should-decide-sexual-assault-cases</a>.</p>
<p id="76ae7a0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, non-criminal approaches hold considerable promise, but they are by no means a panacea. Nor is it likely that they can entirely replace the criminal process, even in the context of less violent offenses and allegations of acquaintance rape.</p>

Rape is not simply a sexual act to which one party does not consent. Rather, it is a degrading, violent act which violates the bodily integrity of the victim and frequently causes severe, long-lasting physical and psychic harm. To ever imply consent to such an act is irrational and absurd. [A] marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity. . . . If a husband feels “aggrieved” by his wife’s refusal to engage in sexual intercourse, he should seek relief in the courts governing domestic relations, not in “violent or forceful self-help.”</p>
<p id="76ae7a16-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other traditional justifications for the marital exemption were the common-law doctrines that a woman was the property of her husband and that the legal existence of the woman was “incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband” (1 Blackstone’s Commentaries (1966 ed.), p. 430). Both these doctrines, of course, have long been rejected in this State. Indeed, “[n]owhere in the common-law world—[or] in any modern society—is a woman regarded as chattel or demeaned by denial of a separate legal identity and the dignity associated with recognition as a whole human being” (Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 52).</p>
<p id="76ae7a17-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the traditional justifications for the marital exemption no longer have any validity, other arguments have been advanced in its defense. [I]t is not tenable to argue that elimination of the marital exemption would disrupt marriages because it would discourage reconciliation.

</p>
<p id="76ae7a18-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The final argument in defense of the marital exemption is that marital rape is not as serious an offense as other rape and is thus adequately dealt with by the possibility of prosecution under criminal statutes, such as assault statutes, which provide for less severe punishment. The fact that rape statutes exist, however, is a recognition that the harm caused by a forcible rape is different, and more severe, than the harm caused by an ordinary assault.</p>

<i>1. The prevalence of marital rape.</i> Although once assumed to be extremely rare, marital rape is now thought to occur with disturbing frequency. Reliable statistics are difficult to obtain for any form of rape, but one study based on interviews with a random sample of nearly 1,000 women found that 14 percent of the women who had been married were the victims of at least one completed or attempted rape by their husbands. See Diana E. H. Russell, Rape in Marriage 57 (2d ed. 1990).</p>

<i>2. The harm of marital rape</i>. The Model Penal Code, drafted in the 1950s, chose to preserve the marital exemption, in part for the following reason (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §213.1, at 344-346 (1980)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aea12d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he law already authorizes a penalty for assault. . . . The issue is whether the still more drastic sanctions of rape should apply. The answer depends on whether the injury caused by forcible intercourse by a husband is equivalent to that inflicted by someone else. The gravity of the crime of forcible rape derives not merely from its violent character but also from its achievement of a particularly degrading kind of unwanted intimacy. Where the attacker stands in an ongoing relation of sexual intimacy, that evil, as distinct from the force used to compel submission, may well be thought qualitatively different.</p>
</div>
<p id="76aea12e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The notion that the harm of marital rape is less serious than that of stranger rape is forcefully criticized in Russell, supra, at 190-191, 198-199:</p>

<p id="76aea12f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]ife rape can be as terrifying and life-threatening to the victim as stranger rape. In addition, it often evokes a powerful sense of betrayal, deep disillusionment, and total isolation. . . . When a woman has been raped by her husband she cannot seek comfort and safety at home. She can decide to leave the marriage or to live with what happened. Either choice can be devastating. [S]taying usually means being raped again, often repeatedly. . . .  A vicious cycle is set in motion that can lead a wife to suicide or madness.</p>

<i>3. Institutional concerns.</i> Another traditional justification for the marital exemption centered on the supposed privacy interests of the married couple and doubts about the legitimacy of state intervention. The Model Penal Code Commentaries, supra, argued that “[r]etaining the spousal exclusion avoids [an] unwarranted intrusion of the penal law into the life of the family.” Critics have forcefully challenged this assumption as well, arguing that it is the rape, not state intervention, that shatters the trust and harmony of the marital relationship. See Jill Elaine Hasday, Contest and Consent: A Legal History of Marital Rape, 88 Cal. L. Rev. 1373, 1487-1488 (2000). But others note that the potential for prosecution can override the victim’s own preferences, cast doubt on her capacity to make valid autonomous judgments, and impose “de facto divorce” against the wishes of both parties. See Jeannie Suk, Criminal Law Comes Home, 116 Yale L.J. 2, 66-68 (2006). In addition, because prosecution, even where possible, is rare,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11830_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11830_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">59</a></span> criminalization runs an especially high risk of discriminatory enforcement.</p>
<p id="76aea132-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional complication is the wider scope and increasing variability of the underlying crimes that become applicable in the absence of an exemption. Consider this assessment (Model Penal Code: Sexual Assault and Related Offenses, Discussion Draft No. 2 at 138, 140 (April 28, 2015)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aea133-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common-law position, which denied married women protection against even violent forms of sexual assault, is clearly archaic and indefensible. But <span title="435" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-435">p. 435</span>[the] opposite extreme, which holds that the existence of an ongoing intimate relationship should have no effect on the application of a more comprehensive suite of sexual-assault offenses, also proves unsatisfactory. [A] conscientious approach must consider the [scope of] substantive liability. . . .  As sexual-offense law progresses to penalize a range of behavior far wider than just forcible rape, the existence of an intimate, consensual sexual relationship becomes an increasingly salient factor for determining liability.</p>

<p id="76aea134-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Legislative developments.</i> Recent statutory reforms have substantially eroded the marital rape exemption. Roughly half the states have abolished the exemption entirely or retained it only to the extent of exempting husbands from prosecution for statutory rape (i.e., the situation in which intercourse is consensual but the wife is under the legally prescribed age of consent). Nonetheless, nearly half the states retain qualified versions of the marital rape exemption—for example, by prescribing lower punishment for marital rape, or by permitting prosecution only when the husband has used the most serious forms of force. See Jill Elaine Hasday, Protecting Them from Themselves: The Persistence of Mutual Benefits Arguments for Sex and Race Inequality, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1464, 1471 (2009); Michelle J. Anderson, Marital Immunity, Intimate Relationships, and Improper Inferences: A New Law on Sexual Offenses by Intimates, 54 Hastings L.J. 1465 (2003). And regardless of the statutory framework, reporting rates are even lower than for other rapes (see p. 352, Note 1(a), supra), “prosecution remains infrequent, and conviction rates are low.” Emily J. Sack, Is Domestic Violence a Crime?, 24 St. Johns J. Legal Comment. 535, 557 (2010).</p>
<p id="76aec845-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Judicial approaches.</i> When state statutes do not explicitly require that the rape victim be “a female not his wife,” courts have some flexibility in determining whether the common-law marital exemption should remain a part of contemporary law. Although defendants have argued that such a change in previously settled understandings should come only from the legislature, several courts have held that a marital exemption should no longer be read into their statutes. See, e.g., State v. Smith, 426 A.2d 38 (N.J. 1981). England likewise abolished the marital exemption by judicial decision. R. v. R., [1991] 4 All E.R. 481.</p>
<p id="76aec846-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A narrower approach is taken in Weishaupt v. Commonwealth, 315 S.E.2d 847 (Va. 1984). The court there abolished the marital exemption only for cases in which the wife had “conduct[ed] herself in a manner that establishes a de facto end to the marriage.” (In <i>Weishaupt</i> the parties had been separated for 11 months at the time of the offense.) Does <i>Weishaupt</i> provide a workable compromise approach? If not, is a simple “living apart” test preferable? Or is preservation of the marital exemption under any conditions fundamentally unsound?<span title="436" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-436">p. 436</span></p>

<p id="76aec84b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preceding sections suggest some of the ways in which concerns about unfounded accusations of rape influenced the law relating to the required actus reus and mens rea. The same concerns have also influenced the law of evidence, especially in three areas: requirements of corroboration, jury instructions relating to the complainant’s credibility, and rules relating to cross-examination. The present section examines these three areas, the first two briefly (their interest is now largely historical) and the third, which presents problems of continuing difficulty, in some detail.</p>
<p id="76aec84c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Corroboration.</i> At one time, most American jurisdictions imposed special corroboration requirements as a prerequisite for a rape conviction. In United States v. Wiley, 492 F.2d 547 (D.C. Cir. 1974), Judge Bazelon, concurring, explained the “tangled web” of rationales for these requirements (id. at 552-555):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aec84d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most common [concern] is that false charges of rape are more prevalent than false charges of other crimes. . . . It is contended that a woman may fabricate a rape accusation because, having consented to intercourse she is ashamed and bitter, or because she is pregnant and feels pressured to create a false explanation, or because she hates the man she accuses or wishes to blackmail him. . . . There are, however, countervailing reasons not to report a rape. One said to be a victim of rape may be stigmatized by society, there may be humiliating publicity, and the necessity of facing the insinuations of defense counsel may be a deterrent. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76aec84e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the problem of false charges, the corroboration requirement is justified on the theory of Lord Chief Justice Hale [who wrote in 1680] that rape “is an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.” . . . Juries are said to be unusually sympathetic to a woman wronged, thus weakening the presumption of innocence. [But w]hat studies are available suggest that . . . juries may be more skeptical of rape accusations than is often supposed. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76aec84f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Still another basis for the corroboration requirement lies in “the sorry history of racism in America.” There has been an enormous danger of injustice when a black man accused of raping a white woman is tried before a white jury. [Today, however, juries] are more integrated than in the past and racial prejudice may be at a somewhat lower level. Numerous rape victims are black and their interests, as well as those of white women, may have been slighted by the concern for black defendants.</p>
</div>
<p id="76aeef60-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the treatment of rape victims has improved since the time when Judge Bazelon addressed the issue in <i>Wiley</i>, rape remains one of the most under-reported of the major crimes. See p. 352, Note 1(a), supra. For this and other reasons, many scholars believe that concerns about false charges are wildly exaggerated. They argue that there is no more reason to impose heightened requirements of proof in prosecutions for rape than in prosecutions for <span title="437" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-437">p. 437</span>any other offense. Others, however, suggest that while rape might be under-reported by some potential complainants, it is over-reported by others. For review of the issues, see David P. Bryden &amp; Sonja Lengnick, Rape in the Criminal Justice System, 87 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1194, 1295-1315 (1997).</p>
<p id="76aeef61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Currently, no American state requires corroboration in all forcible rape cases. See Annot., 31 A.L.R.4th 120 (2011). In support of the current consensus against requiring corroboration, see United States v. Sheppard, 569 F.2d 114, 118-119 (D.C. Cir. 1977):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aeef62-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The corroboration requirement . . . foreclose[s] jury consideration of cases in which a highly credible complainant prosecutes charges, on the basis of her testimony alone, against a defendant whose account of the events is clearly less credible. . . . Elimination of the corroboration requirement, however, hardly leaves defendants unprotected against unjust convictions. . . . Where the motivation of the complainant in bringing the charge is an issue, . . . the defense attorney is free to emphasize to the jury the dangers of falsification, and the judge should instruct the jury as to those dangers. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76aeef63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Special jury instructions.</i> Many American jurisdictions once required that the jury in every rape prosecution be given an instruction like the following (from Cal. Jury Instructions—Criminal No. 10.22 (3d ed. 1970)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aeef64-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A charge such as that made against the defendant in this case is one which is easily made and, once made, difficult to defend against, even if the person accused is innocent. Therefore, the law requires that you examine the testimony of the female person named in the information with caution.</p>
</div>
<p id="76aeef65-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instruction, based on the remarks of Sir Matthew Hale previously quoted in <i>Wiley</i>, p. 436 supra, has fallen into disfavor for essentially the same reasons that brought the corroboration requirement under attack. A similar MPC provision adopted in 1962 (see §213.6(5), Appendix) is likewise obsolete. See Deborah W. Denno, Why the Model Penal Code’s Sexual Offense Provisions Should Be Pulled and Replaced, 1 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 207 (2003).</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76aeef69-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[B]ecause it is all but impossible these days to argue successfully that no means yes, or that . . . stupidity as to consent should serve as a defense, men charged with rape . . . have few options but to argue the incredibility of the woman victim. And the argument has appeal, I think, because many people . . . remain ambivalent about the expansion of rape liability: unwilling to continue to afford men the privilege of aggression, but also chary with their sympathy for women who should know better.

<i>2. Abusive treatment of complainants.</i> Until the late 1970s, a common defense tactic in rape prosecutions was to support a claim of consent by offering evidence of the complainant’s “loose” reputation, provocative clothing, or prior sexual experiences; the theory was that such evidence tended to make the claim of consent more plausible. In the words of an infamous early decision, jurors allegedly would “more readily infer assent in the practised [<i>sic</i>] Messalina, in loose attire, than in the reserved and virtuous Lucretia.” People v. Abbot, 19 Wend. 192 (N.Y. 1838). Of course, the notion that a woman was <i>likely</i> to have consented to sex with a stranger, just because she was wearing “loose attire,” was far-fetched, even by the social standards of the nineteenth century. But the test for the admissibility of evidence does not require that the evidence make the legally crucial fact (such as consent) likely to be true. Instead, background circumstances like the complainant’s prior sexual experience are presumptively admissible, whenever the crucial fact (such as consent) is <i>more</i> likely to be true when those circumstances are present than when they are not. See p. 26 supra. By this standard, it was considered plausible that evidence of prior sexual activity might sometimes have at least <i>some</i> probative value: For example, if the complaining witness has previously consented to sexual intercourse with a stranger shortly after meeting him in a bar, that fact might make it a little bit more likely (compared to a situation in which she had never done so) that she consented to intercourse with this defendant shortly after meeting him in a bar.</p>
<p id="76aeef6b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a very slender increase in probabilities is technically sufficient to make evidence relevant, the most persuasive objection to admitting evidence of a complainant’s prior sexual history usually is that any slender probative value of this sort is outweighed by its prejudicial effects: First, such evidence can impair the truth-finding function at trial because its value may be <i>over</i>-estimated or because it may lead to confusion of the issues. Second, the very process of airing such evidence can be painful to the victim, aggravating the injury of the original offense and deterring other victims from seeking prosecution. Many rape victims reported feeling that they had been raped twice—first by their assailant and then a second time in the courtroom. See Vivian D. Berger, Man’s Trial, Woman’s Tribulation: Rape Cases in the Courtroom, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1977).</p>
<p id="76aeef6c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Shield laws.</i> Responding to such concerns, nearly all American jurisdictions have enacted “rape shield laws” to limit the admissibility of evidence bearing on a rape complainant’s prior sexual behavior. For discussion of these statutes, see Michelle J. Anderson, From Chastity Requirement to Sexuality License: Sexual Consent and a New Rape Shield Law, 70 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 51 (2002). Some of the statutes admit evidence of sexual history only when it involves prior incidents with the defendant. Others allow additional exceptions to the rule of exclusion. See Harriett R. Galvin, Shielding Rape Victims <span title="439" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-439">p. 439</span>in the State and Federal Courts: A Proposal for the Second Decade, 70 Minn. L. Rev. 763 (1986).</p>
<p id="76aeef6d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some observers believe that even the most restrictive statutes do not go far enough in excluding evidence of the complainant’s sexual history. For example, Dean Michelle J. Anderson criticizes the blanket exception (in virtually all rape shield statutes) for prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant. See Anderson, Diminishing the Legal Impact of Negative Social Attitudes Toward Acquaintance Rape Victims, 13 New Crim. L. Rev. 644, 659-662 (2010). But does the exclusion of such evidence interfere with the defendant’s right to a fair trial? Consider the cases that follow.</p>

<i>1. Constitutional concerns.</i> A number of courts have held restrictive rape shield statutes unconstitutional when they bar evidence of relevant sexual history, or have avoided the constitutional question by reading in a “catch-<span title="441" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-441">p. 441</span>all” exception for evidence needed to preserve the defendant’s right to a fair trial. E.g., Neeley v. Commonwealth, 437 S.E.2d 721 (Va. Ct. App. 1993).</p>

<i>2. The impact of shield laws.</i> Though rape shield statutes have proved more porous than reformers initially expected, they have nonetheless had a major impact on trial administration. Empirical studies uniformly report that victims are better treated in the judicial process and that efforts to limit the admissibility of sexual history evidence are often successful.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119C3_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N119C3_12a19b86-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">60</a></span>

<i>3. Problems. (a)</i> In Commonwealth v. Harris, 825 N.E.2d 58 (Mass. 2005), a rape defendant argued that the complainant had consented to an act of prostitution and then accused him of rape as retribution for his failure to pay her full fee. The defendant sought to impeach her testimony by offering evidence that she had a prior conviction for prostitution. The state’s rape shield statute bars “[e]vidence of specific instances of a victim’s sexual conduct” with persons other than the defendant. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 233, §21B. But another statute authorizes the admission of a witness’s prior conviction for purposes of impeaching the witness’s credibility. Id. §21. Which of the two conflicting rules should prevail? The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the statute permitting impeachment use of prior convictions controlled and that the evidence of the complainant’s sexual history was admissible. Apart from the question of statutory interpretation, what is the best way to handle this problem? Does the prejudicial impact of casting the complainant as a prostitute outweigh the possible relevance of her prior conviction? Or does excluding the evidence unfairly impede the defendant’s ability to present a possibly truthful defense?</p>
<p id="76af1690-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) </i>In Neeley v. Commonwealth, 437 S.E.2d 721 (Va. Ct. App. 1993), the complainant, a 14-year-old white female, alleged that defendant, a young African-American male, climbed through her bedroom window in the middle of the night and forcibly raped her. Defendant denied entering the house that evening. The prosecution introduced expert testimony that a hair fragment found in the complainant’s cervix, though not positively identifiable as defendant’s, was “characteristic of hair from a person of African-American descent.” The defendant offered to prove that shortly before the alleged rape, the complainant had had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend and that the boyfriend was also African American. A provision of the state’s rape shield law permitted the use of sexual history evidence when “offered to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence of the offense charged which is introduced by the prosecution, limited to evidence designed to explain the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease, or physical injury to the complaining witness’s intimate parts. . . . ” Because the defendant’s evidence was offered to explain the presence of a hair sample rather than semen, it did not meet the terms of this or any other statutory exception, and the trial court <span title="442" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-442">p. 442</span>excluded it. On appeal, should the ruling be upheld? Or, as applied to these facts, is the statutory exclusion unconstitutional?</p>
<p id="76af1691-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) </i>The defendant was charged with forcing his former girlfriend to have sex simultaneously with himself and one of his friends. He claimed consent, and in an effort to make the defense credible, he sought to introduce evidence that on previous occasions she had willingly engaged in sexual acts involving multiple partners. Is that evidence unduly prejudicial? Or would excluding it deny the defendant the opportunity for a fair trial on his defense of consent? See Gagne v. Booker, 606 F.3d 278 (6th Cir. 2010).</p>
<p id="76af1692-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Prior behavior of the defendant.</i> In Chapter 1, we considered the principle that evidence of a defendant’s prior misconduct is not admissible to prove a propensity to engage in similar conduct. And as we saw there, most jurisdictions apply the prior-misconduct rule just as strictly in rape trials as in other kinds of prosecutions. See pp. 34-35, Note 3 supra.</p>
<p id="76af1693-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the willingness of courts to admit evidence of some prior sexual acts by a rape complainant inconsistent with the rule that precludes reference to prior misconduct by the defendant? In one highly publicized prosecution, William Kennedy Smith was charged with committing a sexual assault upon a woman who had accompanied him back to his family’s vacation home, after drinking and dancing with him at a bar. The case turned on the credibility of the woman’s testimony that Smith ignored her protests and forced her to submit. Prior to trial, three other women came forward to allege that Smith had sexually assaulted them. The trial judge excluded this evidence, and Smith was acquitted. See N.Y. Times, Dec. 13, 1992, at B14. Was the ruling correct? If not, should the judge admit evidence of the prior sexual conduct of <i>both</i> Smith and his accuser? Consider Susan Estrich, Teaching Rape Law, 102 Yale L.J. 509, 519 (1992):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76af1694-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One [approach] is to say that we need symmetry: exclude all the evidence about both of them. That’s the approach the judge followed in the William Kennedy Smith case. On the surface, it is neat and appealing. The only problem is that it’s a false symmetry. . . . [E]vidence that a man has abused other women is much more probative of rape than evidence that a woman has had consensual sex with other men is probative of consent. [T]he mere fact that a woman has had lovers tells us almost nothing about whether she consented on the particular occasion that she is charging as rape. But won’t we all look at a defendant differently if three other women have also come forward to say they were abused? The danger with such evidence is not that it proves so little, but that it may prove too much. Symmetry won’t get you out of this hole. . . .

The finding that Michigan conviction rates (as a percentage of indictments) remained constant can nonetheless be viewed as a modest victory for the reform effort: Reporting rates had increased somewhat, more cases were coming into the system, and more were being indicted. The constant rate of conviction as a percentage of indictments suggests the possibility that the new law facilitated conviction in gray-area cases that might not have been prosecuted before.
