INTRODUCTION: THE CONCEPTS OF JUSTIFICATION AND EXCUSE</p></h2></div>


<p id="76f965d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three distinct sorts of defenses can be invoked to bar conviction for an alleged crime. The first asserts that the prosecution has failed to establish one or more required elements of the offense. The defendant may, for example, deny that he was anywhere near the scene of the crime, or he may concede that he fired the fatal shot but deny that he acted intentionally. We have considered defenses of this sort throughout the first seven chapters of this book. They are simply efforts to refute (or raise a reasonable doubt about) whatever the prosecution must prove. Of course, the prosecution always retains the burden of proving its own case—and disproving any such rebuttal efforts—beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p id="76f965d3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present chapter deals with two groups of defenses that have a different character. Justifications and excuses do not seek to refute any required element of the prosecution’s case; rather they suggest considerations that negate liability even when all elements of the offense are present. For example, claims of self-defense and insanity offer reasons to bar conviction even when the defendant undoubtedly killed someone intentionally. It is customary, moreover, to distinguish sharply between justifications and excuses. Self-defense, for example, is traditionally considered a justification, while insanity is considered an excuse. Pragmatists sometimes argue that this distinction is not important—whether labeled a justification or an excuse, the defense, once proved, requires acquittal.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1002E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1002E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> But as J.L. Austin explains in the excerpt below, the distinction is essential for clear thinking because it points to a fundamental difference in the reasons <i>why</i> culpability is lacking.</p>

To take this line is to <i>justify</i> the action, to give reasons for doing it. . . . 
</p><p id="76f965d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different way of going about it is to admit that it wasn’t a good thing to have done, but to argue that it is not quite fair or correct to say <i>baldly</i> “<i>X</i> did <i>A.</i>” We may say it isn’t fair just to say <i>X</i> did it; perhaps he was under somebody’s influence, or was nudged. Or, it isn’t fair to say baldly he <i>did A</i>; it may have been partly accidental or an unintentional slip. Or, it isn’t fair to say he did simply <i>A</i>—he was really doing something quite different and <i>A</i> was only incidental, or he was looking at the whole thing quite differently.

[W]hen we plead, say, provocation, there is genuine uncertainty or ambiguity as to what we mean—is <i>he</i> partly responsible, because he roused a violent impulse or passion in me, so that it wasn’t truly or merely me acting “of my own accord” (excuse)? Or is it rather that, he having done me such injury, I was entitled to retaliate (justification)? . . . But that the defences I have for convenience labelled “justification” and “excuse” are in principle distinct can scarcely be doubted.</p></div>

<span class="epub-small-caps">ROBINSON, J</span>. . . . Self-defense, as a doctrine legally exonerating the taking of human life, is as viable now as it was in Blackstone’s time. . . . But “[t]he law of self-defense is a law of necessity”; the right of self-defense arises only when the necessity begins, and equally ends with the necessity; and never must the necessity be greater than when the force employed defensively is deadly. The “necessity must bear all semblance of reality, and appear to admit of <span title="871" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-871">p. 871</span>no other alternative, before taking life will be justifiable as excusable.” Hinged on the exigencies of self-preservation, the doctrine of homicidal self-defense emerges from the body of the criminal law as a limited though important exception to legal outlawry of the arena of self-help in the settlement of potentially fatal personal conflicts.</p><p id="76f98cf5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So it is that necessity is the pervasive theme of the well-defined conditions which the law imposes on the right to kill or maim in self-defense. There must have been a threat, actual or apparent, of the use of deadly force against the defender. The threat must have been unlawful and immediate. The defender must have believed that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself therefrom. These beliefs must not only have been honestly entertained, but also objectively reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. It is clear that no less than a concurrence of these elements will suffice.</p></div>

<p id="76f98cf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the use of defensive force against an aggressor is necessary to protect the actor from serious bodily harm, that action is <i>justified—</i>because it was the right thing to do. But the <i>Peterson</i> court, stating the widely accepted view, does not require that the use of force be <i>truly</i> necessary; self-defense is available when the actor <i>reasonably believes</i> defensive force to be necessary. Yet if the actor’s reasonable belief turns out to be mistaken, her use of force arguably was <i>not</i> the right thing to do; it therefore might be more precise to say that her action is not justified but merely <i>excused</i>—because her mistake was reasonable. From this perspective, we might say that self-defense can be <i>either</i> a justification or an excuse, depending on whether the actor’s reasonable belief is well founded. Nonetheless, courts and commentators conventionally refer to self-defense in both settings as a justification, and we follow that somewhat oversimplified convention in the organization of this book. Of course, regardless of the label used (justification or excuse), a defendant who meets the <i>Peterson</i> requirements is entitled to an acquittal.</p>

</p><p id="76f9b410-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded an IRT express subway train in The Bronx and headed south toward lower Manhattan. The four youths rode together in the rear portion of the seventh car of the train. Two of the four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their coats, which they said were to be used to break into the coin boxes of video machines.</p><p id="76f9b411-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train at 14th Street in Manhattan and sat down on a bench towards the rear section of the same car occupied by the four youths. Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber pistol loaded with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband holster. The train left the 14th Street station and headed towards Chambers Street.</p><p id="76f9b412-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him, and stated “give me five dollars.”

Goetz responded by standing up, pulling out his handgun and firing four shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ramseur’s arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired at Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of the car, but missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the conductor’s cab. After Goetz briefly surveyed the scene around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then was sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet entered the rear of Cabey’s side and severed his spinal cord.</p><p id="76f9b414-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All but two of the other passengers fled the car when, or immediately after, the shots were fired. The conductor, who had been in the next car, heard the shots and instructed the motorman to radio for emergency assistance. The conductor then went into the car where the shooting occurred and saw Goetz sitting on a bench, the injured youths lying on the floor or slumped against a seat, and two women who had apparently taken cover, also lying on the floor. Goetz told the conductor that the four youths had tried to rob him.</p><p id="76f9b415-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the conductor was aiding the youths, Goetz headed towards the front of the car.

In the statements . . . Goetz admitted that he had been illegally carrying a handgun in New York City for three years. He stated that he had first purchased a gun in 1981 after he had been injured in a mugging. Goetz also revealed that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had successfully warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.</p><p id="76f9b418-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Goetz’s statement, the first contact he had with the four youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the bench across from him, asked “how are you,” to which he replied “fine.” Shortly thereafter, Canty, followed by one of the other youths, walked over to the defendant and stood to his left, while the other two youths remained to his right, in the corner of the subway car. Canty then said “give me five dollars.” Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on Canty’s face that they wanted to “play with me.” Although he was certain that none of the youths had a gun, he had a fear, based on prior experiences, of being “maimed.”</p><p id="76f9b419-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Goetz then established “a pattern of fire,” deciding specifically to fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point was to “murder [the four youths], to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible.” When Canty again requested money, Goetz stood up, drew his weapon, and began firing, aiming for the center of the body of each of the four. Goetz recalled that the first two he shot “tried to run through the crowd [but] they had nowhere to run.” Goetz then turned to his right to “go after the other two.” One of these two “tried to run through the wall of the train, but . . . he had nowhere to go.” The other youth (Cabey) “tried pretending that he wasn’t with [the others]” by standing still, holding on to one of the subway hand straps, and not looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless fired his fourth shot at him. He then ran back to the first two youths to make sure they had been “taken care of.” Seeing that they had both been shot, he spun back to check on the latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had been standing still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As Goetz told the police, “I said ‘[y]ou seem to be all right, here’s another,’” and he then fired the shot which severed Cabey’s spinal cord. Goetz added that “if I was a little more under self-control . . .  I would have put the barrel against his forehead and fired.” He also admitted that “if I had had more [bullets], I would have shot them again, and again, and again.” . . . 
</p><p id="76f9b41a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification, which “permits the use of force under certain circumstances.” One such set of circumstances pertains to the use of force in defense of a person, encompassing both self-defense and defense of a third person. Penal Law §35.15 (1) sets forth the general principles governing all such uses of force: “[a] person may . . . use physical force upon another person when and to the extent he <i>reasonably believes</i> such to be necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he <i>reasonably believes</i> to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person” (emphasis added).</p><p id="76f9db2b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="874" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-874">p. 874</span>Section 35.15 (2) sets forth further limitations on these general principles with respect to the use of “deadly physical force”: “A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person under circumstances specified in subdivision one unless (a) He <i>reasonably believes</i> that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force . . . or (b) He <i>reasonably believes</i> that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery” (emphasis added). . . . 
</p><p id="76f9db2c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the evidence before the [Grand Jury] included statements by Goetz that he acted to protect himself from being maimed or to avert a robbery, the prosecutor correctly chose to charge the justification defense in section 35.15 to the Grand Jury . . . essentially by reading or paraphrasing the language in Penal Law §35.15. The defense does not contend that he committed any error in this portion of the charge.</p><p id="76f9db2d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of the grand jurors asked for clarification of the term “reasonably believes.” The prosecutor responded by instructing the grand jurors that they were to consider the circumstances of the incident and determine “whether the defendant’s conduct was that of a reasonable man in the defendant’s situation.” It is this response by the prosecutor—and specifically his use of “a reasonable man”—which is the basis for the dismissal of the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly in the Appellate Division’s plurality opinion, because section 35.15 uses the term “<i>he</i> reasonably believes,” the appropriate test, according to that court, is whether a defendant’s beliefs and reactions were “reasonable to <i>him.</i>” Under that reading of the statute, a jury which believed a defendant’s testimony that he felt that his own actions were warranted and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless of what anyone else in defendant’s situation might have concluded. Such an interpretation defies the ordinary meaning and significance of the term “reasonably” in a statute, and misconstrues the clear intent of the Legislature, in enacting section 35.15, to retain an objective element as part of any provision authorizing the use of deadly physical force. . . . 
</p><p id="76f9db2e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1961 the Legislature established a Commission to undertake a complete revision of the Penal Law. . . . The impetus for the decision to update the Penal Law came in part from the drafting of the Model Penal Code. . . . While using the Model Penal Code provisions on justification as general guidelines . . . the drafters of the new Penal Law did not simply adopt them verbatim.</p><p id="76f9db2f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The provisions of the Model Penal Code with respect to the use of deadly force in self-defense reflect the position of its drafters that any culpability which arises from a mistaken belief in the need to use such force should be no greater than the culpability such a mistake would give rise to if it were made with respect to an element of a crime. Accordingly, under Model Penal Code §3.04(2)(b), a defendant charged with murder (or attempted murder) need only show that he “<i>believe[d]</i> that [the use of deadly force] was necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or [forcible] sexual intercourse” to prevail on a self-defense claim (emphasis added). If the defendant’s belief was wrong, and was recklessly, or negligently formed, <span title="875" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-875">p. 875</span>however, he may be convicted of the type of homicide charge requiring only a reckless or negligent, as the case may be, criminal intent (see, Model Penal Code §3.09 . . . ).</p><p id="76f9db30-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York did not follow the Model Penal Code’s equation of a mistake as to the need to use deadly force with a mistake negating an element of a crime, choosing instead to use a single statutory section which would provide either a complete defense or no defense at all to a defendant charged with any crime involving the use of deadly force. The drafters of the new Penal Law adopted in large part the structure and content of Model Penal Code §3.04, but, crucially, inserted the word “reasonably” before “believes.” . . . Had the drafters of section 35.15 wanted to adopt a subjective standard, they could have simply used the language of section 3.04. “Believes” by itself requires an honest or genuine belief by a defendant as to the need to use deadly force. Interpreting the statute to require only that the defendant’s belief was “reasonable to <i>him</i>,” as done by the plurality below, would hardly be different from requiring only a genuine belief; in either case, the defendant’s own perceptions could completely exonerate him from any criminal liability.</p><p id="76f9db31-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot lightly impute to the Legislature an intent to fundamentally alter the principles of justification to allow the perpetrator of a serious crime to go free simply because that person believed his actions were reasonable and necessary to prevent some perceived harm. To completely exonerate such an individual, no matter how aberrational or bizarre his thought patterns, would allow citizens to set their own standards for the permissible use of force. . . . We can only conclude that the Legislature retained a reasonableness requirement to avoid giving license for such actions. . . . 
</p><p id="76f9db32-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective element will preclude a jury from considering factors such as the prior experiences of a given actor and thus, require it to make a determination of “reasonableness” without regard to the actual circumstances of a particular incident. This argument, however, falsely presupposes that an objective standard means that the background and other relevant characteristics of a particular actor must be ignored. To the contrary, we have frequently noted that a determination of reasonableness must be based on the “circumstances” facing a defendant or his “situation.” Such terms encompass more than the physical movements of the potential assailant. [T]hese terms include any relevant knowledge the defendant had about that person. They also necessarily bring in the physical attributes of all persons involved, including the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant’s circumstances encompass any prior experiences he had which could provide a reasonable basis for a belief that another person’s intentions were to injure or rob him or that the use of deadly force was necessary under the circumstances. . . . The prosecutor’s instruction . . . was thus essentially an accurate charge. . . . 
</p><p id="76f9db33-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, . . . the dismissed counts of the indictment [are] reinstated.</p></div>

</div><p id="76fa024c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The acquittal of Mr. Goetz on charges of attempted murder broke no dramatic new legal ground, in the opinion of legal experts. But in the context of the national debate on the balance between self-defense and social order, it appeared to widen the circumstances that justify the use of deadly force. . . . 
</p><p id="76fa024d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was almost no evidence presented that any of the four youths who approached Mr. Goetz had actually tried to rob him before he shot them. Thus the jury, by rejecting the charge of attempted murder, seemed to be saying that in the nervousness that courses through much of urban experience, from riding the subway at night to walking a darkened street, such evidence may not matter all that much. Perceptions, the jury suggested, can attain the power of facts.</p><p id="76fa024e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The jury decided that no man is reasonable when he’s surrounded by four thugs,” said Alan Dershowitz, professor of law at Harvard Law School. “It’s hard to pay attention to lines drawn by academics in a classroom.”</p><p id="76fa024f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mr. Dershowitz, noting that jurors often nullify self-defense standards set by the law, said he believed that what Mr. Goetz did was by definition illegal in New York State and every other state. It is illegal, he said, to shoot a person after the immediate danger has passed. “It doesn’t change the law,” he said of the verdict. “It may show the law is somewhat out of line with people’s passions today.”</p><p id="76fa0250-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury’s decision also seemed to be a back-handed commentary on the effectiveness of the police and the courts. Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School, said, “The jurors had so little faith in the criminal justice system, both to protect us and to bring the guilty to justice, <span title="877" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-877">p. 877</span>that they were willing to tolerate a degree of vigilante behavior that I think rationally cannot be justified.” . . . 
</p><p id="76fa0251-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Crime has become such a daily feature of urban life that several of the jurors had themselves been victims. It is often on people’s minds, determining where they live, how and when they travel, and how they spend their time.</p><p id="76fa0252-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury seemed to be saying that the fear of crime, in someone who has been a previous mugging victim like Mr. Goetz, can weigh so heavily on one’s emotions that it can lead to conduct that might normally be considered wrongful. The jury in the Goetz case apparently believed there was not enough evidence to show that Mr. Goetz acted out of any motive other than fear. . . . 
</p><p id="76fa0253-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Underlying the issue of crime in this case was the issue of race. Scholars such as Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, professor emeritus of psychology at the City University of New York, have expressed doubt that Mr. Goetz would have shot four white youths asking him for money.</p><p id="76fa0254-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, Marvin E. Wolfgang, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that perceptions about who is more likely to commit a crime have some statistical basis. The rates of crime for four violent offenses—homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault—are at least ten times as high for blacks as they are for whites, he said. “The expectation that four young black males are going to do you harm is indeed greater than four young whites,” he said. “I can understand the black position that this is a racist attitude, but it’s not unrealistic.”</p><p id="76fa0255-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is possible that jurors have absorbed such racially based perceptions about who is going to commit a crime. Elijah Anderson, a black sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who spent three years studying street-corner life in a tough, black neighborhood in Philadelphia, said law-abiding people, black and white, have a distinctive way of relating “to people they assume to be members of the black underclass.” People, he said, “can be very intimidated by young black males or people who seem to represent this so-called underclass by their dress or comportment, very intimidated.” . . . 
</p><p id="76fa0256-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because it raises such issues, the jury verdict may pose some hard questions for the American public to deal with. Will some New Yorkers come to feel that they can now make hair-trigger assumptions about the character of people who somehow threaten them, and if they have a gun, use it in self-defense? Will blacks have to fear that if they look at someone the wrong way or dress too casually they may be mistaken for criminals? . . .

The elderly women left alone in the car are . . . aging, they are women, they are white. . . . And because in society’s eyes they are the archetypal victims, were they to shoot and to testify to their fear, their story would be readily believed; the tale told by their tormenters would surely be doubted. . . .

<i>1. Trayvon Martin.</i> In February 2012, a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, was visiting his father in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Walking back from a convenience store one evening, Martin, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, attracted the attention of George Zimmerman, a volunteer with a neighborhood watch program. Zimmerman thought that Martin looked suspicious and called the Sanford Police Department to report his concerns. The dispatcher told Zimmerman not to follow the teenager, but Zimmerman did so anyway and ultimately confronted Martin. What happened next was hotly disputed, but witnesses largely agreed that an altercation ensued, then gun fire. Martin, who was unarmed, had been killed by a single shot to the chest. Zimmerman had suffered some head injuries; he told police that he and Martin got into a fight and that he shot Martin in self-defense. After an initial police decision not to press charges and a subsequent national uproar, Zimmerman was prosecuted for second-degree murder but was acquitted by the jury.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1029D_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1029D_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span> The U.S. Department of Justice considered charging Zimmerman with a federal <span title="879" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-879">p. 879</span>civil-rights offense but eventually decided not to prosecute, citing “insufficient evidence.”

<i>3. Solutions?</i> If race-based generalizations affect, consciously or unconsciously, the threat assessments of citizens on the street or jurors at trial, what corrective measures are appropriate—and feasible? Professor Armour, supra, suggests that “race-based evidence of reasonableness impairs the capacity of jurors to rationally and fairly strike a balance between the costs of waiting (increased risk for the person who perceives imminent attack) and the costs of not waiting (injury or death to the immediate victim, exclusion of blacks from core community activities, and, ultimately, reduction of individuals to predictable objects)”; accordingly, such evidence “should arguably be excluded under the ‘more prejudicial than probative’ standard of most states’ evidence codes.” As a practical matter, an effort to screen out racial references during testimony at trial poses formidable challenges.

<p id="76fa9ebd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Deadly force” plays a crucial role on both sides of the self-defense equation, because a defender can <i>use</i> deadly force in response to a <i>threat</i> of deadly force. But in the law, the two concepts are not identical.</p>

<i>1. When does the force used for self-defense qualify as “deadly” force?</i> Goetz obviously did, even though he did not kill any of his victims, because he shot directly at them, “aiming for the center of the body of each.” Could a person in Goetz’s position avoid the limits on using deadly force by aiming for the feet of his attackers? If a person had defended himself in that way, would he (should he) be able to claim that he had not used <i>deadly</i> force? Under current law, that move would not work because a person is deemed to use deadly force whenever he or she knowingly creates a substantial risk of inflicting great bodily harm, and shooting in the direction of another person always qualifies as a use of deadly force. See MPC §3.11(2). See also Hosnedl v. State, 126 So. 3d 400, 404 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013): “[F]iring a firearm in the air, even as a so-called ‘warning shot,’ constitutes as a matter of law the use of deadly force . . . whenever it is fired in the vicinity of human beings . . . even if not aimed at anyone.” Force of this sort is therefore unjustified unless the person attacked can show that he or she faced a threat of force that was not only unlawful but exceptionally serious, a requirement that the next note explains.</p>
<p id="76fa9ebf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Which threats are “deadly”?</i> Goetz said he was “certain that none of the youths had a gun” but was afraid of being “maimed.” If reasonable, is such a fear sufficient to justify the use of deadly force in response? The general rule is that any threat to inflict great bodily harm (such as a threat to maim) qualifies, even if the harm might not be life-threatening. The New York formula, quoted in <i>Goetz</i>, also includes “kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible sodomy or robbery.” Under the MPC, threats of kidnapping and rape are likewise included (§3.04(2)(b)), but the Code addresses the use of force to prevent robbery as a defense of <i>property</i> rather than <i>self</i>-defense, and in that setting it imposes stricter limits on the use of deadly force. See §3.06(3)(d). We examine defense of property in the materials beginning at p. 930 infra.</p>

<i>1. A subjective test?</i> The prevailing American rule is that a self-defense claim can succeed only when the defendant’s fear and use of defensive force were both reasonable. But if a defendant perceives that he faces a threat of imminent death or great bodily harm, is it reasonable to require a “reasonable” response? Consider Justice Holmes’s oft-quoted epigram: “Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.” Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343 (1921). Professor Glanville Williams (quoted in Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §3.09 at 152, n.10 (1985)) advanced the following argument in support of a wholly subjective test:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76fa9ec3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal law of negligence works best when it gives effect to the large number of rules of prudence which are commonly observed though not directly incorporated into the law. Such rules include the rule against pulling out on a blind corner, . . . the rule against deliberately pointing a gun at another <span title="883" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-883">p. 883</span>person, even in play, and so on. These rules are not part either of enacted or of common law, but as customary standards of behavior they become binding via the law of negligence. Are there any similar rules of behavior applicable when a person acts in self-defense or in making an arrest? It must be recollected that the injury he inflicts on the other is in itself intentional, so that the usual rules of prudence in respect to the handling of weapons are not in question. The only question is whether the defendant was negligent in arriving at the conclusion that the use of the force in question was called for. It is hard to imagine what rules of prudence could normally serve in this situation. Either the defendant is capable of drawing the inferences that a reasonable man would draw or he is not. If he is not, and he is a peace officer, his tendency to make miscalculations would certainly justify his dismissal from the police force. But there is no obvious case for the intervention of the criminal courts.</p>

<i>2. Qualifications to the objective test.</i> As in other instances in which the law employs an objective standard, there is always the question of just how objective the standard is to be—that is, which features of the defendant’s particular situation should be taken into account in determining whether the choice of defensive force was reasonable? Compare the discussion of the reasonable-provocation standard, p. 485 supra, and the discussion of the definition of negligence, pp. 499-509 supra. Recall the MPC standard (§2.02), calling for a judgment whether the defendant’s conduct “involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe <i>in the actor’s situation.</i>” (Italics added.) Thus, the MPC partially individualizes the objective standard. Likewise, “a majority of jurisdictions adopt some form of ‘hybrid’ standard: the jury must judge the defendant by the standards of the reasonable person . . . in the ‘situation.’” Victoria Nourse, After the Reasonable Man: Getting over the Subjectivity/Objectivity Question, 11 New Crim.

<i>3. Specifying the actor’s situation.</i> Which features of a defendant’s background, experiences, and personality should be taken into account in determining whether his assessment of a threat and his response to it were “reasonable”? The MPC solution is to have courts (and presumably juries) determine in each case, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, what circumstances count as part of the defendant’s “situation.” See p. 507, Note 4 supra. Is this the right way to bring community intuitions of justice into the calculus, or does it open the door to political, racial, and cultural bias? See Michael Vitiello, Defining the Reasonable Person in the Criminal Law: Fighting the Lernaean Hydra, 14 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 1435 (2010). Consider the following issues:</p>

<i>(b)</i> People v. Romero, 69 Cal. App. 4th 846, 848 (1999), involved a heated street confrontation in which the defendant stabbed and killed a person who may have endangered his younger brother. At his trial for murder, he sought to introduce expert testimony concerning “the role of honor, paternalism, and street fighters in the Hispanic culture,” in order to support his claims that he believed he was in imminent danger of great bodily harm and that his belief was objectively reasonable. The trial judge ruled the evidence inadmissible on the ground that it was irrelevant to both claims, and the defendant was convicted of second-degree murder. The appellate court affirmed. Do you agree? Why isn’t the culture that shapes the defendant’s perceptions relevant to his “situation”? For detailed assessment of the role of culture in determinations of reasonableness in this context, see Eugene R. Milhizer, Group Status and Criminal Defenses, 71 Mo. L. Rev. 547 (2006).</p>

<i>4. A grading problem.</i> Where reasonableness is required for total exculpation, how should the law deal with a person who holds an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to use lethal force? Assume such a person kills because she genuinely believes it is the only way to save her life, but she comes to her conclusion on grossly unreasonable grounds. She has killed intentionally and, under the prevailing objective test, she has no defense of self-defense. Thus, she would be guilty of murder, just like the person who kills for revenge or gain. This appears to be the generally prevailing view.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10455_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10455_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span> But <span title="886" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-886">p. 886</span>several states avoid this result through various doctrines of mitigation. One, known as the doctrine of “imperfect self-defense,” classifies the crime as voluntary manslaughter, on the theory that “malice” is lacking and that the lesser culpability in a killing of this sort is similar to that in a killing in a heat of passion.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1045F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1045F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span> The other approach, even less common, is to classify the killing as involuntary manslaughter.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10467_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10467_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">7</a></span> A problem for this theory is that involuntary manslaughter presupposes an unintentional killing, while a killing in self-defense is ordinarily intentional. The justification, nonetheless, is that the actor’s culpability most closely approximates that of a person whose criminal negligence causes an unintentional death.</p>
<p id="76faebf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC is similar to this last approach: A person who kills in the honest but unreasonable belief in the need to kill would be guilty of negligent homicide. The Code achieves this result through the interaction of two distinct requirements. First, in the various justification provisions, the Code states that the justification is available whenever the actor herself subjectively believes that the necessary circumstances are present. See, e.g., §3.04(1), stating that the use of force for self-protection “is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary. . . . ” Second, to deal with situations involving mistaken beliefs, the Code provides in §3.09(2):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76faebf9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the actor believes that the use of force upon or toward the person of another is necessary for any of the purposes for which such belief would establish a justification under §§3.03 to 3.08 but the actor is reckless or negligent in having such belief or acquiring or failing to acquire any knowledge or belief which is material to the justifiability of his use of force, the justification afforded by those Sections is unavailable in a prosecution for an offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.</p>

</p>
<p id="76faec01-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ms. Kelly was indicted for murder. At trial, she did not deny stabbing her husband, but asserted that her action was in self-defense. To establish the requisite state of mind for her self-defense claim, Ms. Kelly called Dr. Lois Veronen as an expert witness to testify about the battered-woman’s syndrome. After hearing a lengthy voir dire examination of Dr. Veronen, the trial court ruled that expert testimony concerning the syndrome was inadmissible on the self-defense issue. . . . Ms. Kelly was convicted of reckless manslaughter. [We] reverse.</p>
<p id="76faec02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Kellys had a stormy marriage. Some of the details of their relationship, especially the stabbing, are disputed. The following is Ms. Kelly’s version of what happened—a version that the jury could have accepted and, if they had, a version that would make the proffered expert testimony not only relevant, but critical.</p>
<p id="76faec03-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The day after the marriage, Mr. Kelly got drunk and knocked Ms. Kelly down. Although a period of calm followed the initial attack, the next seven years were accompanied by periodic and frequent beatings, sometimes as often as once a week. During the attacks, which generally occurred when Mr. Kelly was drunk, he threatened to kill Ms. Kelly and to cut off parts of her body if she tried to leave him. Mr. Kelly often moved out of the house after an attack, later returning with a promise that he would change his ways. Until the day of the homicide, only one of the attacks had taken place in public.</p>
<p id="76fb1314-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The day [of] the stabbing, [Ernest] left for work. Ms. Kelly next saw her husband late that afternoon at a friend’s house. She had gone there with her daughter, Annette, to ask Ernest for money to buy food. He told her to wait until they got home, and shortly thereafter the Kellys left. After walking past several houses, Mr. Kelly, who was drunk, angrily asked “What the hell did you come around here for?” He then grabbed the collar of her dress, and the two fell to the ground. He choked her by pushing his fingers against her throat, punched or hit her face, and bit her leg.</p>
<p id="76fb1315-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A crowd gathered on the street. Two men from the crowd separated them, just as Gladys felt that she was “passing out” from being choked. Fearing that Annette had been pushed around in the crowd, Gladys then left to look for her. . . .

<p id="76fb1316-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After finding her daughter, Ms. Kelly then observed Mr. Kelly running toward her with his hands raised. Within seconds he was right next to her. Unsure of whether he had armed himself while she was looking for their daughter, and thinking that he had come back to kill her, she grabbed a pair of scissors from her pocketbook. She tried to scare him away, but instead stabbed him.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104D3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N104D3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span>

That testimony was intended to explain defendant’s state of mind and bolster her claim of self-defense. We shall first examine the nature of the battered-woman’s syndrome and then consider the expert testimony proffered in this case and its relevance. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fb1319-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the problem of battered women has begun to receive more attention, sociologists and psychologists have begun to focus on the effects a sustained pattern of physical and psychological abuse can have on a woman. The effects of such abuse are what some scientific observers have termed “the battered-woman’s syndrome,” a series of common characteristics that appear in women who are abused physically and psychologically over an extended period of time by the dominant male figure in their lives. Dr. Lenore Walker, a prominent writer on the battered-woman’s syndrome, defines the battered woman as one</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76fb131a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">who is repeatedly subjected to any forceful physical or psychological behavior by a man in order to coerce her to do something he wants her to do without concern for her rights. Battered women include wives or women in any form of intimate relationships with men. Furthermore, in order to be classified as a battered woman, the couple must go through the battering cycle at least twice. Any woman may find herself in an abusive relationship with a man once. If it occurs a second time, and she remains in the situation, she is defined as a battered woman.</p>
</div>
<p id="76fb131b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">[L. Walker, The Battered Woman (1979) at xv.]</p>
<p id="76fb131c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">According to Dr. Walker, relationships characterized by physical abuse tend to develop battering cycles. Violent behavior directed at the woman occurs in three distinct and repetitive stages that vary both in duration and intensity depending on the individuals involved. [As summarized by the court, the expert testimony maintained that phase one of the battering cycle, the “tension-building stage,” involves minor battering incidents and verbal abuse during which the woman, beset by fear, attempts to be placating in order to stave off more serious violence. Phase two involves an “acute battering incident” typically triggered by an event in the life of the battering male, although the testimony also suggested that provocation for more severe violence is sometimes provided by the woman, who can no longer control her phase-one anger and anxiety. Phase three of the cycle is characterized by extreme contrition and loving behavior on the part of the battering male, who will often mix pleas for forgiveness with promises to stop drinking and seek professional help. Dr. Walker testified that for some couples, this period of relative calm may last as long as several months, but that the contrition of the man will eventually fade and phase one of the cycle will start anew.]</p>
<p id="76fb131d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="889" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-889">p. 889</span>The cyclical nature of battering behavior helps explain why more women simply do not leave their abusers. The loving behavior demonstrated . . . during phase three reinforces whatever hopes these women might have for their mate’s reform and keeps them bound to the relationship. Some women may even perceive the battering cycle as normal, especially if they grew up in a violent household. . . . Other women, however, become so demoralized and degraded by the fact that they cannot predict or control the violence that they sink into a state of psychological paralysis and become unable to take any action at all to improve or alter the situation. There is a tendency in battered women to believe in the omnipotence or strength of their battering husbands and thus to feel that any attempt to resist them is hopeless.</p>
<p id="76fb131e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition . . . , [lack of material and social resources] often make[s] it difficult for some women to extricate themselves from battering relationships. [T]here may be no place [for them] to go. Moreover, the stigma that attaches to a woman who leaves the family unit without her children undoubtedly acts as a further deterrent to moving out. [B]attered women, when they want to leave the relationship, are typically unwilling to reach out and confide in their friends, family, or the police, either out of shame and humiliation, fear of reprisal by their husband, or the feeling they will not be believed.</p>
<p id="76fb131f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Walker and other commentators have identified several common personality traits of the battered woman: low self-esteem, traditional beliefs about the home, the family, and the female sex role, tremendous feelings of guilt that their marriages are failing, and the tendency to accept responsibility for the batterer’s actions.</p>
<p id="76fb1320-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, battered women are often hesitant to leave a battering relationship because . . . they harbor a deep concern about the possible response leaving might provoke in their mates. They literally become trapped by their own fear. Case histories are replete with instances in which a battered wife left her husband only to have him pursue her and subject her to an even more brutal attack.</p>
<p id="76fb1321-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The combination of all these symptoms—resulting from sustained psychological and physical trauma compounded by aggravating social and economic factors—constitutes the battered-woman’s syndrome. Only by understanding these unique pressures that force battered women to remain with their mates, despite their long-standing and reasonable fear of severe bodily harm and the isolation that being a battered woman creates, can a battered woman’s state of mind be accurately and fairly understood.</p>
<p id="76fb1322-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The voir dire testimony of Dr. Veronen, sought to be introduced by defendant Gladys Kelly, conformed essentially to this outline of the battered-woman’s syndrome. . . . In addition, Dr. Veronen was prepared to testify as to how, as a battered woman, Gladys Kelly perceived her situation . . . , and why, in her opinion, defendant did not leave her husband despite the constant beatings she endured.</p>
<p id="76fb3a33-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether expert testimony on the battered-woman’s syndrome should be admitted in this case depends on whether it is relevant to defendant’s claim of self-defense. . . . The use of force against another in self-defense is justifiable <span title="890" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-890">p. 890</span>“when the actor reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.” N.J.S.A. 2C:3-4(a).

</div>
<p id="76fb3a35-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Gladys Kelly claims that she stabbed her husband in self-defense, believing he was about to kill her. The gist of the State’s case was that Gladys Kelly was the aggressor, that she consciously intended to kill her husband, and that she certainly was not acting in self-defense.</p>
<p id="76fb3a36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The credibility of Gladys Kelly is a critical issue in this case. If the jury does not believe Gladys Kelly’s account, it cannot find she acted in self-defense. The expert testimony offered was directly relevant to one of the critical elements of that account, namely, what Gladys Kelly believed at the time of the stabbing, and was thus material to establish the honesty of her stated belief that she was in imminent danger of death. . . . Specifically, by showing that her experience, although concededly difficult to comprehend, was common to that of other women who had been in similarly abusive relationships, Dr. Veronen would have helped the jury understand that Gladys Kelly could have honestly feared that she would suffer serious bodily harm from her husband’s attacks, yet still remain with him. . . . On the facts of this case, we find that the expert testimony . . . was admissible to show she <i>honestly</i> believed she was in imminent danger of death. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fb3a37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We also find the expert testimony relevant to the reasonableness of defendant’s belief that she was in imminent danger of death or serious injury. We do not mean that the expert’s testimony could be used to show that it was understandable that a battered woman might believe that her life was in danger when indeed it was not and when a reasonable person would not have so believed. . . . Expert testimony in that direction would be relevant solely to the honesty of defendant’s belief, not its objective reasonableness. Rather, our conclusion is that the expert’s testimony, if accepted by the jury, would have aided it in determining whether, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed there was imminent danger to her life.</p>
<p id="76fb3a38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the heart of the claim of self-defense was defendant’s story that she had been repeatedly subjected to “beatings” over the course of her marriage. . . .  When that regular pattern of serious physical abuse is combined with defendant’s claim that the decedent sometimes threatened to kill her, defendant’s statement that on this occasion she thought she might be killed when she saw Mr. Kelly running toward her could be found to reflect a reasonable fear; that is, it could so be found if the jury believed Gladys Kelly’s story. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fb3a39-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crucial issue of fact on which this expert’s testimony would bear is why, given such allegedly severe and constant beatings, combined with threats to kill, defendant had not long ago left decedent. Whether raised by the prosecutor as a factual issue or not, our own common knowledge tells us that most <span title="891" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-891">p. 891</span>of us, including the ordinary juror, would ask himself or herself just such a question. [O]ne of the common myths, apparently believed by most people, is that battered wives are free to leave. To some, this misconception is followed by the observation that the battered wife is masochistic, proven by her refusal to leave despite the severe beatings; to others, however, the fact that the battered wife stays on unquestionably suggests that the “beatings” could not have been too bad for if they had been, she certainly would have left. The expert could clear up these myths, by explaining that one of the common characteristics of a battered wife is her <i>inability</i> to leave despite such constant beatings; her “learned helplessness”; her lack of anywhere to go; her feeling that if she tried to leave, she would be subjected to even more merciless treatment; her belief in the omnipotence of her battering husband; and sometimes her hope that her husband will change his ways. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fb3a3a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty with the expert’s testimony is that it <i>sounds</i> as if an expert is giving knowledge to a jury about something the jury knows as well as anyone else, namely, the reasonableness of a person’s fear of imminent serious danger. That is not at all, however, what this testimony is <i>directly</i> aimed at. It is aimed at an area where the purported common knowledge of the jury may be very much mistaken, an area where jurors’ logic, drawn from their own experience, may lead to a wholly incorrect conclusion. . . . After hearing the expert, instead of saying Gladys Kelly could not have been beaten up so badly for if she had, she certainly would have left, the jury could conclude that her failure to leave was very much part and parcel of her life as a battered wife. The jury could conclude that instead of casting doubt on the accuracy of her testimony about the severity and frequency of prior beatings, her failure to leave actually reinforced her credibility.</p>
<p id="76fb3a3b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since a retrial is necessary, we think it advisable to indicate the limit of the expert’s testimony on this issue of reasonableness. It would not be proper for the expert to express the opinion that defendant’s belief on that day was reasonable, not because this is the ultimate issue, but because the area of <i>expert</i> knowledge relates, in this regard, to the reasons for defendant’s failure to leave her husband. Either the jury accepts or rejects that explanation and, based on that, credits defendant’s stories about the beatings she suffered. No expert is needed, however, once the jury has made up its mind on those issues, to tell the jury the logical conclusion, namely, that a person who has in fact been severely and continuously beaten might very well reasonably fear that the imminent beating she was about to suffer could be either life-threatening or pose a risk of serious injury. What the expert could state was that defendant had the battered-woman’s syndrome, and could explain that syndrome in detail, relating its characteristics to defendant, but only to enable the jury better to determine the honesty and reasonableness of defendant’s belief. Depending on its content, the expert’s testimony might also enable the jury to find that the battered wife, because of the prior beatings, numerous beatings, as often as once a week, for seven years, from the day they were married to the day he died, is particularly able to predict accurately the likely extent of violence in any attack on her. That conclusion could <span title="892" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-892">p. 892</span>significantly affect the jury’s evaluation of the reasonableness of defendant’s fear for her life. . . .

Men are frequently slapped, kicked, or beaten by their spouses or domestic partners, but they are much less likely to be victims of the most serious assaults; in the Justice Department surveys, about 150,000 men annually were victims of significant domestic violence,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105B4_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105B4_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">10</a></span> and in 2005, 329 were killed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105BC_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105BC_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">11</a></span> Thus, women are almost five times more likely to be the victim of a serious domestic assault. And although the debate about battered spouse syndrome has focused attention on women who kill their spouses, men are three times more likely than women to kill their spouses or partners.

Advocates for battered women urged the adoption of mandatory-arrest policies and “no-drop” policies to prevent prosecutors from declining to prosecute such cases. An initial empirical study, conducted in Minneapolis, provided strong support for the hypothesis that mandatory arrest would deter battering, but subsequent studies raised concern about possible countervailing effects. Because battered women often are economically dependent on, and fearful of, their male partners, mandatory-arrest policies in some instances seemed to deter reporting and calls for help by women, more than they deterred violence by men. There was also some evidence that mandatory-arrest policies sometimes prompted the arrested men to be <i>more</i> violent toward their spouses afterward. One scholar who initially supported mandatory arrest cautioned that, in light of later studies, the mandatory-arrest approach to domestic violence “may make as much sense as fighting a fire with gasoline.”

<p id="76fbd6b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To apply a purely objective standard is unduly harsh because it ignores the characteristics which inevitably and justifiably shape the defender’s perspective, thus holding him (or her) to a standard he simply cannot meet. If the defender is young or crippled or blind, we should not expect him to behave like a strapping, sighted adult. On the other hand, if the reasonable person has all of the defender’s characteristics, the standard loses any normative component and . . . would give free rein to the short-tempered, the pugnacious, and the foolhardy who see threats of harm where the rest of us would not and who blind themselves to opportunities for escape that seem plainly available. These unreasonable people may not be as wicked as (although perhaps more dangerous than) cold-blooded murderers . . . but neither are they, in practical or legal terms, justified in causing death. . . .

<p id="76fbd6b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this context, “reasonableness” can have two possible meanings. First, . . . her experience as a battered woman, and the syndrome from which she suffers, [may make] her a better judge than us of the seriousness of the situation she actually faces. . . . But what of the woman who shoots her husband while he is sound asleep, and not, by anyone’s account, about to do anything? What of the woman who faces a beating, but not—even within her own or her expert’s description of the cycles of violence—serious bodily harm? Put aside the woman who has tried to escape in the past and been <span title="899" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-899">p. 899</span>beaten for it, or who has called the police and been rebuffed, or who would be leaving her young children defenseless if she left. In these cases, properly applied, the retreat requirement cannot be met with the necessary “complete safety.” But what of the woman who has never tried any of these alternatives? What of the woman who could walk out the back door and into a neighbor’s house?</p>
<p id="76fbd6b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In such cases, the “reasonableness” inquiry, and the evidence of battered woman’s syndrome, does not really go to the rightness of the woman’s belief in the need for deadly force. It is, instead, a request to abandon the limits on self-defense out of empathy for the circumstances of the defender and disgust for the acts of her abuser. We can find her belief in the imminence of danger “reasonable” only by deciding that these standards mean less in the home than outside it, mean less when applied to cruel husbands who torment defenseless wives than to others.</p>
<p id="76fbd6b5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face, that is a very uncomfortable request—at least for those of us who see in the rules of self-defense a laudable recognition of the value of human life and a desirable effort to articulate a normative standard which protects even aggressors and wrongdoers from instant execution or vigilante justice.</p>

<i>5. The issue of scientific reliability. (a) The law.</i> At the time <i>Kelly</i> was decided, courts were divided over whether expert testimony on BWS was sufficiently reliable to allow it to go to the jury. Today its admissibility is overwhelmingly accepted by courts and legislatures. See State v. Townsend, 897 A.2d 316 (N.J. 2006); Rogers v. State, 616 So. 2d 1098, 1100 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993). In some jurisdictions the issue is resolved by statute. See, e.g., Cal. Evid. Code §1107(b) (2011) (“Expert opinion testimony on intimate partner battering and its effects shall not be considered a new scientific technique whose reliability is unproven”). Texas has an even broader provision, as it is not restricted to intimate partner cases. Tex. Penal Code §19.06 (2011):</p>

<i>(b) The science.</i> Concerns about the methodology of BWS research were raised from the start. In a prescient student note, the author pointed to several problems, observing that the pivotal research of Lenore Walker left unclear the nature of the “loving contrition” phase in the “cycle of violence” and did not indicate whether battered women felt unable to leave during the periods when intimidation was in abeyance. See Note (David L. Faigman), The Battered Woman Syndrome and Self-Defense: A Legal and Empirical Dissent, 72 Va. L. Rev. 619 (1986). Similarly, the Walker research did not specify which <span title="900" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-900">p. 900</span>groups of women experienced which phases of the cycle of violence, and her data implied that at most only 58 percent of those considered battered women experienced all three phases. As a result, the Note argued, the claim that becomes central in self-defense cases—that battered women develop “learned helplessness” and believe themselves unable to flee—lacked verifiable empirical support.</p>
<p id="76fbd6b9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsequent studies reinforce these misgivings. Professor Leigh Goodmark observes that “[e]xperts in the field have largely abandoned the theory of learned helplessness and its conception of women who experience violence as passive non-actors.” Goodmark, supra p. 893, at 44. Alison L. Weitzer explains (The Revitalization of Battered Woman Syndrome as Scientific Evidence with the Enforcement of the DSM-5, 18 Mich. St. U. J. Med. &amp; L. 89, 117-118 (2014)) that the diagnosis of BWS is not “testable” by ordinary medical criteria, and that commentary on BWS has appeared in the popular press but not in peer-reviewed journals, so that the theory has not been adequately critiqued. See also Robert F. Schopp, Barbara J. Sturgis &amp; Megan Sullivan, Battered Woman Syndrome, Expert Testimony, and the Distinction Between Justification and Excuse, 1994 U. Ill. L. Rev. 45, 63-64:</p>

<p id="76fbd6ba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The complete body of [research] provides neither any clear conception of learned helplessness nor any good reason to believe that it regularly occurs in battered women. . . . Collectively, the data reviewed supports the proposition that battered women do not suffer learned helplessness, at least as well as it supports the claim that they do. Finally, it would be more consistent with the theoretical and empirical foundations of learned helplessness to contend that battered women who kill their batterers differ from those who remain in the battering relationships without killing their batterers precisely because those who kill do <i>not</i> manifest learned helplessness.</p>

<p id="76fbfdcc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From a different direction, an emerging body of data suggests that battering, especially when it causes a concussion, can alter the victim’s brain chemistry, prompting increased aggressiveness and enhancing fears of future battering.

<i>6. Feminist perspectives.</i> Some of the criticism of efforts to use BWS evidence has come from an avowedly feminist perspective. See, e.g., Anne M. Coughlin, Excusing Women, 82 Cal. L. Rev. 1 (1994):</p>

 . . . None of those who advocate, or, for that matter, criticize, adoption of the battered woman syndrome defense has noticed that, for many centuries, the criminal law has been content to excuse women for criminal misconduct on the ground that they cannot be expected to, and, indeed, should not, resist the influence exerted by their husbands. No similar excuse has ever been afforded to men; to the contrary, the criminal law consistently has demanded that men withstand any pressures in their lives that compel them to commit crimes, including pressures exerted by their spouses. In this way, the theory of criminal responsibility has participated in the construction of marriage and, indeed, of gender, as a hierarchical relationship. By construing wives as incapable of choosing lawful conduct when faced with unlawful influence from their spouses, the theory invests men with the authority to govern both themselves and their irresponsible wives. The battered woman syndrome defense rests on and reaffirms this invidious understanding of women’s incapacity for rational self-control.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Does the partial excuse of provocation (available most classically when a man discovers sexual infidelity by his spouse, see p. 474 supra) contradict Coughlin’s claim that men have never been afforded an excuse for inability to withstand pressures in their lives?

See Bautista v. Small, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141158 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 16, 2010). And courts have generally been unreceptive to evidence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) offered by military veterans seeking to bolster their claims of self-defense. See Thomas L. Hafemeister &amp; Nicole A. Stockey, Last Stand? The Criminal Responsibility of War Veterans Returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, 85 Ind. L.J. 87 (2010). In the PTSD cases, unlike the battered spouse cases, the defendant’s self-defensive action typically is not directed toward an unsympathetic victim who has committed many abusive acts in the past. Should that difference be significant? If a person in the defendant’s “situation” would reasonably believe it was necessary to use <span title="902" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-902">p. 902</span>deadly force to save his own life, shouldn’t a self-defense claim be viable regardless of whether, unbeknownst to him, the person killed was innocent of wrongdoing?

App. 1986), the defendant appealed his conviction of murder, complaining that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the jury to hear the testimony of his expert witness. He had raised the issue of self-defense, and the witness would have testified that the defendant, as the son of a Nazi concentration camp survivor, was a victim of a so-called Holocaust syndrome, which causes people to be unusually assertive in confrontational settings, as a reaction to the memory of Jewish concentration camp victims who did not fight back. The court rejected his argument, stating: “The evidence excluded only tended to show that possibly appellant was not an ordinary and prudent man with respect to self-defense. This did not entitle appellant to an enlargement of the statutory defense on account of his psychological peculiarities” (id. at 646). The dissent observed:</p>

<p id="76fc4c14-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant testified that, “I knowed when he woke up, it was going to be the same thing, and I was scared when he took me to the truck stop that night it was going to be worse than he had ever been.” She also testified, when asked if she believed her husband’s threats: “Yes. . . . [H]e would kill me if he <span title="906" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-906">p. 906</span>got a chance.

The Court of Appeals concluded that to impose such requirements would ignore the “learned helplessness,” meekness and other realities of battered wife syndrome and would effectively preclude such women from exercising their right of self-defense. . . .

<p id="76fc4c16-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasoning of our Court of Appeals in this case proposes to change the established law of self-defense by giving the term “imminent” a meaning substantially more indefinite and all-encompassing than its present meaning. This would result in a substantial relaxation of the requirement of real or apparent necessity to justify homicide. Such reasoning proposes justifying the taking of human life not upon the reasonable belief it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm—which the imminence requirement ensures—but upon purely subjective speculation that the decedent probably would present a threat to life at a future time and that the defendant would not be able to avoid the predicted threat.</p>
<p id="76fc4c17-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals suggests that such speculation would have been particularly reliable in the present case because the jury, based on the evidence of the decedent’s intensified abuse during the thirty-six hours preceding his death, could have found that the decedent’s passive state at the time of his death was “but a momentary hiatus in a continuous reign of terror by the decedent [and] the defendant merely took advantage of her first opportunity to protect herself.” Requiring jury instructions on perfect self-defense in such situations, however, would still tend to make opportune homicide lawful as a result of mere subjective predictions of indefinite future assaults and circumstances. Such predictions . . . would be entirely speculative, because there was no evidence that her husband had ever inflicted any harm upon her that approached life-threatening injury, even during the “reign of terror.” It is far from clear in the defendant’s poignant evidence that any abuse by the decedent had ever involved the degree of physical threat required to justify the defendant in using deadly force, even when those threats were imminent. The use of deadly force in self-defense to prevent harm other than death or great bodily harm is excessive as a matter of law.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> How could the law of self-defense take account of these morally relevant factors? Would it be desirable to allow self-defense not only in the traditionally designated circumstances but also “in any other circumstance in which the defendant’s killing of the victim was morally justified”? Compare Jahnke v. State, 682 P.2d 991 (Wyo. 1984), a case in which a badly abused 16-year-old boy killed his father after lying in wait for him and shooting him without warning.

[If battered person] evidence has any role at all it is in assisting the jury to evaluate the reasonableness of the defendant’s fear in a case involving the recognized circumstances of self-defense which include a confrontation or conflict with the deceased not of the defendant’s instigation.</p>

<i>1.

In one study, only 20 percent of the cases involved abusers killed in nonconfrontational settings—8 percent while they slept, 8 percent caught unawares during a lull in the violence, and 4 percent killed by a third party at the abused woman’s behest.

Instead, 84 percent of the cases involving an alleged lack of imminence were cases in which the parties were fighting, the defendant allegedly saw a weapon, or the defendant claimed that the victim was advancing toward her. Victoria F. Nourse, Self-Defense and Subjectivity, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1235, 1253 (2001).

<i>5. The Model Penal Code.</i> The MPC modestly relaxes the imminence requirement, providing that self-defense can be available if the actor reasonably believed that the use of defensive force was “immediately necessary” §3.04(1). Thus, in a case like <i>Schroeder</i>, Note 4(a) supra, the defendant might have a defense under the MPC, though not under the common-law approach, because his use of defensive force arguably was “immediately necessary” under the circumstances, even though the cellmate’s threatened assault was not imminent. Several states have adopted language similar to that of the MPC. E.g., N.J. Stat. Ann. §2C:3-4a (2016); Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, §505 (2016). Some courts have loosened the imminence requirement on their <span title="914" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-914">p. 914</span>own authority. In State v. Janes, 850 P.2d 495, 506 (Wash. 1993), for example, the court interpreted the statutory imminence requirement as follows:</p>

<p id="76fd0fa0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A threat, or its equivalent, can support self-defense when there is a reasonable belief that the threat will be carried out.

<i>6. Assessing the imminence requirement. (a) Imminence in fact.</i> Are courts and commentators justified in assuming that the strict imminence requirement invariably defeats a self-defense claim in nonconfrontational settings?

<i>(b) Imminence and necessity.</i> Why <i>should</i> imminence be required? One answer is that in the absence of imminence, the killing was not strictly necessary. Imminence, in other words, serves as a proxy for necessity. But if this is the rationale for requiring imminence, why should imminence and necessity be independent requirements? One could justifiably say that lack of imminence creates a presumption that the killing was unnecessary. But note that most courts treat this no-necessity presumption as irrebuttable. Why shouldn’t a defendant in cases like <i>Norman</i>, <i>Sands</i>, <i>Schroeder</i>, and <i>Ha</i> be permitted to argue that the killing <i>was</i> necessary even in the absence of imminence?</p>

But some argue that in a case like <i>Norman</i>, a number of morally relevant factors, taken together, call for exoneration even when the defendant did have alternatives to the use of violence. See the comments of McCord &amp; Lyons, p. 908 supra. In addition, existing law already includes exceptions to the “pacifist” principle. For example, as we shall see (p. 921 infra), many jurisdictions permit an actor to use deadly force even when he could avoid the need to do so, simply by retreating to a readily available place of safety. Professor Joan Krause suggests (supra, at 561-562) that these exceptions to the “pacifist” principle can be explained by</p>

<i>1. Limits on the use of deadly force.</i> As we have seen, p. 882 supra, a defender can use deadly force only in response to a threat of “death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat.” MPC §3.04(2)(b). In John Q. La Fond, The Case for Liberalizing the Use of Deadly Force in Self-Defense, 6 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 237 (1983), the author criticizes this limitation because it leaves many law-abiding citizens (including most female victims) without a practically effective means of defense against a nondeadly assault by a stronger attacker. The author proposes instead that resort to deadly force be permissible whenever “necessary to protect [the defendant] effectively” against unlawful physical violence (id. at 280).</p>
<p id="76fd5ddd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note the significance of this issue for the battered woman’s defense. In <i>Norman</i>, the court said “there was no evidence that her husband had ever inflicted any harm upon her that approached life-threatening injury,” and accordingly that “it is far from clear . . . that [his abuse] ever involved the degree of physical threat required to justify the defendant in using deadly force, <i>even when those threats were imminent</i>” (emphasis added). Do you <span title="917" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-917">p. 917</span>agree about the facts? Did any of J.T.’s abuse meet the MPC standard for using deadly force in self-defense? If not, could Judy Norman have reasonably feared more serious assaults in the future? And apart from the specific facts of <i>Norman</i>, is the legal rule sound in requiring a reasonable fear of <i>great bodily harm</i>? If a battering husband uses only nondeadly force against a spouse who cannot readily escape the relationship, what are her options?</p>

<i>2. The risk of injury to others.</i> Is a person who is privileged to use deadly force criminally responsible if his defensive actions injure innocent persons? In People v. Adams, 291 N.E.2d 54, 55-56 (Ill. App. Ct. 1972), the defendant, acting in self-defense, shot and killed his assailant, Robinson, who was threatening his life. One of the defendant’s bullets passed through Robinson’s body and struck and killed Mary Davis, who was sitting nearby. The defendant was convicted of manslaughter for killing Davis. The appellate court reversed the conviction, stating:</p>

Some courts would permit a self-defense claim even under such circumstances, because they analyze the issue as a problem of “transferred intent.” As we have seen (p. 618 supra), if a defendant shoots, intending to kill <i>A</i>, and the bullet accidentally strikes and kills bystander <i>B</i>, the defendant can be convicted of murdering <i>B</i>, because his intent to kill <i>A</i> is “transferred” to <i>B.</i> Applying the same logic, some courts hold that the justification transfers along with the intent, so that if the defendant, acting in justified self-defense, shoots at assailant <i>A</i> and accidentally kills <i>B</i>, the killing of <i>B</i> is deemed to be intentional but justified. See, e.g., Rogers v. State, 994 So. 2d 792, 802 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008); People v. Reyes, 2010 WL 5175486, at *3 (Cal. App. Dec. 22, 2010).</p>
<p id="76fd5de2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does this approach leave too much room for reckless measures by persons acting in self-defense? Consider Commonwealth v. Fowlin, 710 A.2d 1130 (Pa. 1998). Fowlin, a nightclub patron, was approached by three men, one of whom sprayed pepper gas in his eyes while a second pulled a gun. Thinking that he was about to be killed, Fowlin drew his own handgun and fired more <span title="918" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-918">p. 918</span>than seven times in the general direction of his attackers. Though nearly blinded by pepper spray, he managed to kill one of his assailants and wound another, but 200 other people were present in the club, and Fowlin also wounded one of these bystanders. No charges were pressed with respect to the shooting of the two assailants, but Fowlin was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment for shooting the bystander. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed the charges. The court held that if a defendant reasonably believes that deadly force is necessary to avoid death or serious bodily harm, he cannot be deemed reckless, regardless of the extent to which he endangers innocent bystanders. A dissenting judge conceded that Fowlin had been justified in shooting his assailants but argued that the question whether he had acted recklessly toward the bystanders was a matter for the jury to determine under all the circumstances. The dissenting judge added (id. at 1136):</p>

See §3.09(3). Which approach makes more sense? If the defendant in <i>Fowlin</i> knew his desperate acts of self-defense might injure or kill several innocent people, should a lawyer standing at his side advise him to do nothing? If not—if the defendant had a right to use the only defensive measures available to save his life—how can we convict him of a serious felony for doing so?

<i>3. Burden of proof.</i> Most jurisdictions place the burden on the prosecution to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, once the issue is raised by the evidence. E.g., Commonwealth v. Walker, 820 N.E.2d 195, 201-202 (Mass. 2005); see Annot., 43 A.L.R.3d 221 (2005). Ohio, however, requires the defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Dykas, 925 N.E.2d 685 (Ohio Ct. App. 2010). In Martin v. Ohio, 480 U.S. 228 (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this practice, on the ground that the absence of the conditions of self-defense was not among the elements of the crime charged (aggravated murder) as defined by the Ohio statute.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">WEINTRAUB, C.J</span>. . . . Abbott shared a common driveway with his neighbors, Michael and Mary Scarano. The Scaranos engaged a contractor to pave their portion. Abbott obtained some asphalt from the contractor and made a doorstop to keep his garage door from swinging onto the Scaranos’ property. Nicholas Scarano, who was visiting with the Scaranos, his parents, objected to Abbott’s innovation. After some words between them a fist fight ensued.</p><p id="76fdab0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although Abbott managed to land the first punch, with which he sent Nicholas to the ground, a jury could find Nicholas was the aggressor. At this point Michael Scarano came at Abbott with a hatchet. Michael . . . denied he meant to use it as a weapon. According to Abbott, Mary Scarano followed, armed with a carving knife and large fork. The actors gave varying versions of what happened, but the end result was that all of the Scaranos were hit by the hatchet. Nicholas received severe head injuries. Abbott claimed he too suffered a laceration. Abbott admitted he finally wrested the hatchet from Michael but denied he wielded it at all. Rather he insisted that the Scaranos were injured during a common struggle for the instrument. A jury could, however, find Abbott intentionally inflicted the blows.</p><p id="76fdab0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Abbott was separately indicted for atrocious assault and battery upon each of the Scaranos. . . . The jury acquitted Abbott of the charges relating to Michael and Mary, but found him guilty as to Nicholas.

[O]ne could readily say there was no necessity to kill in self-defense if the use of deadly force could have been avoided by retreat. The critics of the retreat rule do not quarrel with the theoretical validity of this conclusion, but rather condemn it as unrealistic. The law of course should not denounce conduct as criminal when it accords with the behavior of reasonable men. [A]dvocates of no-retreat say the manly thing is to hold one’s ground and hence society should not demand what smacks of cowardice. Adherents of the retreat rule reply it is better that the assailed shall retreat than that the life of another be needlessly spent. They add that not only do right-thinking men agree, but further a rule so requiring may well induce others to adhere to that worthy standard of behavior. . . .

<span title="920" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-920">p. 920</span>Other jurisdictions are closely divided upon the retreat doctrine. . . . The Model Penal Code embraces the retreat rule while acknowledging that on numerical balance a majority of the precedents oppose it.</p><p id="76fdd221-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are not persuaded to depart from the principle of retreat. We think it salutary if reasonably limited. Much of the criticism goes not to its inherent validity but rather to unwarranted applications of the rule. For example, it is correctly observed that one can hardly retreat from a rifle shot at close range. But if the weapon were a knife, a lead of a city block might well be enough. . . . Such considerations, however, do not demand that a man should have the absolute right to stand his ground and kill in any and all situations. . . . 
</p><p id="76fdd222-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe the following principles are sound:</p><p id="76fdd223-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1.</i> The issue of retreat arises only if the defendant resorted to a deadly force. . . . Model Penal Code §3.04(2)(b)(ii). As defined in §3.11(2) a deadly force means “force which the actor uses with the purpose of causing or which he knows to create a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.”</p><p id="76fdd224-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hence it is not the nature of the force defended against which raises the issue of retreat, but rather the nature of the force which the accused employed in his defense. If he does not resort to a deadly force, one who is assailed may hold his ground whether the attack upon him be of a deadly or some lesser character. Although it might be argued that a safe retreat should be taken if thereby the use of <i>any</i> force could be avoided, yet, as the comment in the Model Penal Code observes, “The logic of this position never has been accepted when moderate force is used in self-defense; here all agree that the actor may stand his ground and estimate necessity upon that basis.” . . .  Hence, in a case like the present one, the jury should be instructed that Abbott could hold his ground when Nicholas came at him with his fists, and also when Michael and Mary came at him with the several instruments mentioned, and that the question of retreat could arise only if Abbott intended to use a deadly force.</p><p id="76fdd225-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2.</i> What constitutes an opportunity to retreat which will defeat the right of self-defense? As §3.04(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Penal Code states, deadly force is not justifiable “if the actor <i>knows</i> that he can avoid the necessity of using such force <i>with complete safety</i> by retreating. . . . ” We emphasize “knows” and “with complete safety.” One who is wrongfully attacked need not risk injury by retreating, even though he could escape with something less than serious bodily injury. It would be unreal to require nice calculations as to the amount of hurt, or to ask him to endure any at all. And the issue is not whether in retrospect it can be found the defendant could have retreated unharmed. Rather the question is whether he knew the opportunity was there, and of course in that inquiry the total circumstances including the attendant excitement must be considered. . . .

<i>NOTES ON THE DUTY TO RETREAT</i>

<p id="76fdd229-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The traditional view.</i> The English common law imposed a strict duty to retreat; a person could use deadly force in self-defense only after exhausting every chance to flee, when he had his “back to the wall.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CB5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CB5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">31</a></span> In the nineteenth century, American courts began rejecting the English doctrine as unsuited to American values. In a widely quoted decision, Erwin v. State, 29 Ohio St. 186, 199 (1876), the Ohio Supreme Court said that the law “will not permit the taking of [human life] to repel mere trespass, . . . but a true man who is without fault is not obliged to fly from an assailant.” Some contemporary scholars continued to defend the retreat requirement; Professor Beale wrote in 1903 that despite the “apparent cowardice, [a] really honorable man . . .  would regret ten times more, after the excitement of the contest was past, the thought that he had the blood of a fellow-being on his hands.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CC1_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CC1_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">32</a></span> Many states, especially those on the east coast, retained a retreat requirement, but by the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the majority had adopted the “true man” or no-retreat rule. Historian Richard Maxwell Brown describes the result: “The centuries-long English legal severity against homicide was replaced in our country by a proud new tolerance for killing in situations where it might have been avoided.”

<i>2. The recent case law.</i> As the <i>Abbott</i> decision notes, most states at that time followed the no-retreat approach. Since then, the law on retreat has been in flux. Ohio, where the “true man” concept originated, rejected that approach in 1979.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CDB_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CDB_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">34</a></span> Tennessee, which had long rejected the no-retreat rule, adopted it by legislation in 1989, and as recently as 2006, its courts approvingly referred to that approach as “the ‘true man’ doctrine.”

<p id="76fdf940-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although contemporary cases and commentators sometimes identify no-retreat as the majority rule, the situation is more complex. In decisions based on common-law principles, there has been a distinct tendency to favor a requirement of retreat in settings outside the home, with many decisions requiring retreat when possible and courts in half a dozen additional states treating the possibility of retreat as a factor to be considered in judging necessity.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CEF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CEF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">36</a></span> Among the minority of courts that still choose a no-retreat rule under common-law principles, many expressly reject the old justification for it—that the law should not require what looks like cowardice. Rather, these courts argue that a rule requiring retreat tends to confuse the jury because it is so <span title="922" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-922">p. 922</span>difficult to determine whether the defendant knew he could retreat with complete safety.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CF9_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CF9_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">37</a></span> Recently, however, many judicial decisions reaffirming the retreat requirement have been nullified by legislation.</p>

<i>3. “Stand your ground” statutes.</i> Roughly 33 states have now enacted laws that permit the actor to meet force with force, including deadly force, even in public spaces where retreat is possible. See American Bar Association, Report to the House of Delegates (National Task Force on Stand Your Ground Laws) 3 (Feb. 2015). Explaining the rationale for these enactments, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, one of the organizations lobbying for them, said they send a needed message to law-abiding citizens: “If they make a decision to save their lives in the split second they are being attacked, the law is on their side. . . . Good people make good decisions. That’s why they’re good people. If you’re going to empower someone, empower the crime victim.” See Adam Liptak, 15 States Expand Right to Shoot in Self-Defense, N.Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2006.</p>

<i>(a) Protecting rights or saving lives?</i> In assessing the moral and practical implications of a retreat requirement, consider State v. Smiley, 927 So. 2d 1000 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006). The defendant, a cab driver, was paid in advance to drive an intoxicated man home from a bar.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D11_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D11_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">38</a></span> When they arrived at their destination the man got out of the cab, but then he allegedly started an argument, pulled a knife, and began advancing toward Smiley. Smiley apparently could have driven away in complete safety, but he chose to stand his ground, drew his gun, and shot his customer dead. At the time of the shooting, Florida’s common-law decisions required retreat, and Smiley was convicted of first-degree murder. But he might have a strong defense under the “stand your ground” (SYG) statute enacted shortly after the shooting, which currently provides (Fla. Stat. §776.012(2) (2016)):</p>

<i>(b) Unintended consequences.</i> SYG laws are typically debated in terms of the moral wisdom of preferring the rights of “good people” over the lives of <span title="923" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-923">p. 923</span>those they believe (correctly or otherwise) to be committing a serious offense. But it is also important to consider possible indirect effects: Will deterrence be enhanced by the prospect that crime victims can more readily resort to self-help? Or will the homicide rate increase because unnecessary killings occur more often in circumstances that are excusable under permissive SYG standards? Will SYG laws increase vigilantism and the danger of fatal mistakes prompted by unfounded racial suspicion? Recall the Trayvon Martin case, p. 878 supra, where a lethal confrontation occurred because George Zimmerman exercised his right to disregard police advice and followed an unarmed black teenager whom he considered dangerous: SYG played a decisive role in the unfolding of that tragedy. How should such outcomes be weighed against the perceived benefits of SYG?</p>

<i>4. The castle exception. (a) Intruders.</i> In jurisdictions requiring retreat before deadly force may be used, an exception is invariably made when the defendant is attacked in his own home by an intruder. Thus, in People v. Tomlins, 107 N.E. 496, 497 (1914), Judge Cardozo stated:</p>

<p id="76fe2060-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the castle exception sound in principle, or is it just a concession to human instinct? Suppose that a distraught teenager pushes her way into the home of her teacher, pulls a knife, cuts the phone lines, and threatens to kill the teacher. If the teacher can easily get to his car and go for help, should he be entitled to ignore that option, pull his gun, and kill the teenager on the spot? All American jurisdictions hold that he may do so. What is the justification for that result?</p>
<p id="76fe2061-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Guests.</i> Should the castle exception also be available (so that retreat is not required) when the homeowner kills a guest? For example, suppose that the owner and a friend are drinking heavily and get into an argument over dinner; the guest grabs a kitchen knife and advances in a menacing way. If the homeowner can easily escape and get help, should he nonetheless be entitled to draw his gun and kill the guest? Only a few states would require the homeowner to retreat in this situation; the great majority permit the homeowner to kill in self-defense. Do you agree? See Catherine L. Carpenter, Of the Enemy Within, the Castle Doctrine, and Self-Defense, 86 Marq. L. Rev. 653 (2003).</p>
<p id="76fe2062-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Co-occupants.</i> The greatest disagreement arises in situations in which one occupant kills another, such as a spouse or child. In <i>Tomlins</i>, supra, Judge Cardozo held that a father being threatened by his son could kill the son rather than retreat. MPC §3.04(2)(b)(ii)(1) endorses this view, as do most of the recent decisions on the issue. E.g., State v. Jones, 786 S.E.2d 132, 140-141 (S.C. 2016). But some courts require the homeowner to flee if possible when the attacker is a co-occupant. E.g., State v. Gartland, 694 A.2d 564 (N.J. 1997).</p>
<p id="76fe2063-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until recently, Minnesota took the latter approach, requiring retreat in cases of attack by a co-occupant, but not in cases of attack by an intruder or guest. What, then, should be the rule when a homeowner is attacked by a girlfriend who visits and sleeps over several nights a week? The difficulty of distinguishing between a co-occupant and a mere guest led the Minnesota Supreme Court to relax its restrictions on using defensive force and to hold that the homeowner was entitled to stand his ground and use deadly force even against a full-fledged co-resident. State v. Glowacki, 630 N.W.2d 392 (Minn. 2001).</p>
<p id="76fe2064-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An additional concern for courts that follow this approach is fear that a duty to retreat would adversely affect victims of domestic violence, because for battered women “separation or retreat can be the most dangerous time in the relationship.” Weiand v. State, 732 So. 2d 1044, 1053 (Fla. 1999). See Brandi Jackson, No Ground on Which to Stand: Revise Stand Your Ground Laws So Survivors of Domestic Violence Are No Longer Incarcerated for Defending Their Lives, 30 Berkeley J. Gender L. &amp; Just. 154 (2015).</p>
<p id="76fe2065-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But will some women (and abused teenage children) be placed in even greater danger by a gender-neutral privilege not to retreat? Consider State v. Shaw, 441 A.2d 561 (Conn. 1981). The statute in <i>Shaw</i>, patterned after <span title="925" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-925">p. 925</span>the MPC, stated: “[T]he actor shall not be required to retreat if he is in his dwelling . . . and was not the initial aggressor. . . . ” Nevertheless, the court, noting the overriding policy favoring human life and stressing that in the great majority of homicides the killer and victim are relatives or close acquaintances, chose to read into the statute a requirement of retreat from co-occupants. The court stated: “We cannot conclude that the Connecticut legislature intended to sanction the reenactment of the climactic scene from ‘High Noon’ in the familial kitchens of this state.”</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">ROBINSON, J</span>. Indicted for second-degree murder, and convicted by a jury of manslaughter as a lesser included offense, Bennie L.

While Keitt was doing so, Peterson came out of the house . . . to protest. After a verbal exchange, Peterson went back into the house, obtained a pistol, and returned to the yard. In the meantime, Keitt had reseated himself in his car, and he and his companions were about to leave.</p><p id="76fe477d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon his reappearance in the yard, Peterson paused briefly to load the pistol. “If you move,” he shouted to Keitt, “I will shoot.” He walked to a point in the yard slightly inside a gate in the rear fence and, pistol in hand, said [to Keitt], “If you come in here I will kill you.” Keitt alighted from his car, took a few steps toward Peterson and exclaimed, “What the hell do you think you are going to do with that?” Keitt then made an about-face, walked back to his car and got a lug wrench. With the wrench in a raised position, Keitt advanced toward Peterson, who stood with the pistol pointed toward him. Peterson warned Keitt not to “take another step” and, when Keitt continued onward shot him in the face from a distance of about ten feet. Death was apparently instantaneous. . . . 
</p><p id="76fe477e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Peterson’s complaint centers upon an instruction that the right to use deadly force in self-defense is not ordinarily available to one who provokes a conflict or is the aggressor in it. . . . Peterson contends that there was no evidence that he <span title="926" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-926">p. 926</span>either caused or contributed to the conflict, and that the instructions on the topic could only [have] misled the jury.</p><p id="76fe477f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It has long been accepted that one cannot support a claim of self-defense by a self-generated necessity to kill. The right of homicidal self-defense is granted only to those free from fault in the difficulty; it is denied to slayers who incite the fatal attack, encourage the fatal quarrel or otherwise promote the necessitous occasion for taking life. The fact that the deceased struck the first blow, fired the first shot or made the first menacing gesture does not legalize the self-defense claim if in fact the claimant was the actual provoker. In sum, one who is the aggressor in a conflict culminating in death cannot invoke the necessities of self-preservation. Only in the event that he communicates to his adversary his intent to withdraw and in good faith attempts to do so is he restored to his right of self-defense.</p><p id="76fe4780-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This body of doctrine traces its origin to the fundamental principle that a killing in self-defense is excusable only as a matter of genuine necessity. Quite obviously, a defensive killing is unnecessary if the occasion for it could have been averted.</p><p id="76fe4781-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he trial judge’s charge fully comported with these governing principles. The remaining question, then, is whether there was evidence to make them applicable to the case. . . . 
</p><p id="76fe4782-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence is uncontradicted that when Peterson reappeared in the yard with his pistol, Keitt was about to depart the scene. . . . The uncontroverted fact that Keitt was leaving shows plainly that so far as he was concerned the confrontation was ended. [E]ven if he had previously been the aggressor, he no longer was.</p><p id="76fe4783-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not so with Peterson, however. . . . Emerging from the house with the pistol, he paused in the yard to load it, and to command Keitt not to move. He then walked through the yard to the rear gate and, displaying his pistol, dared Keitt to come in, and threatened to kill him if he did. While there appears to be no fixed rule on the subject, the cases hold, and we agree, that an affirmative unlawful act reasonably calculated to produce an affray foreboding injurious or fatal consequences is an aggression which, unless renounced, nullifies the right of homicidal self-defense. We cannot escape the abiding conviction that the jury could readily find Peterson’s challenge to be a transgression of that character.</p><p id="76fe4784-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation at bar is not unlike that presented in <i>Laney</i> [294 Fed. 412 (1923)]. There the accused, chased along the street by a mob threatening his life, managed to escape through an areaway between two houses . . . and then returned to the areaway. The mob beset him again, and during an exchange of shots one of its members was killed by a bullet from the accused’s gun. In affirming a conviction of manslaughter, the court reasoned: “It is clearly apparent . . . that, when defendant escaped from the mob into the back yard . . . he was in a place of comparative safety, from which, if he desired to go home, he could have gone by the back way. [W]hen he adjusted his gun and stepped out into the areaway, he had every reason to believe that his presence there would provoke trouble. We think his conduct in adjusting his revolver and going into <span title="927" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-927">p. 927</span>the areaway was such as to deprive him of any right to invoke the plea of self-defense.” . . . 
</p><p id="76fe4785-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are brought much the readier to the same conclusion here. We think the evidence plainly presented an issue of fact as to whether Peterson’s conduct was an invitation to and provocation of the encounter which ended in the fatal shot. We sustain the trial judge’s action in remitting that issue for the jury’s determination.</p></div>

<p id="76fe4788-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Can the nonlethal aggressor respond?</i> In <i>Peterson</i>, the defendant became the initial aggressor when he obtained a pistol, reentered his yard, and threatened to shoot. Keitt’s response (getting the lug wrench) was arguably a legitimate act of self-protection under these circumstances; if so, it is easy to see why Peterson should not have a right to use deadly force in return. But suppose that Peterson had threatened only nonlethal force and then was met by Keitt’s excessive, potentially lethal response. Should the initial aggressor still be denied any right to defend his life, when his initial aggression may have consisted only of provocative words, a shove, or a punch?</p>
<p id="76fe4789-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a few states, the nonlethal aggressor can regain his right to self-defense if he is met by an excessive, life-threatening response, provided that he then “exhaust[s] every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of [deadly] force.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E27_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10E27_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">41</a></span> But most jurisdictions tend to deny the initial aggressor even this limited means of escape. On the ground that self-defense is available only to the person who is “free from fault,” most states hold that the initial aggressor has no self-defense privilege even when his minor provocation is met by a grossly excessive response.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10E2F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10E2F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">42</a></span> Apparently, the initial aggressor’s only choices are to run (if possible), to forgo self-defense (and be killed), or to fight back unlawfully (and face homicide charges if he is forced to kill his attacker). Does this make sense?</p>
<p id="76fe6e9c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider Allen v. State, 871 P.2d 79, 92-93 (Okla. Crim. App. 1994). After the defendant and her intimate partner quarreled, the partner, Gloria Leathers, collected her possessions and prepared to move out. As Leathers went to her car, Allen pursued her, asking her to stay, but Leathers grabbed a multiple-pronged garden rake and struck Allen in the face, causing extensive bleeding. Leathers drove off, and Allen got in her own car to pursue Leathers. When Allen caught up, she parked her car and walked toward Leathers’s vehicle, hoping (she claimed) to persuade Leathers to reconsider. At that point Allen saw Leathers coming toward her holding the rake. She returned to her car and retrieved a gun from the glove compartment; when she turned around and saw Leathers standing very near her, holding the rake, she fired. Leathers died from a single gunshot wound to the abdomen. Allen was <span title="928" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-928">p. 928</span>convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The appellate court noted that in Oklahoma, “a party has no obligation to retreat from a confrontation; she can stand her ground and defend herself”; nonetheless the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, after finding the no-retreat privilege unavailable to Allen:</p>

<p id="76fe6e9d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a person by provocative behavior initiates a confrontation, even with no intention of killing the other person, she loses the right of self-defense. Here, even assuming Appellant did not intend to provoke an argument when she pursued the decedent . . . , she re-initiated the encounter. . . . She knew the decedent was upset, yet she pursued her anyway, knowing the possibility of a confrontation was strong.

<i>2. What kinds of fault suffice?</i> How far should courts extend the doctrine that fault forfeits the privilege of self-defense? In Andrews v. United States, 125 A.3d 316 (D.C. 2015), the defendant went to Bigelow’s home to see Bigelow’s sister, after Bigelow warned him to keep away and implicitly threatened to kill him if he did not. When defendant showed up anyway, Bigelow charged at him with a knife, and defendant shot and killed Bigelow. At his trial for murder, defendant argued that he went to see the sister for peaceful purposes, had every right to be where he was, and had no choice but to shoot Bigelow to save himself from a deadly attack. Defendant was convicted after the trial judge instructed the jury that one who “provokes conflict upon himself” cannot claim self-defense. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, explaining (id. at 321-322):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76fe6ea0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]elf-defense is not available to a defendant who voluntarily—knowingly and unnecessarily—placed himself in a position where he had reason to believe his presence would provoke [violence]. Forfeiture [of the right to self-defense] ensues . . . even if the defendant’s “purpose in putting himself in that position . . . was benign,” and even if the area of confrontation was a public street or other place where the defendant had a right to be present. . . . The rationale underlying this stern doctrine lies in “the fundamental principle that a killing in self-defense is excusable only as a matter of genuine necessity. Quite obviously, a defensive killing is unnecessary if the occasion for it could have been averted[.]”</p>

<p id="76fe6ea1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Do you agree? Compare Margaret Raymond, Looking for Trouble: Framing and the Dignitary Interest in the Law of Self-Defense, 71 Ohio St. L.J. 287, 289 (2010), arguing that a person like Andrews should not have to rely on police protection in order to pursue perfectly lawful activities. Similarly, Kimberly Kessler Ferzan argues (Provocateurs, 7 Crim. L. &amp; Phil. 597 (2013)) that people should “forfeit their defensive rights [only] when they . . . subjectively <span title="929" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-929">p. 929</span>appreciate that they are running the risk of causing force to be used against them and they engage in this behavior without justification or excuse.” Do you agree, or is it preferable to minimize the use of lethal force to settle private conflicts, no matter who is in the wrong?</p>
<p id="76fe6ea2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most courts deny the right to defend with lethal force when the person claiming self-defense has wrongfully provoked the conflict. But what sort of wrongdoing will suffice? Suppose that Uriah catches David in flagrante delicto with Uriah’s wife. Uriah, enraged, tries to kill David. Can David defend himself with deadly force, or has he become the aggressor, and therefore lost his right to self-defense, by committing adultery with Uriah’s wife? What should be the result under <i>Allen v. State</i>, Note 1, supra?</p>
<p id="76fe6ea3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts hold that David cannot defend himself with deadly force in this situation. See Dabney v. State, 21 So. 211 (1897). More modern cases addressing the issue tend to reject this approach. See Atkins v. State, 339 S.E.2d 782 (Ga. 1986). Which is the better view? Is it wrong to permit David to have an affair and then kill the husband who is understandably enraged by his provocative conduct? Or is it worse to make David, whose most serious offense is adultery, either face a homicide conviction (if he defends himself) or pay with his life (if he does not)?</p>
<p id="76fe95b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts take this “free from fault” requirement even further, holding that commission of any crime causally related to the fatal result will forfeit the privilege of self-defense, even when the crime itself does not <i>provoke</i> the victim’s threatening conduct. Consider Mayes v. State, 744 N.E.2d 390 (Ind. 2001). The defendant and his girlfriend Mary were having a bitter argument. Mary left the house, and the defendant pursued her into the street. When she reached for her purse, the defendant, who claimed she was about to pull a gun, drew his own weapon and fired, killing her. Whether the circumstances would support a claim of self-defense was hotly disputed. But the prosecution argued that because the defendant had committed a misdemeanor by carrying a handgun without a license, he had, in any event, forfeited his right to self-defense. The trial judge instructed the jury that, as specified in the applicable Indiana statute, the defendant was not entitled to use force in self-defense if he was “committing [or] escaping after the commission [of] a crime.” The jury convicted Mayes of murder, and the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed. The court acknowledged that a literal application of the statute would produce absurd results, and stressed that there must be “an immediate causal connection between the crime and the confrontation.” Id. at 394. But, the court held, “the jury could have concluded that but for Mayes’ possession of the unlicensed handgun, Mary would still be alive because Mayes’ unlicensed handgun [which he had carried into the street] was required, by law, to be kept at his dwelling.” Id.</p>
<p id="76fe95b5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the result sound? Recall the felony-murder doctrine, under which the commission of certain felonies can sometimes be a basis for murder liability when death results. If Mayes’s possession of the handgun was a felony, would he be guilty of murder under the felony-murder rule? If not, is there good reason to attach murder penalties when death is proximately caused by the commission of a misdemeanor?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BURKE, J</span>. Don Ceballos was found guilty by a jury of assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, §245). Imposition of sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fe95c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant lived alone in a home in San Anselmo. The regular living quarters were above the garage, but defendant sometimes slept in the garage and had about $2,000 worth of property there.</p>
<p id="76fe95c2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In March 1970 some tools were stolen from defendant’s home. On May 12, 1970, he noticed the lock on his garage doors was bent and pry marks were on one of the doors. The next day he mounted a loaded .22 caliber pistol in the garage. The pistol was aimed at the center of the garage doors and was connected by a wire to one of the doors so that the pistol would discharge if the door was opened several inches.</p>
<p id="76fe95c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The damage to defendant’s lock had been done by a 16-year-old boy named Stephen and a 15-year-old boy named Robert. On the afternoon of May 15, <span title="931" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-931">p. 931</span>1970, the boys returned to defendant’s house while he was away. Neither boy was armed with a gun or knife. After looking in the windows and seeing no one, Stephen succeeded in removing the lock on the garage doors with a crowbar, and, as he pulled the door outward, he was hit in the face with a bullet from the pistol.</p>
<p id="76fe95c4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Stephen testified: He intended to go into the garage “[f]or musical equipment” because he had a debt to pay to a friend. His “way of paying that debt would be to take [defendant’s] property and sell it” and use the proceeds to pay the debt. He “wasn’t going to do it [i.e., steal] for sure, necessarily.” He was there “to look around,” and “getting in, I don’t know if I would have actually stolen.”</p>
<p id="76fe95c5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted having set up the trap gun. He stated that after noticing the pry marks on his garage door on May 12, he felt he should “set up some kind of a trap, something to keep the burglar out of my home.” When asked why he was trying to keep the burglar out, he replied, “ . . . Because somebody was trying to steal my property . . . and I don’t want to come home some night and have the thief in there . . . usually a thief is pretty desperate . . . and . . . they just pick up a weapon . . . if they don’t have one . . . and do the best they can.” [D]efendant [also] stated that “he didn’t have much and he wanted to protect what he did have.”</p>
<p id="76fe95c6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he jury found defendant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon. An assault is “an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.” (Pen. Code, §240.)</p>
<p id="76fe95c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that had he been present he would have been justified in shooting Stephen since Stephen was attempting to commit burglary, that under cases such as United States v. Gilliam, 25 Fed. Cas. p. 1319, defendant had a right to do indirectly what he could have done directly, and that therefore any attempt by him to commit a violent injury upon Stephen was not “unlawful” and hence not an assault. The People argue that the rule in <i>Gilliam</i> is unsound, that as a matter of law a trap gun constitutes excessive force, and that in any event the circumstances were not in fact such as to warrant the use of deadly force. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76febcd8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, courts have concluded that a person may be held criminally liable . . . or civilly liable, if he sets upon his premises a deadly mechanical device and that device kills or injures another. . . . However, an exception to the rule that there may be criminal and civil liability for death or injuries caused by such a device has been recognized where the intrusion is, in fact, such that the person, were he present, would be justified in taking the life or inflicting the bodily harm with his own hands. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76febcd9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Allowing persons, at their own risk, to employ deadly mechanical devices imperils the lives of children, firemen and policemen acting within the scope of their employment, and others. Where the actor is present, there is always the possibility he will realize that deadly force is not necessary, but deadly mechanical devices are without mercy or discretion. Such devices “are silent instrumentalities of death. They deal death and destruction to the innocent as well as the criminal intruder without the slightest warning. The taking of human life [or infliction of great bodily injury] by such means is brutally savage and inhuman.” (See State v. Plumlee, . . . 149 So. 425, 430).</p>
<p id="76febcda-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="932" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-932">p. 932</span>[T]he use of such devices should not be encouraged. Moreover, whatever may be thought in torts, the foregoing rule setting forth an exception to liability for death or injuries inflicted by such devices “is inappropriate in penal law for it is obvious that it does not prescribe a workable standard of conduct; liability depends upon fortuitous results.” (See Model Penal Code (Tent. Draft No. 8), §3.06, com. 15.) We therefore decline to adopt that rule in criminal cases.</p>
<p id="76febcdb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Furthermore, even if that rule were applied here, as we shall see, defendant was not justified in shooting Stephen. Penal Code section 197 provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76febcdc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Homicide is . . . justifiable . . . 1. When resisting any attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to do some great bodily injury upon any person; or, 2. When committed in defense of habitation, property, or person, against one who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76febcdd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By its terms subdivision 1 of Penal Code section 197 appears to permit killing to prevent any “felony,” but in view of the large number of felonies today and the inclusion of many that do not involve a danger of serious bodily harm, a literal reading of the section is undesirable. People v. Jones, 191 Cal. App. 2d 478, 481, . . . read into section 197, subdivision 1, the limitation that the felony be “some atrocious crime attempted to be committed by force. [When] the character of the crime and the manner of its perpetration . . . 
<i>do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm,</i>
 . . . 
<i>there is no cause for the exaction of a human life.</i>” (italics added . . . ).</p>
<p id="76febcde-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Jones</i> involved subdivision 1 of Penal Code section 197, but subdivision 2 of that section is likewise so limited. The term “violence or surprise” in subdivision 2 is found in common law authorities . . . and, whatever may have been the very early common law . . . the rule developed at common law that killing or use of deadly force to prevent a felony was justified only if the offense was a forcible and atrocious crime. . . . “Surprise” means an unexpected attack—which includes force and violence . . . and the word thus appears redundant. Examples of forcible and atrocious crimes are murder, mayhem, rape and robbery. . . . In such crimes “from their atrocity and violence human life [or personal safety from great harm] either is, or is presumed to be, in peril” (see United States v. Gilliam, supra, 25 Fed. Cas. pp. 1319, 1320 . . . ).</p>
<p id="76febcdf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Burglary has been included in the list of such crimes. . . . However, in view of the wide scope of burglary under Penal Code section 459, as compared with the common law definition of that offense, in our opinion it cannot be said that under all circumstances burglary under section 459 constitutes a forcible and atrocious crime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10FA0_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10FA0_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> Where the character and manner of the burglary do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for exaction <span title="933" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-933">p. 933</span>of human life . . . or for the use of deadly force. . . . In the instant case the asserted burglary did not threaten death or serious bodily harm, since no one but Stephen and Robert was then on the premises. A defendant is not protected from liability merely by the fact that the intruder’s conduct is such as would justify the defendant, were he present, in believing that the intrusion threatened death or serious bodily injury. . . . We thus conclude that defendant was not justified under Penal Code section 197, subdivisions 1 or 2, in shooting Stephen to prevent him from committing burglary. [I]n view of the supreme value of human life, we do not believe deadly force can be justified to prevent all [burglaries of a dwelling], including ones in which no person is, or is reasonably believed to be, on the premises except the would-be burglar.</p>
<p id="76febce1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . We conclude that as a matter of law the exception to the rule of liability for injuries inflicted by a deadly mechanical device does not apply under the circumstances here appearing. . . . [Affirmed].</p>

<i>1. Variations on</i> Ceballos. Suppose that instead of using a spring gun, Ceballos had put a curtain over the window to prevent anyone from looking in, had then seated himself inside the garage, facing the door, and had fired at the boys as they raised the door. On these facts would the California court still consider his actions unjustified? Would it matter whether Ceballos knew that the boys were unarmed?</p>
<p id="76febce5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Other statutory approaches. (a)</i> MPC §3.06(3)(d), like the <i>Ceballos</i> court, strictly limits the use of deadly force against an intruder in the home. But §3.06(3)(d)(ii)(2) nonetheless permits the use of deadly force when “the use of force other than deadly force to prevent the commission or the consummation of the crime would expose the actor . . . to substantial danger of serious bodily harm.” Would Ceballos have a defense under this provision? Aside from the tactic he actually employed, how else could Ceballos have prevented the burglary?</p>

<i>3. Problem.</i> On the night of October 17, 1992, Yoshihiro Hattori, a 16-year-old Japanese exchange student, was with a friend looking for a Halloween party, and he was dressed in a “Saturday Night Fever” costume. He mistakenly rang Mr. Peairs’s doorbell, and when Mrs. Peairs came to the door and saw them, she became frightened and screamed. Apparently, neither Hattori nor his friend could speak enough English to reassure her. At this point Peairs grabbed his laser-scoped .44-magnum handgun from his bedroom and went to the carport door. The two boys had retreated to the sidewalk, but when the carport door opened, Hattori began walking towards Peairs, waving his arms as he often did when trying to communicate. Peairs yelled “freeze,” but Hattori did not understand him. Hattori continued forward; he had recently lost a contact lens and presumably did not see the gun. When Hattori was less than five feet away, Mr. Peairs fired one shot into his chest, killing him.</p>
<p id="76fee403-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rodney Peairs was indicted for manslaughter. He claimed that the shooting, though mistaken, was justified under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:20(3), which allows the use of deadly force based on a reasonable belief that an intruder is “likely to use any unlawful force against a person [in the dwelling] while committing . . . a burglary of that dwelling. . . . ” Peairs’s lawyer argued that Peairs saw an intruder who kept advancing “with absolutely no respect for [Peairs’s] home, his gun, or his warning.” During closing arguments, Peairs’s lawyer proclaimed “You have the absolute legal right in this country to answer your door with a gun. In your house, if you want to do it, you have the legal right to answer everybody that comes to your door with a gun.” The prosecutor emphasized the fact that Peairs acted without investigating why his wife screamed; Peairs’s alleged negligence was “his conduct in going to the closet and getting the biggest handgun made by human beings and never ever asking what it’s for.” After a seven-day trial and three hours of deliberation, Peairs was acquitted. The acquittal sparked outrage in Japan where owning a handgun is illegal (with minor exceptions), but many people in Peairs’s community supported his actions. See N.Y. Times, May 23, 1993, at A1; May 20, 1993, at A10.</p>

State, 776 A.2d 669, 671 (Md. 2001), the defendant was sitting on a stoop when Anthony Jackson approached, pulled a gun, and told him to hand over a gold chain he was wearing. After hitting Sydnor on the head and threatening to kill him, Jackson took $30 and was about to take the gold chain when Sydnor, assisted by friends, grabbed the gun and took it away. Jackson then attempted to flee, but Sydnor fired five shots, hitting him four times. Jackson collapsed and died 40 to 50 yards from where the robbery occurred. At Sydnor’s trial for murder and manslaughter, the judge instructed the jury that before using deadly force, the defendant was required to retreat unless “at the moment that the shots were fired the defendant was being robbed,” and the prosecution contended that the jury was entitled to view the robbery and the shooting as separate incidents. Sydnor was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the defense argument that the robbery was “a continuous transaction that is not complete until the perpetrator reaches a place of temporary safety.” Id. at 676. Acknowledging that under felony-murder precedents, a robbery does not end until the robber has made good his escape, the court said (id. at 676-677):</p>

<p id="76ff0b24-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the defenses we have considered so far, which are typically invoked by private citizens (self-defense, defense of others, and defense of property), an overlapping but doctrinally distinct set of defenses applies when force is used to prevent crime or effect an arrest. These defenses and their limits are most centrally directed to law enforcement officers, but private citizens may also claim these defenses, especially when they are assisting the police.</p>
<p id="76ff3235-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic principles applicable to arrests and crime prevention are comparable to those we have seen in connection with the defense of persons and property: In general terms, force must never be excessive in relation to the harm it seeks to prevent. As we shall see, however, the doctrinal specifics are somewhat different. And the social context is distinct: In urban areas, police are ubiquitous, they almost always carry firearms, and of great importance, police—unlike civilians—usually do not have the option to steer clear of dangerous situations. To the contrary, the potential for citizen misconduct and violence is ever-present in their working environment, and <i>their duty is not to avoid danger but to intervene</i>. Indeed, the capacity and authority to deploy non-negotiable force, and to do so quickly, 24/7, is what most centrally defines the police function and distinguishes it from other government agencies with responsibility for public health and safety (like Emergency Medical Services or the courts).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110DF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N110DF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">43</a></span> The ability to defuse conflict and prevent trouble on the spot, by force if necessary, is at the heart of what people expect when they “call the cops.”</p>
<p id="76ff3237-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The value of a police officer’s ability to deploy needed force quickly is matched, however, by its unique capacity to inflict unwarranted injury, inflame racial tension, and undermine the bonds of community when it is not carefully constrained. News reports of fatal police shootings and uses of excessive force against unarmed individuals, often minority youth, are tragically frequent. Victims like Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, and many others now have widely recognized <span title="938" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-938">p. 938</span>names,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110ED_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N110ED_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">44</a></span> prompting a national movement—“Black Lives Matter”—devoted in part to insisting that police exercise greater restraint in their use of force.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11103_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11103_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">45</a></span>

<p id="76ff3241-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These data underscore the importance of both the rules and the underlying “facts”—the standards that govern the use of force and the social, cultural, and perhaps racial presuppositions that shape whether a police officer has a “reasonable belief” that a suspect poses a serious threat. To be sure, criminal prosecutions in this area are rare, and convictions are rarer still; jurors are said to be “very reluctant to punish police officers, tending to view them as guardians of order.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11154_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11154_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">52</a></span> Nonetheless, the occasional prosecution has high visibility significance, and the legal standard is crucial in police training, civil-rights litigation, and damage suits brought by injured victims or their surviving relatives.

<i>NOTES ON THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK</i>

<p id="76ff5955-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Misdemeanors.</i> At common law, deadly force was never permissible simply to prevent a misdemeanor or to effect a misdemeanor arrest. For example, deadly force would not be justified simply to arrest a motorist for a traffic violation. But in practice things become more complicated because a mere traffic stop can quickly evolve into something more.</p>
<p id="76ff5956-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) When the misdemeanant flees.</i> The law has long been clear that an officer may not use deadly force to arrest a misdemeanor suspect who flees without resisting.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1117C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1117C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">53</a></span> But what if a suspect stopped for drunk driving flees at high speed, endangering other motorists? <i>Now</i> can the police shoot, on the theory that their purpose is not simply to make the arrest but to stop the drunk driver from killing innocent bystanders? In principle, the answer is yes—they can try to shoot out the tires and even shoot at the driver himself if his flight threatens others with death or great bodily harm. In Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012 (2014), a driver sped away from a traffic stop, swerving through traffic at high speed. Pursuing officers fired three shots into the car, and when the driver continued to flee, they fired 12 more times, killing the driver and his passenger. The Supreme Court held their actions permissible: “Rickard’s flight posed a grave public safety risk, and . . . the police acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk. . . . We reject the argument [that they acted unreasonably in firing 15 shots]. It stands to reason that, if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended.” Id. at 2022. The Court did not consider whether shooting at the tires was an option and if so whether shooting directly into the car instead was an unreasonable way to use the deadly force that was otherwise permissible.</p>
<p id="76ff5958-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compare Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007). When a deputy sheriff signaled Harris to pull over for speeding, Harris sped away at speeds exceeding 85 miles per hour. After a chase of nearly ten miles, one of the pursuing deputies sought to terminate it by ramming Harris’s car from the rear. Harris lost control of his vehicle, which overturned and crashed, leaving Harris badly injured and permanently quadriplegic. In a civil damage suit against the officer for having used excessive force, the officer largely conceded that his maneuver exposed Harris to a substantial risk of serious injury or death, thus amounting to “deadly force.” But the Court held that the tactic was unambiguously justified—and that the officer was therefore entitled to summary judgment dismissing the case—because the chase (which had been recorded on video) created great danger to innocent bystanders. The Court described Harris as “racing down narrow, two-lane roads in the dead of night at speeds that [were] shockingly fast” and “swerv[ing] around more than a dozen other cars”; his driving resembled “a Hollywood-style car chase of the most frightening sort.” <span title="940" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-940">p. 940</span>Id. at 379-380. But Justice Stevens in dissent saw the chase quite differently, describing it as</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ff5959-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">a nighttime chase on a lightly traveled road . . . where no pedestrians or other “bystanders” were present. [Harris,] though speeding, retained full control of his vehicle. . . . At no point [did he] pull into the opposite lane other than to pass a car in front of him; . . . at one point, . . . he slowed and waited for the cars traveling in the other direction to pass before overtaking the car in front of him. . . . This is hardly the stuff of Hollywood. To the contrary, the video does not reveal any incidents that could even be remotely characterized as “close calls.” [Harris’s] refusal to stop and subsequent flight was a serious offense. . . . It was not, however, a capital offense, or even an offense that justified the use of deadly force rather than an abandonment of the chase. [Officers] could have apprehended [Harris] later because they had his license plate number.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ff595a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A research team subsequently showed the <i>Scott v. Harris</i> video to a large, diverse sample of observers. Overall, a strong majority agreed with the Court majority’s perception of the issues, but there were sharp differences along cultural and ideological lines. Politically conservative, affluent white males were likely feel strongly that Harris was much more at fault than the police, that he posed a lethal threat to the public, and that the use of deadly force to terminate the chase was justified. In contrast, politically liberal and well-educated but less affluent individuals, especially African Americans and women, were much more likely to believe that Harris and the police were about equally at fault, that he did not pose a significant danger to the public, and that the police acted unreasonably in using deadly force to stop him.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111AB_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111AB_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">54</a></span>

<p id="76ff595e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) When the misdemeanant resists.</i> What rules should apply in a traffic stop if the motorist pulls a lawfully carried gun from the glove compartment and tells the officer to back off without issuing a ticket and let him proceed? Must the officer comply and let the traffic violation go unpunished? Or should she be entitled to call for back-up and use deadly force to effectuate the arrest? In practice such situations are less rare than we might suppose, partly because traffic stops sometimes involve mentally unstable motorists and partly because the officer may perceive a lethal threat in actions that are in fact innocent (for example, taking from the glove compartment a leather folder that holds the car registration). And bear in mind that the officer must make her decision quickly, sometimes in conditions of poor visibility. Should the officer be permitted to use her gun if deadly force reasonably seems the only way to make a successful arrest?</p>
<p id="76ff595f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic rule for these situations is that when a suspect resists, the officer may meet force with force, and if threatened with deadly force, she can <span title="941" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-941">p. 941</span>respond in kind, not simply because she is making an arrest, but because she needs to protect herself from the threat of death or great bodily harm. Note that the officer’s privilege here is “a different thing from self-defense, for it is [her] duty to push forward and make the arrest and to secure and retain custody of the prisoner.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111D3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111D3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">56</a></span> The practical effect of this rule, therefore, is that an officer <i>can</i> use lethal force in the context of a mere traffic stop or other minor misdemeanor offense (such as Eric Garner’s arrest on the charge of selling loose cigarettes<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111E1_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111E1_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">57</a></span>) whenever the suspect’s behavior gives the officer a “reasonable” fear of death or great bodily harm. Importantly, the fact that deadly force is <i>legally permissible</i> does not mean that the officer, in the sound exercise of her discretion, <i>should</i> use deadly force. Often the wiser course is to seek ways to de-escalate the situation.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ff8072-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions</i>: Does this framework strike the right balance? Or is it better to prohibit deadly force in some minor-offense situations that become threatening (or <i>seem</i> threatening to the officer)? If so, when <i>should</i> deadly force be permissible in misdemeanor enforcement? For discussion of possible approaches and the need for more careful examination of less intrusive ways to accomplish police objectives, see Lauryn P. Gouldin, Redefining Reasonable Seizures, 93 Denv. U.L. Rev. 53 (2015).</p>

<p id="76ff8073-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Felonies.</i> At common law, a peace officer was allowed to use deadly force to prevent any felony and to make any felony arrest. But over time the felony category expanded to include a wide range of less serious offenses, many of them nonviolent, and most felonies were no longer subject to the death penalty even after a formal trial and conviction. Under these circumstances, the use of deadly force to make <i>any</i> felony arrest became less and less tolerable. Eventually, common-law courts restricted deadly force to situations involving “forcible and atrocious crime.” See <i>Ceballos</i>, p. 930 supra. Similarly, the MPC stipulates that deadly force can be used to prevent a crime or effect an arrest only when “the crime for which the arrest is made involved conduct including the use or threatened use of deadly force; or . . . there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed.” See Model Penal Code §§3.07(2)(b)(iv), 3.07(5)(a)(i) &amp; (ii).</p>
<p id="76ff8074-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Constitutional limits also come into play because the Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures,” and an arrest—the quintessential seizure of the person—becomes unreasonable when effectuated by excessive force. In Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), a Memphis police officer responding to a nighttime burglary chased the 15-year-old suspect to a fence, which the teenager started to climb, with every chance of getting away. To prevent the suspect’s escape, the officer shot and killed him. The common law had always authorized apprehension by deadly force for a traditional <span title="942" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-942">p. 942</span>felony like burglary, but the Court held that shooting the suspect under these circumstances was “unreasonable,” in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Constitutionalizing a standard similar to that of MPC §3.07(2)(b), the Court declared that in order to use deadly force to prevent a felon’s escape, an officer must have “probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.” Id. at 11.</p>
<p id="76ff8075-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Intermediate measures?</i> In situations that do not warrant the use of “deadly” force, what means <i>can</i> the police deploy to stop a suspect from getting away? If a drunk driver flees from an attempted traffic stop, can pursuing officers radio ahead, asking colleagues to set up a roadblock to prevent his escape? Or is the roadblock itself a form of deadly force, because the speeding, intoxicated driver may be unable to stop in time and may be killed crashing into it at high speed?</p>
<p id="76ff8076-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are choke holds, electric cattle prods, night sticks, and pepper spray included in “deadly” force? A California police officer pursuing a suspect threatened to unleash his K-9 companion unless the suspect stopped. When the suspect refused to do so, the officer released the dog, who effected the arrest by catching up to the suspect, biting onto his right arm, and holding him until the officer ordered the dog to release its grip. The suspect sustained severe wounds to his upper arm, requiring surgery and eight days of hospitalization. Was this a use of “deadly force”? Was it permissible under <i>Garner</i>? See Vera Cruz v. City of Escondido, 139 F.3d 659 (9th Cir. 1997). Compare the definition of deadly force in Model Penal Code §3.11(2).</p>
<p id="76ff8077-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Tasers.</i> As an option to reduce the need to rely on firearms, many police departments use electric stun devices (“Tasers”) to subdue uncooperative arrestees. But is the Taser itself a form of deadly force? In Rodriguez v. Panarello, 119 F. Supp. 3d 331 (E.D. Pa. 2015), a suspect subdued by a Taser suffered a fall resulting in a spinal injury and paraplegia. Consider this description (Bryan v. MacPherson, 608 F.3d 614, 824-825 (9th Cir. 2010)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ff8078-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A Taser X26 . . . uses compressed nitrogen to propel a pair of “probes”—aluminum darts tipped with stainless steel barbs connected to the X26 by insulated wires—toward the target at a rate of over 160 feet per second. Upon striking a person, the X26 delivers a 1200 volt, low ampere electrical charge through the wires and probes and into his muscles. The impact is as powerful as it is swift. The electrical impulse instantly overrides the victim’s central nervous system, paralyzing the muscles throughout the body, rendering the target limp and helpless. The tasered person also experiences an excruciating pain that radiates throughout the body. [T]asers result in “immobilization, disorientation, loss of balance, and weakness,” even after the electrical current has ended. Moreover, tasering a person may result in serious injuries when intense pain and loss of muscle control cause a sudden and uncontrolled fall.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ff8079-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite these consequences, courts generally conclude that a Taser does not constitute “deadly” force. E.g., <i>Rodriguez</i>, supra. Still, is its use inappropriate, even unconstitutional, against nonviolent individuals suspected only of <span title="943" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-943">p. 943</span>minor offenses? In a number of traffic-stop cases, officers have used Tasers against motorists who refuse to get out of their vehicles as ordered or otherwise fail to comply with officer instructions. In Odom v. Matteo, 772 F. Supp. 2d 377 (D. Conn. 2011), an officer making a stop for minor traffic infractions ordered the driver to leave her car; when she hesitated to do so, wanting to wait until other officers arrived (because she was not sure the officer was in fact a police officer), he allegedly tasered her without warning. The courts agree that such actions, even when falling short of “deadly force,” are constitutionally excessive and that “[w]hether [the officer] reasonably interpreted [the driver’s] refusal as a realistic threat to his personal safety or whether it constituted nothing more than an affront to his command authority is a matter for a jury to decide.” Brown v. City of Golden Valley, 574 F.3d 491, 497 (8th Cir. 2009).</p>
<p id="76ff807a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if a suspect <i>does</i> act aggressively or resist arrest for a minor offense? <i>Then</i> should Tasers be permissible? In <i>Bryan v. MacPherson</i>, supra, a motorist (Bryan), stopped for a seat belt infraction, began to shout expletives and bang on his steering wheel. Though ordered to remain in his vehicle, he got out while still shouting expletives and “yelling gibberish.” Dressed only in boxer shorts, he was obviously unarmed, but when he continued to behave erratically, the officer used his Taser X26 to subdue him. Bryan fell to the ground, fracturing four teeth and suffering facial contusions. In a suit against the officer, Bryan described his own behavior as erratic but nonviolent; he emphasized that he was disturbed and upset but not immediately threatening and that none of the offenses of which he was suspected was inherently dangerous. The officer claimed that he reasonably believed Bryan had committed three misdemeanors in addition to the seat belt violation—resisting a police officer, failure to comply with a lawful order, and using or being under the influence of a controlled substance—and that he believed Bryan may have been mentally ill and thus subject to detention.</p>

<i>Questions</i>: Was this use of the Taser a legitimate way to protect the officer and bystanders by defusing a potentially dangerous situation and making more severe force unnecessary? The Ninth Circuit did not think so, noting that “if Officer MacPherson believed Bryan was mentally disturbed he should have made greater effort to take control of the situation through less intrusive means. . . . A mentally ill individual is in need of a doctor, not a jail cell” (id. at 829). Accordingly, the court held that the Taser constituted excessive, constitutionally impermissible force in these circumstances. Do you agree? If so, does the court’s result in effect subject Tasers to virtually the same limits that apply to police use of their firearms? What devices short of the Taser <i>should</i> be available for dealing with situations like that in the <i>Bryan</i> case? See Loan K. Le &amp; Maitria Moua, Civilian Oversight and Developments in Less Lethal Technologies: Weighing Risks and Prioritizing Accountability in Domestic Law Enforcement, 14 Seattle J. Soc.

<i>5. What is a “reasonable” fear? Are judgments tainted by consideration of race?</i> As we saw in connection the use of deadly force in ordinary <span title="944" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-944">p. 944</span>self-defense, rules on the books are often less important than whether intangible factors arouse perceptions of danger and whether such perceptions are “reasonable.” See p. 879-881 supra. The same issues become crucial in law enforcement, with the added complication that police officers confront potential danger far more often, and their duty requires them to intervene. The possibility for tragic mistakes is multiplied, and there is heightened concern about the potential for racial bias in on-the-spot contextual judgments. There are strongly suggestive indications of racial profiling in police assessments of the need to use lethal force, but the empirical evidence is mixed. In one well-designed study, officers were far more likely to see a need to use deadly force when the suspect was black, but another similarly designed study found no such effect with respect to deadly force (but did find racial bias with respect to the use of nondeadly force).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11266_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11266_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">28</a></span> Consider the comment that follows:</p>

</div><p id="76ffa791-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is ample statistical evidence of large and persistent racial bias in other areas—from labor markets to online retail markets. So I expected that police prejudice would be a major factor in accounting for the killings of African-Americans. But when I looked at the numbers, that’s not exactly what I found. . . . Police bias may well be a significant problem, but in accounting for why some of these encounters turn into killings, it is swamped by other, bigger problems that plague our society, our economy and our criminal justice system.</p><p id="76ffa792-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . African-Americans <i>are</i> being killed disproportionately and by a wide margin. And police bias may be responsible. But . . . there is another possibility. . . . African-Americans have a very large number of encounters with police officers. Every police encounter contains a risk: The officer might be poorly trained, might act with malice or simply make a mistake, and civilians might do something that is perceived as a threat. The omnipresence of guns exaggerates all these risks. [And] having more encounters with police officers, even with officers entirely free of racial bias, can create a greater risk of a fatal shooting.</p><p id="76ffa793-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arrest data lets us measure this possibility. For the entire country, 28.9 percent of arrestees were African-American. This number is not very different from the 31.8 percent of police-shooting victims who were African-Americans. . . . This in turn suggests that removing police racial bias [at the time of the encounter] will have little effect on the killing rate. [W]ith the current arrest rate, 28.9 percent of all those killed by police officers would still be African-American. This is only slightly smaller than the 31.8 percent of killings we actually see, and it is much greater than the 13.2 percent level of African-Americans in the overall population.</p><p id="76ffa794-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

Of course, with this as well, police prejudice may be playing a role. . . . But this is too large a problem to pin on individual officers.</p><p id="76ffa795-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[P]olice officers tend to be most active in poor neighborhoods, and African-Americans disproportionately live in poverty. [T]he deeper you look, the more it appears that the race problem revealed by the statistics reflects a larger problem: the structure of our society, our laws and policies.</p><p id="76ffa796-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The war on drugs illustrates this kind of racial bias. . . . Laws and policies need not explicitly discriminate to effectively discriminate. As Anatole France wrote centuries ago, “In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.” . . .  Poverty plays an essential role in all of this. . . . “Living in a high-poverty neighborhood increases risk of violent-crime involvement, and in the most poor neighborhoods of the country, fully four out of five residents are black or Hispanic.”</p><p id="76ffa797-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We will not sharply reduce police killings of African-Americans unless we understand the social institutions that intimately tie race and crime. . . . We should eliminate police prejudice because it is wrong and because it undermines our democracy. It blights—and all too often destroys—lives. But there are also structural problems underpinning these killings. We are all responsible for those.</p><p id="76ffa798-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

<span class="epub-small-caps">RYAN, J</span>. Defendant, Francis Unger, was [convicted of] the crime of escape and was . . . sentenced to a term of three to nine years to be served consecutively to the remainder of the sentence for which he was imprisoned at the time of the escape. The conviction was reversed upon appeal and the cause was remanded for a new trial. . . . We granted leave to appeal and now affirm the judgment of the appellate court.</p>
<p id="76ffceb0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of the present offense, the defendant was confined at the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois. Defendant was serving a one- to three-year term as a consequence of a conviction for auto theft. . . . On <span title="946" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-946">p. 946</span>February 23, 1972, the defendant was transferred to the prison’s minimum security, honor farm. It is undisputed that on March 7, 1972, the defendant walked off the honor farm. Defendant was apprehended two days later in a motel room in St. Charles, Illinois.</p>
<p id="76ffceb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, defendant testified that prior to his transfer to the honor farm he had been threatened by a fellow inmate. This inmate allegedly brandished a six-inch knife in an attempt to force defendant to engage in [sexual] activities. Defendant was 22 years old and weighed approximately 155 pounds. He testified that he did not report the incident to the proper authorities due to fear of retaliation. Defendant also testified that he is not a particularly good fighter.</p>
<p id="76ffceb2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant stated that after his transfer to the honor farm he was assaulted and sexually molested by three inmates, and he named the assailants at trial. The attack allegedly occurred on March 2, 1972, and from that date until his escape defendant received additional threats from inmates he did not know. On March 7, 1972, the date of the escape, defendant testified that he received a call on an institution telephone. Defendant testified that the caller, whose voice he did not recognize, threatened him with death because the caller had heard that defendant had reported the assault to prison authorities. Defendant said that he left the honor farm to save his life and that he planned to return once he found someone who could help him. None of these incidents were reported to the prison officials. As mentioned, defendant was apprehended two days later still dressed in his prison clothes. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ffceb3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following instruction (People’s Instruction No. 9) was given by the trial court over defendant’s objection. “The reasons, if any, given for the alleged escape are immaterial and not to be considered by you as in any way justifying or excusing, if there were in fact such reasons.” . . . The principal issue in the present appeal is whether it was error for the court to instruct the jury that it must disregard the reasons given for defendant’s escape and to conversely refuse to instruct the jury on the statutory defenses of compulsion and necessity. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ffceb4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditionally, the courts have been reluctant to permit the defenses of compulsion and necessity to be relied upon by escapees. This reluctance appears to have been primarily grounded upon considerations of public policy. Several recent decisions, however, have recognized the applicability of the compulsion and necessity defenses to prison escapes. In People v. Harmon (1974), 220 N.W.2d 212, the defense of duress was held to apply in a case where the defendant alleged that he escaped in order to avoid repeated homosexual attacks from fellow inmates. In People v. Lovercamp (1974), 43 Cal. App. 3d 823, a limited defense of necessity was held to be available to two defendants whose escapes were allegedly motivated by fear of homosexual attacks.</p>
<p id="76ffceb5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As illustrated by <i>Harmon</i> and <i>Lovercamp</i>, different courts have reached similar results in escape cases involving sexual abuse, though the question was analyzed under different defense theories. A certain degree of confusion has resulted from the recurring practice on the part of the courts to use the terms <span title="947" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-947">p. 947</span>“compulsion” (duress) and “necessity” interchangeably, though the defenses are theoretically distinct. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ffceb6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the defense of necessity . . . is the appropriate defense in the present case. [T]he defendant here was not deprived of his free will by the threat of imminent physical harm which, according to the Committee Comments, appears to be the intended interpretation of the defense of compulsion as set out in section 7-11 of the Criminal Code. . . . Rather, if defendant’s testimony is believed, he was forced to choose between two admitted evils by the situation which arose from actual and threatened homosexual assaults and fears of reprisal. Though the defense of compulsion would be applicable in the unlikely event that a prisoner was coerced by the threat of imminent physical harm to perform the specific act of escape, no such situation is involved in the present appeal. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ffceb7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant’s testimony was clearly sufficient to raise the affirmative defense of necessity [as] defined by statute (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 38, par. 7-13):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ffceb8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conduct which would otherwise be an offense is justifiable by reason of necessity if the accused was without blame in occasioning or developing the situation and reasonably believed such conduct was necessary to avoid a public or private injury greater than the injury which might reasonably result from his own conduct.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ffceb9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant testified that he was subjected to threats of forced homosexual activity and that, on one occasion, the threatened abuse was carried out. He also testified that he was physically incapable of defending himself and that he feared greater harm would result from a report to the authorities. Defendant further testified that just prior to his escape he was told that he was going to be killed, and that he therefore fled the honor farm in order to save his life. Though the State’s evidence cast a doubt upon the defendant’s motives for escape and upon the reasonableness of defendant’s assertion that such conduct was necessary, the defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the defense on the basis of his testimony. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ffceba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State, however, would have us apply a more stringent test to prison escape situations. The State refers to the <i>Lovercamp</i> decision, where . . . it was held that the defense of necessity need be submitted to the jury only where five conditions had been met. Those conditions are: “(1) The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future; (2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints . . . ; (3) There is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts; (4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other ‘innocent’ persons in the escape; and (5) The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.”</p>
<p id="76ffcebb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State correctly points out that the defendant never informed the authorities of his situation and failed to report immediately after securing a position of safety. Therefore, it is contended that, under the authority of <span title="948" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-948">p. 948</span><i>Lovercamp,</i> defendant is not entitled to a necessity instruction. We agree . . . that the above conditions are relevant factors to be used in assessing claims of necessity. We cannot say, however, that the existence of each condition is, as a matter of law, necessary to establish a meritorious necessity defense.</p>
<p id="76fff5cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The preconditions set forth in <i>Lovercamp</i> are, in our view, matters which go to the weight and credibility of the defendant’s testimony. . . . The absence of one or more of the elements listed in <i>Lovercamp</i> would not necessarily mandate a finding that the defendant could not assert the defense of necessity.</p>
<p id="76fff5cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]n the present case . . . defendant never voluntarily turned himself in to the proper officials. However, defendant testified that he intended to return to the prison upon obtaining legal advice from an attorney and claimed that he was attempting to get money from friends to pay for such counsel. Regardless of our opinion as to the believability of defendant’s tale, this testimony, if accepted by the jury, would have negated any negative inference which would arise from defendant’s failure to report to proper authorities after the escape. The absence of one of the <i>Lovercamp</i> preconditions does not alone disprove the claim of necessity and should not, therefore, automatically preclude an instruction on the defense. We therefore reject the contention that the availability of the necessity defense be expressly conditioned upon the elements set forth in <i>Lovercamp.</i>
</p>
<p id="76fff5ce-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[U]nder the facts and circumstances of the present case the defendant was entitled to submit his defense of necessity to the jury. It was, therefore, reversible error to give People’s Instruction No. 9 to the jury and to refuse to give an appropriate instruction defining the defense of necessity, such as the instruction tendered by the defendant. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fff5cf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">UNDERWOOD, J</span>., dissenting: My disagreement with my colleagues stems from an uneasy feeling that their unconditional recognition of necessity as a defense to the charge of escape carries with it the seeds of future troubles. Unless narrowly circumscribed, the availability of that defense could encourage potential escapes, disrupt prison discipline, and could even result in injury to prison guards, police or private citizens. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76fff5d0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I am not totally insensitive to the sometimes brutal and unwholesome problems faced by prison inmates, and the frequency of sexually motivated assaults. Prisoner complaints to unconcerned or understaffed prison administrations may produce little real help to a prisoner or may actually increase the hazard from fellow inmates of whose conduct complaint has been made. Consequently, and until adequate prison personnel and facilities are realities, I agree that a necessity defense should be recognized. The interests of society are better served, however, if the use of that defense in prison-escape cases is confined within well-defined boundaries such as those in <i>Lovercamp.</i> In that form it will be available, but with limitations precluding its wholesale use.</p>
<p id="76fff5d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is undisputed that defendant here did not meet those conditions. . . .  Rather, he stole a truck some nine hours after his escape, drove to Chicago, and later drove to St. Charles, using the telephone to call friends in Canada. <span title="949" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-949">p. 949</span>This conduct, coupled with his admitted intent to leave in order to gain publicity for what he considered an unfair sentence, severely strain the credibility of his testimony regarding his intention to return to the prison.</p>

<i>1. The Supreme Court’s view.</i> In United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394 (1980), the Supreme Court held, contrary to <i>Unger</i> but in accord with <i>Lovercamp</i>, that a prerequisite for invoking the necessity defense in a federal prosecution for prison escape is that the defendant make a bona fide effort to surrender or return “as soon as the duress or necessity had lost its coercive force.”</p>

<i>2. What are the potential harms of escape?</i> Consider the following comment on the balance of evils in a prison escape case (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comments to §3.02 at 12 n.5 (1985)): “The harm sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense may be viewed broadly. . . . For example, a court could consider whether recognition of the defense when a prisoner has escaped to avoid assault would have the effect of substantially encouraging unjustified escapes.”</p>

<i>3. The legality principle.</i> What perils are created by the elasticity of the necessity defense? We saw earlier, in the section on the principle of legality, p. 158 supra, that vagueness is regarded as a serious evil in the criminal law. See especially pp. 185-202 supra. Is vagueness less offensive when it affects defenses to, rather than definitions of, criminal conduct?</p>

<p id="77001cf1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Which harms count? (a) Natural events only?</i> Notice that both the Illinois and MPC formulations do not restrict the perils that can trigger a necessity defense. In some jurisdictions, however, the defense is available only when the threatened harm results from <i>natural events</i> (such as a snowstorm or flood). See, e.g., Wis. Stat. §939.47 (2016) (limiting the defense to “[p]ressure of natural physical forces”). In these jurisdictions, perils due to the wrongful acts of others (as in <i>Unger</i>) can only support a defense of “duress,” which is subject to different limitations. See pp. 985-1003 infra.</p>
<p id="77001cf2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) An imminence requirement?</i> Recall that Unger’s necessity claim was based on a death threat he had received over the prison telephone. But at the time he escaped, the caller was not about to strike; if Unger had identified the potential assailant and approached him from behind, he would not have been entitled to kill in self-defense because the execution of the threat was not “imminent.” See p. 910 supra. Instead, however, Unger took a less extreme self-protective measure—in a sense, he simply chose to “retreat.”</p>
<p id="77001cf3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Illinois and MPC formulations do not restrict the necessity defense to situations where harm to the defendant was imminent. Some jurisdictions, however, allow the defense only where the defendant faced “clear and imminent danger.” Commonwealth v. Brugmann, 433 N.E.2d 457, 461 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982). See also N.Y. Penal Law §35.05(2) (2016), limiting the defense to situations in which the defendant’s conduct was “necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur . . . through no fault of the actor. . . . ”</p>
<p id="77001cf4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which approach is preferable? Consider Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §3.02 at 17, 19-21 (1985):</p>

<i>2. Statutes that preempt the balancing of evils.</i> In most states, as under the MPC, “the general choice of evils defense cannot succeed if the issue of competing values has been previously foreclosed by a deliberate legislative choice, as when some provision of the law deals explicitly with the specific situation . . . or a legislative purpose to exclude the claimed justification otherwise appears.”

The defendants’ argument raises the issue of jury nullification, not the defense of necessity. . . .

<i>3. Necessity and clean hands.</i> Suppose that one of Unger’s fellow prisoners had threatened to kill him because Unger had (a) accused the other man of being a sexual pervert; or (b) assaulted the other man. Note that Unger would no longer have a defense under the Illinois necessity provision. Does that result make sense? If commission of an offense can avert serious harm in an unforeseen emergency, why should the law prohibit the defendant from taking steps to leave society better off? Consider Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra:</p>

<i>4. Necessity and mens rea.</i> Lawrence Tiffany &amp; Carl Anderson, Legislating the Necessity Defense in Criminal Law, 52 Denv. L.J. 839, 861-862 (1975), write:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7700440c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A question which needs to be clarified is posed by LaFave and Scott: “<i>A</i>, driving a car, suddenly finds himself in a predicament where he must either <span title="952" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-952">p. 952</span>run down <i>B</i> or hit <i>C</i>’s house and he reasonably chooses the latter, unfortunately killing two people in the house who by bad luck happened to be just at that place inside the house where <i>A</i>’s car struck. . . . ”</p>
<p id="7700440d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the defendant [charged with reckless or negligent homicide] is guilty of no crime to begin with. . . . Defendant needs no general justification defense when charged with a crime based on recklessness or negligence since it is implicit in the charge itself that the defendant’s conduct was not [culpable]; [the culpability of the conduct—taking a risk with awareness (or negligent failure to be aware) of an <i>unjustifiable</i> risk—] becomes an element of the charge itself and must be proved by the state.</p>
</div>
<p id="7700440e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider Axelberg v. Commr. of Pub. Safety, 848 N.W.2d 206 (Minn. 2014). After defendant Jennifer Axelberg and her husband Jason Axelberg had spent an evening drinking, they got into a violent argument. Jennifer fled to her car and locked the doors, but Jason continued to yell at her and hit the car several times, eventually breaking the windshield. Fearing for her safety, Jennifer drove away, with Jason pursuing her on foot, while a witness called 911. When officers arrived at the scene, they arrested Jason and then arrested Jennifer for “driving while impaired”; her blood-alcohol level tested at double the legal limit. As Tiffany &amp; Anderson explain, supra, if Jennifer had hit and killed another driver while fleeing from Jason, the circumstances presumably could be considered in determining whether she was guilty of involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide. But if she is prosecuted for “driving while impaired,” does she have a mens rea defense? The peril posed by Jason does not seem relevant to whether she knew (or should have known) that she was alcohol-impaired. Should she nonetheless have a necessity defense? How does the peril she was fleeing compare to the peril she posed to other drivers on the road?</p>
<p id="7700440f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compare State v. Rasmussen, 524 N.W.2d 843 (N.D. 1994). The defendant’s license to drive had been suspended. On a bitterly cold night, he found himself stranded on the highway after the person driving him had left to get help. When the driver did not return, Rasmussen started the car and drove away. He was caught and prosecuted for driving while suspended—a strict liability offense. Should he be able to assert a necessity defense when the underlying crime does not require mens rea? If necessity is an excuse—if it identifies cases in which blame for a wrongful act should not be imposed—then the defense should not be available, because a strict liability offense, by definition, permits conviction even in the absence of fault. But if necessity is a justification—if it identifies cases in which the defendant’s conduct was not wrongful at all—then the defense <i>should</i> be considered, because it claims that the defendant’s conduct was not wrongful. Which is it?</p>

<i>1. Slippery slope harms?</i> Consider Commonwealth v. Hutchins, 575 N.E.2d 741 (Mass. 1991). Defendant was charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana.

The judge denied the offer of proof on the ground that it would not support a necessity defense, and the defendant was convicted. On appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77006a23-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our view, the alleviation of the defendant’s medical symptoms, the importance to the defendant of which we do not underestimate, would not clearly and significantly outweigh the potential harm to the public were we to declare that the defendant’s cultivation of marihuana and its use for his medicinal purposes may not be punishable.

In my view, the harm to an individual in having to endure such symptoms may well outweigh society’s generalized interest in prohibiting him or her from using the marihuana in such circumstances.</p>

<i>2. Judicial disagreement.</i> Courts remain divided over whether to permit a necessity defense for medical uses of marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of severe illness. Compare State v. Kurtz, 309 P.3d 472 (Wash. 2013) (allowing the defense), with State v. Bonjour, 694 N.W.2d 511 (Iowa 2005) (denying the defense). Several states have statutory exceptions to their antidrug laws for such cases. Indeed, 25 states and the District of Columbia now allow the medical use of marijuana. In California, the Compassionate Use Act authorizes the possession and use of marijuana when recommended by a physician. Other states have taken a narrower approach. Vermont allows the defense only when the marijuana is grown indoors by a registered caregiver; a woman who grew marijuana for her son, who suffered from a painful medical condition, was denied the defense because she failed to comply with <span title="954" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-954">p. 954</span>the statutory conditions. State v. Thayer, 14 A.3d 231 (2010). Virginia legislation permits the use of marijuana for glaucoma and cancer patients; because other diseases are not mentioned, the necessity defense was denied to a man who used marijuana to treat debilitating migraine headaches that did not respond to prescription medications. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 521 S.E.2d 301 (Va. Ct. App. 1999).</p>
<p id="77006a29-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even in states that recognize a medical necessity exception to their state antidrug laws, there remains the question whether individuals can be subject to <i>federal</i> prosecution. Federal law prohibits distribution of any “controlled substance,” 28 U.S.C. §841(a)(1), and posits that, as a matter of federal law, marijuana is a controlled substance for which there is “[no] currently accepted medical use.” As a result, the Supreme Court has held that Congress intended to preclude any medical necessity defense to a prosecution under §841(a)(1) and that the federal prohibition takes precedence over any more permissive standards under state law. United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative, 532 U.S. 483 (2001). Three concurring justices stressed, however, that the decision to preclude a necessity defense applies only to prosecutions under §841(a)(1) for drug distribution; accordingly, the defense may remain available in other contexts, such as the prosecution of individual users. But if a cancer patient is <i>justified</i> in buying and using marijuana to alleviate her extreme pain, how can the seller <i>not</i> be justified in selling the drug to her for that purpose?</p>
<p id="77006a2a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 2014 and again in 2015, Congress prohibited the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent designated states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.”

<span class="epub-small-caps">BOOCHEVER, J</span>.: Gregory Schoon, Raymond Kennon, Jr., and Patricia Manning appeal their convictions for obstructing activities of the Internal Revenue Service Office in Tucson, Arizona. [The] charges stem from their activities in protest of United States involvement in El Salvador. They claim the district court improperly denied them a necessity defense. Because we hold the necessity defense inapplicable in cases like this, we affirm.</p><p id="7700914b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On December 4, 1989, thirty people, including appellants, gained admittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted “keep America’s tax dollars out of El Salvador,” splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the office’s operation. After a federal police officer ordered the group, on several occasions, to disperse or face arrest, appellants were arrested.</p><p id="7700914c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a bench trial, appellants proffered testimony about conditions in El Salvador as the motivation for their conduct. They attempted to assert a necessity defense, essentially contending that their acts in protest of American involvement in El Salvador were necessary to avoid further bloodshed in that country. While finding appellants motivated solely by humanitarian concerns, the court nonetheless precluded the defense as a matter of law. . . . 
</p><p id="7700914d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To invoke the necessity defense . . . the defendants colorably must have shown that: (1) they were faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) they acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) they reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between their conduct and the harm to be averted; and (4) they had no legal alternatives to violating the law. The district court denied the necessity defense on the grounds that (1) the requisite immediacy was lacking; (2) the actions taken would not abate the evil; and (3) other legal <span title="957" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-957">p. 957</span>alternatives existed. Because the threshold test for admissibility of a necessity defense is a conjunctive one, a court may preclude invocation of the defense if “proof is deficient with regard to any of the four elements.”</p><p id="7700914e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While we could affirm substantially on those grounds relied upon by the district court, we find a deeper, systemic reason for the complete absence of federal case law recognizing a necessity defense in an indirect civil disobedience case. As used in this opinion, “civil disobedience” is the wilful violation of a law, undertaken for the purpose of social or political protest. Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law or interfering with a government policy that is not, itself, the object of protest. Direct civil disobedience, on the other hand, involves protesting the existence of a law by breaking that law or by preventing the execution of that law in a specific instance in which a particularized harm would otherwise follow. This case involves indirect civil disobedience because these protestors were not challenging the laws under which they were charged. In contrast, the civil rights lunch counter sit-ins, for example, constituted direct civil disobedience because the protestors were challenging the rule that prevented them from sitting at lunch counters. . . . Today, we conclude, for the reasons stated below, that the necessity defense is inapplicable to cases involving indirect civil disobedience.</p><p id="7700b85f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Necessity is, essentially, a utilitarian defense . . . , maximizing social welfare by allowing a crime to be committed where the social benefits of the crime outweigh the social costs of failing to commit the crime. . . . What all the traditional necessity cases have in common is that the commission of the “crime” averted the occurrence of an even greater “harm.” In some sense, the necessity defense allows us to act as individual legislatures, amending a particular criminal provision or crafting a one-time exception to it, subject to court review, when a real legislature would formally do the same under those circumstances. For example, by allowing prisoners who escape a burning jail to claim the justification of necessity, we assume the lawmaker, confronting this problem, would have allowed for an exception to the law proscribing prison escapes.</p><p id="7700b860-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the necessity doctrine is utilitarian, however, strict requirements contain its exercise so as to prevent nonbeneficial criminal conduct. . . . 
</p><p id="7700b861-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Analysis of three of the necessity defense’s four elements leads us to the conclusion that necessity can never be proved in a case of indirect civil disobedience. We do not rely upon the imminent harm prong of the defense because we believe there can be indirect civil disobedience cases in which the protested harm is imminent.</p><p id="7700b862-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Indirect civil disobedience seeks first and foremost to bring about the repeal of a law or a change of governmental policy, attempting to mobilize public opinion through typically symbolic action. These protestors violate a law, not because it is unconstitutional or otherwise improper, but because doing so calls public attention to their objectives. . . . However, the mere existence of a constitutional law or governmental policy cannot constitute a legally cognizable harm.</p><p id="7700b863-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] court [must also] judge the likelihood that an alleged harm will be abated by the taking of illegal action. . . . In the traditional cases, a prisoner flees a <span title="958" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-958">p. 958</span>burning cell and averts death, or someone demolishes a home to create a firebreak and prevents the conflagration of an entire community. The nexus between the act undertaken and the result sought is a close one. . . . 
</p><p id="7700b864-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In political necessity cases involving indirect civil disobedience against congressional acts, however, the act alone is unlikely to abate the evil precisely because the action is indirect. Here, the IRS obstruction [is] unlikely to abate the killings in El Salvador, or immediately change Congress’s policy; instead, it takes another volitional actor not controlled by the protestor to take a further step; Congress must change its mind.</p><p id="7700b865-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A final reason the necessity defense does not apply to these indirect civil disobedience cases is that . . . the harm indirect civil disobedience aims to prevent is the continued existence of a law or policy. [T]he “possibility” that Congress will change its mind is sufficient in the context of the democratic process to make lawful political action a reasonable alternative to indirect civil disobedience. [P]etitioning Congress to change a policy is always a legal alternative in such cases, regardless of the likelihood of the plea’s success. . . . 
</p><p id="7700b866-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, we see the failure of any federal court to recognize a defense of necessity in a case like ours not as coincidental, but rather as the natural consequence of the historic limitation of the doctrine. Indirect protests of congressional policies can never meet all the requirements of the necessity doctrine. Therefore, we hold that the necessity defense is not available in such cases.</p><p id="7700b867-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Affirmed.</p></div>

<i>2. A sequel.</i> A modern variant on <i>Dudley and Stephens</i> occurred in a 1987 tragedy at Zeebrugge, Belgium. The ferry <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i>, lacking an adequate system to signal when its doors were properly shut, suddenly sank as it left port, trapping dozens of passengers inside. The safety problems were attributed to “tough competition” and “the reluctance of the ferry operators . . . to incur extra costs.”

At one point a passenger climbing the ladder froze in panic and refused repeated commands to move. Those below him then pulled him off the ladder, and he drowned. A coroner mentioned the possibility of murder charges but concluded that the actions taken were “a reasonable act of what is known as self-preservation.” See Neil Hanson, The Custom of the Sea 301 (2000).</p>

<i>3. An overloaded boat.</i> The American case referred to in Lord Coleridge’s opinion was United States v. Holmes, 26 F. Cas. 360 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1842). Following a shipwreck, the first mate, eight seamen, and 32 passengers were cast adrift on a life boat. The boat was grossly overcrowded and sprang a leak, making it necessary to bail constantly in order to stay afloat. Rough seas made bailing difficult, and after a day and half, the boat was in danger of sinking. To lighten the boat, the first mate ordered all male passengers whose wives were not in the boat to be thrown overboard. Eighteen passengers were jettisoned before a rescue ship arrived. Subsequently, Holmes, one of the crew who assisted in ejecting the passengers, was charged with <span title="960" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-960">p. 960</span>manslaughter, after the grand jury declined to indict for murder. The trial judge charged the jury that if two persons face a situation in which only one can survive “neither is bound to save the other’s life by sacrificing his own, nor would either commit a crime in saving his own life for the only means of safety”; that while this principle prevailed between sailor and sailor it did not prevail between sailor and passenger because of the special duty owed the latter by the former; that absent this special relationship the choice of who should be sacrificed must be made by lot, since “[i]n no other way than this or some like way are those having equal rights put on an equal footing, and in no other way is it possible to guard against partiality and oppression, violence and conflict. . . . ” Holmes was convicted and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and a fine of $20. Shortly thereafter the penalty was remitted.</p>

<i>4. When the stakes are not in doubt.</i> In his opinion in <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, Lord Coleridge argues that it was not certain the defendants had to kill Parker, and that “they might possibly have been picked up next day by a passing ship; they might possibly not have been picked up at all; in either case it is obvious that the killing of the boy would have been an unnecessary and profitless act.” But suppose there had been certainty on the key points?

Suppose, for example, that the actor makes a breach in a dike, knowing that this will inundate a farm, but taking the only course available to save a whole town. If he is charged with homicide of the inhabitants of the farm house, he can rightly point out that the object of the law of homicide is to save life, and that by his conduct he has <span title="961" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-961">p. 961</span>effected a net saving of innocent lives. The life of every individual must be taken in such a case to be of equal value and the numerical preponderance in the lives saved compared to those sacrificed surely should establish legal justification for the act. So too, a mountaineer, roped to a companion who has fallen over a precipice, who holds on as long as possible but eventually cuts the rope, must certainly be granted the defense that he accelerated one death slightly but avoided the only alternative, the certain death of both. Although the view is not universally held that it is ethically preferable to take one innocent life than to have many lives lost, most persons probably think a net saving of lives is ethically warranted if the choice among lives to be saved is not unfair.

But if the driver faints, the dilemma is perhaps different because the bystander who can throw the switch has no duty to act.

His only chance is to throw a hand grenade through his assailants’ window. Under the MPC and American law he will be legally justified in doing so. His right to resist the aggressors’ threat is determinative. The lives of the terrorist’s legally insane husband and their child carry no weight because all of them are aggressors who threaten his right to life.</p>
<p id="77012dbd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What if the terrorist’s target knows there is a woman in an adjoining flat who will surely be killed by the grenade blast? Now under the MPC necessity principle, the official arguably is <i>not</i> justified in throwing the grenade (though he might be excused), for his action will not result in a net saving of nonaggressor lives.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11710_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11710_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">69</a></span>
</p>
<p id="77012dbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, what if the terrorists are directing the machine gun against <i>two</i> government officials? Now, the MPC’s lesser-evil doctrine <i>does</i> allow the first official to throw the grenade: The right of the innocent person in the adjoining flat is the same, but her claim of right would yield to the maximizing-life <span title="963" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-963">p. 963</span>principle that the other two innocent lives are to be preferred over her one life.</p>
<p id="77012dc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This last case reveals an anomaly in the MPC approach: Rights prevail over lives (even multiple innocent lives) in the aggression cases, but lives prevail over rights in the bystander cases like this last one or the flood-deflection and trolley cases. To the extent this is the law, a bystander’s right against aggression sometimes yields to a utilitarian assessment in terms of net saving of lives. Yet, this is not always so, because we can be sure courts would not permit some killings that result in a net saving of lives—for example, killing a person to obtain his organs, even when that step might be necessary to save the lives of several other people. Indeed, courts presumably would not permit removing just one of his kidneys against his will, even though that action could save someone <i>without</i> killing him. This evidences an acute moral unease with reliance on a utilitarian calculus for assessing the justification of intended killings, even to achieve a net savings of lives.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Should it matter whether the net savings of life is achieved by steps <i>designed</i> to kill innocent bystanders, rather than just by steps that the actor knows will kill them as an undesired but inevitable side effect? In <i>Dudley and Stephens</i>, the defendants maximized their chances of survival by cutting Parker’s throat. Many condemn this action but nonetheless think it is not necessarily wrong for a ship’s passenger who falls overboard to grasp the only plank in sight and push another man off of it, hoping that the other man will be rescued but knowing that he will almost certainly drown. Similarly, in armed conflict, it is unquestionably a war crime to shoot civilians in order to coerce an opposing army to surrender, but it is often permissible to bomb a vital ammunition dump, even when doing so will inevitably kill just as many civilians. Does it make sense to view these two cases (killing on purpose and killing knowingly but not on purpose) so differently? There is a large literature on whether the distinction is sound and if so, what the moral basis for it is.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1173A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1173A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">70</a></span> But there is no doubt that many moral intuitions—not to mention the entire structure of rules governing lethal force in warfare—lead to sharp differences in how the two situations are treated.

<i>2.</i> The case of Re A (children), [2000] 9 BHRC 261 (Ct. App., Civil Div.), involved conjoined twins, connected at the lower abdomen. Each had all her own vital organs, but they shared a common artery that enabled the stronger twin (Jodie) to circulate blood to both of them. If they were separated, the weaker twin (Mary) would die almost immediately, but if they were not separated, both would die within three to six months, because the strain of supporting both bodies would eventually cause Jodie’s heart to fail. The parents refused to consent to the operation because “as devout Roman Catholics they sincerely believe that their children . . . must be left in God’s hands.” Id. at 268. Convinced that the parents’ decision was not in the best interest of the children, doctors petitioned for a court order permitting them to perform surgery in order to save Jodie’s life. The English Court of Appeal acknowledged that “the operation will be an active invasion of Mary’s body and by that act the doctors will kill her” (id. at 312). But the court nonetheless authorized the procedure as the lesser evil, and the parents chose not to seek review in the House of Lords.

<span class="epub-small-caps">JUSTICE BARAK, PRESIDENT:</span> The General Security Service (hereinafter, the “GSS”) investigates individuals suspected of committing crimes against Israel’s security. [Administrative directives] authorize investigators to apply physical means against those undergoing interrogation (for instance, shaking the suspect,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN117B5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N117B5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> [sleep deprivation, and forcing the suspect to wait in painful positions]). The basis for permitting such methods is that they are deemed immediately necessary for saving human lives.</p>
<p id="770154e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Israeli authorities had issued “directives” authorizing GSS interrogators to use physical means under restricted circumstances. The directives instructed the officer in charge to weigh the severity and urgency of the attack that an interrogation was intended to prevent and to seek alternative means of averting the danger. They also required that before using such measures, the investigator would evaluate the suspect’s health and “ensure that no harm comes to him.” The GSS argued that such measures had helped thwart specific bombing attempts in the past and were “indispensable to its ability to thwart deadly terrorist attacks” in the future.</p>

<p id="770154e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State of Israel has been engaged in an unceasing struggle for both its very existence and security, from the day of its founding. Terrorist organizations have established as their goal Israel’s annihilation. . . . They carry out terrorist attacks in which scores are murdered in . . . public transportation, city squares and centers, theaters and coffee shops. They do not distinguish between men, women and children. They act out of cruelty and without mercy. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770154e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts presented before this Court reveal that one hundred and twenty one people died in terrorist attacks between 1.1.96 to 14.5.98.

<p id="770154e6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court addressed two issues: whether GSS’s general mandate to conduct interrogations encompassed the authority to use physical means and, if not, whether in exceptional situations such an authority could be based on the concept of “necessity.” On the first issue, the court noted that “a reasonable investigation is likely to cause discomfort” for the suspect but concluded nonetheless that in ordinary cases interrogation must be “free of torture, free of cruel, inhuman treatment of the subject and free of any degrading handling whatsoever.” Under both Israeli law and International Law, the court said, “[t]hese prohibitions are ‘absolute.’ There are no exceptions to them and there is no room for balancing.”

<p id="77017bf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Shaking] harms the suspect’s body. It violates his dignity. [T]here is no doubt that shaking is not to be resorted to . . . as part of an “ordinary” investigation. [Similarly,] there is no inherent investigative need for seating the suspect on a chair so low and tilted forward towards the ground, in a manner that causes him real pain and suffering [the so-called Shabach position]. These methods . . . impinge upon the suspect’s dignity, his bodily integrity and his basic rights in an excessive manner.

<p id="77017bfa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person will not bear criminal liability for committing any act immediately necessary for the purpose of saving the life, liberty, body or property, of either himself or his fellow person, from substantial danger of serious harm, imminent from the particular circumstances, at the requisite [time], and absent alternative means for avoiding the harm.</p>
</div>
<p id="77017bfb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State’s position is that by virtue of this “defence” to criminal liability, GSS investigators are also authorized to apply physical means, such as shaking, in the appropriate circumstances, in order to prevent serious harm to human life or body, in the absence of other alternatives. The State maintains that an act committed under conditions of “necessity” [is] a deed that society has an interest in encouraging. . . . Not only is it legitimately permitted to engage in the fighting of terrorism, it is our moral duty to employ the necessary means for this purpose. . . . As this is the case, there is no obstacle preventing the investigators’ superiors from instructing and guiding them with regard to when the conditions of the “necessity” defence are fulfilled.</p>

<p id="77017bfd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are prepared to assume that—although this matter is open to debate— . . . the “necessity” exception is likely to arise in instances of “ticking time bombs,” and that the immediate need [required by the statute] refers to the imminent nature of the act rather than that of the danger. Hence, the imminence criteria is satisfied even if the bomb is set to explode in a few days, or perhaps even after a few weeks, provided the danger is certain to materialize and there is no alternative means of preventing its materialization. . . .

<p id="7701a311-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This decision opens with a description of the difficult reality in which Israel finds herself securitywise. . . . We are aware that this decision does not ease dealing with that reality. This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual’s liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day, they [add to] its strength. . . . If it will nonetheless be decided that it is appropriate for Israel, in light of its security difficulties, to sanction physical means in interrogations . . . , this is an issue that must be decided by the legislative branch . . . , provided, of course, that a law infringing upon a suspect’s liberty “befitting the values of the State of Israel,” is enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required.

<i>1. The tactics used.</i> Do you agree that the necessity defense should be available to an interrogator who uses physical means against a suspected terrorist, in hopes of locating a “ticking time bomb”?

<i>2. The Bybee Memorandum.</i> The question whether a necessity defense could ever be available when interrogators use severe physical and psychological coercion was given an affirmative answer in the “Bybee Memorandum,” an analysis submitted to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee, head of the Justice Department’s <span title="969" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-969">p. 969</span>Office of Legal Counsel, on August 1, 2002.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN118A9_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N118A9_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">71</a></span> When the document became public, it triggered a political firestorm, and soon thereafter it was withdrawn “in its entirety.”

<p id="7701a31e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that torture, a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. §2340A, is defined in 18 U.S.C. §2340(1) as “an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon a person within his custody or physical control.” In one of its most controversial sections, the Bybee Memorandum set an exceptionally high threshold for the degree of pain necessary to constitute torture. But it also went on to argue that even if a government interrogator were to use methods of that especially painful sort, a necessity defense could still be available. There being no federal statutory provision specifically authorizing or foreclosing a necessity defense, the Memorandum discusses the defense in terms of general common-law principles:</p>

Clearly, any harm that might occur during an interrogation would pale to insignificance compared to the harm avoided by preventing such an attack, which could take hundreds or thousands of lives.</p>
<p id="7701ca30-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this calculus, two factors will help indicate when the necessity defense could appropriately be invoked. First, the more certain that government officials are that a particular individual has information needed to prevent an attack, the more necessary interrogation will be. Second, the more likely it appears to be that a terrorist attack is likely to occur, and the greater the amount of damage expected from such an attack, the more that an interrogation to get information would become necessary. Of course, the strength of the necessity defense depends on the circumstances that prevail, and the knowledge of the government actors involved when the interrogation is conducted.</p>

<i>Questions: (a) Scope of the defense.</i> The necessity defense outlined in the Bybee Memorandum does not appear limited to <span title="970" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-970">p. 970</span>“ticking time bomb” scenarios. Should it be? Under the logic of a cost-benefit calculus, society could arguably gain, on balance, even when the probability of an attack is not high, provided that the loss of life, if the attack occurs, would be extensive. If so, does that conclusion suggest that the necessity defense should not be confined to “ticking time bomb” cases? Or does that conclusion suggest that the logic of ordinary cost-benefit calculus is flawed in this context?</p>
<p id="7701ca32-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Potential benefits?</i> Note the two factors that the Bybee Memorandum identifies as governing the cost-benefit equation: the likelihood that an individual has information and the likelihood that a damaging attack will occur. But what of the possibility that the individual subjected to torture, even if he has information, may not reveal it in time for it to be of value? The Memorandum may be assuming that this is only a minor qualification—most interrogation experts agree that torture almost always succeeds in getting individuals to talk. Experts are by no means agreed, however, about the likelihood that information given under torture will be true. How should we account for the instances in which torture produces only useless information or causes investigators to waste precious time pursuing false leads?</p>
<p id="7701ca33-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Potential harms?</i> Does the Bybee Memorandum properly describe the harms of permitting torture in circumstances of “necessity”? The Memorandum compares the benefit of averting a catastrophic terror attack to “the harm that might occur during an interrogation.” Is this the right way to identify the harm sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense? Compare <i>Unger</i>, the Model Penal Code Commentaries, and the material on economic necessity, pp. 945-956 supra, all considering broad systemic harms that could result from accepting a claim of necessity in an isolated case. As applied to the problem of torture, what broader harms, in addition to the pain inflicted on a particular suspect, could be entailed in allowing highly coercive methods of questioning?</p>
<p id="7701ca34-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d) The legislative judgment.</i> Note that torture, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §2340(1), is not simply an extreme form of aggravated assault but “an act committed by a person <i>acting under the color of law</i>
 . . . upon a person <i>within his custody.</i>

<i>3. Culpability of the person targeted for torture.</i> Both the Israel Supreme Court decision and the Bybee Memorandum contemplate the use of torture against a known terrorist who has, or probably has, vital information. Should the case for permitting torture change if the person under interrogation is merely a <i>suspected</i> terrorist—for example, a villager accused by two of his neighbors? The lack of certainty that the suspect is involved reduces the likelihood that he has vital information, but the Bybee Memorandum makes that probability only one factor, and the probability need not be high if the potential attack would have catastrophic effects. Shouldn’t the possible innocence of the person under interrogation make the resort to torture absolutely unacceptable? But why should it, if the logic of ordinary cost-benefit calculus is sound in this context?</p>
<p id="7701ca39-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should it ever be permissible to torture a person <i>known</i> to be innocent? Such a scenario is readily imaginable. Suppose that an admitted terrorist, who has acknowledged involvement in planning a still-impending attack, is captured and brutally interrogated. But he refuses to reveal vital details of the plot. Should interrogators be permitted, on necessity grounds, to torture the terrorist’s six-year-old daughter, on the plausible assumption that this is the most likely means, and perhaps the only means, of getting the terrorist to talk and thus avert the potentially catastrophic attack?</p>
<p id="7701ca3a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Procedures and oversight.</i> If the Israel Supreme Court was right to hold that a necessity defense should sometimes be available to an interrogator who uses physical means, wasn’t it wrong to hold that administrative authorities cannot regulate the use of such methods by rules promulgated in advance? If necessity is a genuine justification, indicating that the action taken is beneficial on balance, why must the circumstances justifying that action always be assessed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis?</p>
<p id="7701ca3b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One proposal hotly debated since 9/11 has been to permit torture if, but only if, investigators first obtain a judicial warrant authorizing it. Compare Alan M. Dershowitz, Why Terrorism Works 158-163 (2002) (advocating this approach), with Fritz Allhoff, Torture Warrants, Self-Defense, and Necessity, 11 Cardozo Pub. L. Pol’y &amp; Ethics J. 421, 447 (2013) and Oren Gross, Are Torture Warrants Warranted?, 88 Minn. L. Rev. 1481 (2004) (both opposing it). Would administrative regulations and independent oversight tend to make the use of torture and other severely coercive methods less frequent? Or would official legitimation of those practices lead them to be used even more <span title="972" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-972">p. 972</span>frequently? If torture is going to occur anyway, is it better for society to acknowledge the practice or to treat it as something that is never condoned?</p>

<i>5. Further reading.</i> Prior to the decision of the Israel Supreme Court, the issues in the case were explored by an official commission (the Landau Commission) in 1988. For the commission’s report and comments on it, see Symposium, 23 Israel L. Rev., Nos. 2 &amp; 3 (Spring-Summer 1989). See also Michael Moore, Torture and the Balance of Evils, in Michael Moore, Placing Blame 669-736 (1997). The 9/11 attacks spawned a vast literature. See, e.g., Fritz Allhoff, Terrorism, Ticking Time-Bombs, and Torture (2012); Karen J. Greenberg ed., The Torture Debate in America (2005); Sanford Levinson ed., Torture (2004); Jeremy Waldron, Torture and Positive Law: Jurisprudence for the White House, 105 Colum L. Rev. 1681 (2005). The last article, in addition to analyzing “positive law,” argues that “the absolute prohibition on torture should remain in force” and that “any attempt to loosen it . . . would deal a traumatic blow to our legal system and our ability to sustain the law’s commitment to human dignity . . . even in areas where torture as such is not involved.” Id. at 1681-1682.

The vehicle overturned, and Cruzan was discovered lying face down in a ditch without detectable respiratory or cardiac function. . . . She now lies in a Missouri state hospital in what is commonly referred to as a persistent vegetative state: generally, a condition in which a person exhibits motor reflexes but evinces no indications <span title="973" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-973">p. 973</span>of significant cognitive function.

All agree that such a removal would cause her death. The employees refused to honor the request without court approval. The parents then sought and received authorization from the state trial court for termination. The court . . . found that Nancy’s “expressed thoughts at age twenty-five in somewhat serious conversation with a housemate friend that if sick or injured she would not wish to continue her life unless she could live at least halfway normally suggests that given her present condition she would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration.”</p><p id="7701f159-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed by a divided vote. . . . The court found that Cruzan’s statements to her roommate regarding her desire to live or die under certain conditions were “unreliable for the purpose of determining her intent,” “and thus insufficient to support the co-guardians[’] claim to exercise substituted judgment on Nancy’s behalf.” . . . 
</p><p id="7701f15a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We granted certiorari to consider the question whether Cruzan has a right under the United States Constitution which would require the hospital to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from her under these circumstances.</p><p id="7701f15b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Before the turn of the century, this Court observed that “[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891). This notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment. Justice Cardozo, while on the Court of Appeals of New York, aptly described this doctrine: “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient’s consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages.” Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 105 N.E. 92, 93 (N.Y. 1914). The informed consent doctrine has become firmly entrenched in American tort law. . . . 
</p><p id="7701f15c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he common-law doctrine of informed consent is viewed as generally encompassing the right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. . . . This is the first case in which we have been squarely presented with the issue whether the United States Constitution grants what is in common parlance referred to as a “right to die.” . . . 
</p><p id="7702186d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions. . . . But determining that a person has a “liberty interest” under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry; “whether respondent’s constitutional <span title="974" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-974">p. 974</span>rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests against the relevant state interests.” Youngberg v.

Such a “right” must be exercised for her, if at all, by some sort of surrogate. Here, Missouri has in effect recognized that under certain circumstances a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn in such a way as to cause death, but it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the action of the surrogate conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent. Missouri requires that evidence of the incompetent’s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The question, then, is whether the United States Constitution forbids the establishment of this procedural requirement by the State.</p><p id="77021870-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[This question] depends in part on what interests the State may properly seek to protect in this situation.

 . . . In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the “liberty” specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the rights to marry, to have children, to direct the education and upbringing of one’s children, to marital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and to abortion, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). We have also assumed, and strongly suggested, that the Due Process Clause protects the traditional right to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment. Cruzan v.

This requirement is unquestionably met here. . . . Washington’s assisted-suicide ban implicates a number of state interests.</p><p id="77023f90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, Washington has an “unqualified interest in the preservation of human life.” . . . This interest is symbolic and aspirational as well as practical. . . .  Relatedly, . . . many people who request physician-assisted suicide withdraw that request if their depression and pain are treated.</p><p id="77023f91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State also has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession. . . . [T]he American Medical Association, like many other medical and physicians’ groups, has concluded that “[p]hysician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer.” . . . And physician-assisted suicide could, it is argued, undermine the trust that is essential to the doctor-patient relationship by blurring the time-honored line between healing and harming.</p><p id="77023f92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, the State has an interest in protecting vulnerable groups—including the poor, the elderly, and disabled persons—from abuse, neglect, and mistakes. [T]he New York Task Force warned that “ . . . [t]he risk of harm is greatest for the many individuals in our society whose autonomy and well-being are already compromised by poverty, lack of access to good medical care, advanced age, or membership in a stigmatized social group.” [New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, When Death is Sought: Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical Context (1994) at] 120. . . . If physician-assisted suicide were permitted, many might resort to it to spare their families the substantial financial burden of end-of-life health-care costs. . . . The State’s assisted-suicide ban reflects and reinforces its policy that the lives of terminally ill, disabled, and elderly people must be no less valued than the lives of the young and healthy, and that a seriously disabled person’s suicidal impulses should be interpreted and treated the same way as anyone else’s. . . . 
</p><p id="77023f93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the State may fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia. . . . The Court of Appeals’ decision [below] . . . noted, for example, that . . . “in some instances, the patient may be unable to self-administer the drugs and . . . administration by the physician . . . may be the only way the patient may be able to receive them”; and that not only physicians, but also family members and loved ones, will inevitably participate in assisting suicide. Thus, it turns out that what is couched as a limited right to “physician-assisted suicide” is likely, in effect, a much broader license, which could prove extremely difficult to <span title="977" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-977">p. 977</span>police and contain.

<p id="770266b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Department of Justice attempted to block implementation of the Oregon measure. In November 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft ruled that under federal laws regulating prescription drugs, there was no “legitimate medical purpose” for prescriptions written to assist suicide pursuant to the Oregon law, and therefore any physician writing such a prescription would be exposed to revocation of her federal drug license and prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In a suit brought by the State of Oregon, however, the Supreme Court held that the CSA was intended to preserve states’ traditional powers to regulate the medical profession and that the Attorney General’s ruling was invalid. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243 (2006).</p>
<p id="770266b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The number of prescriptions for lethal medication written annually under Oregon DWDA has increased each year; during the eight years that the law has been in effect, a total of 1,545 people have had such prescriptions written and 991 patients have died from ingesting the medications. In 2015, 218 people received such prescriptions, and 132 people died from using them.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11AE3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11AE3_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">76</a></span>

<p id="770266b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One concern about measures like Oregon’s has been that they could reduce incentives for physicians to treat patients’ pain, and that assisted suicide would simply become an easy alternative to effective pain management. There is evidence, however, that the opposite may have occurred; perhaps surprisingly, patients’ ability to consider the assisted suicide option apparently has stimulated greater effort to improve pain management.

<i>2. Subsequent American developments.</i> Although the <i>Glucksberg</i> decision upheld Washington’s prohibition of assisted suicide, that state reversed course in 2008 and approved by ballot initiative a law permitting assisted suicide on terms virtually identical to those of the Oregon legislation. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §70.245 (2016). Vermont adopted a similar measure in 2013. See Kathryn L. Tucker, Vermont’s Patient Choice at End of Life Act: A Historic “Next Generation” Law Governing Aid in Dying, 38 Vt. L. Rev. 687 (2014).

<p id="77028dc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly after Washington’s ballot initiative, the Montana Supreme Court interpreted that state’s right-to-refuse-treatment statute as granting immunity from civil or criminal liability to any health care provider who honors a patient’s wishes, not only by withdrawing or withholding treatment but also by providing medication that will enable the patient to end her own life. Baxter v. State, 224 P.3d 1211, 1219-1220 (Mont. 2009). For standards in other American jurisdictions, see Katherine Ann Wingfield &amp; Carl S.

As a result, a Zurich clinic has become a destination of choice for individuals who desire physician-assisted suicide. From 1998 through the end of 2009, more than 900 non-Swiss patients chose to end their lives at the Dignitas clinic, and by the end of 2015, nearly 2,000 had done so, including 66 Americans, 310 Britons, and more than 1,000 patients from Germany.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B39_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B39_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">82</a></span> One study reports that in the UK “going to Switzerland” has become a euphemism for obtaining assisted suicide.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B45_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B45_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">83</a></span>

<i>(b) The British response.</i> Concerns about “suicide tourism” prompted British authorities to threaten prosecution of citizens who helped a family member obtain a physician-assisted suicide in Switzerland, especially after several prominent Britons had done so in widely publicized fashion. That policy, however, was challenged by a victim of multiple sclerosis who hoped to take advantage of the Swiss clinic. In a landmark decision, the House of Lords ruled that uncertainty about the risk of prosecution <span title="980" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-980">p. 980</span>unacceptably interfered with her right to respect for her private life, and accordingly it ordered the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to publicly identify the factors he would consider in deciding whether to prosecute in such a case. Regina (Purdy) v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [2009] UKHL 45. In response, the DPP promulgated a draft policy, and after extensive public comment, announced final guidelines that largely limit prosecution to cases involving underage or incompetent victims and cases in which a person persuades or pressures someone to kill herself or benefits from her death.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B5A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B5A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">84</a></span> Although assisted suicide remains a crime in England (and is punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment), the DPP guidelines effectively decriminalize the practice when someone acts out of compassion to help a terminally ill patient who has a “clear, settled and informed wish to die.” See Haroon Siddique, DPP Releases Assisted Suicide Guidelines, Guardian, Feb. 25, 2010.</p>

<p id="7702dc07-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike justifications, excuses do not assert that what the accused did was a good thing, or that society is better off, on balance, because of his actions. Instead, an excuse seeks to show that although the acts of the accused were harmful, he or she could not fairly have been expected to do otherwise. The materials in this section focus on the three most important excuses—duress, intoxication, and mental disorder. Then, in a final subsection we turn to the ongoing efforts to test the boundaries of the traditional excuses and extend them to include such problems as drug addiction, childhood abuse, and economic deprivation. But first, we focus on the underlying puzzle of why excuses are ever accepted as a defense to harmful conduct and what underlying rationales are common to this group of criminal law doctrines.</p>

</p><p id="7702dc0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The diversity among excuse defenses—procedurally, substantively, and philosophically—is in many respects far greater than that found among justification defenses. [But] several general observations can be made about the structure and content of excuse defenses. All excuse defenses are predicated upon the presence of some disability or disabling condition affecting the actor claiming the defense. The disability can arise from a number of sources, both internal and external to the actor, and may be temporary or permanent. . . . 
</p><p id="7702dc0f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Excuse defenses can be organized into three categories: involuntary actions, actions related to cognitive deficiencies, and actions related to volitional deficiencies. Involuntary actions are those acts, i.e., bodily movements, <span title="983" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-983">p. 983</span>that are not willed by the actor.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C2F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11C2F_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> When used in this narrow sense, the term “involuntary” does not include behavior that is a consequence of exerted will that has been overborne. . . . Reflex actions and convulsions are examples of involuntary actions, while actions performed in response to a threat are not. . . . 
</p><p id="7702dc11-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second group of excusing conditions involves conduct relating to a cognitive impairment or deficiency. “Cognition” concerns an actor’s ability to know certain things, which, in a broad sense, includes both facts and law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C42_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11C42_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span> When used in connection with a criminal defense based on excuse, cognitive impairment is concerned with an actor’s knowledge of the nature of his conduct and whether it is right or wrong, and legal or illegal.</p><p id="7702dc13-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third group of excusing conditions involves impairments or deficiencies in volition, which concern an actor’s ability to make unencumbered choices [free from external threats] or to meaningfully control his behavior. A volitionally deficient actor is a voluntary actor, at least insofar as his behavior is a product of his effort or determination. Since a volitionally deficient actor’s cognition need not be impaired, he also may be fully aware of the nature of his conduct and whether it is right or wrong, and legal or illegal. Put differently, because most defenses based on a volitional deficiency require only some impairment of an actor’s will, the actor’s conduct remains voluntary in a strict sense and is usually informed by some degree of awareness.</p></div>

</div><p id="77030327-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why we have excuses is less obvious than why we have other defenses. [Jeremy Bentham] saw the point of excuses to be that they identified situations in which conduct is nondeterrable, so that punishment would be so much unnecessary evil. [S]ince only the nondeterrable are excused, withholding punishment offers no comfort to those who are deterrable. The trouble is . . . that this [conclusion] does not follow, for punishing all, whether or not they happen to be deterrable, closes off any hope a deterrable offender might otherwise harbor that he could convince a jury that he was among the nondeterrable.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C6B_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11C6B_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> Moreover, without excuses, prosecutions would be faster and <span title="984" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-984">p. 984</span>cheaper, convictions more reliable, and the deterrent threat more credible. Indeed, strict liability offenses [dispense] with mens rea requirements on just these grounds. [Yet, doesn’t the effectiveness of strict liability give up] something of value . . . , something that is not captured in Bentham’s rationale?</p><p id="7703032b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor [H.L.A.] Hart . . . offered a different account of excuses. He argued that by confining liability to cases in which persons have freely chosen, excuses serve to maximize the effect of a person’s choices within the framework of coercive law, thereby furthering the satisfaction people derive in knowing that they can avoid the sanction of the law if they choose.</p><p id="7703032c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This rationale is an improvement over Bentham, inasmuch as Hart gives us a reason why we might want to put up with the loss of deterrence caused by excuses. But does this account capture the full force of a system of excuses? Suppose we preferred the risk of accidentally being victims of law enforcement to the increased risk of being victims of crime. That would be a plausible choice, particularly for a public obsessed with rising crime rates. Would we then feel there was nothing more problematic in giving up excuses than that we would be trading one kind of satisfaction for another? I think not. Something is missing in this account.</p><p id="7703032d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hart’s account focuses on the interests and satisfactions of the great majority of us who never become targets of law enforcement—our security in knowing we will not be punished if we do not choose to break the law. What is missing is an account of the concern for the innocent person who is the object of a criminal prosecution. . . . To blame a person is to express a moral criticism, and if the person’s action does not deserve criticism, blaming him is a kind of falsehood and is, to the extent the person is injured by being blamed, unjust to him. It is this feature of our everyday moral practices that lies behind the law’s excuses. Excuses . . . represent no sentimental compromise with the demands of a moral code; they are, on the contrary, of the essence of a moral code. . . . 
</p><p id="7703032e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, one might escape excuses altogether by withdrawing the element of blame from a finding of criminality. Indeed, [some people] would prefer that the criminal law reject all backward-looking judgments of punishment, blame, and responsibility, and concern itself exclusively with identifying and treating those who constitute a social danger. Whether it would be desirable to loosen [official coercion] from its mooring in blame is a large and much discussed question.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11C9E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11C9E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span> I will confine myself here to two observations. First, such a dissociation would not likely succeed. People would continue to see state coercion as punishment, notwithstanding official declarations that the state’s only interest is the individual’s welfare and social protection. Second, it is very doubtful that we should want it to succeed, since blame and punishment give expression to the concept of personal responsibility which is a central feature of our moral culture.</p></div>

<span class="epub-small-caps">PASHMAN, J</span>. [Dr. Joseph Toscano, a chiropractor, was charged with conspiring to obtain money by false pretenses from the Kemper Insurance Company. The charges were part of a larger indictment alleging that 11 named defendants and two unindicted co-conspirators had participated in a scheme to defraud various insurance companies by staging accidents in public places and obtaining payments in settlement of fictitious injuries. William Leonardo, the alleged architect of the conspiracy and the organizer of each of the separate incidents, pleaded guilty, as did several other defendants. Toscano went to trial, admitting that he had aided in the preparation of a fraudulent insurance claim by making out a false medical report, but arguing that he had acted under duress. The trial judge ruled that the threatened harm was not sufficiently imminent to justify charging the jury on the defense of duress. The jury convicted, and Toscano was fined $500. His conviction was affirmed on appeal, and the New Jersey Supreme Court granted certification to consider the status of duress as an affirmative defense.]</p>
<p id="77032a47-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State attempted to show that Toscano agreed to fill out the false medical report because he owed money to Richard Leonardo [William’s brother] for gambling debts. It also suggested that Toscano subsequently sought to cover up the crime by fabricating office records of non-existent office visits by Hanaway.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11CDD_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11CDD_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> Defendant sharply disputed these assertions and maintained that he capitulated to William Leonardo’s demands only because he was fearful for his wife’s and his own bodily safety. Since it is not our function here to assess these conflicting versions, we shall summarize only those facts which, if believed by the jury, would support defendant’s claim of duress. . . .

Leonardo was “boisterous and loud” repeating, “You’re going to make this bill out for me.” Then he said: “Remember, you just moved into a place that has a very dark entrance and you leave there with your wife. . . . You and your wife are going to jump at shadows when you leave that dark entrance.” Leonardo sounded “vicious” and “desperate” and defendant felt that he “just had to do it” to protect himself and his wife. He thought about calling the police, but failed to do so in the hope that “it would go away and wouldn’t bother me any more.”</p>

It was returned that evening and defendant completed it. On Sunday morning he met Hanaway at a prearranged spot and delivered a medical bill and the completed medical report. He received no compensation for his services, either in the form of cash from William Leonardo or forgiven gambling debts from Richard Leonardo. He heard nothing more from Leonardo after that Sunday.</p>
<p id="7703505c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Shortly thereafter, still frightened by the entire episode, defendant moved to a new address and had his telephone number changed to an unlisted number in an effort to avoid future contacts with Leonardo. He also applied for a gun permit but was unsuccessful. His superior at his daytime job with the Newark Housing Authority confirmed that the quality of defendant’s work dropped so markedly that he was forced to question defendant about his attitude. [D]efendant explained that he had been upset by threats against him and his wife. He also revealed the threats to a co-worker at the Newark Housing Authority.</p>
<p id="7703505d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After defendant testified, the trial judge granted the State’s motion to exclude any further testimony in connection with defendant’s claim of duress, and announced his decision not to charge the jury on that defense. . . .

Now, this principle prevails regardless of the subjective estimate he may have made as to the degree of danger with which he or his wife may have been confronted. Under the facts of this case, I instruct you, as members of the jury, that the circumstances described by Dr. Toscano leading to his implication in whatever criminal activities in which you may find he participated are not sufficient to constitute the defense of duress.</p>

<p id="77035064-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was commonly said that duress does not excuse the killing of an innocent person even if the accused acted in response to immediate threats. Aside from this exception, however, duress was permitted as a defense to prosecution for a range of serious offenses. . . .

<p id="77035065-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To excuse a crime, the threatened injury must induce “such a fear as a man of ordinary fortitude and courage might justly yield to.” Although there are scattered suggestions in early cases that only a fear of death meets this test, . . .

Thus, the courts have assumed as a matter of law that neither threats of slight injury nor threats of destruction to property are coercive enough to overcome the will of a person of ordinary courage. [The court then referred to cases in which threats of loss of job, denial of food rations, economic need, and prospect of financial ruin were held inadequate.] . . . When the alleged source of coercion is a threat of “future” harm, courts have generally found that the defendant had a duty to escape from the control of the threatening person or to seek assistance from law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p id="77035067-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming a “present, imminent and impending” danger, however, there is no requirement that the threatened person be the accused. [C]oncern for the well-being of another, particularly a near relative, can support a defense of duress if the other requirements are satisfied. . . .

<p id="77035068-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The insistence under the common law on a danger of immediate force causing death or serious bodily injury may be ascribed to . . . judicial fears of perjury and fabrication of baseless defenses. We do not discount [this] concern as a reason for caution in modifying this accepted rule, but we are concerned by its obvious shortcomings and potential for injustice. Under some circumstances, the commission of a minor criminal offense should be excusable even if the coercive agent does not use or threaten force which is likely to result in death or “serious” bodily injury. Similarly, it is possible that authorities might not be able to prevent a threat of future harm from eventually being carried out. . . .

<p id="77037784-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem of how far duress should exculpate conduct that otherwise would constitute a crime is much debated. . . . [Sir James] Stephen argued, for example, that “compulsion by threats ought in no case whatever to be admitted as an excuse for crime, though it may and ought to operate in mitigation of punishment in most though not in all cases.” His reason was, in substance, that “it is at the moment when temptation to crime is strongest that the law should speak most clearly and emphatically to the contrary.”

</p>
<p id="77039e97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much of the issue posed by these competing views is resolved . . . in Section 3.02, which provides a general defense in cases where the actor believed his conduct necessary to avoid an evil to himself or to another and the evil sought to be avoided is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged. The Institute saw no reason why this principle should be denied full application when the evil apprehended has its source in the action or the threatened action of another person, rather than the forces and perils of the physical world. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77039e98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem of Section 2.09, then, reduces to the question of whether there are cases where the actor cannot justify his conduct under Section 3.02, as when his choice involves an equal or greater evil than that threatened, but where he nonetheless should be excused because he was subjected to coercion. If he is so far overwhelmed by force that his behavior is involuntary, as when his arm is physically moved by someone else, Section 2.01(1) stands as a barrier to liability. . . . The case of concern here is that in which the actor makes a choice, but claims in his defense that he was so intimidated that he was unable to choose otherwise. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77039e99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In favor of allowing the defense, it may be argued that the legal sanction cannot be effective in the case supposed and that the actor may not properly be blamed for doing what he had to choose to do. It seems clear, however, that the argument in its full force must be rejected. The crucial reason is the same as that which elsewhere leads to an unwillingness to vary legal norms with the individual’s capacity to meet the standards they prescribe, absent a disability that is both gross and verifiable, such as the mental disease or defect that may establish irresponsibility. The most that it is feasible to do with lesser disabilities is to accord them proper weight in sentencing. To make liability depend upon the fortitude of any given actor would be no less impractical or otherwise impolitic than to permit it to depend upon such other variables as intelligence or clarity of judgment, suggestibility or moral insight.</p>
<p id="77039e9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the legal standard may gain in its effectiveness by being unconditional in this respect. It cannot be known what choices might be different if the actor thought he had a chance of exculpation on the ground of his peculiar disabilities instead of knowing that he does not. No less important, legal norms and sanctions operate not only at the moment of climactic choice, but also in the fashioning of values and of character.</p>
<p id="77039e9b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though, for the foregoing reasons, the submission that the actor lacked the fortitude to make the moral choice should not be entertained as a defense, a different situation is presented if the claimed excuse is based upon the <span title="990" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-990">p. 990</span>incapacity of men in general to resist the coercive pressures to which the individual succumbed. . . . [L]aw is ineffective in the deepest sense, indeed . . . it is hypocritical, if it imposes on the actor who has the misfortune to confront a dilemmatic choice, a standard that his judges are not prepared to affirm that they should and could comply with if their turn to face the problem should arise. Condemnation in such a case is bound to be an ineffective threat; what is, however, more significant is that it is divorced from any moral base and is unjust. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77039e9c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Model Code accordingly provides for the defense in cases where the actor was coerced by force or threats of force “that a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.” The standard is not, however, wholly external in its reference; account is taken of the actor’s “situation,” a term that should here be given the same scope it is accorded in appraising recklessness and negligence. Stark, tangible factors that differentiate the actor from another, like his size, strength, age, or health, would be considered in making the exculpatory judgment. Matters of temperament would not.</p>

<i>1. Partial versus complete excuse.</i> In a homicide case, the common law denies the defense of duress entirely, see p. 1000 infra, while under the MPC, sufficient duress excuses homicide altogether. The New Jersey statute, enacted after the decision in <i>Toscano</i> (see p. 986, note b and p. 988 note 12, supra), takes an intermediate position—a successful claim of duress (like a successful claim of provocation) only reduces murder to manslaughter. If the MPC rationale for the duress defense is sound, should it apply as well to the defense of provocation, so that a successful claim of provocation (or “extreme emotional disturbance”) would be a complete defense to a homicide charge? Alternatively, if the MPC is sound in its treatment of provocation as a <i>partial</i> excuse, why shouldn’t the same approach apply to duress? Are there differences in the rationales for the two defenses that justify the different treatment that they usually receive? See Anders Kaye, Excuses in Exile, 48 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 437 (2015); Kyron Huigens, The Continuity of Justification Defenses, 2009 U. Ill. L. Rev. 62.</p>
<p id="77039ea0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The objective standard.</i> MPC §2.09(1) requires a defendant claiming duress to meet an objective standard of “a person of reasonable firmness in his situation.” But as in other areas where a norm of reasonableness is set (for example, in the law defining criminal negligence and adequate provocation), it remains necessary to determine how the norm should be tailored to the particular actor’s “situation.” As we have seen, the MPC drafters deliberately chose a term that was undefined and ambiguous, in order “to leave the issue to the courts.”
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11E05_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11E05_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">85</a></span> But courts sometimes duck the issue as well. In State v. <span title="991" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-991">p. 991</span>Helmedach, 8 A.3d 514 (Conn. App. Ct. 2010), the jury sent the trial judge a note asking for “[a] further explanation in [layman’s] terms” of the “situation” standard, but the judge merely replied that he “could only provide you with the instruction on duress that you already had.” Id. at 518. The appellate court held that this was a proper response: “Because the term situation does not have a statutory definition . . . , it is taken that the jury, as a matter of common knowledge, comprehends the term.” Id. at 520. Is this a plausible response? How can the court posit that “the jury, as a matter of common knowledge, comprehends the term” when the jury itself expressly indicates otherwise? If the judge was wrong to duck the issue, what explanation should he have given? Helmedach claimed to be under duress from a domestic partner who had subjected her to years of abuse. Was her status as a battered woman relevant to her situation? Courts are divided on the issue (see Note 2(b), infra). Under these circumstances, is it better for the trial judge to leave the issue unexplained, on the ground that the jury knows the answer “as a matter of common knowledge”? Consider these aspects of the problem:</p>
<p id="77039ea2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Immaturity and mental retardation.</i> In State v. Heinemann, 920 A.2d 278, 295-297 (Conn. 2007), the court rejected the 16-year-old defendant’s effort to have the jury instructed that differences in maturity “make it more difficult for adolescents to resist pressures [which included death threats] because of their limited decision-making capacity and their susceptibility to outside influences.” The court acknowledged that adolescents are “more vulnerable to all sorts of pressure, including . . . duress,” but concluded that the defendant’s argument was precluded by “[t]he legislature’s determination to treat sixteen year olds as adults for purposes of [eligibility for trial in adult rather than juvenile court.]” In United States v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 464, 469 (6th Cir. 2005), the court held that evidence of low IQ, even if sufficient to establish mental retardation, should not be admitted to modify the “reasonable person” standard for the purposes of a duress defense: “Unlike . . . non-mental physical disabilities, mental deficiency or retardation is difficult to identify, more difficult to quantify, and more easily feigned. For these reasons and others, it was the common law rule going back at least to 1616, and still is, that an adult suffering from a mental deficiency is nevertheless held to a reasonable person standard.”</p>
<p id="77039ea3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that mental retardation should be considered as part of an actor’s “situation” for the purposes of duress: “While the trier of fact must consider whether an objective person of reasonable firmness would have been able to resist the threat, it must ultimately base its decision on whether that person would have been able to resist the threat if he was subjectively placed in the defendant’s situation. . . . [T]he fact that a defendant suffers from <span title="992" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-992">p. 992</span>‘a gross and verifiable’ mental disability . . .  is a relevant consideration.” Commonwealth v. DeMarco, 570 Pa. 263, 273 (2002). Should individualization of standards for duress extend even beyond “gross and verifiable” mental disabilities?

<i>(b) Battered woman’s syndrome.</i> Courts now uniformly hold that evidence of battered woman’s syndrome (BWS) is admissible to support a claim of self-defense when a woman facing an immediate threat kills her abuser (see pp. 887-903 supra). But courts do <i>not</i> agree about whether BWS evidence is admissible when the woman claims duress as an excuse for participating in a robbery or drug deal under pressure from her abuser. Is there a valid basis for this distinction?</p>
<p id="7703c5b8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One commentator suggests that in claims of duress, the standard of reasonableness should not take into account that a woman suffers from BWS, in part because “[i]n self-defense, the woman avoids the imminent danger by responding in kind against its source—her batterer. In duress, however, the woman avoids her abuser’s threat by misconduct directed against an innocent third party.” Laurie Kratky Doré, Downward Adjustment and the Slippery Slope: The Use of Duress in Defense of Battered Offenders, 56 Ohio St. L.J. 665, 749 (1995). Do you agree that the innocence of the victim should be a relevant consideration? Does the defendant’s degree of culpability change with the identity of the victim?</p>
<p id="7703c5b9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If BWS evidence is admissible in cases of duress at all, to which factual issues is it relevant? The reasonableness of the defendant’s fear? The recklessness or negligence of the defendant in placing herself in a position where she might be subjected to duress? The degree of firmness that the defendant should be expected to exhibit under the circumstances? See Alafair S. Burke, Rational Actors, Self-Defense, and Duress: Making Sense, Not Syndromes, Out of the Battered Women, 81 <span class="epub-small-caps">N.C.</span> L. Rev. 211 (2002). Most courts have not distinguished among these issues. In United States v. Dixon, 413 F.3d 520, 523 (5th Cir. 2005), the court declared that expert testimony that a defendant “suffers from the battered woman’s syndrome” is “inherently subjective” and therefore inadmissible to support a defense of duress. Compare Dando v. Yukins, 461 F.3d 791, 801 (6th Cir. 2006), holding that BWS is admissible and relevant to the entire defense of duress.</p>
<p id="7703c5ba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="993" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-993">p. 993</span>At least one court has held that the requirement of “reasonable firmness” should be treated differently from the other issues. In State v. B.H., 183 N.J. 171 (2005), the defendant admitted to engaging in sexual activity with her seven-year-old stepson while S.H., her husband and father of the child, watched. The defendant raised a defense of duress, claiming that S.H. had often physically and sexually assaulted her in the past, and that he held his hand to her throat during her sexual activity with the boy and said that if she refused he would make her pay and she would never see her daughter again. The trial court allowed the defendant to present BWS evidence, but instructed the jury that the evidence was <i>not</i> relevant to whether “a person of reasonable firmness in the defendant’s situation would have been unable to resist” the threat, but rather was relevant only to the issue of whether the defendant had “recklessly placed herself in a situation that it was probable that she would be subjected to duress.” Id. at 181. The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed, stating: “Because N.J.S.A. 2C:2-9a embodies an objective standard for the evaluation of a defendant’s conduct in response to a threat by another, we can discern no place for battered woman syndrome evidence in that assessment. In applying the statute’s objective measure, it is a person of reasonable firmness that the jury must consider. . . . The evidence is relevant, however, to a defendant’s subjective perception of a threat from her abuser, and in that respect, can be relevant to her credibility. It also helps in explaining why she would remain with her abuser and, therefore, why such a defendant ought not to be perceived as acting recklessly.” Id. at 199-201.</p>

<i>NOTE: NECESSITY AND DURESS COMPARED</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="7703c5be-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The relationship between the defenses of necessity and duress can be confusing. Partly, the reason is terminological: Courts and commentators don’t always use the terms the same way. But, more significantly, the confusion is analytical. See Peter Westen &amp; James Mangiafico, The Criminal Defense of Duress: A Justification, Not an Excuse—And Why It Matters, 6 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 833 (2003); Claire O. Finkelstein, Duress: A Philosophical Account of the Defense in Law, 37 Ariz. L. Rev. 251 (1995).</p>
<p id="7703c5bf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two separate concepts are at work here. What is usually called necessity refers to a defense resting on the rationale of justification. One can see this most clearly in the MPC defense of the choice of evils (§3.02), which we explored in the preceding section: The defendant violated a criminal prohibition, but in the circumstances it was beneficial for society that she did, because doing so was the lesser evil. The other concept rests on the rationale of excuse. The defendant is accorded a defense not because it was beneficial to violate the law under the particular circumstances, but because those circumstances were so compelling that normally law-abiding people might well have done the same. This is the spirit behind the MPC defense of duress.</p>
<p id="7703c5c0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="994" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-994">p. 994</span>But the lines between these two distinguishable concepts are often blurred in the way the law is formulated and discussed. For example, Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law 467 (3d ed. 2000), summarizes the law of duress as requiring not only that the defendant be threatened by another with imminent serious unlawful harm, but that the defendant’s choice to break the law was the lesser evil in the circumstances.</p>
<p id="7703c5c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In those jurisdictions where the law of duress is as LaFave summarizes it, duress becomes a species of justification. But why is it needed? Wouldn’t the choice-of-evils defense (necessity) cover all the cases duress covers? The answer might be no, because the law in some jurisdictions accords significance to the source of the peril. Under this view, if the source of the peril was the “do-it-or-else” command of another person, the only possible defense is duress, not necessity; but if the source of the peril is something else (for example, a natural disaster), the only possible defense may be necessity, not duress. Recall, for example, the dictum in <i>People v. Unger</i>, p. 947 supra, that the defense of compulsion (duress) would be available only if someone commanded the prisoner to escape by threatening him with serious harm if he did not.</p>
<p id="7703ecd2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These ways of formulating the defenses of duress and necessity—that <i>both</i> are justification defenses, but that only a do-it-or-else command of another can establish duress—are problematic in that they preclude the possibility of a defense when conduct is harmful on balance and therefore not <i>justifiable.</i> MPC §2.09 addresses this difficulty by defining duress purely as an excuse. The defense is established when the defendant acted under a threat that a person of reasonable firmness would have been unable to resist. If the circumstances would also make the defendant’s act the lesser evil, the MPC permits the justification defense (§3.02) as well, but he can claim duress even if he did not choose the lesser evil.</p>
<p id="7703ecd3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when a defendant’s duress claim can plausibly be framed in terms of either justification or excuse, the difference between the two can have significant practical consequences. Consider United States v. Lopez, 662 F. Supp. 1083 (N.D. Cal. 1987). Defendant McIntosh landed a helicopter in the recreation yard of a federal prison and then flew off with Lopez, who had been an inmate there. Prosecuted for escape, Lopez asserted the defenses of duress and necessity, on the basis of her fear that she faced threats of death or serious injury at the hands of other inmates. McIntosh was charged with aiding and abetting Lopez’s escape. Does he have a good justification defense if Lopez does? Does he have a good duress defense if Lopez does?</p>
<p id="7703ecd4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between choice-of-evils <i>justification</i> and the duress <i>excuse</i> can be important for another reason, because the MPC allows the justification defense regardless of the <i>source of the peril</i>, but it makes the duress excuse available only when the peril arises from the threat of another person. The MPC thus adheres to the tradition of attributing importance to the source of the peril. The following Notes explore this issue and other major issues in the law of duress.</p>

<i>1. Source of the threat.</i> What is the basis for the MPC distinction depending on the source of the threat? If the peril is great enough that a person of reasonable firmness would be unable to resist, why should it matter whether the peril is from another person or from some natural event? Consider the following cases.</p>
<p id="7703ecd8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> <i>X</i>, under the command of <i>Y</i>, an armed escaping felon, is unwillingly driving a car along a narrow and precipitous mountain road that drops off sharply on both sides.

Shouldn’t an actor have an excuse whenever she commits a criminal act that most people would lack the fortitude to resist? But if so, could such a defense be too easily abused? One way to avoid that danger would be to limit the defense to situations in which the peril (whether from an unlawful threat or natural causes) posed a risk of death or great bodily harm. But the MPC does not permit a duress defense for <i>any</i> naturally arising peril, no matter how severe. The Commentary justifies this position as follows (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.09 at 378-379 (1985)):</p>

<i>3. Imminence.</i> Both <i>Toscano</i> and MPC §2.09 treat the imminence of the threatened harm as one factor to be weighed in determining whether the defendant’s conduct was that of “a person of reasonable firmness in his situation.” Accord, Bates v. Commonwealth, 145 S.W.3d 845, 847 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004). In contrast, many common-law decisions treat imminence as an absolute prerequisite to a duress defense, and some statutes limit the defense to situations involving threats of “instant” death. Many statutory revisions also rejected the MPC’s flexible approach and preserved some requirement that the threatened harm be “immediate,” “imminent,” or “instant.” See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comments to §2.09 at 369, 382 (1985). Many recent judicial decisions likewise insist on strict temporal imminence. E.g., United States v. Shryock, 342 F.3d 948 (9th Cir. 2003); State v. Rafferty, 2015 Ohio 1629 (Ct. App. 2015).</p>

In describing the circumstances leading up to the acts of collaboration, the court noted that after being captured, defendant suffered numerous interrogations, forced marches, and physical abuse.

These factors, plus his greatly weakened physical condition, led the accused to the conclusion that he would never reach the north camp alive.

<i>4. Duress and mens rea.</i> Because cases of imminent duress involve a lack of moral culpability, it makes sense for duress to be a defense to crimes like assault or damage to property, which require a culpable mens rea (for example, an intent to cause harm). But does the same logic suggest that duress <i>should not</i> be available as a defense to strict liability crimes? For example, in many states, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) is a strict liability offense; it is no defense that the defendant was unaware of being intoxicated. <span title="1000" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1000">p. 1000</span>What should be the result if a defendant who knows he is intoxicated is forced at gunpoint to drive a fleeing felon away from the scene of a crime? Since a DUI conviction does not require moral culpability, should the defendant’s claim of duress be considered irrelevant for the same reasons that a mistake of fact would be considered irrelevant? Or conversely, if a duress defense is permitted in this situation (as it apparently is in most states), does that willingness suggest that the refusal to permit a mistake-of-fact defense is fundamentally unsound? For a careful analysis, see Vera Bergelson, A Fair Punishment for Humbert Humbert: Strict Liability and Affirmative Defenses, 14 New Crim. L. Rev. 55 (2011).</p>

<i>5. Contributory fault.</i> Should it matter whether the defendant is in some way to blame for being in a position that leads to duress? Suppose a defendant joins a gang engaged in petty thefts. When the leader decides to rob a bank, the defendant refuses to go along, but is threatened with death if he fails to cooperate. If the defendant participates in the robbery, should he have a duress defense? A common approach is to hold that, where a defendant “voluntarily, and with knowledge of its nature, joined a criminal organization or gang which he knew might bring pressure on him to commit an offense and was an active member when he was put under such pressure, he cannot avail himself of the defense of duress.” Regina v. Sharp, [1987] 3 W.L.R. 1, 8-9. If, however, the nature of the criminal enterprise is such that the defendant has no reason to suspect he would be forcibly prevented from withdrawing, and if trouble materializes unexpectedly, the defense remains available. Regina v. Shepherd, 86 Cr. App. R. 47 (1988). See also MPC §2.09(2), withdrawing the defense where the defendant “recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it is probable that he would be subjected to duress.”</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Is the MPC too restrictive in precluding the defense whenever a person exposes himself to the likelihood of some sort of duress? For example, suppose that a defendant knows that in joining a gang, he is likely to be pressured to participate in various crimes, primarily ones connected to the sale of marijuana. If the defendant is later threatened with death if he does not help in a bank robbery, is it fair to deny him the duress defense to that much more serious, specific intent crime? What if the choice to join the gang was itself coerced? See David Rutkowski, Note, A Coercion Defense for the Street Gang Criminal: Plugging the Moral Gap in Existing Law, 10 Notre Dame J.L.

<i>6. Duress as a defense to murder.</i> Prior to the MPC, most jurisdictions held the duress defense inapplicable in prosecutions for murder (and sometimes for other very serious crimes) even when the stringent requirements of an imminent, inescapable lethal threat were satisfied. The MPC rejected this exclusion of murder cases, as have a few states that adopted duress provisions derived from the MPC. E.g., Commonwealth v. Markman, 916 A.2d 586, 606 (Pa. 2007); N.Y. Penal Law §40.00 (2011). See also Kenneth J. Arenson, The Paradox of Disallowing Duress as a Defence to Murder, 78 J. Crim. L. 65 (2014), suggesting a framework for allowing duress defenses <span title="1001" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1001">p. 1001</span>in homicide cases. But most recent cases and statutory revisions continue to exclude the defense in murder prosecutions. E.g., Viera v. Chappell, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14130 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2015); Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 971 N.E.2d 783 (Mass. 2012). In England, the defense is precluded in cases of murder and attempted murder, but not in cases of aircraft hijacking. See Regina v. Abdul-Hussain, [1999] Crim. L. R. 570 (Ct. App.).</p>

<i>Questions:</i> <i>(a) Duress as a defense to felony murder.</i> Suppose that a defendant is compelled to participate in a robbery, and during the course of that crime a bystander is shot and killed by one of the other robbers. If duress is available in a prosecution for robbery but not in a murder prosecution, should the defendant be able to invoke the duress defense in a prosecution for felony murder? Logically, the answer should be yes: A well-founded claim of duress will defeat the robbery charge, and any allegation of murder must therefore rest upon independent proof of malice, without regard to the underlying felony. Most courts accept this analysis. E.g., McMillan v. State, 51 A.3d 623 (Md. 2012); People v. Fiore, 227 Cal. App. 4th 1362 (2014). But some courts hold that duress is not available as a defense to any homicide charge, including felony murder. See Russell Shankland, Comment, Duress and the Underlying Felony, 99 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1227 (2009); Steven J. Mulroy, The Duress Defense’s Uncharted Terrain, 43 San Diego L. Rev. 159 (2006).</p>

<i>(b) The defendant’s role in a homicidal offense.</i> Where, as in most jurisdictions, duress cannot be a defense to a murder charge, should the defense nonetheless remain available if the coerced defendant’s participation in the crime was relatively minor? Consider the observations of Chief Justice Bray, dissenting in Regina v. Brown, [1968] S.A.S.R. 467, 494:</p>

<p id="7704622f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The reasoning generally used to support the proposition that duress is no defence to a charge of murder is, to use the words of Blackstone cited above, that “he ought rather to die himself, than escape by the murder of an innocent.” Generally speaking I am prepared to accept this position. Its force is obviously considerably less where the act of the threatened man is not the direct act of killing but only the rendering of some minor form of assistance, particularly when it is by no means certain that if he refuses the death of the victim will be averted, or conversely when it is by no means certain that if he complies the death will be a necessary consequence. It would seem hard, for example, if an innocent passer-by seized in the street by a gang of criminals visibly engaged in robbery and murder in a shop and compelled at the point of a gun to issue misleading comments to the public, or an innocent driver compelled at the point of a gun to convey the murderer to the victim, were to have no defence. . . .

<p id="77046234-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Drazen Erdemović was charged before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with crimes against humanity and war crimes for his participation in the mass execution of 1,200 unarmed Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica during a five-hour period in July 1995. At the time of the massacre, Erdemović was a low-ranking soldier in the Serbian army. He testified that when members of his unit were ordered to shoot the civilians, he refused, only to be threatened with instant death: “If you don’t wish to do it, stand in the line with the rest of them and give others your rifle so that they can shoot you.” Prosecutor v. Erdemović, No. IT-96-22-A (Intl. Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber, Oct. 7, 1997), at p.6. The prosecution did not dispute Erdemović’s account of the facts; rather, it argued that duress could not constitute a complete defense to such crimes, but could be considered only as a mitigating factor in sentencing. Consider these issues:</p>

<i>1. The question of guilt.</i> The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY, in a 3–2 vote, agreed with the prosecution that duress can only be a mitigating factor, not a complete defense to such charges. Two judges in the majority insisted that “he ought rather to die himself, than kill an innocent.”

<i>2.

In other words, <i>more</i> people would have died if he had <i>resisted</i> the threat. A dissenting judge argued that the decision to succumb to the threat and kill the innocent victims therefore was the lesser evil.</p>

<i>3. The appropriate sentence.</i> Erdemović ultimately served a five-year prison term. Do the arguments for denying the duress defense altogether suggest that this relatively lenient sentence (for having helped murder 1,200 persons) was inappropriate? How can a sentence of this sort possibly deter people facing a threat of instant death from participating in a mass atrocity? Or is deterrence the wrong way to view the purpose of punishment in a case like this, which may be grounded more on expressive concerns? If so, does criminal condemnation suffice without severe sanctions?</p>

<p id="77048955-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should there be a defense when a crime is committed in response to <i>inducements</i> (as opposed to <i>threats</i>) that would overcome the resistance of a person of ordinary firmness? Sir James Stephen, reflecting the prevailing common-law view, thought not: “It is at the moment when temptation to crime is strongest that the law should speak most clearly and emphatically to the contrary.” 2 James Fitzjames Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 107 (1983). But since some inducements can affect ordinary, law-abiding people as powerfully as forcible threats, why should the two be treated differently? Consider the offer of employment, housing, or medical care to a person in desperate need. Wouldn’t an offer to donate a kidney to a seriously ill person who otherwise lacked access to one be as difficult for that person to resist as a threat to inflict serious bodily injury on a healthy person?</p>
<p id="77048956-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only inducement defense that exists in American law is that of entrapment, which applies only to excessive inducements offered by <i>government</i> agents. See the discussion of entrapment in the section on accomplice liability in Chapter 7, p. 737 supra. It is widely accepted that the primary purpose of the defense is to deter government overreaching in undercover operations. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.13 at 413-415 (1985). Yet the most common version of the defense is considerably narrower, because it is available only to a supposedly “innocent” defendant—someone not “predisposed” to offend. See Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 553 (1992). Given this focus on the particular defendant’s culpability or predisposition, why shouldn’t the excuse be available for similarly “innocent” defendants whose lack of predisposition is overcome by nongovernmental inducements?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">TRAYNOR, C.J.</span> [The evidence showed that defendant, who had been drinking heavily, resisted an effort by a police officer to subdue and arrest him, and in the course of the struggle seized the officer’s gun and shot him in the legs. Defendant was convicted at trial of assault with a deadly weapon. Because the trial court had given the jury “hopelessly conflicting instructions on the effect of intoxication,” the California Supreme Court reversed and attempted to clarify the issue for retrial. The court explained that the relevance of intoxication generally turns on whether the charged offense is a crime of “specific intent” or “general intent.” Assault with intent to kill is clearly a specific intent crime, but the lower courts were in conflict about which category properly described other crimes of assault, such as simple assault and assault with a deadly weapon. The court then continued:]</p><p id="7704b07a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] problem is to reconcile two competing theories of what is just in the treatment of those who commit crimes while intoxicated. On the one hand, the moral culpability of a drunken criminal is frequently less than that of a sober person effecting a like injury. On the other hand, it is commonly felt that a person who voluntarily gets drunk and while in that state commits a crime should not escape the consequences. [To] achieve a compromise between the conflicting feelings of sympathy and reprobation for the intoxicated offender, . . . courts both in England and this country drew a distinction between so-called specific intent and general intent crimes. [The upshot was that evidence of intoxication could be considered to negate a required specific intent, but not to negate “general intent.”]</p><p id="7704b07b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Specific and general intent have been notoriously difficult terms to define and apply, and a number of text writers recommended that they be abandoned altogether. . . . When the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, [the intention to commit that particular act] is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to defendant’s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12137_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12137_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> There is no real difference, however, only <span title="1006" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1006">p. 1006</span>a linguistic one, between an intent to do an act already performed and an intent to do that same act in the future. . . .

[W]hatever reality the distinction between specific and general intent may have in other contexts, the difference is chimerical in the case of assault with a deadly weapon or simple assault. Since the definitions of both specific intent and general intent cover the requisite intent to commit a battery, the decision whether or not to give effect to evidence of intoxication must rest on other considerations.</p><p id="7704d78f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A compelling consideration is the effect of alcohol on human behavior. A significant effect of alcohol is to distort judgment and relax the controls on aggressive and antisocial impulses. Alcohol apparently has less effect on the ability to engage in simple goal-directed behavior, although it may impair the efficiency of that behavior. In other words, a drunk man is capable of forming an intent to do something simple, such as strike another, unless he is so drunk that he has reached the stage of unconsciousness. What he is not as capable as a sober man of doing is exercising judgment about the social consequences of his acts or controlling his impulses toward antisocial acts. He is more likely to act rashly and impulsively and to be susceptible to passion and anger. It would therefore be anomalous to allow evidence of intoxication to relieve a man of responsibility for the crimes of assault with a deadly weapon or simple assault, which are so frequently committed in just such a manner. . . . [Accordingly, the court held, evidence of intoxication is not admissible to negate the intent required for conviction of simple assault or assault with a deadly weapon.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12158_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12158_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>]</p><p id="7704d791-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those crimes that have traditionally been characterized as crimes of specific intent [such as assault with intent to rape or assault with intent to kill] are not affected by our holding here.

In some instances if the defendant is found incapable of formulating the specific intent necessary for the crime charged, such as assault with intent to rob, he may be convicted of a lesser included general intent crime, such as assault with a deadly weapon.

Thus it might be proven that a defendant was in such a drunken stupor and unconscious state that he was not a part of a robbery. . . . Under some circumstances intoxication may be relevant to demonstrate mistake.

<p id="7704feaa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority . . . professes to be concerned with protecting society from drunken offenders. There are several problems with this approach. First, the majority’s opinion is not even internally consistent. Although intoxication is not to be given the status of a defense, the majority states that it can be considered to “buttress the affirmative defense of reasonable mistake.” It is difficult to comprehend why the public would be less endangered by persons who become intoxicated and, as a result, commit alcohol-induced “mistakes” . . . than by persons who get so intoxicated that they commit the same acts without any evil intent. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7704feab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most important consideration, however, is that the standards for establishing the defense are extremely difficult to meet. Contrary to the implications contained in the majority opinion, it is not the case that every defendant who has had a few drinks may successfully urge the defense. [T]he defense cannot be established solely by showing that the defendant might not have committed the offense had he been sober. What is required is a showing of such a great prostration of the faculties that the requisite mental state was totally lacking. That is, to successfully invoke the defense, an accused must show that he was so intoxicated that he did not have the intent to commit an offense. Such a state of affairs will likely exist in very few cases. I am confident that our judges and juries will be able to distinguish such unusual instances. . . .

<i>NOTES ON VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION AS EVIDENCE NEGATING MENS REA</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="7704feae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why try to distinguish between whole classes of offenses for which voluntary intoxication can serve as a defense and those for which it cannot? Wouldn’t it be more straightforward to admit evidence of voluntary intoxication whenever it is logically relevant to a fact in dispute? Decisions like <i>Hood</i> and <i>Stasio</i> reflect widespread resistance to this approach: In nearly all jurisdictions, evidence of intoxication is sometimes inadmissible even when it is logically relevant. These Notes explore the reasons for this reluctance and the doctrinal forms that it takes.</p>
<p id="7704feaf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1009" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1009">p. 1009</span>
<i>1.</i> <i>Developments after</i> Hood <i>and</i> Stasio. In California and New Jersey, subsequent statutes superseded the tests applied in <i>Hood</i> and <i>Stasio.</i> California, at the time of <i>Hood</i>, allowed intoxication evidence to be considered in determining “purpose, motive or intent,” and in 1994, the California Supreme Court ruled that intoxication evidence was admissible on the question whether a defendant had formed the malice (recklessness) required for second-degree murder. The legislative response was swift. As amended in 1995, Cal. Penal Code §29.4(b) (2016) states that “[e]vidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent, or, when charged with murder, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought [i.e., intent to kill].” As a result, such evidence is <i>not</i> admissible on the issue of implied malice (i.e. recklessness).</p>
<p id="7704feb0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New Jersey legislature moved in the opposite direction. After <i>Stasio</i> held that intoxication evidence was not admissible to negate specific <i>or</i> general intent (except in cases of first-degree murder), the legislature enacted a provision specifying that for all criminal offenses generally, intoxication evidence can be considered in determining purpose or knowledge but not in determining recklessness or negligence. N.J. Stat. Ann. §2C:2-8(b) (2016).</p>
<p id="7704feb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Looking more widely, the law is far from uniform. Many federal courts follow the “specific intent” versus “general intent” approach described in <i>Hood.</i> See United States v. White Calf, 634 F.3d 453, 458 (8th Cir. 2011). In United States v. Veach, 455 F.3d 628 (6th Cir. 2006), U.S. Park Rangers arrested a motorist for driving while intoxicated. The motorist shoved one of the officers, and once in the patrol car, he said, “[I]f I get a shot at you[,] . . . I’ll kill you[;] I’m going to cut off your head.” He was convicted of two offenses: assaulting a federal officer (18 U.S.C. §111), and threatening to assault a federal officer “with intent to impede [such] officer while engaged in the performance of official duties.” 18 U.S.C. §115(a)(1)(B). The court held that the ample evidence of defendant’s intoxication was properly ruled irrelevant to the charge of simple assault under §111, but that the trial judge had erred in ruling this evidence irrelevant on the question whether the defendant had formed the specific “intent to impede” required for conviction under §115.</p>
<p id="7704feb2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Roughly half of the states use the same test: The distinction between crimes of “specific intent” and “general intent” is decisive. E.g., State v. Walters, 255 P.3d 835, 840 (Wash. Ct. App. 2011). But several states, following the <i>Stasio</i> approach, exclude logically relevant intoxication evidence even on the issue of specific intent, except in first-degree murder cases (e.g., Swisher v. Commonwealth, 506 S.E.2d 763 (Va. 1998)), and many states bar defense use of intoxication evidence on <i>all</i> mens rea issues. See R.W. Gascoyne, Modern Status of the Rules as to Voluntary Intoxication as Defense to Criminal Charge, 8 A.L.R.3d 1236 (2016). Ohio is one of the states following this last approach. In State v. Arnold, 2 N.E.3d 1009, 1026 (Ohio 2013), the court ruled that evidence of intoxication was irrelevant to the specific intent required on a capital charge of aggravated murder, and then upheld the conviction and a sentence to life without possibility of parole.</p>

<i>2. Why should intoxication be treated differently from other logically relevant evidence?</i> Some of the reluctance to give intoxication its normal significance in rebutting evidence of mens rea is explained by the close connection between alcohol consumption and crime, especially violent crime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12216_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12216_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">89</a></span> One recent study found that “40% of state prisoners convicted of violent crimes were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their offense—the more violent the crime, the greater the likelihood that alcohol was involved.”

<p id="770525cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two major issues are . . . presented by the Model Code’s provisions. The first . . . is the question of whether intoxication ought to be accorded a significance that is entirely coextensive with its relevance to disprove purpose or knowledge when they are the requisite mental elements of a specific crime. The answer ought to be affirmative. [W]hen purpose or knowledge, as distinguished from recklessness, is made essential for conviction, the reason very surely is that in the absence of such states of mind the conduct involved does not present a comparable danger. [In contrast,] in the case of crimes of violence against the person, purpose or knowledge rarely is required to establish liability . . . ; recklessness or even negligence is ordinarily sufficient.</p>
<p id="770525cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second and more difficult question relates to recklessness, where awareness of the risk created by the actor’s conduct ordinarily is requisite for liability under Section 2.02. The problem is whether intoxication ought to be accorded a significance coextensive with its relevance to disprove such awareness, as in the case of purpose or knowledge. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770525ce-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those who oppose a special rule for drunkenness in relation to awareness of the risk in recklessness draw strength . . . from the proposition that it is precisely the awareness of the risk in recklessness that is the essence of its moral culpability—a culpability dependent upon the magnitude of the specific risk knowingly created. When that risk is greater in degree than that which the actor perceives at the time of getting drunk, as is frequently the case, the result of a special rule is bound to be a liability disproportionate to culpability. Hence the solution urged is to dispense with any special rule, relying rather on the possibility of proving foresight at the time of drinking and, when this <span title="1011" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1011">p. 1011</span>cannot be proved, upon a generalized prohibition of being drunk and dangerous, with sanctions appropriate for such behavior. This approach would also permit prosecution for negligence if negligent commission of the act in question was sufficient to establish criminal liability . . . . The actor’s culpability in failing to perceive a risk would be judged against the standard of a man in normal possession of his faculties. Thus, the fact that the defendant was drunk will not exculpate him from a charge of negligence. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770525cf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case thus made is worthy of respect, but there are strong considerations on the other side. There is first the weight of the antecedent law which . . . has tended toward a special rule for drunkenness in this context. Beyond this, . . . awareness of the potential consequences of excessive drinking on the capacity of human beings to gauge the risks incident to their conduct is by now so dispersed in our culture that it is not unfair to postulate a general equivalence between the risks created by the conduct of the drunken actor and the risks created by his conduct in becoming drunk. Becoming so drunk as to destroy temporarily the actor’s powers of perception and judgment is conduct that plainly has no affirmative social value to counterbalance the potential danger. The actor’s moral culpability lies in engaging in such conduct. Added to this are the impressive difficulties posed in litigating the foresight of any particular actor at the time when he imbibes and the relative rarity of cases where intoxication really does engender unawareness as distinguished from imprudence. These considerations led to the conclusion, on balance, that the Model Code should declare that unawareness of a risk, of which the actor would have been aware had he been sober, is immaterial. Most states with revised codes have taken a similar position.</p>
<p id="770525d0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The recklessness equation.</i> Is the Model Penal Code right to equate drunkenness with recklessness? Suppose a defendant has several drinks at a party, assuming that his roommate (the designated driver) will take him home afterwards. On the way home, the roommate becomes sick and is unable to drive, so the defendant takes the wheel. Shortly afterwards, he does not stop at a stop sign, failing to realize the risk that a pedestrian might be crossing from a blind spot at the intersection. As a result, he is unable to stop in time to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road, and the pedestrian is killed. In a jurisdiction that follows the MPC framework for homicide, the defendant could perhaps be convicted of negligent homicide, but should he be considered guilty of the more serious MPC offense of reckless manslaughter? Is the MPC approach sound in equating his willingness to get drunk at the party with the culpability involved in <i>recklessly killing</i>? Gideon Yaffe argues (Intoxication, Recklessness, and Negligence, 9 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 547, 581 (2011-2012)) that the MPC rule is defensible only as applied to situations in which the defendant was consciously aware, when he became intoxicated, of the harms that his post-intoxication conduct would risk. Consider Stephen J. Morse, Fear of Danger, Flight from Culpability, 4 Psychol. Pub. Pol’y &amp; L. 250, 254 (1998):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="770525d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As an empirical matter, . . . this equation is often preposterous. An agent will not be consciously aware while becoming drunk that there is a substantial and <span title="1012" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1012">p. 1012</span>unjustifiable risk that he or she will commit a particular crime when drunk, unless the person has a previous history of . . . committing this specific crime [while drunk]. If such a prior history . . . exists, then the prosecution is capable of proving [the] previous awareness. The prosecution should not be able to rely on what is, in effect, the conclusive presumption that becoming drunk demonstrates the same culpability as the actual conscious awareness of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the defendant would commit the specific harm.</p>

<i>5. Intoxication and due process.</i> Once a state decides to require a particular mens rea as an element of an offense (for example, knowledge or recklessness), how can the state legitimately deny the defendant the opportunity to present relevant exculpatory evidence that bears on the question whether, in fact, he had the required mens rea?</p>
<p id="770525d3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37 (1996), involved a state law defining “deliberate homicide” as a killing committed “purposely” or “knowingly.” But Mont. Penal Code §45-2-203 provided that “an intoxicated condition . . .  may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state which is an element of the offense unless [the intoxication was involuntary].” Egelhoff was convicted of deliberate homicide after a trial at which the judge told the jury, in accordance with §45-2-203, that it could not consider his intoxicated condition in determining whether he had acted purposely or knowingly. The Montana Supreme Court reversed and held the statute unconstitutional. The court said that the evidence of Egelhoff’s intoxication was “clear[ly] . . . relevant to the issue of whether [he] acted knowingly and purposely,” and that the rule precluding consideration of that evidence had in effect “relieved [the State] of part of its burden to prove [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p id="770525d4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court did not agree, but the Court produced five separate opinions and was unable to agree on a single rationale. Justice Scalia, writing for four members of the Court, emphasized that the State must still offer evidence sufficient to prove purpose or knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. He acknowledged that “by excluding a significant line of evidence that might refute mens rea, the statute made it easier for the State to meet [that] requirement.” “But,” Justice Scalia continued, “<i>any</i> evidentiary rule can have that effect. ‘Reducing’ the State’s burden in this manner is not unconstitutional, unless the rule of evidence itself violates a fundamental principle of fairness (which . . . this one does not).” Id. at 55. Justice O’Connor, also writing for four members of the Court, reached the opposite conclusion. She reasoned that “to impede the defendant’s ability to throw doubt on the State’s case, [makes] the State’s burden to prove its case . . . correspondingly easier,” and that the statute therefore violated the due process requirement that the prosecution prove each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 61.</p>
<p id="77054ce5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Ginsburg, casting the deciding vote, found it unnecessary to resolve this disagreement and upheld the Montana statute on a different ground. She concluded that the Montana rule did <i>not</i> exclude evidence relevant to a <span title="1013" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1013">p. 1013</span>required element of the offense, because §45-2-203 had in effect redefined deliberate homicide. As she interpreted Montana law, a deliberate-homicide conviction required the prosecution to prove <i>either</i> (1) that the defendant had killed purposely or knowingly, <i>or</i> (2) “that the defendant killed under circumstances that would otherwise establish knowledge or purpose ‘but for’ [the defendant’s] voluntary intoxication.” Id. at 58. She reasoned that Montana had not excluded relevant exculpatory evidence, because the intoxication evidence was irrelevant to an accusation based on the second theory, which the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77054ce6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is Justice Ginsburg’s interpretation of the Montana statute workable? In the case of an intoxicated actor, how should the jury go about determining whether his act of killing <i>would have been</i> knowing or purposeful “but for” his voluntary intoxication? Which of the opinions offers the best way of implementing the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt? Consider State v. Boyston, 298 P.3d 887, 897-899 (Ariz. 2013). The defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death after a trial in which he was barred from offering evidence of voluntary intoxication to rebut the required element of premeditation; the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, upholding the constitutionality under <i>Egelhoff</i> of the state’s statute, which provides that evidence of voluntary intoxication was not admissible to rebut <i>any</i> required mental state.</p>
</div>
<p id="77054ce7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For incisive critiques of the opinions in <i>Egelhoff</i>, see Ronald J. Allen, Forward: <i>Montana v. Egelhoff</i>—Reflections on the Limits of Legislative Imagination and Judicial Authority, 87 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 633 (1997); Larry Alexander, The Supreme Court, Dr. Jekyll, and the Due Process of Proof, 1996 Sup. Ct. Rev. 191.</p>
<p id="77054ce8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>6. A separate offense?</i> In his critique of the MPC’s recklessness “equation” (the notion that knowingly drinking to excess is equivalent to knowingly creating a risk of harm), Professor Morse argues that this notion confuses the vague and relatively minor culpability involved in choosing to get drunk with the much more serious culpability involved in the mens rea required for crimes like rape and murder. But what criminal charges would be available if the prosecution must restrict its attention to the defendant’s conduct in choosing to get drunk? At present, such behavior usually is not in itself a crime. Should it be? A German statute creates a separate offense applicable to any person who commits a wrongful act after intentionally or negligently getting intoxicated. Although the act of getting drunk must be committed intentionally or negligently, no additional culpability is required with respect to the subsequent wrongful act that brings the statute into play. See George Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law 846-848 (1978). Is this kind of law preferable to the American approach? And if so, what punishment would be appropriate for the crime of committing a wrongful act after intentionally or negligently getting drunk?</p>
<p id="77054ce9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>7. Voluntary intoxication and insanity.</i> Should evidence of voluntary intoxication be admissible for any purpose other than to refute the existence <span title="1014" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1014">p. 1014</span>of the specific mens rea of the charged offense? Such intoxication, if severe, might produce a state in which culpability in the broader sense—the ability to understand the consequences of one’s actions or to meaningfully choose to engage in them—is entirely absent. The common-law rule, still widely in effect, allows a defense when voluntary intoxication produces a <i>permanent</i> condition sufficient to meet the jurisdiction’s test for legal insanity—for example, a substantial incapacity either to appreciate the criminality of the actor’s conduct or to conform to the law. When this incapacity results from prolonged extensive use of alcohol, it is therefore treated the same as a similar incapacity that results from mental disease. But when voluntary intoxication causes such an incapacity only on a temporary basis, it is not a defense. See State v. Booth, 169 N.W.2d 869, 873 (Iowa 1969).</p>
<p id="77054cea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is this rule so restrictive because it is unlikely that someone might become temporarily insane through intoxication? Or because it would be too difficult to detect false assertions of such a condition? Why should a defendant’s choice to become drunk deprive him of an insanity defense, if his assertion of temporary insanity is factually true? For a critique of this restrictive approach, see Mark A. Grimes, Note, Punishing Temporary Drug-Induced Insanity: An Analysis of State v. Hotz, 91 Neb. L. Rev. 502 (2012-2013).</p>

<p id="770573ff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should evidence of intoxication be treated differently if the defendant did not <i>choose</i> to become intoxicated, but instead became drunk by accident or because someone else tricked him into getting drunk? In one respect, involuntary intoxication is clearly treated more generously than voluntary intoxication is. When <i>involuntary</i> intoxication produces a condition sufficient to meet the jurisdiction’s test for legal insanity, it can be a defense even if the impaired condition is only <i>temporary</i> (see MPC §2.08(4)); in contrast, as the preceding section explains, when the same incapacity results from <i>voluntary</i> intoxication, it does not afford a defense (beyond its permitted relevance to mens rea), unless the incapacity is <i>permanent</i>.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1231D_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1231D_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">91</a></span> But perhaps surprisingly, a defendant who is impaired to a lesser degree does not have an incapacity defense, even when that incapacity resulted from <i>purely involuntary</i> intoxication. As the MPC Commentaries explain, “The actor whose personality is altered by intoxication to a lesser degree [than legal insanity] is treated like others who may have difficulty in conforming to the law [through no fault of their own] and yet are held responsible for violation.”

<span class="epub-small-caps">LORD TAYLOR OF GOSFORTH, C.J.</span> [for the Court of Appeal]: [In order to blackmail defendant, Penn lured a 15-year-old boy to his (Penn’s) flat and then invited defendant over to abuse the boy sexually. Penn photographed and audiotaped defendant committing the act. At trial for indecent assault, defendant said he could not remember drinking anything before going to the bedroom, but stated that he sometimes drank coffee at Penn’s flat. In addition, defendant could be heard to say on the tape “I don’t know why, am I falling asleep?” and “Have you put something in my coffee?”</p><p id="77059b17-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[At trial, the judge instructed the jury it should acquit the defendant only if it found that because of the drug he did not intend to commit an indecent assault upon the boy, but so long as he did have that intent, it was irrelevant that he had been drugged, because “a drugged intent is still an intent.” The jury convicted.</p><p id="77059b18-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendant’s counsel argued on appeal that “an accused person may be entitled to be acquitted if there is a possibility that although his act was intentional, the intent itself arose out of circumstances for which he bears no blame.” After noting that there was little authority for this proposition, the court turned to first principles:]</p><p id="77059b19-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he purpose of the criminal law is to inhibit, by proscription and by penal sanction, anti-social acts which individuals may otherwise commit. . . . Having paedophiliac inclinations and desires is not proscribed; putting them into practice is. If the sole reason why the threshold between the two has been crossed is or may have been that the inhibition which the law requires has been removed by the clandestine act of a third party, the purposes of the criminal law are not served by nevertheless holding that the person performing the act is guilty of an offence. . . . If therefore drink or drug, surreptitiously administered, causes a person to lose his self-control and for that reason to form an intent which he would not otherwise have formed, . . . the law should exculpate him because the operative fault is not his.

<span class="epub-small-caps">LORD MUSTILL</span> [for the House of Lords]: [W]e are concerned here with a case of disinhibition.

 . . . The decision [below] was explicitly founded on [the] general principle . . . that if blame is absent the necessary mens rea must also be absent. My Lords, with every respect I must [reject the] argument which treats the absence of moral fault on the part of the appellant as sufficient in itself to negative the necessary mental element of the offence. . . . 
</p><p id="77059b1d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To recognize a new defense of this type would be a bold step. . . . So one must turn to consider just what defence is now to be created.

The defence applies to all offences, except perhaps to absolute [strict liability] offences.

The defence is a complete answer to a criminal charge. If not rebutted it leads to an outright acquittal, and unlike provocation and diminished responsibility leaves no room for conviction and punishment for a lesser offence. The underlying assumption must be that the defendant is entirely free from culpability. . . . 
</p><p id="77059b20-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">5. The defence is subjective in nature. Whereas provocation and self-defence are judged by the reactions of the reasonable person in the situation of the defendant, here the only question is whether this particular defendant’s inhibitions were overcome by the effect of the drug. The more susceptible the defendant to the kind of temptation presented, the easier the defence is to establish.</p><p id="77059b21-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he defence appears to run into difficulties at every turn. . . . Before the jury could form an opinion on whether the drug might have turned the scale witnesses would have to give a picture of the defendant’s personality and susceptibilities, for without it the crucial effect of the drug could not be assessed; pharmacologists would be required to describe the potentially disinhibiting effect of a range of drugs whose identity would, if the present case is anything to go by, be unknown; psychologists and psychiatrists would express opinions, not on the matters of psychopathology familiar to those working within the framework of the Mental Health Acts but on altogether more elusive concepts. No doubt as time passed those concerned could work out techniques to deal with these questions. Much more significant would be the opportunities for a spurious defence. Even in the field of road traffic the “spiked” drink as a special reason for not disqualifying from driving is a regular feature. Transferring this to the entire range of criminal offences is a disturbing prospect. The defendant would only have to assert, and support by the evidence of well-wishers, that he was not the sort of person to have done this kind of thing, and to suggest an occasion when by some means a drug might have been administered to him for the jury to be sent straight to the question of a possible disinhibition. The judge would direct the jurors that if they felt any legitimate doubt on the matter—and by its nature the defence would be one which the prosecution would often have no means to rebut—they must acquit outright. . . . 
</p><p id="7705c232-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">My Lords, the fact that a new doctrine may require adjustment of existing principles to accommodate it, and may require those involved in criminal <span title="1017" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1017">p. 1017</span>trials to learn new techniques, is not of course a ground for refusing to adopt it, if that is what the interests of justice require. Here, however, justice makes no such demands, for the interplay between the wrong done to the victim, the individual characteristics and frailties of the defendant, and the pharmacological effects of whatever drug may be potentially involved can be far better recognised by a tailored choice from the continuum of sentences available to the judge than by the application of a single Yea-or-Nay jury decision.

<i>1. A problem of culpability or of proof?</i> The House of Lords offered two different grounds for rejecting the defense of involuntary intoxication—that involuntary “disinhibition” does not negate mens rea because an intoxicated defendant still possesses the intent to perform the criminal act, and that such a defense would create insurmountable evidentiary problems. Is the court right that the defendant’s preexisting illegal desires make his actions voluntary to some degree? Or was the lower court right that in such cases the purposes of the criminal law are not served by punishment? If no purposes of punishment are served, are problems of proof nonetheless sufficient reason to deny a defense?</p>

<i>2. Pushing the boundaries of intoxication.</i> While alcohol and illegal drugs are the most common intoxicating substances, defendants have also asserted defenses of involuntary intoxication from taking prescription medication. In People v. Garcia, 113 P.3d 775 (Colo. 2005), the defendant went berserk and brutally assaulted his wife a few days after she asked for a divorce; the court held that he was entitled to present a defense that his behavior was triggered by involuntary intoxication in the form of insulin shock unexpectedly resulting from his own injection of a large dose of insulin for his diabetic condition. In Cobb v. State, 884 So. 2d 437 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004), a defendant who shot her former lover was not allowed to present evidence of involuntary intoxication based on the effects of the antidepressants Xanax and Paxil, because she had knowingly taken higher-than-prescribed doses. In another case, a person who went camping in the desert was charged with murder after fatally stabbing a fellow camper; he was not allowed to assert a defense of involuntary intoxication based on severe dehydration during the trip. See Shawn Marie Boyne &amp; Gary C. Mitchell, Death in the Desert: A New Look at the Involuntary Intoxication Defense in New Mexico, 32 N.M. L. Rev. 243 (2002). The preference of these defendants to claim involuntary intoxication rather than insanity may reflect the fact that involuntary intoxication is a more protective defense. As noted in the <i>Garcia</i> case, supra (113 P.3d at 783):</p>

Presumably, the assumption is that a person who is legally insane is more likely to be dangerous to others in the future than a person whose ordinary mental condition was altered by involuntary intoxication. But does the difference in consequences make sense in the absence of assurance that the impact on the defendant of the intoxicants will truly be temporary? Reconsider these issues in connection with the material on the disposition of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, p. 1025 Note 2 infra. </p>

<i>3. Recent trends.</i> For a review of the recent case law, see Jennifer Piel, The Defense of Involuntary Intoxication by Prescribed Medications: An Appellate Case Review, 43 J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry L. 321 (2015). Courts apparently are becoming increasingly inhospitable to the defenses of both voluntary and involuntary intoxication. See Meghan Paulk Ingle, Law on the Rocks: The Intoxication Defenses Are Being Eighty-Sixed, 55 Vand. L. Rev. 607, 631 (2002), arguing that narrowing legal standards and jury hostility to intoxication defenses have rendered them “essentially unavailable.”</p>

<p id="77063770-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mental incapacity has legal significance in a variety of settings; for example, it may render a contract unenforceable or a will void. In the criminal process, mental incapacity can be a defense to a criminal charge, or it can preclude the guilty plea, trial, sentencing, or execution of a defendant. Our principal focus is on the appropriate contours of the insanity defense: What forms of mental incapacity should provide a complete defense to criminal responsibility? Note how the insanity defense differs from duress; in duress the actor argues that she is no different from the rest of us, whereas the basis for the insanity excuse is that she is <i>very</i> different from the rest of us. Before wrestling with the complexities of competing legal standards for insanity, consider the following accounts of two seriously mentally ill defendants, both of whom were deemed competent to stand trial and whose defenses of insanity were rejected by juries.</p>
<p id="77065e81-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. A tale of two insanity defenses. (a) Steven Green</i> (facts reported in State v. Green, 643 S.W.2d 902 (Tenn. 1982)). Steven Green was 18 years old when he shot and killed a Chattanooga police officer with the officer’s own revolver in a city park where the homeless Green was apparently residing. A bizarre note left on the victim’s body led the police to an FBI agent, who reported that Green had walked into the FBI building a few weeks before the murder complaining of “voices” that were “directing” him. In response, the agent suggested to Green that he seek mental health assistance at a city hospital, advice that Green did not follow.</p>
<p id="77065e82-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1019" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1019">p. 1019</span>Green’s mental illness had become apparent early in his life. He first received psychiatric treatment at the age of seven, when he was diagnosed with paranoia and treated for more than two years. At age 12, Green attacked his mother with a knife and again received short-term psychiatric treatment. As a teenager, Green reported hearing voices and exhibited increasingly bizarre behavior, which led to his hospitalization for more than a month, until his family’s insurance coverage ran out. He continued to receive out-patient care, but because the medications he received made him feel like a “zombie,” he stopped taking them and refused to return to the out-patient clinic. Although Green managed to graduate from high school and enlisted in the Navy, he was soon thereafter discharged for failure to adapt to regulations. Continuing to hear voices, he attacked his brother with a knife and ran away from his parents’ home in New York City to Tennessee, where he stayed first with an uncle and then with an aunt; both relatives ejected him from their homes because of his bizarre and potentially dangerous behavior. His father traveled to Tennessee and tried to persuade Green to return home to New York, but Green refused, so his father left him in Memphis with some money and a new pair of shoes. Two months later, Green was arrested for murder. On the day Officer Wilcox was killed, Green was found carrying what was apparently his only possession at that time, a pair of shiny black shoes.</p>
<p id="77065e83-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although initially found incompetent to stand trial and committed to a mental health facility, Green’s ability to think coherently gradually improved in response to intensive drug therapy, and he was found competent to stand trial. At trial, mental health experts testified that they and all the other professional staff members who had contact with Green after his arrest agreed unanimously that he was insane at the time the offense. The prosecution offered no experts in rebuttal, but instead presented police officers who had contact with Green at around the time of the offense; they testified that Green appeared “normal” to them. The jury rejected Green’s insanity defense and convicted him of first-degree murder.</p>
<p id="77065e84-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Andrea Yates</i> (facts reported in Yates v. State, 171 S.W.3d 215 (Tex. App. 2005)). Andrea Yates drowned her five children, ranging in age from seven months to seven years, in a bathtub in an attempt, she said, to save them from Satan. After giving birth to three children in three-and-a-half years, Yates moved with her family into a converted bus in a trailer park in the Houston area. When she told her husband that she felt depressed and overwhelmed, he suggested that she talk to her mother and a friend. After the birth of her fourth child a year later, Yates suffered from severe depression and tried to commit suicide. She was admitted to the psychiatric unit of a hospital for a week and continued to see a psychiatrist after her release. A month later, her husband found her holding a knife to her own throat in the bathroom, and she was again hospitalized. During this hospitalization, Yates told a psychologist that she had been having visions and hearing voices since the birth of her first child. Her treating psychiatrist ranked Yates as one of the five sickest patients he had ever seen at the time of this second hospitalization, and he warned both <span title="1020" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1020">p. 1020</span>Yates and her husband that she had a high risk of another psychotic episode if she had another baby.</p>
<p id="77065e85-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fifteen months later, Yates gave birth to her fifth child. A few months after that, Yates’s father died, and she began to suffer from depression again. She was again hospitalized. During this hospitalization, Yates was placed on suicide watch and was observed as being catatonic or nearly catatonic and possibly delusional. Two weeks later, Yates was discharged at her own and her husband’s request, though she continued to receive out-patient care. The psychiatrist who discharged her recommended that someone stay with her at all times and that she not be left alone with her children. Yates’s mother-in-law came to help with the children, and reported that Yates was almost catatonic, stared into space, scratched her head until she created bald spots, and did not eat. Three weeks later, Yates was hospitalized again but discharged after ten days, refusing her doctor’s recommendation that she receive electroconvulsive therapy. During the next month, Yates did not report any suicidal or psychotic thoughts, and her psychiatrist decided to taper her off of Haldol, the powerful antipsychotic drug that had been previously prescribed, though she remained on other antidepressant medication. Five weeks after her most recent hospital discharge, Yates methodically drowned all five of her children.</p>
<p id="77065e86-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At trial, 12 mental health professionals testified regarding Yates’s mental state. All agreed that she was psychotic at the time of her offense, and only one testified that Yates’s mental state did not meet the state’s insanity standard. The jury nonetheless rejected her insanity defense and found her guilty of capital murder, though she was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death.</p>
<p id="77065e87-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) The sequels.</i> Despite the rejection of their insanity defenses by their trial juries, Green and Yates each prevailed in different ways on appeal. The appellate court reversed Green’s conviction on the ground that the prosecution had failed to carry its burden of disproving insanity, as was then (but no longer is) required by Tennessee law. The appellate court reversed Yates’s conviction on the ground that the lone expert who testified against her insanity plea had suggested that Yates fabricated her defense after watching a Law &amp; Order television episode about a woman who drowned her children and was found to be insane; in fact, no such episode existed. On retrial before a new jury in 2006, Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity. For insightful analysis of the <i>Yates</i> trials, see Theodore Y. Blumoff, Rationality, Insanity, and the Insanity Defense: Reflections on the Limits of Reason, 39 Law &amp; Psychol. Rev. 161 (2014).</p>
<p id="77065e88-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d) Thoughts and questions.</i> The <i>Yates</i> and <i>Green</i> cases, though not “typical” (perhaps no insanity case is), offer some insight into the dynamics of criminal justice in insanity-defense cases. Before considering the details of legal doctrine, we can reflect on several broader issues:</p>
<p id="77065e89-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, Green’s and Yates’s appellate victories are as rare as their initial trial defeats are common: The insanity defense is rarely asserted and even more <span title="1021" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1021">p. 1021</span>rarely accepted. See pp. 1044-1045 infra. Why are juries so reluctant to accept an insanity plea, and is that reluctance appropriate or misplaced? Should our legal system run the risk of imposing criminal punishment on individuals who are as deeply impaired as Green and Yates clearly were?</p>
<p id="77065e8a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, both Green and Yates were able to offer extensive expert testimony to support their insanity pleas. Should a successful defense require so much medical (as opposed to lay) testimony? Does the necessity of producing expert witnesses unduly limit the defense to defendants wealthy enough to hire such experts (or lucky enough to have court-appointed lawyers who have the inclination and resources to do so)? Are juries right to approach such expert testimony with great skepticism? Or should our rules encourage juries to give more deference to the weight of expert opinion?</p>
<p id="77065e8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, consider how easily (at least in hindsight) we can identify so many missed opportunities to prevent the tragic deaths that occurred: Green could have received more consistent mental health treatment throughout his childhood; that he did not is largely explained simply by the fact that his own family lacked adequate health insurance coverage. Green’s homelessness could have been addressed by his family, or by local charities, or by the City of Chattanooga. The FBI agent to whom Green turned could have done something to assure that he received treatment. Yates could have received more aggressive treatment from the many mental health professionals who saw her and recognized the seriousness of her illness. Or she could have gotten more help from family members. Perhaps she and her husband should have heeded the warning about not having more children or been offered counseling on how to avoid future pregnancies.</p>
<p id="77065e8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do these missed opportunities suggest that it is unjust to hold people like Green and Yates responsible for their criminal acts, given how clear their mental illness was to all around them? Or does the proper response lie in the provision of better social services rather than in changes within the criminal justice system?</p>
<p id="77065e8d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Terminology defined.</i> In considering the relevance of mental incapacity in the criminal process, it is helpful to distinguish among three distinct concepts: mental illness, insanity, and incompetence. “Mental illness” is a medical rather than a legal term, used by clinicians to refer to a disorder recognized by the therapeutic community for purposes of diagnosis and treatment. In contrast, “insanity” is a legal term that refers to a mental state, existing at the time of a criminal offense, that is considered sufficient to preclude criminal responsibility. “Incompetence” is also a legal term; it refers to a person’s mental state at the time of a legal proceeding. A person who lacks sufficient mental capacity to understand or participate in the relevant legal proceeding is deemed incompetent (either to stand trial, enter a guilty plea, be sentenced, or even be executed). Because the medical category of mental illness is far broader than the legal categories of insanity or incompetence, it is possible and indeed common for people suffering from mental illness to be held neither insane nor incompetent. Because the determinations of insanity and incompetence refer <span title="1022" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1022">p. 1022</span>to different time periods (time of offense versus time of legal proceeding), and because the legal standards for insanity and incompetence are different, it is possible that a person could be deemed insane and yet competent, or conversely, sane and yet incompetent to stand trial or participate in other legal proceedings. For probing analysis of the distinct legal doctrines relating to mental disorder at various stages of the criminal process (and in related processes that lead to confinement for purposes of social protection), see Stephen J. Morse, Mental Disorder and Criminal Law, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 885 (2011).</p>

Competence to stand trial.</i> Although precise wording varies across jurisdictions, Model Penal Code §4.04 states the generally accepted test of competence to be tried and sentenced: “No person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures.” In Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960), the Court stated: “[T]he test must be whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding—and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.” This focus on “rational” and “factual” understanding, however, typically neglects mood disorders and certain forms of organic brain damage that can “unreasonably [interfere] with decision-relevant emotional perception, processing, and expression.” Terry A. Maroney, Emotional Competence, “Rational Understanding,” and the Criminal Defendant, 43 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1375, 1381 (2006). The <i>Dusky</i> test remains in widespread use, e.g., State v. Smith, 878 N.W.2d 135, 148 (Wis. 2016), but there is no uniform standard for competency evaluations,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12467_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12467_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">93</a></span> and courts differ on whether the defense or prosecution has the burden to prove competency.

<p id="770685a0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">May defendants be forcibly medicated in order to render them competent to stand trial? The Supreme Court held in Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003), that the Constitution sometimes permits forced medication to render a defendant competent to stand trial, but suggested that those instances may well be “rare” in light of the constitutional right to refuse medical treatment in the absence of unusual circumstances. To uphold such involuntary treatment, a court must find that (1) the government has an important interest in trying the defendant for the crime at issue; (2) forced medication is likely to render the defendant competent and unlikely to have side effects that interfere with the ability to assist defense counsel; (3) alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results; and (4) the treatment is in the defendant’s best medical interest in light of her condition. A principal concern is that these criteria give insufficient weight to forced medication’s <span title="1023" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1023">p. 1023</span>potential for negative side effects. See Dora W. Klein, Curiouser and Curiouser: Involuntary Medications and Incompetent Criminal Defendants After Sell v. United States, 13 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 897, 899-900 (2005), arguing that “[a]ny medication that succeeds in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial is likely to alter his mental functioning and physical appearance in myriad ways, thereby potentially compromising the fairness of his trial.” For further criticism of <i>Sell</i>’s framework, see Tobias Schad (Note), Insane in the Membrane: Arguing Against the Forcible Medication of Mentally Ill Pre-Trial Defendants, 23 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 351, 379 (2014); Dora W.

<p id="770685a1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is a finding of incompetence to stand trial warranted when a defendant’s memory is impaired? If the defendant is suffering from total amnesia concerning the alleged crime but is otherwise in full command of her faculties, most courts hold that the defendant <i>is</i> competent to stand trial. See United States v. Minter, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132804 (N.D. Ga. 2014); State v. Decato, 75 A.3d 1131 (N.H. 2013). What is the basis for this view? Doesn’t an inability to recall the events charged seriously impede a defendant’s ability to mount a defense? Compare State v. McClendon, 419 P.2d 69 (Ariz. 1966) (improper to hold trial if continuance might enable amnesiac to recover).</p>

<i>4. Execution.</i> In Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment’s proscription of “cruel and unusual punishment” bars execution of the insane, but the Court offered no definition of what constitutes insanity for purposes of the Eighth Amendment requirement. Nor did the Court pinpoint the specific reasons <i>why</i> execution of the “insane” would be cruel and unusual. Justice Marshall, speaking for five members of the Court, concluded:</p>

We know of virtually no authority condoning the execution of the insane at English common law. . . .  And the intuition that such an execution simply offends humanity is evidently shared across this Nation. Faced with such widespread evidence of a restriction upon sovereign power, this Court is compelled to conclude that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane. Whether its aim be to protect the condemned from fear and pain without comfort of understanding, or to protect the dignity of society itself from the barbarity of exacting mindless vengeance, the restriction finds enforcement in the Eighth Amendment.</p>

<p id="770685a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[S]ome authorities contended that the prohibition against executing the insane was justified as a way of preserving the defendant’s ability to make arguments on his own behalf. [This justification] has slight merit today.

<p id="770685a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more general concern of the common law—that executions of the insane are simply cruel—retains its vitality. It is as true today as when Coke lived that most men and women value the opportunity to prepare, mentally and spiritually, for their death. Moreover, today as at common law, one of the death penalty’s critical justifications, its retributive force, depends on the defendant’s awareness of the penalty’s existence and purpose. . . . For precisely these reasons, Florida requires the Governor to stay executions of those who “d[o] not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of the death penalty and why it was imposed” on them. Fla. Stat. §922.07 (1985). A number of States have more rigorous standards, but none disputes the need to require that those who are executed know the fact of their impending execution and the reason for it. Such a standard appropriately defines the kind of mental deficiency that should trigger the Eighth Amendment prohibition.</p>

Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 959 (2007). A few states have adopted stricter tests. In Washington and South Carolina, sanity for purposes of execution requires that the prisoner not only understand the nature of the death penalty and why it is being imposed, but also have the ability to communicate rationally with defense counsel. Singleton v. State, 437 S.E.2d 53 (S.C. 1993); State v. Harris, 789 P.2d 60, 64-65 (Wash. 1990).

<p id="770685aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has not decided whether it is constitutionally permissible to forcibly medicate a prisoner in order to render him competent to be executed. The problem is a recurrent one, because up to 70 percent of death-row inmates are estimated to suffer some form of mental illness, and antipsychotic drugs are an increasingly popular means of treating mental disorder. See Robert Johnson, Death Work 50 (1990). Yet “[a]ccording to nearly universal ethical opinion within the mental health professions, treatment with the purpose or inevitable effect of enabling the state to carry out an otherwise prohibited execution is unethical.” See Brian D. Shannon &amp; Victor R. Scarano, Incompetency to Be Executed: Continuing Ethical Challenges and Time for a Change in Texas, 45 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 419, 424 (2013) (quoting Professor Richard Bonnie). At least two courts have held that the state may not subject an insane death-row prisoner to antipsychotic medication, against his will, in order to restore his sanity so that he may be executed. See Singleton <span title="1025" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1025">p. 1025</span>v. State, 437 S.E.2d 53, 62 (S.C. 1993) (“justice can never be served by forcing medication on an incompetent inmate for the sole purpose of getting him well enough to execute”); State v. Perry, 610 So. 2d 746, 747 (La. 1992) (same). Does that approach mean that the incompetent prisoner (or someone acting on his behalf) must choose between continued insanity and death by execution? Is there any way to escape this dilemma? See Kristen Wenstrup Crosby, Comment, <i>State v. Perry</i>, 77 Minn. L. Rev. 1193 (1993).</p>
<p id="770685ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of persons with mental retardation, even if they are not “insane” under the <i>Ford</i> standard. See p. 580 supra. As in <i>Ford</i>, the Court discerned a societal consensus (though not unanimity) against the execution of those with mental retardation. But whereas the <i>Ford</i> Court had based the exemption from execution on the condemned inmate’s mental state at the time of execution, the <i>Atkins</i> Court explained that mental retardation precludes execution because it undermines a defendant’s culpability for the charged crime at the time it was committed and places such defendants at special risk of wrongful execution. Id. at 319-321. <i>Atkins</i>, however, applies only to conditions of mental retardation. If a defendant has a history of mental illness but not retardation, <i>Atkins</i> does not apply, and the Eighth Amendment does not preclude execution. Dickerson v.

<p id="7706abbe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Who may raise the defense?</i> In most jurisdictions, the decision to raise the insanity issue must be left entirely within the defendant’s control. Courts have stressed that a properly counseled defendant may prefer to be found guilty rather than not guilty by reason of insanity, because the latter verdict can lead to longer confinement, more intrusive treatment, or greater stigma. See, e.g., Frendak v. United States, 408 A.2d 364 (D.C. 1979). And a competent defendant may decline to plead insanity even against the advice of his attorney. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Federici, 696 N.E.2d 111 (Mass. 1998). Compare Hughes v. State, 2011 Ark. LEXIS 134 (Apr. 7, 2011). In a prosecution for making terroristic threats, the defendant pled not guilty, but the state introduced evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease at the time of the offense. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and the court ordered him committed; the Arkansas Supreme Court then dismissed his appeal on the ground that state statutes granted an appeal in a criminal case only when the defendant had been “convicted.” And see Bratty v. Attorney-General, [1963] A.C. 386, 411, where Lord Denning, speaking of the English practice, said: “The old notion that only the defence can raise a defence of insanity is now gone. The prosecution are entitled to raise it and it is their duty to do so rather than allow a dangerous person to be at large.”</p>
<p id="7706abbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Disposition after acquittal.</i> How should the law deal with defendants who have been acquitted on grounds of legal insanity? As they have been found not guilty, they cannot be blamed for their actions. On the other <span title="1026" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1026">p. 1026</span>hand, those actions have done harm and the public demands protection against any repetition. Consider the following:</p>
<p id="7706abc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Civil commitment.</i> One approach to protecting the public while also respecting the person’s innocence is to rely on the processes for civil commitment. In these processes, a judge, after a hearing, decides whether to commit a person indefinitely to a mental institution because he is suffering from a mental disability that makes him a danger to himself or others. In states that adopt this approach, insanity acquittees may be committed only in compliance with the procedural and substantive standards for any mentally disturbed person in the community, and there are constitutional restrictions on civil commitment. For example, the standard of proof is high—both mental illness and dangerousness must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979). That high threshold in civil commitment serves to reduce the risk of confining members of the public who are simply idiosyncratic. But is that concern equally applicable to those who have been shown to be irresponsible authors of criminal acts? Many states have thought not and have enacted special commitment procedures for insanity acquittees in which the crucial factual findings (mental illness and dangerousness) can be made by a preponderance of the evidence. See Jan Brakel, After the Verdict: Dispositional Decisions Regarding Criminal Defendants Acquitted by Reason of Insanity, 37 DePaul L. Rev. 181 (1988).</p>
<p id="7706abc1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other jurisdictions follow a different approach: Commitment is automatic and mandatory for all insanity acquittees. In defense of this approach, it has been observed that it “not only provides the public with the maximum immediate protection, but may also work to the advantage of mentally diseased or defective defendants by making the defense of irresponsibility more acceptable to the public and to the jury.” Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §4.08 at 256 (1985). But is a finding that the defendant was insane at the time of the offense sufficiently probative of present mental illness and dangerousness to justify confinement?</p>
<p id="7706abc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory commitment. The Court asserted as a matter of common sense that the mental disorder and dangerousness of an insanity acquittee are likely to continue through to the time of trial and thereafter. Do you agree? Even if a presumption of continuing insanity is plausible, what is the justification for making that presumption in effect irrebuttable, by requiring automatic commitment without any hearing on the present mental disorder and dangerousness of the defendant? The Court in <i>Jones</i> also noted that the committed person was given an opportunity to demonstrate his recovery at a hearing within 50 days of commitment. Does this allay the reservations about the justification for the initial commitment? One court noted “the practical difficulties of requiring a mental patient to overcome the effects of his confinement, his closed environment, his possible incompetence and the debilitating effects of drugs or other treatment. . . . ” Fasulo v. Arafeh, 378 A.2d 553, <span title="1027" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1027">p. 1027</span>557 (Conn. 1997). These practical difficulties often mean that the initial commitment becomes an indefinite one.</p>
<p id="7706abc3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Duration of confinement.</i> Regardless of the procedure used to support an initial commitment, how long may the person committed be held? The average insanity acquittee apparently remains confined for nearly twice as long as the typical defendant convicted of the same charges. See Scott Brooks, Comment, Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Why a Maligned Defense Demands a Constitutional Right of Inquiry on Voir Dire, 20 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 1183, 1200 (2013). In California, individuals charged with nonviolent crimes who were acquitted by reason of insanity were confined nine times longer than those convicted of similar crimes. Fatma Marouf, Assumed Sane, 101 Cornell L. Rev. Online 25, 31 (2016). And although insanity acquittals are comparatively rare, the cumulative total of insanity acquittees confined after their trials is significant; as of July of 2015, California had 1,417 acquittees in state hospitals. See Amanda Joy Peters &amp; Indira Azizi Lex, Improving Insanity Aftercare, 42 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 564 (2016).</p>
<p id="7706abc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under regular civil commitment statutes, the medical facility must release the patient when he has recovered and is no longer dangerous to himself or others. Provisions for commitment of insanity acquittees, however, require that the appropriate finding be made by a judge, usually with the burden on the inmate to prove that he meets the conditions for release. As a result, the person committed after winning acquittal may in practice be held indefinitely, sometimes for his entire life.</p>
<p id="7706abc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should extended commitment of this sort be permissible even when the crime charged was a minor property offense punishable by no more than a short prison term? In <i>Jones</i>, supra, the Supreme Court held that an insanity acquittee subjected to automatic commitment could be held indefinitely, even when the period he had spent in confinement exceeded the maximum sentence authorized for the underlying offense. The Court reasoned that dangerousness warranting indefinite commitment may be established by proof of a nonviolent act against property, in that case, shoplifting. Do you agree? Is there a case for requiring release at the maximum term for the offense of which the person was acquitted, unless the state can then meet the ordinary criteria for civil commitment by establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the inmate continues to be mentally ill and a danger to himself or others? This is the law in roughly a dozen states. See, e.g., Wood v. Main, 789 F. Supp. 2d 519, 520 (D.N.J. 2011); Brakel, supra, at 196.</p>
<p id="7706abc6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Guilty but mentally ill.</i> One major concern in states using standard civil commitment is that a committed insanity acquittee may be released too soon. In Michigan, an acquittee committed under the ordinary civil commitment laws was released, as the law required, upon a medical determination that he was no longer mentally ill and dangerous. His recovery, however, was dependent upon his continuing to take his prescribed medicine, which he failed to do, resulting in a crime spree that shocked the community. This led to the enactment in Michigan of the first “Guilty but Mentally Ill” statute. <span title="1028" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1028">p. 1028</span>See Sharon M. Brown &amp; Nicholas J. Wittner, Criminal Law (1978 Annual Survey of Michigan Law), 25 Wayne L. Rev. 335 (1978). This statute allowed the jury three options—it could find the defendant guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity, or guilty but mentally ill (GMI) at the time of the offense. If the jury returns a GMI verdict, the court retains the same sentencing authority it has when a defendant is found guilty; if the court sentences the defendant to prison, he is to be given treatment “as is psychiatrically indicated for his mental illness,” but even if treatment is successful, the defendant still must serve the full term to which he was sentenced. Such GMI statutes are now found in about a dozen states, almost always as an addition to, rather than a replacement for, the traditional insanity defense. See, e.g., People v. Jackson, 37 N.E.3d 883 (2015).What is the practical effect of such laws? In their favor, GMI statutes establish a cap on how long the defendant can be held without a fresh judicial determination of dangerousness and mental disorder. But in practice, are they likely to make an insanity acquittal less likely and thereby make conviction of morally innocent persons more likely? For a critique, see Stephen J. Morse, Preventive Detention: Mental Disorder and Criminal Law, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 885, 934 (2011).</p>
<p id="7706abc7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The experiment with “Guilty but Mentally Ill” statutes also suggests broader issues because of the pervasive perception that public safety considerations make some dilution of the insanity defense a practical necessity. Of course, many would dispute this view. But if public opinion insists on some such dilution, what is the best way to achieve it? Is it preferable to dilute the insanity defense in the way that the “Guilty but Mentally Ill” laws do (by encouraging juries not to vote an insanity acquittal) or in the way that <i>Jones</i>, supra, does (by depriving insanity acquittees of the full benefits of an ordinary acquittal)? See Stephen J. Schulhofer, Two Systems of Social Protection, 7 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 69 (1996); Paul H. Robinson, Forward: The Criminal-Civil Distinction and Dangerous Blameless Offenders, 83 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 693 (1993).</p>
<p id="7706abc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Instructing the jury on the consequences of an insanity acquittal.</i> In jurisdictions that provide for mandatory commitment following an insanity acquittal, defendants have pressed to have the jury informed of that fact because the jury may otherwise assume that an insanity acquittal will lead to the release of a dangerous, mentally unstable individual. Yet most courts have held that the jury should not be instructed on the procedures that follow an insanity verdict, on the ground that what will happen to the defendant is not relevant to whether the defendant meets the test of legal insanity. See, e.g., State v. Becker, 818 N.W.2d 135 (Iowa 2012). For federal prosecutions, the Supreme Court has held that juries should not be informed of the mandatory commitment provisions applicable under federal law. Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573 (1994). The Court said that “the principle that juries are not to consider the consequences of their verdicts is a reflection of the basic division of labor in our legal system between judge [as sentencer] and jury [as factfinder]”; the Court also noted that “[even if] some jurors will <span title="1029" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1029">p. 1029</span>harbor the mistaken belief that defendants found [not guilty by reason of insanity] will be released into society immediately . . . [there is] no reason to depart from ‘the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.’”</p>
<p id="7706abc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts take a less formalistic view, holding that when commitment is mandatory, a jury should be informed that a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity must be detained until she is no longer mentally ill and dangerous. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Mutina, 323 N.E.2d 294, 301-302 (Mass. 1975) (“If jurors can be entrusted with responsibility for a defendant’s life and liberty . . . they are entitled to know what protection they and their fellow citizens will have if they conscientiously apply the law to the evidence and arrive at a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.”). In Commonwealth v. Chappell, 40 N.E.3d 1031, 1043-1044 (Mass. 2015), the court concluded that its <i>Mutina</i> decision had not gone far enough: “On reflection, we think an instruction that . . . mentions the potential for successive commitment orders that could span the duration of the defendant’s life . . . may better accomplish [<i>Mutina</i>’s] purposes.” Accordingly, the court proposed adding to the Massachusetts model jury instructions the explanation that “[t]here is no limit to the number of such renewed orders of commitments as long as the defendant continues to be mentally ill and dangerous; if these conditions do continue, the defendant may remain committed for the duration of his [or her] life.” Id. at 1045.</p>

<i>4. Burden of proof.</i> All jurisdictions create a presumption of legal sanity at the trial. The effect of this presumption is that, in the absence of evidence on the issue, the sanity of the accused is presumed for all legal purposes. American jurisdictions, however, differ on two issues: (1) How much evidence must be presented before the effect of the presumption disappears and the question of the defendant’s insanity becomes an issue that must be established by the evidence? (2) Who bears the burden of persuasion, and how is that burden defined?</p>
<p id="7706d2dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the first question, some states require only “some evidence” of legal insanity in order to eliminate the presumption of sanity, e.g., People v. Hill, 934 P.2d 821 (Colo. 1997). Others require more, usually that the evidence raise a reasonable doubt about the sanity of the accused, e.g., Jamezic v. State, 723 So. 2d 355 (Ala. 1996). For discussion of the issue, see Julian Eule, The Presumption of Sanity: Bursting the Bubble, 25 UCLA L. Rev. 637 (1978).</p>
<p id="7706d2dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to the second question, once insanity becomes an issue, roughly a dozen states continue to adhere to what once was the majority rule requiring the prosecution to prove the sanity of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Keita, 712 N.E.2d 65, 73 (Mass. 1999), where the court supported this rule on the ground that “[t]here is no theoretical justification for maintaining a lower standard for the proof of sanity than for the proof of guilt.” This approach was widely abandoned in the aftermath of the <i>Hinckley</i> <span title="1030" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1030">p. 1030</span>verdict, see pp. 1043-1044 infra. About three-quarters of the states now place the burden of proof of insanity on the defense. <i>Keita</i>, supra at 71. In most of these jurisdictions, the defendant must meet that burden by a preponderance of the evidence. E.g., Simon v. State, 740 S.E.2d 819 (Ga. App. 2013); State v. Haq, 268 P.3d 997, 1003 (Wash. Ct. App. 2012). Several states are more demanding. In Florida, the defendant must prove insanity by “clear and convincing evidence,” Fla. Stat. §775.027(2) (2016), and in Wisconsin the defendant must establish insanity “to a reasonable certainty,” State v. Burton, 832 N.W.2d 611, 624 (Wis. 2013). For the federal courts, the question is governed by 18 U.S.C. §17(b) (2016): “The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence.”</p>

The mode of putting the latter part of the question to the jury on these occasions has generally been, whether the accused at the time of doing the act knew the difference between right and wrong: which mode, though rarely, if ever, leading to any mistake with the jury, is not, as we conceive, so accurate when put generally and in the abstract, as when put with reference to the party’s knowledge of right and wrong in respect to the very act with which he is charged. If the question were to be put as to the knowledge of the accused solely and exclusively with reference to the law of the land, it might tend to confound the jury, by inducing them to believe that an actual knowledge of the law of the land was essential in order to lead to a conviction; whereas the law is administered upon the principle that every one must be taken conclusively to know it, without proof that he does know it. If the accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if the act was at the same time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable; and the usual course therefore has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party accused had a sufficient degree of reason to know that he was doing an act that was wrong: and this course we think is correct, accompanied with such observations and explanations as the circumstances of each particular case may require.</p>

<p id="7706f9fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Before explaining what that standard actually is, I wish to draw your attention to some general considerations affecting the question of insanity in the criminal law in the hope that by so doing you may be helped to grasp what the law prescribes. The purpose of the law in punishing people is to prevent others from committing a like crime or crimes. Its prime purpose is to deter people from committing offences. It may be that there is an element of retribution in the criminal law, so that when people have committed offences the law considers that they merit punishment, but its prime purpose is to preserve society from the depredations of dangerous and vicious people. Now, it is perfectly useless for the law to attempt, by threatening punishment, to deter people from committing crimes if their mental condition is such that they cannot be in the least influenced by the possibility or probability of subsequent punishment; if they cannot understand what they are doing or cannot understand the ground upon which the law proceeds. The law is not directed, as medical science is, to curing mental infirmities. The criminal law is not directed, as the civil law of lunacy is, to the care and custody of people of weak mind. . . . This is quite a different thing from the question, what utility there is in the punishment of people who, at a moment, would commit acts which, if done when they were in sane minds, would be crimes. What is the utility of punishing people if they be beyond the control of the law for reasons of mental health? In considering that, it will not perhaps, if you have ever reflected upon the matter, have escaped your attention that a great number of people who come into a Criminal Court are abnormal. They would not be there if they were the normal type of average everyday people. Many of them are very peculiar in their dispositions and peculiarly tempered. That is markedly the case in sexual offences. Nevertheless, they are mentally quite able to appreciate what they are doing and quite able to appreciate the threatened punishment of the law and the wrongness of their acts, and they are held in check by the prospect of punishment. It would be very absurd if the law were to withdraw that check on the ground that they were somewhat different from their fellow creatures in mental make-up or texture at the very moment when the check is most needed. You will therefore see that the law, in laying down a standard of mental disorder sufficient to justify a jury in finding a prisoner not guilty on the ground of insanity at the moment of offence, is addressing itself to a somewhat difficult task. It is attempting to define what are the classes of people who should not be punished although they have done actual things which in others would amount to crime. . . . With that explanation I shall tell you what that standard is.</p>
<p id="7706f9fd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first thing which I want you to notice is that you are only concerned with the condition of the mind at the time the act complained of was done. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7706f9fe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The next thing which I wish to emphasize is that his state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance. Mere excitability of a normal man, passion, even stupidity, obtuseness, lack of self-control, and impulsiveness, are quite different things from what I have attempted to <span title="1033" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1033">p. 1033</span>describe as a state of disease or disorder or mental disturbance arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing.

<span class="epub-small-caps">BELL</span>, Circuit Judge: . . . Blake was charged with bank robbery, 18 U.S.C.A. §2113. He was arrested on the day following the robbery and his trial began some six months later. The evidence that he committed the robbery was overwhelming; his principal defense was insanity at the time of the commission of the offense. He was convicted and . . . this appeal followed. . . .  Appellant urges that the definition of insanity given the jury in charge for determining the issue of not guilty by reason of insanity was outmoded and prejudicial. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7706fa04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Blake came from a well-to-do family, completed two years of college, and briefly served on active duty with the Navy until he was given a medical discharge after suffering an epileptic seizure. The following year, he received his first course of electroshock therapy, and the year after that he was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment for the first time. Over the next 20 years, Blake continued to need extensive psychiatric care, including numerous periods of in-patient treatment and further electroshock therapy. During this time, he was a heavy drinker who also used stimulants and drugs. In his 20s, Blake managed to work for his father’s construction company and marry and start a family. As his drinking and irrational behavior increased, however, he was no longer able to work, and in his 30s Blake was twice adjudged incompetent and hospitalized in mental institutions for periods of six months. He was divorced from his first wife, though he married three more times. In addition to his repeated hospitalizations, Blake served a brief prison sentence when his probation for shooting his second wife was revoked because of a further charge of aggravated assault. While in prison, Blake was hospitalized several times, and he was released from prison less than three months before the robbery for which he was convicted in the instant case. As the Fifth Circuit summarized: “To this point Blake’s adult life had been one long round of confinement for mental problems and drinking when not confined.”]</p>
<p id="7706fa05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts of the robbery are rather bizarre. Blake committed the robbery within a matter of two or three hours after making an attempt to obtain a legal hearing before the United States District Court . . . apparently seeking a writ of habeas corpus to relieve him of certain state prison release restrictions which kept him from going to the Miami area. He was registered at a Jacksonville hotel. He obtained a hotel employee as a chauffeur for the purpose of driving him about town. He stopped by a bar en route to the robbery, had <span title="1034" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1034">p. 1034</span>several drinks and told a waitress that he would be back later with a large sum of money. The waitress jokingly asked him if he planned to rob a bank. He said, “That’s possible.”</p>
<p id="7706fa06-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bank which was robbed was one of two under consideration. Each was a member of the bank group which he claimed had mishandled a trust which was established either by or for him several years earlier. His quarrel with the bank over the trust had gone on for some years and was bitter. He did not case the bank. He selected the bank, ordered his driver to take him to the bank and wait, walked in during rush hour, demanded the money, obtained it, and walked out. He had no trouble getting away immediately to Tampa in the same car and with the same driver. He returned from Tampa to Jacksonville the very next day with an attorney to press his petition for the writ in the district court and was arrested for the robbery.</p>
<p id="7706fa07-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was psychiatric testimony that Blake was suffering from the mental disease of schizophrenia, marked with psychotic episodes, and that his behavior on the occasion of the robbery indicated that appellant was in a psychotic episode. This was described as a form of severe mental illness. There was testimony that in such a period his actions would not be subject to his will. On the other hand, there was psychiatric testimony that he had a sociopathic personality and was not suffering from a mental disease. [T]he burden was on the prosecution, once the hypothesis of insanity was established, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Blake was sane at the time of the commission of the crime. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77072118-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We come then to the definition of insanity given in charge. The district court charge was based on the dictum in Davis v. United States, 165 U.S. 373, 378 (1897). [The defense objected to the <i>Davis</i> standard and proposed substitution of the MPC instead.] The <i>Davis</i> standard is as follows:</p>

<p id="77072119-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term “insanity” as used in this defense means such a perverted and deranged condition of the mental and moral faculties as to render a person incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, or unconscious at the time of the nature of the act he is committing, or where, though conscious of it and able to distinguish between right and wrong and know that the act is wrong, yet his will, by which I mean the governing power of his mind, has been otherwise than voluntarily so completely destroyed that his actions are not subject to it, but are beyond his control.</p>

<p id="7707211a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 4.01 of the ALI Model Penal Code is as follows:</p>

He could not prevail under a <i>Davis</i> charge. He might have prevailed under a substantial lack of capacity type charge.</p>
<p id="7707211e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think that a substantiality type standard is called for in light of current knowledge regarding mental illness. A person, as Blake here, may be a schizophrenic or may merely have a sociopathic personality. The evidence could go either way. He may or may not have been in a psychotic episode at the time of the robbery. But, he was not unconscious, incapable of distinguishing right and wrong nor was his will completely destroyed in terms of the <i>Davis</i> definition. Modifying the lack of mental capacity by the adjective “substantial,” still leaves the matter for the jury under the evidence, lay and expert, to determine mental defect vel non and its relationship to the conduct in question. . . .

<p id="77072121-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No problem in the drafting of a penal code presents greater intrinsic difficulty than that of determining when individuals whose conduct would otherwise be criminal ought to be exculpated on the ground that they were suffering from mental disease or defect when they acted as they did. The problem is the drawing of a line between the use of public agencies and force (1) to condemn the offender by conviction, with resulting sanctions in which the ingredient of reprobation is present no matter how constructive one may seek to make the sentence and the process of correction, and (2) modes of disposition in which the condemnatory element is absent, even though restraint may be involved. . . . Stating the matter differently, the problem is to etch a decent working line between the areas assigned to the authorities responsible for public health and those responsible for the correction of offenders. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77072122-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As far as its principle extends, the <i>M’Naghten</i> rule is right. Those who are irresponsible under the test are plainly beyond the reach of the restraining influence of the law, and their condemnation would be both futile and unjust. A deranged person who believes he is squeezing lemons when he chokes his wife, or who kills in supposed self-defense on the basis of a delusion that another is attempting to kill him, is plainly beyond the deterrent influence of the law; he needs restraint but condemnation is meaningless and ineffective. Moreover, the category defined by the rule is so extreme that to the ordinary person the exculpation of those it encompasses bespeaks no weakness in the law. He does not identify such persons with himself; they are a world apart.</p>
<p id="77072123-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question remains, however, whether the <i>M’Naghten</i> rule goes far enough to draw a fair and workable distinction. In two respects, this question <span title="1036" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1036">p. 1036</span>must be answered in the negative. The <i>M’Naghten</i> test addresses itself to the actor’s “knowledge,” which can naturally be understood as referring to a simple awareness by the actor of his wrongdoing such as would be manifested by a verbal acknowledgment on his part of the forbidden nature of his conduct. One shortcoming of this criterion is that it authorizes a finding of responsibility in a case in which the actor is not seriously deluded concerning his conduct or its consequences, but in which the actor’s appreciation of the wrongfulness of his conduct is a largely detached or abstract awareness that does not penetrate to the affective level. Insofar as a formulation centering on “knowledge” does not readily lend itself to application to emotional abnormalities, the <i>M’Naghten</i> test appears less than optimal as a standard of responsibility in cases involving affective disorder.</p>
<p id="77072124-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second and more pervasive difficulty with the <i>M’Naghten</i> standard appears in cases in which the defendant’s disorder . . . destroys or overrides the defendant’s power of self-control. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77072125-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Responding to the <i>M’Naghten</i> formulation’s inadequacy in connection with claims that emphasize a defendant’s volitional incapacity rather than his inability to understand, a minority of jurisdictions . . . explicitly supplemented the <i>M’Naghten</i> rule by what was commonly called the “irresistible impulse” test. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77074836-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Model Code formulation is based on the view that a sense of understanding broader than mere cognition, and a reference to volitional incapacity should be achieved directly in the formulation of the defense. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77074837-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to the <i>M’Naghten</i> and “irresistible impulse” criteria, the Model Code formulation reflects the judgment that no test is workable that calls for complete impairment of ability to know or to control. The extremity of these conceptions had posed the largest difficulty for the administration of the old standards. Disorientation, psychiatrists indicated, might be extreme and still might not be total; what clinical experience revealed was closer to a graded scale with marks along the way. . . . To meet these difficulties, it was thought that the criterion should ask if the defendant, as a result of mental disease or defect, was deprived of “substantial capacity” to appreciate the criminality (or wrongfulness) of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, meaning by “substantial” a capacity of some appreciable magnitude when measured by the standard of humanity in general, as opposed to the reduction of capacity to the vagrant and trivial dimensions characteristic of the most severe afflictions of the mind.</p>
<p id="77074838-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The adoption of the standard of substantial capacity may well be the Code’s most significant alteration of the prevailing tests. It was recognized, of course, that “substantial” is an open-ended concept, but its quantitative connotation was believed to be sufficiently precise for purposes of practical administration. The law is full of instances in which courts and juries are explicitly authorized to confront an issue of degree. Such an approach was deemed to be no less essential and appropriate in dealing with this issue than in dealing with the questions of recklessness and negligence.<span title="1037" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1037">p. 1037</span></p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">GEE, J</span>. Defendant Robert Lyons was indicted on twelve counts of knowingly and intentionally securing controlled narcotics. . . . Lyons proffered evidence that in 1978 he began to suffer from several painful ailments, that various narcotics were prescribed to be taken as needed for his pain, and that he became addicted to these drugs. He also offered to present expert witnesses who would testify that his drug addiction affected his brain both physiologically and psychologically and that as a result he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. . . .

And although we today withdraw our recognition of the volitional prong of [the insanity defense]—that as to which such evidence has usually been advanced—we also conclude that should Lyons wish to offer such evidence in an attempt to satisfy the remaining cognitive prong, fairness demands that we afford him an opportunity to do so.</p>

 . . . We last examined the insanity defense in Blake v. United States, 407 F.2d 908 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), where we adopted the ALI Model Penal Code definition of insanity. [W]e concluded that then current knowledge in the field of behavioral science supported such a result. Unfortunately, it now appears our conclusion was premature. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77074842-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reexamining the <i>Blake</i> standard today, we conclude that the volitional prong of the insanity defense—a lack of capacity to conform one’s conduct to the requirements of the law—does not comport with current medical and scientific knowledge, which has retreated from its earlier, sanguine expectations. Consequently, we now hold that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct on the grounds of insanity only if at the time of that conduct, as a result of a mental disease or defect, he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of that conduct.</p>
<p id="77074843-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do so for several reasons. First, as we have mentioned, a majority of psychiatrists now believe that they do not possess sufficient accurate scientific bases for measuring a person’s capacity for self-control or for calibrating the impairment of that capacity. Bonnie, The Moral Basis of the Insanity Defense, 69 A.B.A. J. 194, 196 (1983). “The line between an irresistible impulse and an impulse not resisted is probably no sharper than between twilight and dusk.” <span title="1038" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1038">p. 1038</span>American Psychiatric Association Statement on the Insanity Defense, 11 (1982) [APA Statement]. Indeed, Professor Bonnie [supra] states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77076f54-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, in short, no objective basis for distinguishing between offenders who were undeterrable and those who were merely undeterred, between the impulse that was irresistible and the impulse not resisted, or between substantial impairment of capacity and some lesser impairment.</p>
</div>
<p id="77076f55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, the risks of fabrication and “moral mistakes” in administering the insanity defense are greatest “when the experts and the jury are asked to speculate whether the defendant had the capacity to ‘control’ himself or whether he could have ‘resisted’ the criminal impulse.” Bonnie, supra, at 196. Moreover, psychiatric testimony about volition is more likely to produce confusion for jurors than is psychiatric testimony concerning a defendant’s appreciation of the wrongfulness of his act. It appears, moreover, that there is considerable overlap between a psychotic person’s inability to understand and his ability to control his behavior. Most psychotic persons who fail a volitional test would also fail a cognitive test, thus rendering the volitional test superfluous for them. Finally, [case law currently] requires that such proof be made by the federal prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt, an all but impossible task in view of the present murky state of medical knowledge.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1271E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1271E_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

<span class="epub-small-caps">RUBIN, J.,</span> with whom <span class="epub-small-caps">TATE, J</span>., joins, dissenting. . . . An adjudication of guilt is more than a factual determination that the defendant pulled a trigger, took a bicycle, or sold heroin. It is a moral judgment that the individual is blameworthy. “Our collective conscience does not allow punishment where it cannot impose blame.” . . . “[H]istorically, our substantive criminal law is based on a theory of punishing the [vicious] will. It postulates a free agent confronted with a choice between doing right and wrong, and choosing freely to do wrong.”

 . . . An acquittal by reason of insanity is a judgment that the defendant is not <i>guilty</i> because, as a result of his mental condition, he is unable to make an effective choice regarding his behavior.</p>
<p id="77076f5a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority does not controvert these fundamental principles; indeed it accepts them as the basis for the defense when the accused suffers from a disease that impairs cognition. It rests its decision to redefine insanity and to narrow the defense on “new policy considerations.” . . .

Public opposition to any insanity-grounded defense is often based, either explicitly or implicitly, on the view that the plea is frequently invoked by violent criminals who fraudulently use it to evade just punishment. . . . This perception depicts an insanity trial as a “circus” of conflicting expert testimony that confuses a naive and sympathetic jury. And it fears insanity acquittees as offenders who, after manipulating the criminal justice system, are soon set free to prey once again on the community.</p>
<p id="77076f5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the prodigious volume of writing devoted to the plea, the empirical data that are available provide little or no support for these fearsome perceptions and in many respects directly refute them. Both the frequency and the success rate of insanity pleas are grossly overestimated by professionals and lay persons alike; the plea is rarely made, and even more rarely successful.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1275C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1275C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> The number of insanity pleas based on control defects, as compared to those based on lack of cognition, must have been almost negligible.</p>

<p id="77076f60-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another set of objections to the plea is based on the thesis that factfinders—especially juries—are confused and manipulated by the vagueness of the legal standards of insanity and the notorious “battle of the experts” who present conclusory, superficial, and misleading testimony. These conditions, the argument runs, conspire to produce inconsistent and “inaccurate” verdicts.</p>
<p id="77076f61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Let us first put these objections in perspective. Most cases involving an insanity plea do not go to trial; instead, like most other criminal cases, they are settled by a plea bargain. In many of the cases that do go to trial, psychiatric testimony is presented by deposition, without disagreement among experts, and without opposition by the prosecution. And in the few cases in which a contest does develop, the defendant is usually convicted. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77076f62-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The manipulated-jury argument is supported largely by declamation, not data. [N]o source has been cited to the court to support the conclusion that, as an empirical matter, pleas based upon the volitional prong present an especially problematic task for the jury.</p>
<p id="77079673-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, the majority opinion does not assert that the insanity defense, particularly the control test, <i>doesn’t</i> work; it contends that the defense <i>can’t</i> <span title="1040" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1040">p. 1040</span>work. The principal basis for this contention is the belief, held by “a majority of psychiatrists,” that they lack “sufficient accurate scientific bases for measuring a person’s capacity for self-control or for calibrating the impairment of that capacity.” . . . [B]ut the absence of useful expert evidence, if indeed there is none, does not obviate the need for resolving the question whether the defendant ought to be held accountable for his criminal behavior. . . .

<p id="77079674-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our concept of responsibility in this sense is not limited to observable behavior: it embraces <i>meaningful</i> choice, and necessarily requires inferences and assumptions regarding the defendant’s unobservable mental state. . . .  The difference between the concepts of excusing circumstances such as coercion and the insanity defense is that the former is based on objective assumptions about human behavior and is tested against hypothetical-objective standards such as “the reasonable person.” “The insanity defense [on the other hand] marks the transition from the adequate man the law demands to the inadequate man he may be.”

Our duty to undertake that inquiry is not based on confidence in the testimony of expert witnesses, but on the ethical precept that the defendant’s mental state is a crucial aspect of his blameworthiness. . . . The availability of expert testimony and the probative value of such testimony are basically evidentiary problems that can be accommodated within the existing test. . . .

<i>1. Practical concerns.</i> Professor Michael Corrado has challenged the claim that it is impossible to tell the difference between those who can’t control their behavior and those who can but won’t. He writes (The Case for a Purely Volitional Insanity Defense, 42 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 481, 502) (2009)) that “recent studies have shown that the line between those who can’t . . . and those who won’t . . . can be very clear indeed.” Professor Corrado adds that “those who advanced [the contrary claim] should be a little red-faced, . . . especially if their argument was that the possibility of abuse was too great.” In making that point, he refers to Supreme Court decisions upholding the constitutionality of “sexually violent predator” (SVP) statutes. Those decisions (discussed at pp. 87-88 supra) stress that SVP confinement is constitutionally permissible only for offenders who <i>can’t</i> control their behavior, not for those who simply won’t. In upholding such statutes, the Court has accepted the premise that it is possible to reliably distinguish between those two sorts of offenders. See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 413 (2002) (SVP commitment is permissible only on “proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior . . . sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender [who is subject to preventive confinement] from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.”)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN127FF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N127FF_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">96</a></span>

<i>1. The Hinckley acquittal.</i> The change from <i>Blake</i> to <i>Lyons</i> exemplifies a shift in attitudes toward the insanity defense that began in the 1980s. Before then, about half the states had adopted some version of the MPC, as did all but one of the U.S. Courts of Appeal. But this trend in favor of the MPC approach was abruptly reversed following the 1982 trial of John W. Hinckley, Jr., who—in a misguided attempt to impress the actress Jodie Foster—shot and wounded President Reagan and several others in an abortive assassination attempt witnessed on national television. When the jury, applying the MPC test, found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, public opinion reacted with outrage over the verdict.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12875_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12875_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">101</a></span>
</p>
<p id="7707e4ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If there was fear that Hinckley would soon be walking the streets, free to menace others, subsequent events put that concern in perspective. After the acquittal, Hinckley stayed confined for treatment at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he had been held since his arrest in 1981, and he remained there (except for brief furloughs) for more than 35 years. In July 2016, after hospital experts and the government agreed that Hinckley’s psychiatric disorders “have been in full and sustained remission for well over twenty years,” U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman found that Hinckley no longer posed a danger to himself or others and granted him “convalescent leave,” permitting his release under strict conditions. United States v. Hinckley, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97906, at *3-4 (D.D.C. July 27, 2016). Hinckley was required to live with his mother and remain within a 50-mile radius of her home, except when traveling for treatment at least once a month at St. Elizabeth’s. The release order specified that he must have no access to social media, avoid all contact with the press, and have no contact with a number of specified individuals, including Foster and members of the Reagan family. Id. at *176-189.</p>

<i>2. Restricting access to the insanity defense.</i> Whatever may be the right lesson to draw from the <i>Hinckley</i> trial, its impact on the law has been lasting. Efforts to restrict defenses based on mental illness included adjustments in the burden of proof, changes in the disposition of insanity acquittees, introduction of a separate verdict of “Guilty but Mentally Ill,” and complete abolition of the insanity defense. The choice of which approach (if any) to take involves a complex mixture of substantive and tactical judgments. For helpful discussions, see Ralph Slovenko, The Insanity Defense in the Wake of the <i>Hinckley</i> Trial, 14 Rutgers L.J. 373 (1983); Peter Arenella, Reflections on Current <span title="1044" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1044">p. 1044</span>Proposals to Abolish or Reform the Insanity Defense, 8 Am. J.L. &amp; Med. 271 (1982). Developments in each of the areas just mentioned are explored in the appropriate places in this chapter. The present Note focuses on the formulation of the insanity test itself.</p>
<p id="7707e4b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) State law.</i> About 14 states still adhere to the MPC test. E.g., Wis. Stat. §971.15(1) (2015-2016); see Kate E. Bloch &amp; Jeffrey Gould, Legal Indeterminacy in Insanity Cases: Clarifying Wrongfulness and Applying a Triadic Approach to Forensic Evaluations, 67 Hastings L.J. 913, 915 (2016). But many have returned to M’Naghten. California adopted the MPC formula by judicial decision in 1978 but reverted to M’Naghten as a result of a voter initiative in 1982. See John Q. LaFond &amp; Mary L. Durham, Back to the Asylum 64 (1992). According to one count, by 2004, 30 states adhered to some form of the M’Naghten Rule. See Michael Louis Corrado, Responsibility and Control, 34 Hofstra L. Rev. 59, 61-62 (2005).</p>
<p id="7707e4b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Federal law.</i> As part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Congress enacted a provision that supersedes the <i>Lyons</i> decision and narrows the insanity test even further. 18 U.S.C. §17(a) (2016) provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7707e4b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p>
</div>
<p id="7707e4b4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Legislative proposals.</i> Three influential bodies have, in similar language, proposed retention of the cognitive branch of the MPC test and rejection of the volitional branch. See American Bar Association, Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards §7-6.1(a) (approved Feb. 9, 1983); American Psychiatric Association, Statement on the Insanity Defense, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 6 (1983); National Conf. of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, Model Insanity Defense and Post-Trial Disposition Act §201 (1984). The ABA standard provides:</p>

<i>4. Rates of use and success of the insanity defense.</i> As noted in Judge Rubin’s dissent in <i>Lyons</i>, supra, the frequency and success rates of insanity pleas are often overestimated. The actual use of the insanity defense varies markedly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Colorado had an average of one insanity plea for every 5,000 arrests, while the rate was one in 480 arrests for Michigan and one in 200 arrests for Wyoming. As might be expected, success rates for insanity pleas tend to be higher where the plea is less frequent. Success rates ranged from 44 percent of all insanity pleas tendered in Colorado to 7 percent in Michigan and 2 percent in Wyoming. Overall, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1 percent of felony cases, and <i>successful</i> plea rates <span title="1045" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1045">p. 1045</span>range from about 0.25 percent of all felony cases to only 0.10 percent—a success rate of only one in a thousand. See Fatma Marouf, Assumed Sane, 101 Cornell L. Rev. Online 25, 30-31 (2016). Success rates have varied very little over time; they were virtually identical in the early 1980s, before the post-<i>Hinckley</i> reforms took effect.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN128D5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N128D5_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">102</a></span>

<i>5. The effect of different versions of the insanity defense.</i> There is little evidence that different formulations of the insanity defense produce different results in practice. In one attempt to study this question empirically,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN128E4_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N128E4_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">103</a></span> the researcher assembled roughly 100 experimental jury panels from actual jury pools in Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. The juries listened to the transcript of an actual insanity defense case, then deliberated until they reached a unanimous verdict. One-third of the juries were given the <i>M’Naghten</i> instruction, one-third a more liberalized test, and one-third were simply told to find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity “[i]f you believe the defendant was insane” at the time of the offense. It turned out the differences in instruction made much less difference than the composition of the jury. Other researchers reached similar conclusions from studies using mock jurors who read case summaries. Asked whether to acquit under <i>M’Naghten</i>, the irresistible impulse test, the MPC, and “their own best lights,” no significant differences in acquittal rates were found.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN128F2_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N128F2_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">104</a></span>
</p>
<p id="77080bcb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another approach relies on before-and-after comparisons in jurisdictions that have enacted statutory changes. In Wyoming, legislation replaced <i>M’Naghten</i> with the MPC test; the change had no significant effect on the rate of insanity pleas tendered, the rate of insanity acquittals, or in the characteristics of defendants invoking the defense.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12901_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12901_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">105</a></span> California moved in the opposite direction, replacing the MPC test with <i>M’Naghten</i>; again, there was no significant change in the rate of insanity pleas and acquittals or in the types of defendants invoking the defense.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1290C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1290C_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">106</a></span>

<i>6. Prospects for reform.</i> Professor Alan A. Stone, who served on the committee that prepared the American Psychiatric Association’s formulation of a proposed insanity defense, p. 1044 supra, Note 3, offered some pessimistic reflections on the possibility of successfully reforming the insanity defense (Law, Psychiatry, and Morality 94-96 (1984)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77080bcf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] APA proposal involves going back to an essentially cognitive test—again in part because psychiatric testimony relevant to cognitive matters . . . “is <span title="1046" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1046">p. 1046</span>more reliable, and has a stronger scientific base” than testimony relevant to volition. [But the] defense [in <i>Hinckley</i>] found ample evidence of thought disorder, including . . . magical thinking . . . and a break with reality. The prosecution found none of this. Thus testimony limited to the cognitive issue did not prove reliable in the courtroom. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77080bd0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An exchange between defense and prosecution psychiatrists will illustrate one aspect of [the] more basic theoretical problems. [A defense expert] said that the Valium Hinckley took may well have produced “paradoxical rage,” thus causing him to be unable to control himself. A psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution] said it was “appropriate” for Hinckley to take Valium if he was anxious about assassinating the President. Put aside the fact that these are both conjectures. They are conjectures which are part of two quite different kinds of discourse.</p>
<p id="77080bd1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The theory of paradoxical rage is part of a discourse about organisms with brains, enzymes, and physical chemical reactions. The theory of appropriate behavior is part of a discourse about persons with minds, intentions, and motivated actions. In the discourse about organisms, . . . paradoxical rage is <i>caused</i> by the chemical release of the inhibitory neural system. In the discourse about persons, the self is the agent who chooses, who intends, and who assumes a firing position and pulls the trigger. Morality does not enter the discourse of organisms because free will and choice are not part of that language. To say that a <i>person</i> had a paradoxical rage reaction is to confuse the two discourses. . . . Psychiatry has not yet found a unified discourse about organisms and persons. That is the giant iceberg against which the insanity defense inevitably is wrecked. Neither psychiatry nor law nor moral philosophy has found a sure way past this barrier. It does no good to pretend the barrier does not exist or to ask the jury to deal with it. These are not questions for which common sense has an answer.</p>

<i>NOTE ON ABOLITION OF THE INSANITY DEFENSE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="77080bd4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the defense of legal insanity has long been an established feature of American law, several states attempted to abolish it in the early decades of the past century. These efforts were usually held unconstitutional under state constitutions guaranteeing due process of law. See, e.g., Sinclair v. State, 132 So. 581 (Miss. 1931); State v. Strasburg, 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910). After the <i>Hinckley</i> verdict, there was renewed interest in abolition, and five states (Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, and Utah) took that step. These more recent statutes differed from the earlier ones in that they allowed evidence of mental disease to be introduced on the issue of whether the defendant possessed the mens rea required by the crime charged. Some also authorized the court, after conviction, to determine at sentencing whether the defendant suffered from a mental disease, and if so, to commit him for institutional care and treatment for a period not to exceed the maximum sentence. See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §22-3220 (2016); Mont. Code Ann. §§46-14-311, 46-14-312(2) (2016). Rejecting constitutional challenges, courts in four of these states have held that the insanity defense has been so variable over time that it does not possess the historical pedigree necessary to establish it as a fundamental right under <span title="1047" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1047">p. 1047</span>the Due Process Clause.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1295A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1295A_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">107</a></span> In Finger v. State, 27 P.3d 66, 84 (Nev. 2001), however, the Nevada Supreme Court struck down that state’s abolition statute, holding that the insanity defense is “a well-established and fundamental principle” under the Due Process Clauses of both the United States and the Nevada constitutions. Finger was charged with murdering his mother. His defense—unavailable under the Nevada statute—was that his longstanding paranoid schizophrenia, which included visual and auditory hallucinations, precluded criminal responsibility because it led him to believe that his mother was plotting to kill him. The Nevada Supreme Court held that allowing evidence of Finger’s mental illness only to negate his intent to kill was insufficient; due process required that he be able to argue that he did not know that his intentional killing was wrong.</p>
<p id="770832e6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether statutes abolishing the insanity defense are unconstitutional. However, in Clark v. Arizona, 548 U.S. 735 (2006), the Court rejected a due process challenge to Arizona’s insanity statute, which accepts only half of the <i>M’Naghten</i> test, defining insanity solely in terms of the defendant’s capacity to tell whether the criminal act was right or wrong (and not in terms of the defendant’s capacity to know the nature or quality of the act committed). After canvassing the diversity of approaches among the states, the Court found no history of “deference to <i>M’Naghten</i> that could elevate its formula to the level of fundamental principle” (id. at 749) and concluded that “no particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process. [T]he insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal offenses, is substantially open to state choice” (id. at 752). The Court did not decide whether complete abolition of the insanity defense would be unconstitutional. In Delling v. Idaho, 133 S. Ct. 504 (2012), the Court denied certiorari in a case that sought to raise the question, but Justice Breyer, writing for three justices, dissented from the denial of certiorari (id. at 505-506):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="770832e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Idaho law would distinguish the following two cases. Case One: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that the victim is a wolf. He shoots and kills the victim. Case Two: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that a wolf, a supernatural figure, has ordered him to kill the victim. In Case One, the defendant does not know he has killed a human being, and his insanity negates a mental element necessary to commit the crime. In Case Two, the defendant has intentionally killed a victim whom he knows is a human being; he possesses the necessary mens rea. In both cases the defendant is unable, due to insanity, to appreciate the true quality of his act, and therefore unable to perceive that it is wrong. But in Idaho, the defendant in Case One could defend the charge by arguing that he lacked the mens rea, whereas the defendant in Case Two would not be able to raise a defense based on his mental illness. . . . The American Psychiatric Association tells us that “severe mental illness can seriously impair a sufferer’s ability rationally to appreciate the wrongfulness of conduct.” And other amici tell us that those seriously <span title="1048" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1048">p. 1048</span>mentally ill individuals often possess the kind of mental disease that Case Two describes—that is to say, they know that the victim is a human being, but due to mental illness, such as a paranoid delusion, they wrongly believe the act is justified. In view of these submissions, I would grant the petition for certiorari to consider whether Idaho’s modification of the insanity defense is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.</p>

[W]ould you be satisfied with a legal system in which he could be indicted and convicted of a homicidal crime and his condition regarded as relevant only on the question of what to do with him? Everybody would say no to this. That is why the criterion of responsibility as affected by disease or a defect parallels the traditional mens rea rules in requiring a determination of blameworthiness in the ordinary moral sense, . . . not in the sense of man’s responsibility for his nature or his nurture but in the sense that the afflictive <span title="1049" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1049">p. 1049</span>sanctions of the law will not be visited on anyone unless he does something which is the product of a choice . . . . [G]eneral confidence that this is so seems to me quite central to the sense of security that is one of the greatest values in a law abiding society. . . . So I don’t think that it’s just a question of whether you get sent away and for how long. I rather think that the distinctive feature of the entire criminal process is the element of condemnation that it marshals, of social condemnation. And, indeed, is it not the mark of a healthy society that the criminal law marshal an appropriate moral condemnation?</p></div>

 . . . It too often is overlooked that one group’s exculpation from criminal responsibility confirms the inculpation of other groups. . . . You argue that insanity destroys, undermines, diminishes man’s capacity to reject what is wrong and to adhere to what is right. So does the ghetto—more so. But surely, you reply, I would not have us punish the sick. Indeed I would, if you insist on punishing the grossly deprived. To the extent that criminal sanctions serve punitive purposes, I fail to see the difference between these two defenses. To the extent that they serve rehabilitative, treatment, and curative purposes I fail to see the need for the difference. . . .

<p id="77085a09-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A variety of reasons for abolition have been advanced from quite different ideological perspectives. [For some advocates, abolition is] designed to curb “unconscionable abuse” of the insanity defense. . . . This position . . .  has little empirical support. . . . Unfounded fears of “abuse” are hardly a sufficient reason for abolishing a defense that has properly come to be viewed as fundamental.</p>
<p id="77085a0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The other attack on the insanity defense is more complex and it goes to the roots of the criminal law. It shares with the first position a skepticism that distinctions can sensibly be made between those who are responsible and those who are not. Critics taking this view cite the rarity of the employment of the defense as evidence that most mentally ill defendants are being convicted despite the availability of the defense. They doubt that the stigma of those convicted and subsequently treated as mentally disturbed is any worse than the stigma of those who commit criminal acts and are committed to high security institutions for the mentally ill . . . . They argue that there is little basis for withholding condemnation of those whose mental illness causes them to act criminally when those whose deprived economic and social <span title="1050" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1050">p. 1050</span>background causes them to act criminally are condemned. They regard the adversarial debate over the responsibility of particular defendants as wasteful, confusing for the jury, and possibly harmful for those defendants who are mentally disturbed. They think psychiatric diagnosis should be employed primarily after conviction to determine what sort of correctional treatment is appropriate instead of prior to conviction to determine criminal responsibility. Ideally, in the view of some of these critics, criminal convictions generally should not be regarded as stigmatizing, but as determinants of dangerousness to which the community must respond.</p>
<p id="77085a0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When properly understood, this attack is a challenge to the basic notion that a criminal conviction properly reflects moral condemnation. . . . Yet those who advance the attack do not provide persuasive reasons for believing it would benefit society if the association between moral wrongdoing and criminal conviction were dissipated. Nor do they give reasons for supposing that the association will be dissipated in the near future. Yet they propose labeling as criminal many persons whom society at large would clearly not regard as morally blameworthy.</p>
<p id="77085a0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For additional discussion of these issues, see Christopher Slobogin, An End to Insanity: Recasting the Role of Mental Illness in Criminal Cases, 86 Va. L. Rev. 1199 (2000), supporting an approach that would consider mental disorder only if relevant to other criminal defenses, such as self-defense, duress, and lack of mens rea. Idaho, which follows this approach, relegates mentally insane defendants to prison, but Jessica Harrison notes that doing so may only worsen their condition, and the state will nonetheless be forced to release them when their sentences terminate. Harrison, Idaho’s Abolition of the Insanity Defense—An Ineffective, Costly, and Unconstitutional Eradication, 51 Idaho L. Rev. 575 (2015). For further criticism of abolition, see Stephen J.

When she arrived 2 days later, he immediately thought she had been unfaithful—he sensed “it wasn’t the same Karen . . . she’d been with someone else.”</p>
<p id="77088127-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner did not mention his suspicions to his wife, instead he took her to the motel room and beat her unconscious. He then went to a nearby store, stole a knife, and returned to stab his wife 24 times, inflicting a fatal wound. He left again, drove to a nearby farm where he had been employed and borrowed an ax. Upon returning to the motel room, he decapitated his wife with such force that the ax marks cut into the concrete floor under the carpet and splattered blood throughout the room.</p>
<p id="77088128-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner then proceeded to conceal his actions. He placed the body in a blanket, the head in a pillowcase, and put both in his wife’s car. Next, he went to a service station, borrowed a bucket and sponge, and cleaned the room of blood and fingerprints. Before leaving, petitioner also spoke with the motel manager about a phone bill, then chatted with him for a while over a beer.</p>
<p id="77088129-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When Crenshaw left the motel he drove to a remote area 25 miles away where he hid the two parts of the body in thick brush. He then fled, driving to the Hoquiam area, about 200 miles from the scene of the crime. There he picked up two hitchhikers, told them of his crime, and enlisted their aid in disposing of his wife’s car in a river. The hitchhikers contacted the police and Crenshaw was apprehended shortly thereafter. He voluntarily confessed to the crime.</p>
<p id="7708812a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defense of not guilty by reason of insanity was a major issue at trial. Crenshaw testified that he followed the Moscovite religious faith, and that it would be improper for a Moscovite not to kill his wife if she committed adultery. Crenshaw also has a history of mental problems, for which he has been hospitalized in the past. The jury, however, rejected petitioner’s insanity defense, and found him guilty of murder in the first degree. . . .

<p id="7708a842-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alternatively, the statement in instruction 10 may be approved because, in this case, legal wrong is synonymous with moral wrong. [I]t is important to note that it is society’s morals, and not the individual’s morals, that are the standard for judging moral wrong under <i>M’Naghten.</i> If wrong meant moral wrong judged by the individual’s own conscience, this would seriously undermine the criminal law, for it would allow one who violated the law to be excused from criminal responsibility solely because, in his own conscience, his act was not morally wrong. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7708a843-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is evidence on the record that Crenshaw knew his actions were wrong according to society’s standards, as well as legally wrong. Dr. Belden testified:</p>

</div>
<p id="7708a845-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that Crenshaw knew his acts were morally wrong from society’s viewpoint and also knew his acts were illegal. His personal belief that it was his duty to kill his wife for her alleged infidelity cannot serve to exculpate him from legal responsibility for his acts.</p>
<p id="7708a846-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A narrow exception to the societal standard of moral wrong has been drawn for instances wherein a party performs a criminal act, knowing it is morally and legally wrong, but believing, because of a mental defect, that the act is ordained by God: such would be the situation with a mother who kills her infant child to whom she is devotedly attached, believing that God has spoken to her and decreed the act. Although the woman knows that the law and society condemn the act, it would be unrealistic to hold her responsible for the crime, since her free will has been subsumed by her belief in the deific decree.</p>
<p id="7708a847-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This exception is not available to Crenshaw, however. Crenshaw argued only that he followed the Moscovite faith and that Moscovites believe it is their duty to kill an unfaithful wife. This is not the same as acting under a deific command. Instead, it is akin to “[t]he devotee of a religious cult that enjoins . . .  human sacrifice as a duty [and] is <i>not</i> thereby relieved from responsibility before the law.” Crenshaw’s personal “Moscovite” beliefs are not equivalent to a deific decree and do not relieve him from responsibility for his acts. . . .

<i>1. Legal versus moral wrong.</i> American courts are divided on the issue presented in <i>Crenshaw.</i> Several jurisdictions hold, in accord with <i>Crenshaw</i>, that an insanity acquittal requires the defendant to be unaware that his conduct was <i>legally</i> wrong. Although ignorance of the law is not, of course, a defense, <i>knowledge</i> of the law will be sufficient in these jurisdictions to defeat any claim under <i>M’Naghten</i> that the defendant lacked the capacity to know that his act was wrong. E.g., State v. Hollis, 731 P.2d 260 (Kan. 1987). In contrast, a number of decisions hold that “wrong” means “morally wrong.” E.g., State v. Roberts, 876 N.W.2d 863 (Minn. 2016); People v. Coddington, 2 P.3d 1081 (Cal. 2000). Many jurisdictions leave the issue to the jury without specifying whether “wrong” means legally or morally wrong. E.g., State v. Chanthabouly, 262 P.3d 144, 162 (Wash. Ct. App. 2011); State v. Morgan, 863 So. 2d 520, 525 n.5 (La. 2004) (identifying this practice as the predominant American approach). The issue causes considerable confusion for trial judges and expert witnesses. See Kate E. Block &amp; Jeffery Gould, Legal Indeterminacy in Insanity Cases: Clarifying Wrongfulness and Applying a Triadic Approach to Forensic Evaluations, 67 Hastings L.J. 913 (2016).</p>
<p id="7708a84b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which approach to the <i>Crenshaw</i> issue is more consistent with the purposes of an insanity defense? On the one hand, if a defendant has sufficient awareness to realize the illegality of his conduct and to attempt to conceal his crime, doesn’t he fall, by definition, among those whose behavior is potentially deterrable? On the other hand, consider 2 James F. Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England 167 (1883):</p>

He wanted to be hung for it. He no doubt knew it to be wrong in the sense that he knew that other people would disapprove of it, but he would also have thought, had he thought at all, that if they knew all the facts (as he understood them) they would approve of him, and see that he was sacrificing his own interest for the common good. I could not say that such a person knew that such an act was wrong. His delusion would prevent anything like an act of calm judgment in the character of the act.</p>

At his trial for her murder, psychiatric experts for both the state and the defense agreed that Serravo was unable to distinguish moral right from wrong but probably knew that his act was illegal. Holding that knowledge of the act’s illegality will not defeat a <i>M’Naghten</i> defense, the court said (id. at 135-139):</p>

Conversely, a person who, although mentally ill, . . . is aware that an act is morally wrong, but does not realize that it is illegal, should nonetheless be held responsible for the act, as ignorance of the law is no excuse. . . . A clarifying instruction on the definition of legal insanity, therefore, should clearly state that . . . the phrase “incapable of distinguishing right from wrong” refers to a person’s cognitive inability, due to a mental disease or defect, to distinguish right from wrong as measured by a societal standard of morality, even though the person may be aware that the conduct in question is criminal.

<i>2. The deific decree exception.</i> Why does the court in <i>Crenshaw</i> suggest that the result would be different if the defendant had said that his acts were “ordained by God” rather than merely by his “Moscovite” religion? In a later case, State v. Cameron, 674 P.2d 650 (Wash. 1983), where there was evidence the defendant believed God was instructing him, the court reversed for failure to give a “deific decree” instruction. A concurring judge observed, “Both <i>Crenshaw</i> and the subject case were almost factually identical; both involved outrageous, vicious, messy murders. . . . I frankly don’t see much or any distinction, however, in carrying out or executing a murder under the direction of God or Crenshaw’s Moscovite religious beliefs, or under the beliefs of a prophet, Buddha, etc. . . . ”</p>
<p id="7708cf61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is there any coherent way to distinguish deific decrees from religious beliefs generally or even from nonreligious command hallucinations? For skepticism that such distinctions are possible, see Grant H. Morris &amp; Ansar Haroun, “God Told Me to Kill”: Religion or Delusion?, 38 San Diego L. Rev. 973 (2001). But even if such distinctions can be drawn, why should legal outcomes turn on them? Professor Rabia Belt notes a paradox: “Why is it when we talk to God we’re said to be praying—but when God talks to us, we’re said to be schizophrenic?” Rabia Belt, When God Demands Blood: Unusual Minds and the Troubled Juridical Ties of Religion, Madness, and Culpability, 69 U.

Who then are the sick whose illness shows they are free of moral blame? We cannot turn to the psychiatrist for a list of illnesses which have that quality because, for all his insight into the dynamics of behavior, he has not solved the riddle of blame. The question remains an ethical one, the answer to which lies beyond scientific truth.</p><p id="7708f681-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A]lthough emphasis [in the <i>M’Naghten</i> Rule is] upon a state of mind, it is nonetheless required that that state be due to “disease” and not something else.

<p id="77091d96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Questions on</i> Guido. If “mental disease” is a legal concept, why were the psychiatrists allowed to express their conclusions about it at all? In what sense were they “experts” in the meaning of a legal concept?</p>
<p id="77091d97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The legal definition of disease.</i> In agreement with <i>Guido</i>, most courts treat “mental disease” for purposes of the insanity defense as a legal, not a medical concept, but few indicate the criteria that determine when this legal element is present. When they do, the tests typically give little guidance. Consider whether the following formulation is helpful (McDonald v. United States, 312 F.2d 847, 850-851 (D.C. Cir. 1962)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77091d98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What psychiatrists may consider a “mental disease or defect” for clinical purposes, where their concern is treatment, may or may not be the same as mental disease or defect for the jury’s purpose in determining criminal responsibility. Consequently, for that purpose the jury should be told that a mental disease or defect includes any abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.</p>
</div>
<p id="77091d99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other definitions are similar but more restrictive. State v. Graham, 113 A.3d 1102, 1107 (Me. 2015), defines mental disease or defect as “a severely abnormal mental condition that grossly and demonstrably impairs a defendant’s perception or understanding of reality.” The American Psychiatric Association proposes this definition (140 Am. J. Psychiatry 6 (1980)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77091d9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he terms mental disease or mental retardation include only those severely abnormal mental conditions that grossly and demonstrably impair a person’s perception or understanding of reality and that are not attributable primarily to the voluntary ingestion of alcohol or other psychoactive substances.</p>

<p id="77091d9b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. “Temporary” insanity?</i> A common assumption is that mental disorder is typically deep seated and difficult to cure, casting doubt on moral blame but prompting grave concern about the defendant’s dangerousness. Should it matter if the defendant’s abnormal mental condition was transitory—brought on by unusual circumstances and no longer at work by the time of trial? “Temporary” insanity could afford the defendant an ideal defense, justifying acquittal without justifying subsequent detention for treatment. Doctrinally, temporary insanity is not a formally distinct defense. Should it be? And if so, what kinds of mental disturbance should qualify? Should the criminal law be especially receptive to such defenses? Or especially wary? For a thought-provoking discussion, see Russell D. Covey, Temporary Insanity: The Strange Life and Times of the Perfect Defense, 91 B.U. L. Rev. 1597 (2011).</p>
<p id="77091d9c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Specific applications.</i> Suppose that psychiatric examination indicates that the defendant, because of “explosive personality disorder,” lacks the capacity to “appreciate” the wrongfulness of his aggressive, violent reactions. Does he qualify for the insanity defense? Should the answer depend on <span title="1058" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1058">p. 1058</span>whether the psychiatric profession classifies this abnormality as a “personality disorder” rather than as a psychosis?</p>
<p id="77091d9d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note how the <i>McDonald</i> definition applies in this situation. The defendant’s situation presumably is “abnormal,” but is it a “condition of the mind” within the meaning of <i>McDonald</i>? Is this a legal or a medical question?</p>
<p id="77091d9e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from the <i>McDonald</i> formulation, what is the “right” result in the preceding example? Suppose that a defendant suffers from an impairment of cognition or control sufficiently serious to satisfy the prevailing insanity test. Should it matter whether the impairment results from disease or only from a “personality disorder”? Regardless of the source of the defendant’s impairment, it would seem that blame is inappropriate (and deterrence unlikely) in both cases—or in neither. In other words, why <i>bother</i> to define disease?</p>

<i>NOTE ON THE PSYCHOPATH</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="770944b9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A major policy issue concerns the application of the insanity defense to the psychopath—the offender with a long history of antisocial conduct. Many persistent offenders “know” (in a purely verbal way) that their conduct is illegal, but they experience little or no empathy and have no apparent capacity to “understand” (at the “affective,” emotional level) the rights of others. Their behavior brings them repeatedly into conflict with others and with the law. Often, psychiatrists diagnose them as suffering from “psychopathic personality” or “sociopathic personality,” now more commonly designated “antisocial <span title="1059" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1059">p. 1059</span>personality disorder,” and many mental health professionals regard the disorder as a “mental disease.” Is such an offender legally insane?</p>
<p id="770944ba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">MPC §4.01(2), commonly referred to as the “caveat paragraph,” was designed to exclude from the concept of “mental disease or defect” the case of the so-called psychopathic personality. It states that “the terms ‘mental disease or defect’ do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.” Consider State v. Werlein, 401 N.W.2d 848 (Wis. Ct. App. 1987), decided in a state that had adopted the caveat paragraph. The defendant, for no apparent reason, opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, inflicting serious injury on the victim. He was convicted of attempted first-degree murder. At trial, he had called Dr. Albert Lorenz, who diagnosed him as suffering from antisocial personality disorder:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="770944bb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Lorenz testified that Werlein’s [symptoms] included an inability to handle work, squandering money, lack of attachment to people or groups, and reckless behavior. Lorenz stated that Werlein has no personality of his own, cannot plan for the future, and follows others much like a little child would. Lorenz concluded that as a result of Werlein’s illness, he could not conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>
</div>
<p id="770944bc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court struck Dr. Lorenz’s testimony and precluded the jury from considering whether Werlein was mentally irresponsible. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the caveat paragraph was inapplicable, because Lorenz’s diagnosis went far beyond that of an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct. Cf. Wade v. United States, 426 F.2d 64, 73 (9th Cir. 1970): “[I]t is practically inconceivable that a mental disease or defect would, in the terms of paragraph (2), be ‘manifested <i>only</i> by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct’” (emphasis added).</p>

<i>Questions: (a)</i> Consider whether the psychopathic defendant <i>should be</i> excluded from the insanity defense. Does the answer depend on the relevant <i>facts</i> (such as whether psychopaths feel emotion, whether they are deterrable or treatable)? Or does it depend on judgments about <i>values</i> and <i>policy</i>? If the latter, does the judgment turn on the impact of an insanity defense on social protection in these cases, or does it center on whether the psychopath can justly be blamed? Some experts suggest another concern: Samuel Perry et al. suggest (in A DSM-III Casebook of Differential Therapeutics 304-305 (1985)) that because mental health professionals have limited capacity to treat psychopathy, and because psychopathic defendants will prey on vulnerable mental patients, such defendants should not avoid punishment by being referred for a treatment that does not exist. For analysis of these issues, see Craig A. Stern, The Heart of Mens Rea and the Insanity of Psychopaths, 42 Cap. U. L. Rev. 619 (2014); Steven K. Erickson &amp; Michael J. Vitacco, Predators and Punishment, 18 Psychol. Pub. Pol’y &amp; L. 1 (2012).</p>

<i>NOTES ON AUTOMATISM—SANE AND INSANE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="77096ad1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the insanity defense apply to acts performed by a defendant who is not conscious of performing them, such as acts performed while sleepwalking or under hypnosis? Like defendants who are insane, defendants in a state of automatism do not seem proper subjects for either blame or deterrence. But unlike insanity, automatism is not always the product of “a mental disease or defect.” Should the law attempt to distinguish between automatism that is a result of a mental disease or defect (“insane automatism”) and automatism that has some other source (“sane automatism”)? Note what is at stake: Non-insane automatism may give rise to the complete defense of involuntary action, see p. 229 supra; whereas the insanity defense generally results in a prolonged period of incapacitation and treatment, see pp. 1025-1027 supra.</p>
<p id="77096ad2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Defendant’s option?</i> Most American courts hold that the defendant may elect to plead either insanity, involuntariness, or both. See, e.g., State v. Jenner, 451 N.W.2d 710 (S.D. 1990). The English rule, in contrast, holds that when automatism results from a mental disease or defect, the only defense available is the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. See Bratty v. Attorney-General, [1963] A.C. 386 (H.L. 1961). A minority of American jurisdictions follow the English approach. See, e.g., Loven v. State, 831 S.W.2d 387 (Tex. App. 1992).</p>
<p id="77096ad3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Distinguishing sane from insane automatisms.</i> Where insanity and automatism are mutually exclusive defenses, courts must decide whether the claimed automatism results from a mental disorder. For example, in Wyoming, where impairments resulting from “mental illness or deficiency” can support only an insanity defense, the definition of “mental deficiency” is “a defect attributable to intellectual disability, brain damage and cognitive disabilities.” Wyo. Stat. §7-11-301(a)(iii) (2016). In Fulcher v. State, 633 P.2d 142 (Wyo. 1981), the defendant was charged with aggravated assault. With supporting expert testimony, he claimed that his actions were committed in a state of automatism resulting from traumatic head injuries inflicted in a brawl shortly before the alleged offense. If such injuries are a form of “brain damage,” Wyoming law would require them to be presented as an insanity defense. But the Wyoming Supreme Court held that they were not, and accordingly that the automatism defense remained available. The court said (id. at 146):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77096ad4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is our view that the “brain damage” contemplated in the statute is some serious and irreversible condition having an impact upon the ability of the person to function.

<p id="77096ad8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Sleep.</i> Relatively few cases have dealt with criminal conduct during various states of sleep. The courts appear to be divided on the question whether the defendant in such a case is entitled to outright acquittal due to the absence of a volitional act, or whether the defendant must plead insanity and face commitment to a mental hospital. In McClain v. State, 678 N.E.2d 104 (Ind. 1997), the court held that the defendant’s sleep disorder could form the basis of an automatism (involuntary-act) defense. Noting that Indiana law required commitment proceedings to follow an insanity acquittal, the court observed that merging the automatism and insanity defenses, as the state urged, would force a sane but automatistic defendant to face “a choice of possible commitment or effectively presenting no defense at all.” Id. at 108.</p>
<p id="77096ad9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An English case reached the opposite conclusion. In Regina v. Burgess, [1991] 2 All E.R. 769, the defendant fell asleep while watching a videotape with his neighbor. He awoke to find himself hitting her on the head with a bottle and attempting to strangle her. He quickly came to his senses and called an ambulance for her, but he was charged with assault. He had no history of mental illness and had been on completely friendly terms with the victim. Because the defendant’s automatism derived from an “internal” source, the court concluded that it was the result of a “mental disease” and that he therefore could raise only the defense of insanity, not automatism. Burgess was found not guilty by reason of insanity. For criticism of the result, see Irene Mackay, The Sleepwalker Is Not Insane, 55 Mod. L. Rev. 714 (1992).</p>

See Chip Brown, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Deer, N.Y. Times Mag., Feb. 2, 2003, at 34. Should these clinical distinctions be dispositive of the legal questions?</p>

[After examining the test of legal insanity as a complete defense, the court considered whether mental health evidence should be admissible apart from its bearing on the insanity issue.] [E]xpert testimony as to a <span title="1062" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1062">p. 1062</span>defendant’s abnormal mental condition may be received and considered, as tending to show . . . that defendant did not have the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime—even though he was aware that his act was wrongful and was able to control it, and hence was not entitled to complete exoneration.</p>

He was charged under an Arizona statute making it first-degree murder to “intentionally or knowingly” kill a police officer in the line of duty. He waived his right to a jury. At a bench trial, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew he was killing a law enforcement officer—the officer was in uniform, in a marked police car with emergency lights flashing, and Clark had acknowledged these symbols of police authority when he stopped.]</p><p id="7709b90f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clark claimed mental illness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes. First, he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, [which under Arizona law put] the burden on himself to prove by clear and convincing evidence that “at the time of the commission of the criminal act [he] was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was wrong.” Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecution’s evidence . . . that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to kill a law enforcement officer.</p><p id="7709b910-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court ruled that . . . “Arizona does not allow evidence of a defendant’s mental disorder short of insanity . . . to negate the <i>mens rea</i> element of a crime.”</p><p id="7709b911-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to his insanity, then, Clark presented testimony from classmates, school officials, and his family describing his increasingly bizarre behavior over the year before the shooting. . . . There was lay and expert testimony that Clark thought Flagstaff was populated with “aliens” [who] were trying to kill him. . . .  A psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, [that he was incapable of] understanding right from wrong and that he was thus insane at the time of the killing. In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for the State gave his opinion that Clark’s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, as shown by his actions before and after the shooting (such as . . . , evading the police after the shooting, and hiding the gun).</p><p id="7709b912-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The trial judge concluded that Clark did intend to kill the officer and rejected Clark’s insanity defense because he found that Clark had failed to prove that his schizophrenia prevented him from knowing his actions were wrong.

The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to examine two principal issues. First it considered and rejected Clark’s challenge to the narrowness of Arizona’s insanity defense. We discuss this aspect of the <i>Clark</i> decision at p. 1047 supra. The Court then turned to the question whether Arizona violated due process in barring consideration of Clark’s mental illness in determining whether he had the mens rea required as an element of the offense.]</p><p id="7709b913-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Understanding Clark’s claim requires attention to the categories of evidence with a potential bearing on mens rea. First, there is “observation evidence” . . . , testimony from those who observed what Clark did and heard what he said; this category would also include testimony that an expert witness might give about Clark’s tendency to think in a certain way and his behavioral characteristics. This . . . kind of evidence [can] be relevant to show what in fact was on Clark’s mind when he fired the gun. Observation evidence in the record covers Clark’s behavior at home and with friends [and] his expressions of belief around the time of the killing that “aliens” were inhabiting the bodies of local people (including government agents). . . . 
</p><p id="7709b914-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, there is “mental-disease evidence” in the form of opinion testimony that Clark suffered from a mental disease with features described by the witness. As was true here, this evidence characteristically but not always comes from professional psychologists or psychiatrists who . . . base their opinions in part on examination of a defendant, usually conducted after the events in question. The thrust of this evidence was that . . . Clark was psychotic at the time in question, with a condition that fell within the category of schizophrenia.</p><p id="7709b915-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, there is evidence we will refer to as “capacity evidence” about a defendant’s capacity for cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form mens rea). This, too, is opinion evidence. Here . . . this testimony came from the same experts and concentrated on those specific details of the mental condition that make the difference between sanity and insanity under the Arizona definition. . . .

</p><p id="7709b917-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Clark’s argument is [that Arizona’s restrictions violate] a defendant’s right as a matter of simple due process to present evidence favorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict him.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12DF0_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12DF0_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span>
 . . . Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending to show mens rea. [H]owever, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason for doing that. <span title="1065" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1065">p. 1065</span>“[W]ell-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.” Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006). [In Arizona,] mental-disease and capacity evidence [is] channeled or restricted to one issue and given effect only if the defendant carries the burden to convince the factfinder of insanity; the evidence is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted are good enough to satisfy the standard of fundamental fairness that due process requires. . . . We think there are [such reasons]: in the controversial character of some categories of mental disease, in the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead, and in the danger of according greater certainty to capacity evidence than experts claim for it.</p><p id="7709b919-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To begin with, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate within the profession about the very contours of the mental disease itself. . . . 
</p><p id="7709b91a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, [e]ven when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted . . . , the classification may suggest something very significant about a defendant’s capacity, when in fact the classification tells us little or nothing about the ability of the defendant to form mens rea. . . . The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they come to opposite conclusions on whether the mental disease in his particular case left him bereft of cognitive or moral capacity. [I]t is very easy to slide from evidence that an individual with a professionally recognized mental disease is very different, into doubting that he has the capacity to form mens rea, whereas that doubt may not be justified. . . . Because allowing mental-disease evidence on mens rea can thus easily mislead, it is not unreasonable to address that tendency by confining consideration of this kind of evidence to insanity, on which a defendant may be assigned the burden of persuasion.</p><p id="7709b91b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifications with opinions on incapacity. . . . Unlike observational evidence bearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of . . . judgment fraught with multiple perils. [J]udgment addressing the basic categories of capacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are devised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility. [There is] a real risk that an expert’s judgment in giving capacity evidence will come with an apparent authority that psychologists and psychiatrists do not claim to have. We think that this risk, like the difficulty in assessing the significance of mental-disease evidence, supports the State’s decision to channel such expert testimony to consideration on the insanity defense, on which the party seeking the benefit of this evidence has the burden of persuasion.</p><p id="7709e02c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It bears repeating that not every State will find it worthwhile to make the judgment Arizona has made, and the choices the States do make about dealing with the risks posed by mental-disease and capacity evidence will reflect their <span title="1066" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1066">p. 1066</span>varying assessments about the presumption of sanity as expressed in choices of insanity rules.

He lived in a universe where the delusions were so dominant, the theory was, that he had no intent to shoot a police officer or knowledge he was doing so. It is one thing to say he acted with intent or knowledge to pull the trigger. . . . If the trier of fact were to find Clark’s evidence sufficient to discount the case made by the State, which has the burden to prove knowledge or intent as an element of the offense, Clark would not be guilty of first-degree murder under Arizona law. . . . The issue is not, as the Court insists, whether Clark’s mental illness acts as an “excuse from customary criminal responsibility,” but whether his mental illness, as a factual matter, made him unaware that he was shooting a police officer. If it did, Clark needs no excuse, as then he did not commit the crime as Arizona defines it. [Arizona’s evidentiary restriction] excludes evidence no matter how credible and material it may be in disproving an element of the offense. . . . 
</p><p id="7709e031-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the instant case Arizona’s proposed reasons are insufficient to support its categorical exclusion. While the State contends that testimony regarding mental illness may be too incredible or speculative for the jury to consider, this does not explain why the exclusion applies in all cases to all evidence of mental illness. . . . States have certain discretion to bar unreliable or speculative testimony and to adopt rules to ensure the reliability of expert testimony. Arizona has done so, and there is no reason to believe its rules are insufficient to avoid speculative evidence of mental illness.</p><p id="7709e032-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The risk of jury confusion also fails to justify the rule. . . . The difficulty of resolving a factual issue . . . does not present a sufficient reason to take evidence away from the jury even when it is crucial for the defense. . . .

The trial court was capable of evaluating the competing conclusions, as factfinders do in countless cases where there is a dispute among witnesses. In fact, the potential to mislead will be far greater under the Court’s new evidentiary system, where jurors will receive observation evidence without the necessary explanation from experts.</p><p id="7709e035-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that mental-illness evidence may be considered in deciding criminal responsibility does not compensate for its exclusion from consideration on the mens rea elements of the crime. . . . Criminal responsibility involves an inquiry into whether the defendant knew right from wrong, not whether he had the mens rea elements of the offense. While there may be overlap between the two issues, “the existence or nonexistence of legal insanity bears no necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of the crime.” Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 706 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).</p><p id="7709e036-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the analyses were equivalent, there is a different burden of proof for insanity than there is for mens rea. Arizona requires the defendant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evidence. The prosecution, however, must prove all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The shift in the burden on the criminal responsibility issue, while permissible under our precedent, cannot be applied to the question of intent or knowledge without relieving the State of its responsibility to establish this element of the offense. . . . 
</p><p id="7709e037-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Future dangerousness is not, as the Court appears to conclude, [supra] n.45, a rational basis for convicting mentally ill individuals of crimes they did not commit. Civil commitment proceedings can ensure that individuals who present a danger to themselves or others receive proper treatment without unfairly treating them as criminals. [T]he Court ought not to imply otherwise. . . . 
</p><p id="770a0748-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While Arizona’s rule is not unique . . . , this fact does not dispose of Clark’s constitutional argument. . . . While 13 States still impose significant restrictions on the use of mental-illness evidence to negate mens rea, a substantial majority of the States currently allow it. The fact that a reasonable number of States restrict this evidence weighs into the analysis, but applying the rule as a per se bar, as Arizona does, is so plainly unreasonable that it cannot be sustained. [I]ts irrationality is apparent when considering the evidence that is allowed. Arizona permits the defendant to introduce, for example, evidence of “behavioral tendencies” to show he did not have the required mental state. [The State allows] unexplained and uncategorized tendencies to be introduced while excluding relatively well-understood psychiatric testimony regarding well-documented mental illnesses. It is unclear, moreover, what would have happened in this case had the defendant wanted to testify that he thought Officer Moritz was an alien. If disallowed, it would be tantamount to barring Clark from testifying on his behalf to explain his own actions.

In sum, the rule forces the jury to decide guilt in a fictional world with undefined and unexplained behaviors but without mental illness. This rule has no rational justification and imposes a significant burden upon a straightforward defense: He did not commit the crime with which he was charged.</p></div>

<i>1. State of the law.</i> As Justice Kennedy’s dissent noted, many states impose no special restrictions on the use of mental-health evidence to rebut a required mens rea. One recent count finds that 16 states bar evidence of mental illness to negate culpability elements of any kind, 13 states permit mental illness to negate only a specific intent, and 23 American jurisdictions allow mental-illness evidence to negate any element. Paul Robinson, Murder Mitigation in the Fifty-Two American Jurisdictions: A Case Study in Doctrinal Interrelation Analysis, 47 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 19, 24 (2014). The MPC takes this last approach as well. See MPC §4.02(1) (“Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind which is an element of the offense.”).</p>

<i>(a) Total ban.</i> Putting the constitutional issue aside, how can a total ban on using mental health evidence to negate mens rea be justified as a matter of policy? If a jury can be trusted to deal with such evidence on the issue of legal insanity, why can’t it be trusted to deal properly with such evidence on the issue of the required mental state? For discussion, see Peter Arenella, The Diminished Capacity and Diminished Responsibility Defenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 827, 860 (1977).</p>

<i>(b) Capacity evidence.</i> Other jurisdictions prohibit the use of mental health evidence to establish lack of <i>capacity</i> to form a mental state, but allow such evidence on the issue of whether the defendant in fact had the relevant mental state. E.g., State v. Flattum, 122 Wis. 2d 282, 303 (1985); see Keith v. Schaub, 772 F.3d 451 (7th Cir. 2014).</p>

For example, suppose a mentally disordered person [becomes] lost in a deserted part of town on a cold evening. Lacking the resources to find his way to proper shelter, he breaks into a building to get out of the cold. Caught by the police while doing so, he is charged with burglary on the theory that he intended to steal. Our poor defendant is innocent of burglary because he lacks the mens rea for theft—he only wanted to stay warm, not to steal—but [the reason he lacks] mens rea [is not that] he did not have the capacity to form it. He was perfectly capable of intending to steal; [he simply] did not intend to do so on this occasion. The defendant’s mental disorder is relevant to proving that he lacked mens rea, for it is the reason he . . . got lost, and needed to get warm, but his mental disorder did not affect his capacity to form the mens rea.</p>

<i>Question:</i> What is the basis for allowing mental health evidence to rebut mens rea only in prosecutions for specific intent crimes? In McCarthy v.

Such a doctrine has been recognized by some European countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, a partial-responsibility doctrine is available to reduce murder to manslaughter. The English Homicide Act, 1957, 5 &amp; 6 Eliz. II, ch. II, §2(1).</p>
<p id="770a557c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should this approach be adopted in the United States? Given the convoluted American rules on the admissibility of mental disorder to negate mens rea, would it be more straightforward to create an explicit affirmative defense for cases in which mens rea requirements are technically present but a mental disorder suggests greatly reduced culpability? See Stephen J. Morse, Mental Disorder and Criminal Law, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 885, 938 (2011), proposing that a verdict of “Guilty but Partially Responsible” for defendants with diminished responsibility should result in a sentencing reduction, with “considerations of public safety [playing] a large role in determining how much reduction would be possible for various crimes.”</p>

But compare Elizabeth Nevins-Saunders, Not Guilty as Charged: The Myth of Mens Rea for Defendants with Mental Retardation, 45 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1419, 1461 (2012), expressing concern that “jurors, or even judges, [may] sentence more, rather than less, harshly because of the defendant’s mental [condition] if they have the option to do so,” because they may see in that condition a greater reason to fear the defendant’s future dangerousness.</p>

<i>1. Competing rationales.</i> Justice Douglas and Justice Harlan offer different reasons for concurring in the reversal of Robinson’s conviction. Which of their views (or neither) is endorsed by Justice Stewart’s opinion for the Court? Justice Stewart notes that the California statute creates a form of continuous criminal liability, that it fails to require that any criminal act actually be performed within the jurisdiction, and that it imposes punishment for a disease. Are all of these failings necessary for constitutional invalidation, or would any one of them suffice? What if a statute criminalized a specific act (such as drug use) that could be considered the involuntary product of a disease (drug addiction)? Or what if a statute criminalized a status (such as being a member of a criminal organization) that was entirely voluntary?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">JUSTICE MARSHALL</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which <span class="epub-small-caps">THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BLACK</span>, and <span class="epub-small-caps">JUSTICE HARLAN</span> join.</p>
<p id="770acad6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In late December 1966, appellant was arrested and charged with being found in a state of intoxication in a public place, in violation of Texas Penal Code, Art. 477 (1952), which reads as follows: “Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any public place, or at any private house except his own, shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="770acad7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial judge . . . , sitting without a jury, . . . ruled as a matter of law that chronic alcoholism was not a defense to the charge. He found appellant guilty, and fined him $50. There being no further right to appeal within the Texas judicial system, appellant appealed to this Court. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770acad8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal testimony was that of Dr. Davis Wade, a Fellow of the American Medical Association, duly certified in psychiatry. . . . Dr. Wade sketched the outlines of the “disease” concept of alcoholism; noted that there is no generally accepted definition of “alcoholism”; alluded to the ongoing debate within the medical profession over whether alcohol is actually physically “addicting” or merely psychologically “habituating”; and concluded that in either case a “chronic alcoholic” is an “involuntary drinker,” who is “powerless not to drink,” and who “loses his self-control over his drinking.” He testified that he had examined appellant, and that appellant is a “chronic alcoholic,” who “by the time he has reached [the state of intoxication] is not able to control his behavior, and [who] has reached this point because he has an uncontrollable compulsion to drink.” . . . He added that in his opinion jailing appellant without medical attention would operate neither to rehabilitate him or lessen his desire for alcohol.</p>
<p id="770acad9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross-examination, Dr. Wade admitted that when appellant was sober he knew the difference between right and wrong, and he responded affirmatively to the question whether appellant’s act of taking the first drink in any given instance when he was sober was a “voluntary exercise of his will.” Qualifying his answer, Dr. Wade stated that</p>

</div>
<p id="770acadb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant testified concerning the history of his drinking problem. He reviewed his many arrests for drunkenness; testified that he was unable to stop drinking; stated that when he was intoxicated he had no control over his actions and could not remember them later, but that he did not become violent; and admitted that he did not remember his arrest on the occasion for which he was being tried. On cross-examination, appellant admitted that he had had one drink on the morning of the trial and had been able to discontinue drinking. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770acadc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State made no effort to obtain expert psychiatric testimony of its own, or even to explore with appellant’s witness the question of appellant’s power to control the frequency, timing, and location of his drinking bouts, or the substantial disagreement within the medical profession concerning the nature of the disease, the efficacy of treatment and the prerequisites for effective treatment. . . . Instead, the State concerned itself with a brief argument that appellant had no defense to the charge because he “is legally sane and knows the difference between right and wrong.”</p>
<p id="770acadd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Following this abbreviated exposition of the problem before it, the trial court indicated its intention to disallow appellant’s claimed defense of “chronic alcoholism.” Thereupon defense counsel submitted, and the trial court entered, the following “findings of fact”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="770af1ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) That chronic alcoholism is a disease which destroys the afflicted person’s will power to resist the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol.</p>
<p id="770af1ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(2) That a chronic alcoholic does not appear in public by his own volition but under a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic alcoholism.</p>
<p id="770af1f0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(3) That Leroy Powell, a defendant herein, is a chronic alcoholic who is afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism.</p>
</div>
<p id="770af1f1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever else may be said of them, those are not “findings of fact” in any recognizable, traditional sense in which that term has been used in a court of law; they are the premises of a syllogism transparently designed to bring this case within the scope of this Court’s opinion in Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). Nonetheless, the dissent would have us adopt these “findings” without critical examination; it would use them as the basis for a constitutional holding that “a person may not be punished if the condition essential to constitute the defined crime is part of the pattern of his disease and is occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic of the disease.”</p>
<p id="770af1f2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difficulty with that position, as we shall show, is that it goes much too far on the basis of too little knowledge. In the first place, the record in this case is utterly inadequate to permit the sort of informed and responsible adjudication which alone can support the announcement of an important and wide-ranging new constitutional principle. We know very little about the circumstances surrounding the drinking bout which resulted in this conviction, or about Leroy Powell’s drinking problem, or indeed about alcoholism itself. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770af1f3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1077" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1077">p. 1077</span>[T]he inescapable fact is that there is no agreement among members of the medical profession about what it means to say that “alcoholism” is a “disease.” One of the principal works in this field states that the major difficulty in articulating a “disease concept of alcoholism” is that “alcoholism has too many definitions and disease has practically none.” This same author concludes that “<i>a disease is what the medical profession recognizes as such.</i>” In other words, there is widespread agreement today that “alcoholism” is a “disease,” for the simple reason that the medical profession has concluded that it should attempt to treat those who have drinking problems. There the agreement stops. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770af1f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court’s “finding” that Powell “is afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism, which destroys the afflicted person’s will power to resist the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol” covers a multitude of sins. . . . Dr. Wade [testified] that once appellant began drinking he appeared to have no control over the amount of alcohol he finally ingested. Appellant’s own testimony concerning his drinking on the day of the trial would certainly appear, however, to cast doubt upon the conclusion that he was without control over his consumption of alcohol when he had sufficiently important reasons to exercise such control. . . . Dr. Wade testified that when appellant was sober, the act of taking the first drink was a “voluntary exercise of his will,” but that this exercise of will was undertaken under the “exceedingly strong influence” of a “compulsion” which was “not completely overpowering.” Such concepts, when juxtaposed in this fashion, have little meaning. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770af1f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is one thing to say that if a man is deprived of alcohol his hands will begin to shake, he will suffer agonizing pains and ultimately he will have hallucinations; it is quite another to say that a man has a “compulsion” to take a drink, but that he also retains a certain amount of “free will” with which to resist. It is simply impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to ascribe a useful meaning to the latter statement. This definitional confusion reflects, of course, not merely the undeveloped state of the psychiatric art but also the conceptual difficulties inevitably attendant upon the importation of scientific and medical models into a legal system generally predicated upon a different set of assumptions. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770af1f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite the comparatively primitive state of our knowledge on the subject, it cannot be denied that the destructive use of alcoholic beverages is one of our principal social and public health problems. . . . There is as yet no known generally effective method for treating the vast number of alcoholics in our society. [I]t is entirely possible that, even were the manpower and facilities available for a full-scale attack upon chronic alcoholism, we would find ourselves unable to help the vast bulk of our “visible”—let alone our “invisible”—alcoholic population. . . . The medical profession cannot, and does not, tell us with any assurance that, even if the buildings, equipment and trained personnel were made available, it could provide anything more than slightly higher-class jails for our indigent habitual inebriates. Thus we run the grave risk that nothing will be accomplished beyond the hanging of a new sign—reading “hospital”—over one wing of the jailhouse.</p>
<p id="770af1f7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1078" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1078">p. 1078</span>One virtue of the criminal process is, at least, that the duration of penal incarceration typically has some outside statutory limit; this is universally true in the case of petty offenses, such as public drunkenness, where jail terms are quite short on the whole. “Therapeutic civil commitment” lacks this feature; one is typically committed until one is “cured.” Thus, to do otherwise than affirm might subject indigent alcoholics to the risk that they may be locked up for an indefinite period of time under the same conditions as before, with no more hope than before of receiving effective treatment and no prospect of periodic “freedom.”</p>
<p id="770af1f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Faced with this unpleasant reality, we are unable to assert that the use of the criminal process as a means of dealing with the public aspects of problem drinking can never be defended as rational. . . .

<p id="770af1f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant claims that his conviction on the facts of this case would violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause [as applied] in <i>Robinson</i>. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770af1fa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face the present case does not fall within that holding. [Texas] has not sought to punish a mere status, as California did in <i>Robinson</i>; nor has it attempted to regulate appellant’s behavior in the privacy of his own home. Rather, it has imposed upon appellant a criminal sanction for public behavior which may create substantial health and safety hazards, both for appellant and for members of the general public, and which offends the moral and aesthetic sensibilities of a large segment of the community. This seems a far cry from convicting one for being an addict, being a chronic alcoholic, being “mentally ill or a leper. . . . ”</p>
<p id="770af1fb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Robinson</i> so viewed brings this Court but a very small way into the substantive criminal law. And unless <i>Robinson</i> is so viewed it is difficult to see any limiting principle that would serve to prevent this Court from becoming, under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, throughout the country.</p>
<p id="770af1fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is suggested in dissent that <i>Robinson</i> stands for the “simple” but “subtle” principle that “[c]riminal penalties may not be inflicted on a person for being in a condition he is powerless to change.” . . . In that view, appellant’s “condition” of public intoxication was “occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic of the disease” of chronic alcoholism, and thus, apparently, his behavior lacked the critical element of mens rea. Whatever may be the merits of such a doctrine of criminal responsibility, it surely cannot be said to follow from <i>Robinson.</i> The entire thrust of <i>Robinson</i>’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common law terms, has committed some actus reus. It thus does not deal with the question of whether certain conduct cannot constitutionally be punished because it is, in some sense, “involuntary” or “occasioned by a compulsion.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="770b190d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ultimately, then, the most troubling aspects of this case, were <i>Robinson</i> to be extended to meet it, would be the scope and content of what could only be a constitutional doctrine of criminal responsibility. In dissent it is urged that the <span title="1079" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1079">p. 1079</span>decision could be limited to conduct which is “a characteristic and involuntary part of the pattern of the disease as it afflicts” the particular individual, and that “it is not foreseeable” that it would be applied “in the case of offenses such as driving a car while intoxicated, assault, theft, or robbery.” That is limitation by fiat. . . . If Leroy Powell cannot be convicted of public intoxication, it is difficult to see how a State can convict an individual for murder, if that individual, while exhibiting normal behavior in all other respects, suffers from a “compulsion” to kill, which is an “exceedingly strong influence,” but “not completely overpowering.” Even if we limit our consideration to chronic alcoholics, it would seem impossible to confine the principle within the arbitrary bounds which the dissent seems to envision. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770b190e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditional common-law concepts of personal accountability and essential considerations of federalism lead us to disagree with appellant. We are unable to conclude, on the state of this record or on the current state of medical knowledge, that chronic alcoholics in general, and Leroy Powell in particular, suffer from such an irresistible compulsion to drink and to get drunk in public that they are utterly unable to control their performance of either or both of these acts and thus cannot be deterred at all from public intoxication. And in any event this Court has never articulated a general constitutional doctrine of mens rea.</p>
<p id="770b190f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot cast aside the centuries-long evolution of the collection of interlocking and overlapping concepts which the common law has utilized to assess the moral accountability of an individual for his antisocial deeds. The doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and duress have historically provided the tools for a constantly shifting adjustment of the tension between the evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of man. This process of adjustment has always been thought to be the province of the States.</p>
<p id="770b1910-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court to be impelled into defining some sort of insanity test in constitutional terms. Yet, that task would seem to follow inexorably from an extension of <i>Robinson</i> in this case. If a person in the “condition” of being a chronic alcoholic cannot be criminally punished as a constitutional matter for being drunk in public, it would seem to follow that a person who contends that, in terms of one test, “his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect,” Durham v. United States, 214 F.2d 862, 875 (C.A.D.C. Cir. 1954), would state an issue of constitutional dimension with regard to his criminal responsibility had he been tried under some different and perhaps lesser standard, e.g., the right-wrong test of <i>M’Naghten</i>’s Case. . . . But formulating a constitutional rule would . . . freeze the developing productive dialogue between law and psychiatry into a rigid constitutional mold. It is simply not yet the time to write into the Constitution formulas cast in terms whose meaning, let alone relevance, are not yet clear either to doctors or to lawyers.</p>

When we say that appellant’s appearance in public is caused not by “his own” volition but rather by some other force, we are clearly thinking of a force that is nevertheless “his” except in some special sense.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN13167_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N13167_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> The accused undoubtedly commits the proscribed act and the only question is whether the act can be attributed to a part of “his” personality that should not be regarded as criminally responsible. Almost all of the traditional purposes of the criminal law can be significantly served by punishing the person who in fact committed the proscribed act, without regard to whether his action was “compelled” by some elusive “irresponsible” aspect of his personality. [P]unishment of such a defendant can clearly be justified in terms of deterrence, isolation, and treatment. On the other hand, medical decisions concerning the use of a term such as “disease” or “volition,” based as they are on the clinical problems of diagnosis and treatment, bear no necessary correspondence to the legal decision whether the overall objectives of the criminal law can be furthered by imposing punishment. [M]uch as I think that criminal sanctions should in many situations be applied only to those whose conduct is morally blameworthy, see Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246 (1951), I cannot think the States should be held constitutionally required to make the inquiry as to what part of a defendant’s personality is responsible for his actions and to excuse anyone whose action was, in some complex, psychological sense, the result of a “compulsion.” . . .

<p id="770b1916-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If it cannot be a crime to have an irresistible compulsion to use narcotics [<i>Robinson</i>], I do not see how it can constitutionally be a crime to yield to such a compulsion. Punishing an addict for using drugs convicts for addiction under a different name. Distinguishing between the two crimes is like forbidding criminal conviction for being sick with flu or epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a fever or having a convulsion. Unless <i>Robinson</i> is to be abandoned, the use of narcotics by an addict must be beyond the reach of the criminal law. Similarly, the chronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume alcohol should not be punishable for drinking or for being drunk. [But] I cannot say that the chronic who proves his disease and a compulsion to drink is shielded from conviction when he has knowingly failed to take feasible precautions against committing a criminal act, here the act of going to or remaining in a public place. On such facts the alcoholic is like a person with smallpox, who could be convicted for being on the street but not for <span title="1081" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1081">p. 1081</span>being ill, or like the epileptic, punishable for driving a car but not for his disease.</p>

<i>Robinson</i> stands upon a principle which, despite its subtlety, must be simply stated and respectfully applied because it is the foundation of individual liberty and the cornerstone of the relations between a civilized state and its citizens: Criminal penalties may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he is powerless to change. In all probability, Robinson at some time before his conviction elected to take narcotics. But the crime as defined did not punish this conduct. The statute imposed a penalty for the offense of “addiction”—a condition which Robinson could not control. Once Robinson had become an addict, he was utterly powerless to avoid criminal guilt. He was powerless to choose not to violate the law.</p>
<p id="770b4029-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, appellant is charged with a crime comprised of two elements—being intoxicated and being found in a public place while in that condition. The crime, so defined, differs from that in <i>Robinson.</i> The statute covers more than a mere status. But the essential constitutional defect here is the same as in <i>Robinson</i>, for in both cases the particular defendant was accused of being in a condition which he had no capacity to change or avoid. The trial judge [found] that Powell is a “chronic alcoholic [who] does not appear in public by his own volition but under a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic alcoholism.” I read these findings to mean that appellant was powerless to avoid drinking; that having taken his first drink, he had “an uncontrollable compulsion to drink” to the point of intoxication; and that, once intoxicated, he could not prevent himself from appearing in public places. . . . The findings in this case, read against the background of the medical and sociological data to which I have referred, compel the conclusion that the infliction upon appellant of a criminal penalty for being intoxicated in a public place would be “cruel and inhuman punishment.” . . .

<i>1. Alcoholism.</i> The scientific premises of the defense position in <i>Powell</i> are questioned in Herbert Fingarette, Heavy Drinking (1988). Professor Fingarette characterizes the disease concept of alcoholism as a “myth” that attained ever wider public acceptance just at the time that its empirical foundations were being discredited by researchers and that research over the next two-and-a-half decades consistently contradicted that concept. Fingarette states (id. at 3) that at the time of his writing “<i>no</i> leading research authorities accept the classic disease concept [of alcoholism].” Fingarette observes (id. at 32) that “[a]nyone who has ever observed the behavior of a chronic heavy drinker cannot help feeling a sense of powerful momentum at work.” Nonetheless, Fingarette notes, studies show that on any particular occasion heavy drinkers, including those labeled chronic alcoholics, may drink heavily, moderately, or not at all, and the choice depends on a wide variety of situational factors including the rewards or penalties the drinker believes likely to follow.</p>

<i>2. Homelessness.</i> A Los Angeles ordinance, discussed in Chapter 3 in connection with the actus reus requirement (see p. 223 supra), makes it an offense for any person to “sit, lie or sleep in or upon any street, sidewalk or other public way.” In a suit brought by homeless individuals who proved that the city had too few beds to accommodate them, the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the Eighth Amendment, as interpreted in <i>Robinson</i> and <i>Powell</i>, barred enforcement of the ordinance against these individuals (Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1136-1137 (9th Cir. 2006)):</p>

<i>4. Mens rea and the Constitution.</i> Justice Marshall’s plurality opinion rejected Robinson’s defense of chronic alcoholism not only because of the insufficiency of the empirical case for the “disease” concept of alcoholism, but also because of the undesirability of “a general constitutional doctrine of mens rea,” p. 1073 supra. What would such a constitutional doctrine look like, and what consequences would it have? Canada offers one answer to this question, having interpreted the “fundamental justice” provision of its Charter of Rights and Freedoms to require mens rea as a condition for a criminal conviction. See, e.g., Reference Re Section 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979 [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 (holding strict liability unconstitutional on the ground that protection of the morally innocent is required by “precepts of fundamental justice”). See p. 321 supra. For discussion of the Canadian experience on this issue, see Bruce P. Archibald, The Constitutionalization of the General Part of Criminal Law, 67 Can. Bar Rev. 403 (1998).</p>

<i>5. Non-criminal incarceration of the dangerous.</i> Justice Marshall worried that accepting Powell’s defense would lead to the civil commitment of offending alcoholics that would be non-criminal in name only—“the hanging of a new sign reading ‘hospital’—over one wing of the jailhouse.” The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of preventive civil commitment of the dangerous when there is a mental disorder of some sort and “proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.” Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 413 (2002) (upholding that state’s provision for the commitment of “sexually violent predators”). Would non-criminal incapacitation and treatment be a preferable disposition for alcoholics who commit criminal offenses? For drug addicts? For someone who has serious difficulty in controlling behavior because of genetic factors or environmental deprivation? For probing criticism of preventive confinement on the basis of difficulty in controlling behavior, see Stephen J. Morse, Mental Disorder and Criminal Law, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 885, 951-960 (2011). Consider the materials that follow.</p>

Arguing that he has lost the power of self-control with regard to his addiction, appellant maintains that by applying “the broad principles of common law criminal responsibility” we must decide that he is entitled to dismissal of the indictment or a jury trial on this issue. The gist of appellant’s argument here is that “the common law has long held that the capacity to control behavior is a prerequisite for criminal responsibility.” . . .

<p id="770b8e6b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Drug addiction of varying degrees may or may not result in loss of self-control, depending on the strength of character opposed to the drug craving. Under appellant’s theory, adopted by the dissenters, only if there is a resulting loss of self-control can there be an absence of <i>free will</i> which, under the extension of the common law theory, would provide a valid defense to the addict. If there is a demonstrable absence of free will (loss of self-control), the illegal acts of possession and acquisition cannot be charged to the user of the drugs.</p>

A few may be recognized as so far from normal as to be entirely beyond the reach of criminal justice, but in general the criminal law is a means of social control that must be potentially capable of reaching the vast bulk of the population. Criminal responsibility is a concept that not only extends to the bulk of those below the median line of responsibility, but specifically extends to those who have a realistic problem of substantial impairment and lack of capacity due, say, to weakness of intellect that establishes susceptibility to suggestion; or to a loss of control of the mind as a result of passion . . . ; or to a depravity that blocks out conscience as an influence on conduct. The criminal law cannot “vary legal norms with the individual’s capacity to meet the standards they prescribe, absent a disability that is both gross and verifiable, such as the mental disease or defect that may establish irresponsibility. The most that it is feasible to do with lesser disabilities is to accord them proper weight in sentencing.”

<span class="epub-small-caps">WRIGHT, J</span>., dissenting: . . . I suggest that the development of the common law of mens rea has reached the point where it should embrace a new principle: a drug addict who, by reason of his use of drugs, lacks substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law may not be held criminally responsible for mere possession of drugs for his own use. . . . 
</p>
<p id="770bb589-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[C]riminal responsibility is assessed only when through “free will” a man elects to do evil, and if he is not a free agent, or is unable to choose or to act voluntarily, or to avoid the conduct which constitutes the crime, he is outside the postulate of the law of punishment. . . . Moreover, recognition of a defense of “addiction” for crimes such as possession of narcotics is consistent . . . with the traditional goals of penology—retribution, deterrence, isolation and rehabilitation. . . . Revenge, if it is ever to be legitimate, must be premised on moral blameworthiness, and what segment of our society would feel its need for retribution satisfied when it wreaks vengeance upon those who are diseased because of their disease? [T]here may have been a time in the past before the addict lost control when he made a conscious decision to use drugs. But imposition of punishment on this basis would violate the longstanding rule that “[t]he law looks to the immediate, and not to the remote cause; to the actual state of the party, and not to the causes, which remotely produced it.” . . .

<p id="770bb58a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The most widely employed argument in favor of punishing addicts for crimes such as possession of narcotics is that such punishment or threat of punishment has a substantial deterrent effect. [T]he merits of this argument appear doubtful.

In the case of the narcotic addict, however, the normal sense of reason . . . is overcome by the psychological and physiological compulsions of the disease. As a result, it is widely agreed that the threat of even harsh prison sentences cannot deter the addict from using and possessing the drug.</p>
<p id="770bb58b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A similar situation prevails insofar as deterrence of <i>potential</i> addicts is concerned. [N]othing in this opinion would in any way affect the criminal responsibility of non-addict users for crimes they may commit—including illegal possession of narcotics. . . .

On the contrary, this interest may be fully vindicated through a program of civil commitment with treatment. . . .

<p id="770bb58d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This, then, brings us to the final and most important goal of modern penology—to rehabilitate the offender.

<p id="770bb58e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Perhaps the most troublesome question arising out of recognition of the addiction defense I suggest is whether it should be limited only to those <span title="1088" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1088">p. 1088</span>acts—such as mere possession for use—which are inherent in the disease itself. It can hardly be doubted that, in at least some instances, an addict may in fact be “compelled” to engage in other types of criminal activity in order to obtain sufficient funds to purchase his necessary supply of narcotics. . . . Nevertheless, I am convinced that Congress has manifested a clear intent to preclude common law extension of the defense beyond those crimes which, like the act of possession, cause direct harm only to the addict himself. . . . The essential inquiry, then, is simply whether, at the time of the offense, the defendant, as a result of his repeated use of narcotics, lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BAZELON, C.J.</span> (concurring in part and dissenting in part): . . . On the issue of guilt or innocence, Judge Wright’s views are closest to my own. I cannot, however, accept his view that the addiction/responsibility defense should be limited to the offense of possession. I would also permit a jury to consider addiction as a defense to a charge of, for example, armed robbery or trafficking in drugs, to determine whether the defendant was under such duress or compulsion, because of his addiction, that he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. . . .

Scientific (psychological, biological, or medical) explanations . . . almost invariably increase the deterministic element in our view of human conduct. . . . The more such accounts we possess, the greater the encroachment on the presupposition of voluntariness that underlies the criminal law. Any recognition of a case of involuntariness is bound to take us down a slippery slope, at the end of which we would have nullified the entire criminal law. On the other hand, a refusal to go down the slope, or any attempt to stop somewhere along the way, is bound to be arbitrary and unfair. . . .

</div><p id="770c03c0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Bazelon first raised the possibility that extreme poverty might give rise to an RSB [Rotten Social Background] defense in United States v. Alexander, [471 F.2d 923 (D.C. Cir. 1973]. . . . In <i>Alexander</i>, one of the defendants shot and killed a marine in a tavern after the marine called him a “black bastard.” The defense attempted to show that the youth’s action stemmed from an irresistible impulse to shoot, which they, in turn, traced to an emotionally and economically deprived childhood in Watts, California. The defendant reported that when he was young, his father deserted the family and the boy grew up with little money or attention. He was subjected to racist treatment and learned to fear and hate white persons.</p><p id="770c03c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A psychiatrist testified that the defendant suffered from impaired behavior controls rooted in his “rotten social background.” The psychiatrist refused to label the defendant insane, however. The trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the testimony about the defendant’s deprived background and to consider only whether or not his mental condition met the legal standard of insanity. The jury found him sane and the defendant was sentenced to twenty years to life.</p><p id="770c03c2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court of appeals affirmed. In a lengthy, troubled opinion that concurred in part and dissented in part, Judge Bazelon laid out his early thoughts on the RSB defense. For Bazelon, the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to disregard the testimony about defendant’s social and economic background. That testimony might well have persuaded the jury that the defendant’s behavioral controls were so impaired as to require acquittal, even though that impairment might not render him clinically insane. Apart from this, exposure to the testimony would benefit society. As a result of learning about the wretched conditions in which some of its members live, society would presumably decide to do something about them.</p><p id="770c03c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, Bazelon was not prepared to abandon all the trappings of the “disease” model. Among other things, that model provides a rationale for detaining dangerous persons following acquittal. Bazelon reviewed other possible dispositions for the RSB defendant—outright release, preventive detention, and psychological reprogramming—finding each unacceptable. <span title="1090" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1090">p. 1090</span>According to Bazelon, the ultimate solution to the problem of violent crime in our society is some form of income redistribution coupled with other social reform measures. The current narrow insanity test conceals the need for such reform and thus should be broadened, although disposition of offenders not “sick” in any classic sense remained a problem for Bazelon. Judge Bazelon further developed his views on an RSB defense in his Hoover lecture<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN13421_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N13421_12a1c29a-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">87</a></span> and in a reply article. . . .

For Morse, all environments affect choice, making some choices easy and others hard. Rarely, however, will environmental adversity completely eliminate a person’s power of choice. Poor persons are free to choose or not choose to commit crimes, and the criminal law may justifiably punish them when they give in to temptation and break the law. Although he conceded a statistical correlation between poverty and crime, Morse denied that poverty causes crime. He pointed out that some poor persons are law-abiding, while some wealthy persons break the law, and that economic improvements often result in more, not less, crime. Moreover, Bazelon’s social-welfare suggestions would be impractical because there is not enough money to eradicate all poverty; giving money to the poor would entail higher taxation, thus endangering such goals as free accumulation and disposition of wealth; and though eradicating poverty may eliminate some crime, it is a wasteful way to do it. Consequently, Bazelon’s broadened inquiry into culpability could exonerate dangerous criminals without generating socially useful knowledge or experience. Indeed, Bazelon’s defense skirts paternalism. When an individual has freely broken the law, respect for that individual’s personhood <i>demands</i> punishment; any other treatment demeans the defendant, and treats him or her as something less than an autonomous individual.</p><p id="770c03c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bazelon-Morse debate thus raises, but does not answer, a number of key questions concerning a “rotten social background” defense. Does economic and cultural disadvantage impair controls or otherwise cause crime, and if so, how? If severe impairment can be shown in a particular case, what effect should this have on criminal responsibility? What should be done with the successful RSB defendant?</p></div>

<p id="770c03cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Delgado goes on to argue that the criminal law <i>should</i> recognize a defense of severe environmental deprivation. And in a subsequent piece (The <span title="1091" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1091">p. 1091</span>Wretched of the Earth, 2 Ala. Civ. Rts. &amp; Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 1, 9-14 (2011)), Delgado contends that law is unique among leading disciplines in failing to acknowledge that “poverty is an important determinant of human action and one’s life chances”; as a result, he argues, defendants who suffer severe environmental deprivation become “double victims” who are failed by society during their upbringing and again in their interactions with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p id="770c03cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In accord with Delgado, Professor Theodore Y. Blumoff notes (The Problems with Blaming, in Law, Mind, and Brain 127, 129 (M. Freeman &amp; O. Goodenough eds., 2009)) that the prevalent social attitude “accepts without much debate that the wrongdoing actor virtually always possesses . . . sufficient cognitive and volitional capacity to [avoid] the crime they have committed,” but, to the contrary, “poor environmental conditions do in fact effect changes within an individual’s cognitive and volitional control.” See also Robert B. McCaleb, Note, Rejustifying Retributive Punishment on Utilitarian Grounds in Light of Neuroscientific Discoveries More Than Philosophical Calisthenics!, 63 Clev. St. L. Rev. 515, 516 (2015):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="770c2ade-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RSB is qualitatively different from classical defenses in several relevant ways. First, RSB is uniquely interested in the causal relationship between environmental conditions and social behavior. [This] point of view is widely accepted in neuroscience, partially (though controversially) accepted in moral philosophy, and generally not accepted in the law. Second, RSB takes a very broad timeline into account. It connects environmental stimuli to an actor’s later behavior in a way that other defenses do not. [T]hese unique features [are] skeptically received by the classical criminal law mainly because of [their] fundamentally non-scientific, folk-psychological position on free will. However, discoveries in contemporary neuroscience strongly support each of these features.</p>
</div>
<p id="770c2adf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rejecting these views, Professor Erik Luna argues that liability must rest on individual culpability, not “group characterizations or actuarial assessments.” Erik Luna, Spoiled Rotten Social Background, 2 Ala. Civ. Rts. &amp; Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 23, 45 (2011). To make his point, he suggests a thought experiment in which RSB is inverted and “Spoiled Rotten Social Background” (i.e. great affluence) becomes relevant to criminal liability. If “SRSB” poses nearly insuperable line-drawing problems (which defendants would be wealthy enough?), the same must be said of RSB. And <i>in what way</i> would SRSB be relevant? If RSB is a defense, SRSB should be an aggravator, but in terms of utilitarian goals like deterrence and incapacitation, Luna contends, those suffering from RSB might warrant more punishment and affluent SRSB defendants arguably would warrant less, given their access to employment opportunities and other environmental support. Professor Luna concludes that a substantive criminal law defense like RSB is not the solution for defendants who face acute environmental deprivation; rather, he argues, what is needed is greater attention to abuses in street-level policing and the delivery of effective defense services for indigent defendants.</p>

Views so expressed have indeed changed with the advance of knowledge about the human mind. Perhaps most people are now persuaded that it is possible for a man to have volitional control of his muscles and also to know the physical character of his movements and their consequences for himself and others, and yet be <i>unable</i> to resist the urge or temptation to perform a certain act; yet many think this incapacity exists only if it is associated with well-marked physiological or neurological symptoms or independently definable psychological disturbances. . . . 
</p><p id="770c2ae6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another reason limiting the scope of the excusing conditions is difficulty of <i>proof.</i> Some of the mental elements involved are much easier to prove than others. It is relatively simple to show that an agent lacked, either generally or on a particular occasion, volitional muscular control; it is somewhat more difficult to show that he did not know certain facts . . . ; it is much more difficult to establish whether or not a person was deprived of “self-control” by passion provoked by others, or by partial mental disease. As we consider these different cases not only do we reach much vaguer concepts, but we become progressively more dependent on the agent’s own statements about himself, buttressed by inferences from “common-sense” generalizations about human nature, such as that men are capable of self-control when confronted with an open till but not when confronted with a wife in adultery. The law is accordingly much more cautious in admitting “defects of the will” than “defect in knowledge” as qualifying or excluding criminal responsibility.</p></div>

</div><p id="770c2aea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How did the ideas underlying [the legal revolution in individual rights] affect the functioning of the criminal justice system?</p><p id="770c2aeb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many began questioning whether the poor and minorities could be blamed for the crimes they committed. Our legal institutions and popular culture began identifying those accused of wrongdoing as victims of upbringing and circumstances. Many argued that human actions and choices, like events in the natural world, are often caused by factors beyond one’s control. No longer was an individual identified as the cause of a harmful act. Rather, <span title="1093" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1093">p. 1093</span>societal conditions or the actions of institutions or other people became the responsible causes of harm. These external causes might include poverty, poor education, a faltering family structure, systemic racism or other forms of bigotry, and spousal or child abuse, just to name a few. . . . 
</p><p id="770c2aec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a further extension of these ideas, some began challenging society’s moral authority to hold many of our less fortunate citizens responsible for their harmful acts. Punishment is an expression of society’s disapproval or reprobation. . . . Critics insisted, though, that an individual’s harmful conduct is not the only relevant factor in deciding whether punishment is justified. The individual’s conduct must be judged in relation to how society has acted toward that individual in the past. Many began to hesitate to hold responsible those individuals whose conduct might be explained as a response to societal injustice. How can we hold the poor responsible for their actions, some asked, when our society does little to remedy the social conditions of the ill-educated and unemployed in our urban areas? Similarly, others questioned how we could tell blacks in our inner cities to face the consequences for breaking the law when the very legal system—and indeed the society—that will judge their conduct had perpetuated years of racism and unequal treatment under the law.</p><p id="770c2aed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once our legal system accepted the general premise that social conditions and upbringing could be excuses for harmful conduct, the range of cases that might prevent society from holding anyone accountable for his actions became potentially limitless. Do we punish a drunk driver who has a family history of alcoholism? A bigoted employer reared in a segregationist environment, who was taught that blacks are inferior? The fraudulent and manipulative businessman who was raised in a poor family and who had never experienced the good life? The abusive father or husband whose parents mistreated him? A thief or drug pusher who was raised in a dysfunctional family and who received a poor education? A violent gang member, rioter or murderer who attributes his rage, aggression, and lack of respect for authority to a racist society that has oppressed him since birth? Which of these individuals, if any, should be excused for his conduct? Can we really make any principled distinctions among them?</p><p id="770c51fe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An effective criminal justice system—one that holds people accountable for harmful conduct—cannot be sustained when there are boundless excuses for violent behavior and no moral authority for the state to punish. If people know that they are not going to be held accountable because of a myriad of excuses, how will our society be able to influence behavior and provide incentives to follow the law? How can we teach future generations right from wrong if the idea of criminal responsibility is riddled with exceptions and our governing institutions and courts lack moral self-confidence? A society that does not hold someone accountable for harmful behavior can be viewed as condoning, even endorsing, such conduct. In the long run, a society that abandons personal responsibility will lose its moral sense, destroying, above all, the lives of the urban poor.</p><p id="770c51ff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1094" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1094">p. 1094</span>This is not surprising. A system that does not hold individuals accountable for their harmful acts treats them as less than full citizens. In such a world, people are reduced to the status of children or, even worse, treated as though they were animals without a soul. There may be a hard lesson here. In the face of societal injustice, it is natural and easy to demand recompense or a dispensation from conventional norms. But all too often, doing so involves the individual accepting diminished responsibility for his future. Doesn’t the acceptance of diminished responsibility shackle the human spirit from rising above the tragedies of one’s condition? When we demand something from our oppressors—more lenient standards of conduct, for example—are we merely going from a state of slavery to a more deceptive, but equally destructive, state of dependency?</p><p id="770c5200-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What’s more, efforts to rehabilitate criminals will never work in a system that often neglects to assign blame to individuals for their harmful acts. How can we encourage criminals not to return to crime if our justice system fosters the idea that it is the society that has perpetuated racism and poverty that is to blame for aggression and crime, not the individual who engaged in harmful conduct? Thus, it is society, not the wrongdoer, that is in greatest need of rehabilitation and reform. . . . 
</p><p id="770c5201-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Doubtless the rights revolution had a noble purpose: to stop society from treating blacks, the poor, and others as if they were invisible, not worthy of attention.

<i>1. </i> Should <i>prosecutors</i> take into account defendants’ race or socioeconomic status in exercising their charging discretion or in offering plea bargains?

<i>2. </i> Should <i>juries</i> consider the race or socioeconomic status of defendants before deciding whether to vote to acquit despite the evidence (i.e., to nullify the criminal law)? For an argument that jurors are sometimes legally and morally justified in voting to nullify charges against African-American defendants in cases involving drug possession and other nonviolent crime, see Paul Butler, Racially Based Jury Nullification: Black Power in the Criminal Justice System, 105 Yale L.J. 677 (1995), excerpted at p. 73 supra.</p>

<i>3. </i> Should <i>sentencing judges</i> or <i>sentencing guidelines</i> take race or socioeconomic status into account in determining levels of punishment? Compare 28 U.S.C. §994(d) (mandating that federal sentencing guidelines be “entirely neutral” as to race and socioeconomic status). Do you agree?</p>
<p id="770c520a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about the relevance of other environmental circumstances in sentencing? Do Justice Thomas’s concerns suggest that leniency is inappropriate at both the guilt and sentencing phases? Compare United States v. Smith, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174279 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 2015). Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to import a substantial quantity of heroin. The guideline sentencing range for her offense called for imprisonment for a term between 108 and 135 months. U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein imposed a substantially lower sentence (id. at *9-11):</p>

<p id="770c520b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant had a traumatic childhood as a result of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980’s. She experienced sexual abuse, domestic violence, and all of the stressors associated with extreme poverty. However, as a parent she has worked hard to prevent her children from such grave experiences. . . .  Respectful consideration was given to the sentencing guidelines . . . to ensure that the sentence is “sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes” of sentencing. . . . A custodial sentence is unnecessary and would cause immeasurable harm to the children. [Therefore,] defendant is sentenced to time-served, a supervised release term of three years, and 500 hours of community service. No fine is levied because defendant is unlikely to have assets from which to pay a fine.</p>

 . . . The sentence will send a message that any involvement, for whatever purpose and in whatever capacity, in a conspiracy to import drugs into the United States will result in punishment. Specific deterrence is achieved through the defendant’s understanding of the consequences that accompany a charge such as this and [its] many collateral consequences . . . . It is unlikely that she will engage in further criminal activity in light of her disassociation with the co-conspirators, her family obligations . . . and her evident remorse.</p>

But most jurisdictions now reject this instance of strict liability and allow the mistaken third party a defense, provided that his belief in the need to use defensive force was reasonable. E.g., People v. Walker, 42 N.E.3d 688, 692 (N.Y. 2015). Conversely, if the third party knows that deadly force is <i>not</i> really necessary (for example, if he knows that the assailant is using an unloaded gun), he would not be justified in killing the assailant, even if the person attacked might be.</p>

The situational excuses are hedged by safeguards that include factual skepticism, discretion, and partial excuse. Rational actors have very little incentive to fabricate the excuses, and Bentham’s basic point that punishment will not achieve much general deterrence when applied to crimes powerfully impelled by infancy, insanity, intoxication, provocation, and duress seems perfectly plausible.</p>

Estimates of the frequency with which [felony] defendants entered the plea ranged from 13% to 57%. During the time period considered, however, the actual frequency was only 0.47%: one case in 200. Similarly, although estimates of its success rate varied from 19% to 44%, during the relevant period only one of the 102 defendants who entered the plea was acquitted by reason of insanity. . . .

[I]f substantial mental-disease and capacity evidence is accepted as rebutting mens rea in a given case, the affirmative defense of insanity will probably not be reached or ruled upon; the defendant will simply be acquitted (or perhaps convicted of a lesser included offense). If an acquitted defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect that makes him dangerous, he will neither be confined nor treated psychiatrically unless a judge so orders after some independent commitment proceeding. But if a defendant succeeds in showing himself insane, Arizona law . . . will require commitment and treatment as a consequence of that finding. . . . It makes sense, then, to channel capacity evidence to the issue structured to deal with mental incapacity when such a claim is raised successfully.</p>

Twine, 853 F.2d 676, 679 (9th Cir. 1988), “a careful reading of the 1984 Act and its history [shows] that Congress . . . did not intend to eliminate a defendant’s ability to disprove guilt with mental defect evidence [that negates mens rea].” This is now the prevailing view.
