<p id="771a81df-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Taking something belonging to another is at the root of a multitude of offenses that fall under the umbrella of theft. The nature of these crimes varies along two dimensions: how the item in question is acquired and what is taken. The law has changed dramatically on both levels. The means of acquisition separate the various common-law offenses of larceny, embezzlement, obtaining by false pretenses, fraud, and blackmail, but modern statutes tend to consolidate these into general theft statutes. Similarly, the property subject to theft has also evolved over time. There is no controversy about how to treat the unauthorized taking of tangible property, but what about other valuable rights and interests? Here, too, we must ask what is appropriately treated as a criminal offense and where to draw the lines.</p>

<p id="771aa8f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Distinctions among larceny, embezzlement, obtaining by false pretenses, extortion, and the other closely related theft offenses are explicable in terms of a long history of expansion of the role of the criminal law in protecting property. That history begins with a concern for crimes of violence—in the present context, the taking of property by force from the possession of another, i.e., robbery. The criminal law then expanded, by means of the ancient quasi-criminal writ of trespass, to cover all taking of another’s property from his possession without his consent, even though no force was used. This misconduct was punished as larceny. The law then expanded once more, through some famous judicial manipulation of the concept of possession, to embrace misappropriation by a person who with the consent of the owner already had physical control over the property, as in the case of servants. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771aa8f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point in the chronology of the law of theft, about the end of the 18th century, . . . the initiative pass[ed] from the courts to the legislature. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771aa8f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1098" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1098">p. 1098</span>The earliest statutes dealt with embezzlement by such narrowly defined groups as bank clerks. Subsequent laws extended coverage to agents, attorneys, bailees, fiduciaries, . . . until at last a few American legislatures enacted fraudulent-conversion statutes penalizing misappropriation by anyone who received or had in his possession or control the property of another. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771aa8f7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fraud aspects of theft, never regarded with such abhorrence as larceny, begin with the common-law misdemeanor of cheat. This offense required use of false weights or similar “tokens,” thus limiting criminal deception to certain special techniques conceived as directed against the public generally. One may suspect that this development was an outgrowth of guild regulation of unfair competition as much as it reflected a desire to protect the buying public. . . .  A mere lie for the purpose of deceiving another in a business transaction did not become criminal until the Statute of 30 Geo. 2, ch. 24 (1757), created the misdemeanor of obtaining property by false pretenses. Even this statute was not at first believed to make mere misrepresentation criminal. Instead, it was thought to require some more elaborate swindling stratagem. . . . Eventually it was settled in Anglo-American law that false representations of “fact,” if “material,” would suffice. Today’s battleground is over such matters as misrepresentation of “opinion,” “law,” or “value,” as well as “misleading omissions” and “false promises.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="771aa8f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal law reached larceny first and embezzlement later because of real distinctions between theft by a stranger and the peculations of a trusted agent. . . . The ordinary trespass-theft was committed by a stranger, an intruder with no semblance of right even to touch the object taken. The offender was easily recognized by the very taking, surreptitious or forceful, and so set apart from the law-abiding community. . . . In contrast, the embezzler stands always in a lawful as well as in an unlawful relation to the victim and the property. He is respectable; indeed, some tend to identify with him rather than with the bank or insurance company from which he embezzles. The line between lawful and unlawful activity is for the embezzler a question of the scope of his authority, which may be ill-defined. Not every deviation from the authority conferred will be civilly actionable, much less a basis for criminal liability. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771aa8f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The embezzlement problem is complicated further by the necessity of distinguishing between defalcation by one who has “property of another” and failure of a debtor to pay his debts. Modern society is opposed to imprisonment for debt, however committed it may be to punishment for betrayal of trust. Yet when property is entrusted to a dealer for sale, with the expectation that he will receive the proceeds, deduct his commission, and remit the balance, the dealer’s criminal liability if he fails to remit may turn on refinements of the civil law of contracts, agency, sales, or trusts. Such refinements, designed to allocate financial risks or to determine priorities among creditors of an insolvent, are hardly a relevant index to the harm done the owner or to the character of the defaulting dealer and thus may be entirely inappropriate as a measure of criminal liability.<span title="1099" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1099">p. 1099</span></p>

</p><p id="771aa903-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common law defined larceny as the taking and carrying away of someone else’s personal property, by trespass, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession. Larceny was considered to be an offense less serious than robbery because of robbery’s additional requirement of personal violence against, or intimidation of, the victim. Not that the distinction made any difference to the accused: Under the common law, robbery and larceny were felonies, and all felonies were punishable by death.</p><p id="771ad014-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1275, the English Parliament enacted a . . . statute [whereby] grand larceny remained punishable by death; but petit larceny became punishable only by imprisonment, whipping, or forfeiture of goods. Larceny remained a felony, however, irrespective of whether it was grand or petit. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad015-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until the latter part of the 18th century, death was the punishment for all theft offenses except petty larceny. By that time, English society and its judiciary had become troubled by that excessively harsh punishment for theft crimes. This concern led the English courts to limit the scope of larceny. For instance, it was held not to be larceny—and not a crime at all—if someone in lawful possession of another’s property misappropriated it for personal use (the later offense of embezzlement), or if someone acquired title to another’s property by fraud (the later offense of false pretenses). These limitations to the law of larceny made sense [because] they were viewed as less likely to result in violence. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad016-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[L]arceny requires a <i>trespassory</i> taking, which is a taking without the property owner’s consent. . . . The reasoning supporting larceny by trick’s inclusion <span title="1100" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1100">p. 1100</span>within the crime of larceny—that fraud vitiates the property owner’s consent to the taking—was not extended, however, to cases involving the fraudulent transfer of title. Under the common law, if title was transferred, there was no trespass and hence no larceny. The theory was that once title to property was voluntarily transferred by its owner to another, the recipient owned the property and therefore could not be said to be trespassing upon it. Similarly, under the common law there was no trespass, and hence no larceny, when a lawful possessor of another’s property misappropriated it to personal use. These subtle limitations on the common law crime of larceny spurred the British Parliament in the 18th century to create the separate statutory offenses of theft by false pretenses and embezzlement. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad017-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike larceny, the newly enacted offense of theft by false pretenses involved acquiring title over the property, not just possession. Unlike larceny, the newly enacted offense of embezzlement involved an initial, lawful possession of the victim’s property, followed by its misappropriation.</p><p id="771ad018-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Britain’s 18th century division of theft into the three separate crimes of larceny, false pretenses, and embezzlement made its way into the early criminal laws of the American states. That import has been widely criticized in this nation’s legal community because of the seemingly arbitrary distinctions between the three offenses and the burden these distinctions have posed for prosecutors. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad019-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the early 20th century, many state legislatures, recognizing the burdens imposed on prosecutors by the separation of the three crimes of larceny, false pretenses, and embezzlement, consolidated those offenses into a single crime, usually called “theft.” . . . [T]he California Legislature’s consolidation of larceny, false pretenses, and embezzlement into the single crime of theft did not change the elements of those offenses. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad01a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now consider the issue here: whether robbery’s element of “felonious taking” can be satisfied through theft by false pretenses, the type of theft defendant committed.</p><p id="771ad01b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Robbery is “the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.” Reflected in that statutory definition are larceny’s elements of “the taking of another’s property, with the intent to steal and carry it away.” The taking required in larceny, as in robbery, must be “felonious.”</p><p id="771ad01c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[As explained above,] all larceny at common law was a felony, and thus the common law defined larceny as a “felonious taking.” Because California’s robbery statute uses the common law’s phrase “felonious taking,” and because at common law “felonious taking” was synonymous with larceny, we conclude that larceny is a necessary element of robbery. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad01d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two differences in the crimes of larceny and theft by false pretenses tend to support our conclusion that only theft by larceny, not by false pretenses, can fulfill the “felonious taking” requirement of robbery.</p><p id="771ad01e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, <i>larceny</i> requires “asportation,” which is a carrying away of stolen property. This element of larceny, although satisfied by only the slightest <span title="1101" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1101">p. 1101</span>movement, continues until the perpetrator reaches a place of temporary safety. Asportation is what makes larceny a continuing offense. Because larceny is a continuing offense, a defendant who uses force or fear in an attempt to escape with property taken by larceny has committed robbery. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad01f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But <i>theft by false pretenses,</i> unlike larceny, has no requirement of asportation. The offense requires only that “(1) the defendant made a false pretense or representation to the owner of property; (2) with the intent to defraud the owner of that property; and (3) the owner transferred the property to the defendant in reliance on the representation.” The crime of theft by false pretenses ends at the moment title to the property is acquired, and thus cannot become robbery by the defendant’s later use of force or fear. Here, when defendant shoved the store security guards, he was no longer engaged in the commission of theft because he had already acquired title to the Walmart gift cards; therefore, defendant did not commit robbery. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad020-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now consider another significant difference between larceny and theft by false pretenses. . . . [L]arceny requires a “trespassory taking,” which is a taking without the property owner’s consent. . . . By contrast, theft by false pretenses involves the <i>consensual</i> transfer of possession as well as <i>title</i> of property; therefore, it cannot be committed by trespass. This is illustrated by the facts in a recent Court of Appeal decision, <i>People v. Beaver</i> (2010) 186 Cal. App. 4th 107. There, the defendant staged an accident at his place of employment, a ski resort, to obtain medical expenses for a preexisting injury to his knee. The defendant was convicted of grand theft. The Court of Appeal reversed the conviction, holding that the jury was instructed on the incorrect type of theft—theft by larceny—and instead should have been instructed on theft by false pretenses. <i>Beaver</i> said: “The present matter did not involve a taking of property from another without his consent. [The ski resort] willingly paid for defendant’s medical treatment on the false representation that [it] had caused defendant’s injuries. This was theft by false pretenses, not larceny.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 121.) . . . 
</p><p id="771ad021-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here too defendant did not commit larceny. Walmart, through its store employees, consented to transferring title to the gift cards to defendant. Defendant acquired ownership of the gift cards through his false representation, on which Walmart relied, that he was using valid payment cards to purchase the gift cards. Only after discovering the fraud did the store seek to reclaim possession. Because a “felonious taking,” as required in California’s robbery statute, must be <i>without the consent</i> of the property owner, or “against his will,” and Walmart <i>consented</i> to the sale of the gift cards, defendant did not commit a <i>trespassory</i> (nonconsensual) taking, and hence did not commit robbery. Moreover, unlike the offense of larceny by trick, in which a defendant’s fraud vitiates the consent of the victim as a matter of law, the acquisition of title involved in the crime of theft by false pretenses precludes a trespass from occurring. . . . 
</p><p id="771ad022-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In resolving many complex legal issues, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., observed, “a page of history is worth a volume of logic.” (New York Trust Co. v.

This review has led us to conclude that the words “felonious taking” in the robbery definition were intended to refer only to theft committed by larceny and not to theft by false pretenses.</p><p id="771ad023-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The logic and fairness of this conclusion may be open to question because a thief who uses force to resist capture may be equally culpable whether the theft was committed by larceny (for example, ordinary shoplifting) or by false pretenses (as occurred here). Nevertheless, our task is simply to interpret and apply the laws as the Legislature has enacted them, not to revise or reform them to better reflect contemporary standards. . . .

<i>1. Traditional asportation and its statutory variants.</i> Both at common law and under statutory formulations, larceny requires a trespassory taking as well as a carrying away (asportation). While courts have substantially minimized the significance of this requirement by holding that any movement of the thing, no matter how slight, is sufficient, problems still may arise. Consider McAlevy v. Commonwealth, 605 S.E.2d 283 (Va. Ct. App. 2004). The defendant purported to sell farm equipment, not his own, to an innocent purchaser, who himself carried the equipment away. May the defendant be held for larceny? A few courts would answer in the negative because of the absence of an asportation. See, e.g., State v. Laborde, 11 So. 2d 404 (La. 1942). The majority, however, as in <i>McAlevy</i>, supra, resolve the issue by finding the purchaser to be the innocent agent of the seller and imputing his acts to the defendant. Can this be analytically defended?</p>
<p id="771af738-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New York Court of Appeals, in People v. Alamo, 358 N.Y.S.2d 375 (1974), dispensed with the requirement of an actual movement of the object in a case where the defendant entered a stranger’s car, turned on the lights, and started the engine. The court upheld the trial court’s instruction that the jury might find theft of the car in these circumstances even if the defendant had not moved the vehicle (assuming, of course, they found the requisite intent to steal it). The court read the traditional doctrine requiring an asportation as reflecting a concern that the crucial elements of possession and control were established. Drawing a comparison to pickpocket cases in which courts required some movement of the seized object, the court stated (358 N.Y.S.2d at 379):</p>

An automobile, however, is itself an instrument of transportation and when activated comes within the total possession and control of the operator. In this situation movement or motion is not essential to control. Absent any evidence that the vehicle is somehow fastened or immovable because of a mechanical defect, the thief has taken command of the object of the larceny.</p>

The legislative history rejects an asportation requirement: “[T]he term ‘obtaining information’ includes merely reading it. There is no requirement that the information be copied or transported.

<i>2. Problem.</i> The defendant removed a price label for £2.73 from one piece of meat in a supermarket and affixed the label to another piece of meat that should have cost £6.91. His act was detected at the checkout counter before he paid for the mislabeled package. Could the defendant be convicted of larceny? See Regina v.

In another case, the defendant removed a sensor device from a jacket, put the jacket on, and leaving his own jacket on the table, walked toward the exit. N.Y. Penal Code §155.05 provides that one commits larceny when “he wrongfully takes” another’s property, with the intent to steal. The defendant argued that a customer cannot “wrongfully take” an article in a self-service store so long as he remains in the store. The court disagreed and affirmed all the convictions, holding that these defendants could be held for larceny even though they were apprehended before leaving the store. The court stated (52 N.Y.2d at 317-318):</p>

[In] Reg. v. Lawrence, 4 Cox C.C. 438, it was held that if the property was delivered by a servant to the defendant by the master’s direction the offense cannot be larceny, regardless of the purpose of the defendant. In this case the property was not only placed on the loading platform, as was usual in delivering such goods to customers, with knowledge that the accused would soon arrive, having a formed design to take it, but the packing company’s employee in charge of the platform, Ernst Klotz, was instructed that the property was placed there for a man who would call for it. Klotz from such statement had every reason to infer, when the accused arrived and claimed the right to take the property, that he was the one referred to and that it was proper to make delivery to him and he acted accordingly. While he did not physically place the property, or assist in doing so, in the wagon, his standing by, witnessing such placing by the accused, and then assisting him in arranging the wagon, as the evidence shows he did, and taking the order, in the usual way, from the accused as to the disposition of the fourth barrel, and his conduct in respect thereto amounted, practically, to a delivery of the three barrels to the accused.</p><p id="771b1e58-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Rex v.

All this was done with a view to the apprehension of the guilty parties after the accomplishment of their purpose. The servant by direction of the master not only gave access to the house but afforded the would-be thieves every facility for taking the property, and yet the court held that the crime of larceny was complete, because there was no direction to the servant to deliver the property to the intruders or consent to their taking it. [T]he way was made easy for them to do so, but they were neither induced to commit the crime, nor was any act essential to the offense done by any one but themselves. . . .

</p><p id="771b1e5a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The logical basis for the doctrine above discussed is that there can be no larceny without a trespass. So if one procures his property to be taken by another intending to commit larceny, or delivers his property to such other, the latter purposing to commit such crime, the element of trespass is wanting and the crime not fully consummated however plain may be the guilty purpose of the one possessing himself of such property. That does not militate against a person’s being free to set a trap to catch one whom he suspects of an intention to commit the crime of larceny, but the setting of such trap must not go further than to afford the would-be thief the amplest opportunity to carry out his purpose, formed without such inducement on the part of the owner of the property, as to put him in the position of having consented to the taking. If I induce one to come and take my property and then place it before him to be taken, and he takes it with criminal intent, or if knowing that one intends to take my property I deliver it to him and he takes it with such intent, the essential element of trespass involving nonconsent requisite to a completed offense of larceny does not characterize the transaction, regardless of the fact that the moral turpitude involved is no less than it would be if such essential were present. Some writers in treating this subject give so much attention to condemning the deception practiced to facilitate and encourage the commission of a crime . . . that the condemnation is liable to be viewed as if the deception were sufficient to excuse the would-be criminal, or to preclude his being prosecuted; . . . and that the wrongful participation of the owner of the property renders him and the public incapable of being heard to charge the person he has entrapped with the offense of larceny. That is wrong. [The obstacle to convicting the would-be thief] is the removal from the completed transaction . . . of the element of trespass or nonconsent. [Determining whether such element is absent] is often not free from difficulty and courts of review should incline quite strongly to support the decision of the trial judge in respect to the matter and not disturb it except in a clear case.

<i>1. Feigned accomplices and consent.</i> An informant told a police officer that the defendant, Jarrott, proposed that he join him in stealing and selling cars. The informant was instructed to play along. Later, the informant informed the police officer of the general time and place that Jarrott, with his ostensible help, planned to steal a car. The police officer thereupon arranged for his own car to be present at that time and place. He left it with the key in the ignition, concealing himself in the back.

When they arrived at the garage, the policeman climbed out from the car and made his arrest. Defendant appealed his larceny conviction on the grounds that (1) the car was never taken from the personal possession of the owner and (2) the taking occurred with the owner’s consent.

At common law the only substantive crime embodied within this law was robbery, a larceny accomplished by violence or threat of immediate violence to the person of the victim. In time it was acknowledged that men may be intimidated by threats other than those foreboding bodily harm. As a result, modern legislation has extended the substantive content of aggravated theft, complementing robbery with the crime of extortion. . . . 
</p><p id="771b457a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first inquiry, then, concerns the manner in which these crimes differ. The statutory definitions of robbery restate in essence the common law <span title="1107" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1107">p. 1107</span>definition: the felonious and forcible taking of property from the person of another or in his presence, against his will, by violence or putting in fear. Extortion statutes are generally of two types. The majority of jurisdictions treat as the substantive crime of extortion the making of certain specified threats for the purpose of obtaining property, but a substantial number require an actual misappropriation with the owner’s consent. . . . In jurisdictions following either extortion pattern, robbery requires a taking from the person or in his presence, while for extortion the intimidation is crucial and the place of the taking immaterial. In states which do not require more than the threat for extortion, the fact of misappropriation is relevant only to robbery. And in those states where misappropriation is essential to extortion, there is a distinction based on the factor of consent. The robbery statutes speak of the absence of consent; the extortion statutes require its presence. But the willingness to surrender the property in any case is only an apparent willingness since in both instances the victim must choose between alternative evils, namely, the surrender of his property or the execution of the threat. Only if the taking is accomplished by violence to the person of the victim is this apparent consent precluded, for then the victim is presented with no choice. Thus the definitional distinctions between robbery and extortion are extremely tenuous. . . .

The case of the policeman who has a duty to arrest illustrates the point. His threat to arrest unless the proposed subject of the arrest pays him money should be treated as extortionate even though the failure to arrest would be dereliction of duty.</p><p id="771b6ca8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> <i>(a)</i> Note that the threats sufficient to establish robbery are defined much more broadly in California than under the MPC. Is that a strength or a weakness of the California scheme? <i>(b)</i> In California, if an offender threatens to slash a motorist’s tires unless the motorist pays him $200, is the offender guilty of robbery, extortion, or both? What would be the answer in a state following the MPC approach? How <i>should</i> the offense be classified? <i>(c)</i> In California, if an offender threatens to assault a man’s wife unless the man pays him $200, is the offender guilty of robbery, extortion, or both? What would be the answer in a state following the MPC approach? How <i>should</i> that offense be classified? <i>(d)</i> In California, an offender stole a car from a parking lot and ran over the car’s owner as the offender was driving away. The offender conceded that he intended to steal the car but insisted that he did not intend to strike or frighten the owner. Is this robbery? In People v. Anderson, 252 P.3d 968 (Cal. 2011), the California Supreme Court reinstated the offender’s conviction, holding that “the intent element of robbery does not include an intent to apply force against the victim or to cause the victim to feel fear. It is robbery if the defendant committed a forcible act against the victim motivated by the intent to steal, even if the defendant did not also intend for the victim to experience force or fear.” Do you agree with the court’s approach to the mens rea for robbery?

<i>NOTE ON EMBEZZLEMENT</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="771b93c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The early conception of larceny as a trespassory taking from the possession of the owner against his will was thought to preclude conviction of persons who physically and lawfully held property of the owner, such as servants, guests, and employees. Since they had “possession” of the owner’s goods, their making off with them could not constitute larceny.</p>
<p id="771b93ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This was changed through judicial development of the concept that, in some situations the servant merely had <i>custody</i>, while <i>possession</i>—“legal” or “constructive” possession—remained in the employer. The development was gradual, and there was considerable disagreement over such issues as whether a servant had mere custody or legal possession when the master entrusted property to him to be taken a distance from the house. Such doubts were resolved by statute in 1529, and by later cases it was established that “a servant, whether at the master’s home or elsewhere, never has legal possession of such property of his master as he controls in his capacity as servant.” 2 Wm. Oldnall Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanors (11th ed., Turner, 1958). A servant, therefore, who made off with his master’s goods, committed larceny from the possession of the master. By analogous reasoning, similar results were reached with guests.</p>
<p id="771b93cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What about the case in which the servant is given goods by a third party for delivery to his master? Could it be said here that when a servant misappropriated the goods, he was taking them from someone’s possession? The answer was no, since the master did not have possession and the third party voluntarily gave up possession. As a result, the servant could not be convicted of larceny.</p>
<p id="771b93cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The courts found a way to fill part of this gap, too. They reasoned that if the servant deposited the goods or money he had received in a place provided by the master and subject to the master’s control (as in <i>Nolan</i>, supra), then <i>possession</i> passed to the master; the servant retained only <i>custody</i>. In that scenario, therefore, a dishonest appropriation was larceny. The solution, <span title="1111" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1111">p. 1111</span>however, was far from perfect, as became clear in Bazeley’s Case, 168 Eng. Rep. 517 (1799).</p>
<p id="771bbadd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bazeley was a bank teller who pocketed a £100 note received from a customer for deposit. The court found no larceny because at the time of the conversion, the note was in the legal possession of the teller. To fill the gap in the law dramatized by this case, the first embezzlement statute was passed in 1799 (39 Geo. III, ch. 85) providing:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771bbade-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If . . . any person employed . . . in the capacity of a servant or clerk, to any person or persons whomsoever, or to any body corporate or politick, shall, by virtue, of such employment, receive or take into his possession any money, goods, bond, bill, note, banker’s draft, or other valuable security, or effects, for or in the name or on the account of his master or masters, or employer or employers, and shall fraudulently embezzle, secrete, or make away with the same, or any part thereof, every such offender shall be deemed to have feloniously stolen the same.</p>
</div>
<p id="771bbadf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern cases, such as <i>Nolan</i>, supra, are products of this history of larceny and embezzlement as mutually exclusive offenses. Following the common-law rule, State v. Weaver, 607 S.E.2d 599 (N.C. 2005), held that a defendant could not be convicted of aiding and abetting embezzlement because his wife, who allegedly used company checks for personal expenses, did not have the authority to sign for the checks. By contrast, State v. Willard-Freckleton, 939 A.2d 416 (Vt. 2007), rejected the common-law distinction between larceny and embezzlement. It distinguished <i>Weaver</i> and found all employee conversions to constitute embezzlement when the employee has custody or control of the property by virtue of his or her employment, even if the employee does not have lawful possession.</p>
<p id="771bbae0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional enactments have gradually extended the categories of persons capable of embezzling to brokers, merchants, bankers, attorneys, trustees, and similar positions of trust. American embezzlement statutes still bear the mark of this piecemeal legislative development. See <i>Riggins</i>, p. 1116 infra.</p>
<p id="771bbae1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because misappropriation cases involve individuals with lawful possession of property (or at least lawful custody), they often raise questions of when an employee’s use goes too far and crosses the line into criminality. For example, when does the employee’s use of a company car for personal use cross the line from accepted personal use into criminal embezzlement? John L. Diamond, Reviving Lenity and Honest Belief at the Boundaries of Criminal Law, 44 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 1, 4-5 (2010). How should prosecutors determine when to bring charges in these cases where they will undoubtedly have broad discretion because of the nature of the charge? Note that similar concerns are raised in other contexts involving theft, including extortion, bribery, and theft of services. See pp. 1135-1145, 1149-1150 infra. Does this question of line-drawing exist to the same degree with larceny? Why or why not?</p>

If one, without the trespass which characterizes ordinary larceny, comes into possession of any personalty of another and is in duty bound to exercise some degree of care to preserve and restore the thing to such other or to some person for that other, or otherwise account for the property as that of such other, according to circumstances,—he is a bailee. It is the element of lawful possession, however created, and duty to account for the thing as the property of another, that creates the bailment, regardless of whether such possession is based on contract in the ordinary sense or not. . . . The mutuality essential to the contractual feature may be created by operation of law as well as by the acts of the parties with intention to contract.</p><p id="771bbae8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So it makes no difference whether the thing be intrusted to a person by the owner, or another, or by some one for the owner or by the law to the same end. Taking possession without present intent to appropriate raises all the contractual elements essential to a bailment. So the person who bona fide recovers the property of another which has been lost, or irresponsibly cast away by an insane man, as in this case, is a bailee as much as if the same property were intrusted to such person by contract inter partes. In the latter case the contract creates the duty. In the former the law creates it. Such a situation is to be distinguished from that where one knowingly receives money paid him by mistake and fraudulently retains it. There the element of bona fide possession may be said not to exist and so the duty accompanied by such possession essential to a bailment not to have been created. . . .

<p id="771bbaed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Note following <i>Nolan</i>, supra, described the development of the possession-custody distinction as a means whereby certain kinds of misappropriation by persons lawfully holding the property of another came to be treated as larceny. The enactment of embezzlement statutes eliminated the need for such judicial gap filling. However, just as this distinction proved inadequate to deal <span title="1113" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1113">p. 1113</span>with the servant who received goods for his master from a third person, it proved inadequate to deal with the bailee who misappropriated his bailor’s property, because the crucial significance of a bailment relation was the transfer of <i>possession</i> and not mere custody. The early common law therefore sought to bring at least some bailee misappropriations within the scope of larceny, but those efforts proved insufficient. The real remedy was again statutory, an act of 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict., ch. 54, §4) creating the new crime of larceny by bailee, which placed the dishonest bailee on a par with the dishonest servant. American statutes today either retain similar provisions as a separate crime of larceny by bailee or include misappropriation by a bailee as an instance of embezzlement.</p>

In these cases, the person who comes into possession of the property may dishonestly decide to keep it for himself.

Found property.</i> As for property found by a person who fails to return it, an early partial solution was the distinction between <i>lost</i> property (property unintentionally placed where found) and <i>mislaid</i> property (property deliberately placed where found, the owner forgetting where he or she put it). In the latter case, the courts often found that “possession” never left the owner, so that when the finder appropriated it, the finder “took” it from the owner’s possession. Even as to the former, however, it was eventually determined that the finder took the property from the constructive possession of the owner; and if at the time the finder appropriated the lost property he or she intended to convert it, even though he might be able to discover the owner’s identity, the finder was guilty of larceny. Penny v. State, 159 S.W. 1127 (Ark. 1913). It is generally held, however, that the felonious intent to appropriate must accompany the original finding and appropriation—otherwise there is no felonious taking. Long v. State, 33 So. 2d 382 (Ala. Ct. App. 1948). In one recent case, a person in line at the grocery store noticed an unmarked envelope on the checkout counter with more than $1,900 in cash inside. A surveillance tape showed the person opening the envelope, moving it out of the view of the cashier, and leaving the store with it. At trial, the defendant argued that the surveillance tape provided no insight into his thinking and because there was no other evidence to show he believed the owner of the property could be <span title="1114" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1114">p. 1114</span>found, he argued the evidence was insufficient to prove larceny. The Ohio Court of Appeals disagreed because the money was found in the checkout lane of a grocery store, not on the street, thus meeting the state’s test that “when, at the time [a defendant] finds it, he has reasonable ground to believe, from the nature of the property, or the circumstance under which it was found, that if he does not conceal but deals honestly with it, the owner will appear or be ascertained.” State v. Morock, 2015 WL 4660026 (Ohio Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2015).</p>
<p id="771be202-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the MPC’s approach to found property in §223.5, which is now adopted by many states:</p>

The realistic objective in this area is not to prevent initial appropriation but to compel subsequent acts to restore to the owner. The section therefore permits conviction even where the original taking was honest in the sense that the actor then intended to restore; if he subsequently changes his mind and determines to keep the property, he will then be guilty of theft.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> How does this square with the general view that omissions cannot form the basis of criminal liability? Does a law like this effectively create a duty to act because it requires someone who finds property to make a reasonable effort to return it or risk criminal liability?</p>

<i>2. Found information.</i> In 2010, an Apple engineer left a prototype of the soon-to-be-released iPhone 4 at a California bar. Brian Hogan found the prototype and brought it home. Weeks later, Hogan sold the prototype to Gizmodo.com, a tech website, for $5,000; Gizmodo published a preview of the device, and the story spread like wildfire across the Internet. (The iPhone 4 was extraordinarily popular: When released two months later, Apple sold more than 1 million phones on the first day.) When the story ran, Apple claimed the story was damaging to the company because customers would not purchase its existing phones and instead opt to wait for the iPhone 4. Gizmodo later returned the phone to Apple.</p>
<p id="771be208-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hogan was subsequently charged with misdemeanor theft; he pleaded no contest and received probation.

<i>3. Abandoned property.</i> How should the law address the situation where the defendant claims that she believed the property she found was abandoned, as opposed to lost or mislaid? Recall in <i>Morissette</i>, p. 305 supra, that the Supreme Court held that an honest, though mistaken, belief that property was abandoned is a defense to larceny. For a recent decision reaffirming this view, see Commonwealth v. Liebenow, 470 Mass. 151 (2014).</p>

<i>4. Misdelivered property.</i> In the case of dishonest appropriation of property delivered by mistake, there is again a twofold problem: first, finding the necessary taking from possession, and second, finding a felonious intent coincident with the taking. The supporting Commentary to MPC §223.5 states as follows (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §223.5 at 225-226 (1980)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771be20b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[O]ne who accepts a $10 bill knowing that the other person thinks he is handing over a $1 bill acquires it without trespass or false pretense. Moreover, he may not be in any of the employee or fiduciary relations that were enumerated in the typical older embezzlement statutes. Consequently, special legislation or judicial sleight-of-hand was required to reach persons taking advantage of such mistakes. . . . Yet the recipient, knowing that the transfer to him is inadvertent, is in a moral and physical situation with respect to the property much like that of the finder of lost property. Moreover, he knows who is rightfully entitled to the property and can easily take steps to restore the property. Accordingly, Section 223.5 imposes theft sanctions against one in this situation who fails to take reasonable measures to restore. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771be20c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is necessary to limit the reach of Section 223.5, on the other hand, in order to avoid impinging on certain types of tolerated sharp trading. For example, it is not proposed to punish the purchase of another’s property at a bargain price on a mere showing that the buyer was aware that the seller was misinformed regarding the value of what he sold. The language of Section 223.5 is accordingly limited to situations where the mistake is as to “the nature or amount of the property or the identity of the recipient.”</p>

He was subject to no control whatsoever by any of his customers in making his collections. His customers knew that he kept all of his collections in a single account.

 . . . The statute under which the defendant was indicted refers to “any clerk, agent, servant, solicitor, broker, apprentice, or officer.” If “agent” has the broad meaning which the majority gives it, each of the other terms is superfluous because all are embraced within the single term “agent.” Many of the specific enumerations in the other statutes referred to by the majority likewise become largely, if not entirely, meaningless, for the particular relationships they seek to reach are also swallowed up in the expanded definition of the term “agent.”</p>

<p id="771c5774-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the miners in the <i>Mitchneck</i> case had drawn their pay at one window and passed part of it back to Mitchneck’s cashier at the next window, conviction for embezzlement or fraudulent conversion could have been obtained. The premise of Section 223.8 is that liability should also follow on the facts of the case as they occurred. The bookkeeping shortcut actually used hardly serves as a rational basis for exculpating Mitchneck from criminal liability. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771c5775-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Polzin</i> case presents a more complex variation of the same situation. Polzin was a money lender who took a note from a Mrs. Braseth under an <span title="1120" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1120">p. 1120</span>arrangement by which, instead of paying the cash to her, he agreed to pay off certain of her creditors. Instead of doing so, he made out a check to a collection agency which he owned. He then approached the creditors with a proposal to act for them in collecting their claim from Mrs. Braseth for a 33 percent collection fee. They accepted the arrangement, after which Polzin paid the creditors and withheld $19 as his agreed-upon collection fee.</p>
<p id="771c5776-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Polzin was convicted of petty larceny, the jury having evidently taken the view that what was stolen was the $19 fee which Polzin had withheld. The Supreme Court of Washington reversed the conviction. The court held first that there could be no misappropriation of any “property” belonging to Mrs. Braseth, because she never gave Polzin anything other than her note. Since Polzin held no “property” belonging to Mrs. Braseth but had merely promised to make certain payments, he was her debtor rather than her trustee. Second, with respect to the $19 withheld from the creditors, Mrs. Braseth “lost nothing”; the bills had been completely discharged and Polzin had therefore performed his agreement as far as she was concerned.</p>
<p id="771c5777-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 223.8 was designed in part to provide a theory for reaching cases like <i>Mitchneck</i> and <i>Polzin.</i> Both were thought to illustrate situations that properly should be assimilated to theft rather than treated as mere breach of contract. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771c5778-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a long tradition, deriving to some extent from the harsh days of the debtors’ prison and to some extent enshrined in constitutional provisions, against enforcing individual consensual obligations by criminal sanctions. . . .  Among the valid objections[:] that the invocation of criminal sanctions in cases of non-performance involves the impairment of the incentive to make wise risk selections and thus impairment of the social functions of contract-making . . . ; the unlikelihood of deterring honest insolvency by criminal threats, since insolvency is so often a result of factors beyond the control of the individual; the dangers, in attempting to punish insolvency for which the actor may properly be viewed as at fault, of discouraging the kind of speculation that is properly a part of a free-enterprise system and of securing unjust convictions by hindsight; and the futility, from the creditors’ standpoint, of imprisoning a debtor who is unable to pay.</p>
<p id="771c5779-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">None of the foregoing considerations was thought applicable to cases such as <i>Mitchneck</i> and <i>Polzin.</i> In neither of those cases was there an ordinary credit transaction or an understanding that involves an assessment of risks at some future date. Mitchneck and Polzin were not supposed to use the funds in any way for their own purposes nor even to retain them for any substantial period. They were merely conduits for the transmission of money to persons designated by the real owner of the money. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771c577a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be noted, however, that the <i>Mitchneck</i> and <i>Polzin</i> situations are not free from difficulty even under such a formulation as Section 223.8. The text of the offense requires that the actor “obtain” property from another. The term “obtain” is defined in Section 223.0(5) to mean, in <span title="1121" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1121">p. 1121</span>relation to property, “to bring about a transfer or purported transfer of a legal interest in the property, whether to the obtainer or another.” The problem in both <i>Mitchneck</i> and <i>Polzin</i> was that the defendant was not perceived as having “obtained” anything from the victim in this sense, and that perception might be no less applicable to Section 223.8. Indeed, if the property were regarded as having been “obtained” as that term is defined, Section 223.2(1) would be an adequate basis for prosecution. If Mitchneck and Polzin obtained property of another under an understanding and then “exercised unlawful control over” that property, there would seem to be no bar to an ordinary embezzlement prosecution. Even if this is true, however, there may be an important value in addressing a specific formulation to situations of this kind. Convictions of embezzlement are not easily obtained under the broader standards embodied in the general definition of theft.</p>
<p id="771c7e8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important, nevertheless, to emphasize the point that Section 223.8 must not be construed so broadly that a bright line between theft and breach of contract is obscured. [Consider] credit-card purchases, a practice that has assumed enormous proportions in today’s economy. Typically, the purchaser of goods “obtains” property by becoming the drawee-acceptor of a draft, drawn by the merchant in favor of the credit-card company as payee. If unauthorized use of the card is involved, or if forged or stolen cards are used, Section 224.6 is adequate to handle the problem. If the actor intended from the beginning not to pay, Section 223.3 covers the situation. But if the actor . . . simply cannot pay his bills, it is inappropriate to make him a thief; the risk that he cannot pay is a cost of doing business that credit-card companies should assume. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771c7e8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The path to avoiding such undue extensions of Section 223.8 is to accord proper weight to the limitation embodied in the words “to be reserved,” so that Section 223.8 is deemed applicable only in cases of a promise to turn over property actually received in kind or an equivalent sum of money specifically reserved in the sense that a trustee reserves a fiduciary account. It is true that such a construction would seem to limit Section 223.8 to classic instances of embezzlement. [T]here may be some cases beyond ordinary embezzlement to which the provision could be applied by a broad construction of “obtains” to deal with situations where property was not physically exchanged. But in order to eliminate application of the section to cases where civil remedies alone should be permitted, something approaching an explicit agreement to “reserve” would seem to be required.</p>

<p id="771c7e94-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The hallmark of theft by fraud is the use of deception to obtain either possession or title of another’s property. The difficulty is drawing a line between deception that rises to the level of criminality and, as Samuel W. Buell puts it, “acceptable behavior in the rough-and-tumble of markets.” Buell, Good Faith and Law Evasion, 58 UCLA L. Rev. 611, 638 (2011). See also Stuart P. Green, Lying, Cheating, and Stealing: A Moral Theory of White Collar Crime (2006). Even after conduct is identified as falling on the criminal side of the line, there remains a similarly complex question of how it stacks up against other criminal frauds and should be graded for punishment.</p>
<p id="771c7e95-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here, too, history plays an important role in making sense of the current state of the law. The early common law, influenced by the ethic of caveat emptor, did not criminalize situations in which a person acquired another’s property through simple deception. The classic justification was given by Lord Chief Justice John Holt in 1703: “[W]e are not to indict one man for making a fool of another.” Regina v. Jones, 91 Eng. Rep. 330.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN106AE_12a1c29b-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N106AE_12a1c29b-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> But through the development of common-law “cheats,” the principle was modified as to certain kinds of fraud aimed indiscriminately at any member of the public rather than at a particular person, when ordinary prudence was an insufficient protection: for example, using false tokens, weights, or measures. See Rex. v. Wheatley, 97 Eng. Rep. 746, 748-749 (1761).</p>
<p id="771c7e97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A more far-reaching innovation came in 1757 with the enactment of what became the prototype false pretense statute, 30 Geo. II, ch. 24, making it a misdemeanor to obtain “money, goods, wares or merchandizes” by false pretenses with intent to cheat or defraud. There originally was some doubt whether the false pretense statute reached any and all misrepresentations or was to be narrowly read. It was not until 1789 that the broader meaning was established. See Jerome Hall, Theft, Law and Society 45-52 (2d ed. 1952). In a false pretenses case, ownership of the property transfers, not merely possession.</p>
<p id="771c7e98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the meantime, the landmark case of The King v. Pear, decided in 1779, 1 Leach 212, 168 Eng. Rep. 208, created what came to be known as “larceny by trick” as a distinct form of common-law larceny where possession of property is obtained by trickery. The defendant was indicted for stealing Finch’s horse. Finch was a stablekeeper, and the defendant hired a horse from him, claiming he would return later that same day. In fact, he did not return but instead sold the horse. The following report of the case is taken from 168 Eng. Rep. 208:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771c7e99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The learned Judge said: There had been different opinions on the law of this class of cases; that the general doctrine then was that if a horse be let for a particular portion of time, and after that time is expired, the party hiring, <span title="1123" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1123">p. 1123</span>instead of returning the horse to its owner, sell it and convert the money to his own use, it is felony, because there is then no privity of contract subsisting between the parties. . . . He therefore left it with the Jury to consider, Whether the prisoner meant at the time of the hiring to take such journey, but was afterwards tempted to sell the horse? for if so he must be acquitted; but that if they were of opinion that at the time of the hiring the journey was a mere pretense to get the horse into his possession, and he had no intention to take such journey but intended to sell the horse, they would find that fact specially for the opinion of the Judges.</p>
<p id="771ca5aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Jury found that the facts above stated were true; and also that the prisoner had hired the horse with a fraudulent view and intention of selling it immediately.</p>
<p id="771ca5ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question was referred to the Judges, Whether the delivery of the horse by the prosecutor to the prisoner, had so far changed the possession of the property, as to render the subsequent conversion of it a mere breach of trust, or whether the conversion was felonious?</p>
<p id="771ca5ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Judges differed greatly in opinion on this case. . . . The majority of them thought, That the question, as to the original intention of the prisoner in hiring the horse, had been properly left to the jury; and as they had found, that his view in so doing was fraudulent, the parting with the property had not changed the nature of the possession, but that it remained unaltered in the prosecutor at the time of the conversion; and that the prisoner was therefore guilty of felony.</p>
</div>
<p id="771ca5ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court therefore relied on the notion that possession does not pass to a fraudulent bailee to stretch the concept of larceny to include an act otherwise not subject to proper criminal sanction. Jerome Hall, Theft, Law and Society 42 (2d ed. 1952).</p>
<p id="771ca5ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the false pretense statute was subsequently extended to all misrepresentations of fact, regardless of the technique of deception, there were two crimes, larceny by trick (a felony) and statutory false pretenses (only a misdemeanor), covering much the same conduct but distinguished on whether possession (larceny by trick) or ownership (false pretenses) was transferred.</p>

If the possession of such property is obtained by fraud, and the owner of it intends to part with his title as well as his possession, the offence is that of obtaining property by false pretenses, provided the means by which they are acquired are such as, in law, are false pretenses. If the possession is fraudulently obtained, with intent on the part of the person obtaining it, at the time he receives it, to convert the same to his own use, and the person parting with it intends to part with his possession merely, and not with his title to the property, the offence is larceny.</p>

<p id="771ccbd3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whoever shall feloniously take and carry away anything of value of the amount or value of $50 or upward, including things savoring of the realty, shall suffer imprisonment of not less than one nor more than ten years.</p>

<p id="771ccbd4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Interpreting this statute, this court has held that “one who obtains money from another upon the representation that he will perform certain service therewith for the latter, intending at the time to convert the money, and actually converting it, to his own use, is guilty of larceny.” In classic terminology, “the distinction drawn by the common law is between the case of one who gives up possession of a chattel for a special purpose to another who by converting it to his own use is held to have committed a trespass, and the case of one who, although induced by fraud or trick, nevertheless actually intends that title to the chattel shall pass to the wrongdoer.” United States v. Patton, 3 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 73, 76.</p>
<p id="771ccbd5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to appellant’s first contention, that under the evidence in the case the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant. We think this contention without merit. If the jury believed Gal’s testimony, and did not believe that of the defendant, it was possible for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant fraudulently induced Gal to give him $2,000 to be used for a special purpose, i.e., to bribe the police, that the defendant did not intend so to use the money, and converted it to his own use. Under the rule stated above, this would be larceny by trick.</p>
<p id="771ccbd6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus, in the <i>Means</i> case [Means v. United States, 65 F.2d 206], the defendant was convicted of the crime of larceny under the following circumstances: After the kidnapping of the infant son of Charles Lindbergh, the defendant in an interview with Mrs. McLean persuaded her that he could assist in locating and recovering the kidnapped baby, stating that if Mrs. McLean would give him $100,000 he would use that sum to pay the ransom and secure the return of the child. On the basis of these representations he secured the money from Mrs. McLean. His representations were fraudulent and he intended at the time to convert the money to his own use, and actually <span title="1126" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1126">p. 1126</span>so converted it. [U]nder these circumstances “title would remain in [the complainant] until the accomplishment of the purpose for which she gave [the defendant] the money.” . . .

<i>1. Gal’s intent.</i> How can the court defend its decision that Gal did not intend to pass his whole interest in the money to the defendant, title and all, when Gal himself testified that he gave the money to the defendant to be given to the police officer as a bribe? But if the court had held otherwise, thus precluding a larceny-by-trick conviction, could the defendant have been convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses? Note that a false <i>promise</i> is often regarded as inadequate to sustain a false pretense conviction, although it suffices for larceny by trick. See <i>People v. Ashley</i>, infra.</p>

<i>2. Possession versus ownership.</i> In Bourbonnaise v. State, 248 P.2d 640 (Okla. Crim. App. 1952), the defendant bootlegger obtained money from Bean as payment for a bottle of whiskey that defendant claimed he would buy from another bootlegger. He said he would return in 30 minutes with the bottle but never did. Affirming a conviction of larceny, the court stated (248 P.2d at 642):</p>

But here defendant . . . merely agreed to take Bean’s money and go purchase the liquor from another bootlegger. The money was not his. He was to pay it over for Bean.

<i>3. Problem.</i> The defendant went to a car dealership to purchase a new car and lied about her income and employment status on her credit application to finance the car’s purchase. Believing she had sufficient credit to finance the purchase, the car dealership gave her the keys to the car, and she drove away. When the dealership later realized the information on the credit form was false and no payments on the car had been made, it sought to get the car back, but the defendant refused. In defense to her theft charge, the defendant argued that the dealer transferred ownership to her and therefore she cannot be guilty of larceny by false pretenses. Is the case distinguishable from <i>Hufstetler</i>? See Divers v. State, 2015 WL 5968765 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Aug. 21, 2015).</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">TRAYNOR</span>, J. . . . [Defendant, the business manager of a corporation, was convicted of grand theft under §404 of the California Penal Code. Defendant <span title="1127" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1127">p. 1127</span>obtained a loan of $7,200 from an elderly woman, Mrs. Russ, by promising that the loan would be secured by a first mortgage on property owned by the corporation and that the money would be used to build a theater. In fact, the corporation leased but did not own the property, and no theater was ever built, the money having been used to meet the corporation’s operating expenses. After defendant received the money, Mrs. Russ quarreled with him over his failure to deliver the promised first mortgage. After it became apparent that the loan would not be paid, defendant requested an extension. Mrs. Russ granted the extension after defendant had threatened to kill himself if she refused, so that she might be paid from the proceeds of his life insurance policies.</p><p id="771cf2f3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendant also obtained $13,590 from a Mrs. Neal, representing that the corporation intended to use the money to buy a theater. She was initially told that the loan would be secured by a trust deed on the theater and that she would have good security for her loan because the corporation was worth a half million dollars. Subsequently, she loaned the corporation an additional $4,470. Mrs. Neal testified that when she hesitated in making the additional loan, defendant placed a gun on his desk and said: “Now look here, Mrs. Neal, I don’t want no monkey business out of you. Do you understand that?” The corporation did not buy the theater; Mrs. Neal never received the trust deed; and the money was deposited to the corporation’s account.]</p><p id="771cf2f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the crimes of larceny by trick and device and obtaining property by false pretenses are much alike, they are aimed at different criminal acquisitive techniques. Larceny by trick and device is the appropriation of property, the possession of which was fraudulently acquired; obtaining property by false pretenses is the fraudulent or deceitful acquisition of both title and possession. . . . In the present case, it is clear from the record that each of the prosecuting witnesses intended to pass both title and possession, and that the type of theft, if any, in each case, was that of obtaining property by false pretenses. [Defendant’s] defense was not based on distinctions between title and possession, but rather he contends that there was no unlawful taking of any sort.</p><p id="771cf2f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To support a conviction of theft for obtaining property by false pretenses, it must be shown that the defendant made a false pretense or representation with intent to defraud the owner of his property, and that the owner was in fact defrauded. It is unnecessary to prove that the defendant benefited personally from the fraudulent acquisition. The false pretense or representation must have materially influenced the owner to part with his property, but the false pretense need not be the sole inducing cause. If the conviction rests primarily on the testimony of a single witness that the false pretense was made, the making of the pretense must be corroborated. . . . 
</p><p id="771cf2f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[O]ur statute, like those of most American states, is directly traceable to 30 Geo. II, ch. 24, section 1. In an early Crown Case Reserved, Rex v. Goodhall, Russ. &amp; Ry. 461 (1821), the defendant obtained a quantity of meat from a merchant by promising to pay at a future day. The jury found that the promise was made without intention to perform. The judges concluded, however, that the defendant’s conviction was erroneous because the pretense “was merely a <span title="1128" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1128">p. 1128</span>promise of future conduct, and common prudence and caution would have prevented any injury arising from it.” . . . By stating that the “promise of future conduct” was such that “common prudence and caution” could prevent any injury arising therefrom, the new offense was confused with the old common law “cheat.” [This opinion] was completely misinterpreted in the case of Commonwealth v. Drew, 1837, 19 Pick. 179, 185, 36 Mass. 179, 185, in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts declared by way of dictum, that under the statute “naked lies” could not be regarded as “false pretences.” On the basis of these two questionable decisions, Wharton formulated the following generalization: “ . . . the false pretense to be within the statute, must relate to a state of things averred to be at the time existing, and not to a state of things thereafter to exist.” Wharton, American Criminal Law 542 [1st ed. 1846]. This generalization has been followed in the majority of American cases, almost all of which can be traced to reliance on Wharton or the two cases mentioned above.

Business affairs would be materially incumbered by the ever present threat that a debtor might be subjected to criminal penalties if the prosecutor and jury were of the view that at the time of borrowing he was mentally a cheat. The risk of prosecuting one who is guilty of nothing more than a failure or inability to pay his debts is a very real consideration. . . . ” Chaplin v.

 . . . We do not find this reasoning persuasive. In this state, and in the majority of American states as well as in England, false promises can provide the foundation of a civil action for deceit. In such actions something more than nonperformance is required to prove the defendant’s intent not to perform his promise. Nor is proof of nonperformance alone sufficient in criminal prosecutions based on false promises. In such prosecutions the People must . . . prove [the defendant’s fraudulent intent] beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Moreover, in cases of obtaining property by false pretenses, it must be proved that any misrepresentations of fact alleged by the People were made knowingly and with intent to deceive. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">SCHAUER</span>, J.

</p><p id="771cf2fd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a prosecution for obtaining property by the making of a false promise, knowingly and with intent to deceive, the matter to be proved . . . is purely subjective. It is not, like the specific intent in such a crime as burglary, a mere element of the crime; it is, in any significant sense, all of the crime. The proof will necessarily be of objective acts, entirely legal in themselves, from which inferences as to the ultimate illegal subjective fact will be drawn. But, whereas in burglary the proof of the subjective element is normally as strong and reliable as the proof of any objective element, in this type of activity the proof of such vital element can almost never be reliable; it must inevitably (in the absence of confession or something tantamount thereto) depend on inferences drawn by creditors, prosecutors, jurors, and judges from facts and circumstances which by reason of their nature cannot possibly exclude innocence with any certainty. . . . I am unwilling to accept as a premise the scholastic redaction of the majority that rules of proof may be set aside because appellate judges will always know when a jury has been misled and the proof is not sufficient. . . . 
</p><p id="771d1a0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the rule that the majority opinion now enunciates, no man, no matter how innocent his intention, can sign a promise to pay in the future, or to perform an act at a future date, without subjecting himself to the risk that at some later date others, in the light of differing perspectives, philosophies and subsequent events, may conclude that, after all, the accused <i>should</i> have known that at the future date he could not perform as he promised—and if he, as a “reasonable” man from the point of view of the creditor, district attorney and a grand or trial jury—<i>should</i> have known, then, it may be inferred, he did know. And if it can be inferred that he knew, then this court and other appellate courts will be bound to affirm a conviction. . . .

<i>1. False promises.</i> In accord with <i>Ashley</i>, see Commonwealth v. Parker, 564 A.2d 246 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989); Kennedy v. State, 342 S.E.2d 251 (W. Va. 1986). Some jurisdictions that allow false promises to form the basis of a theft charge will nonetheless rule the evidence to be legally insufficient if the breach of performance occurs after the taking instead of at the time of or prior to the taking of the property. Frazier v. State, 114 So. 3d 461 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013).

<i>2. Federal fraud statutes.</i> In its original 1872 enactment, the federal mail fraud statute criminalized use of the mails to advance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 356 (1987). Congress subsequently expanded the statute to cover an even wider range of conduct, and enacted the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. §1343, to proscribe fraud conducted over interstate telecommunications in addition to mail. The modern mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. §1341, reads:</p>

<p id="771d1a14-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The breadth of the mail fraud statute’s coverage to include false promises and “any scheme or artifice to defraud” that involves the use of federal mail—a sweeping expansion of federal jurisdiction over fraud—has led one federal prosecutor (and now federal judge) to call §1341 the white collar prosecutor’s “true love.” Jed S. Rakoff, The Federal Mail Fraud Statute (Part I), 18 Duq. L. Rev. 771, 771 (1980). Why might fraud statutes be more ambiguous than other criminal statutes? See Samuel W. Buell, Novel Criminal Fraud, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1971 (2006). Other aspects of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes are discussed beginning on p. 1161 infra. For a comprehensive overview, see Elizabeth Wagner Pittman, Mail and Wire Fraud, 47 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 797 (2010).</p>
<p id="771d1a15-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall Judge Schauer’s concern in dissent that an action based on false promises could potentially turn any breach of a promise into a crime. The federal statute by its terms makes no effort to police against such an outcome, but other statutory schemes use more care. Consider, for example, N.Y. Penal Law §155.05(2)(d), which makes clear that “the defendant’s intention or belief that the promise would not be performed may not be established by or inferred from the fact alone that such promise was not performed. Such a finding may be based only upon evidence establishing that the facts and circumstances of the case are wholly consistent with guilty intent or belief and wholly inconsistent with innocent intent or belief, and excluding to a moral certainty every hypothesis except that of the defendant’s intention or belief that the promise would not be performed. . . . ” Section 223.3(1) of the MPC similarly provides that “deception as to a person’s intention to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise.”</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">DANAHER</span>, J. This is an appeal from a conviction for obtaining goods by false pretenses in violation of D.C. Code §22-1301 (1951). The trial court entered judgment of acquittal on a second count charging grand larceny. Evidence was offered to show that appellant from time to time over a period of months, for purposes of resale, had purchased merchandise from Potomac Distributors. . . . By September 18, 1952, his account was said to be in arrears more than thirty days. Late that afternoon, appellant sought immediate possession of two television sets and a washing machine, displayed his customers’ purchase contracts to support his statement that he had already sold such merchandise and had taken payment therefor, and told one Schneider, secretary-treasurer of Potomac Distributors, “I promised delivery tonight.” Appellant was told no further credit could be extended to him because of his overdue indebtedness in excess of $1,800, whereupon appellant offered to give security for the desired items as well as for the delinquent account. He represented himself as the owner of a Packard car for which he had paid $4,260.50, but failed to disclose an outstanding prior indebtedness on the car of $3,028.08 secured by a chattel mortgage in favor of City Bank. Instead, he represented that he owed only one payment of some $55, not then due. Relying upon such representations, Potomac Distributors delivered to appellant two television sets each worth $136, taking in return a demand note for the entire indebtedness, past and present, in the total, $2,047.37, secured by a chattel mortgage on the Packard and the television sets. Appellant promised to make a cash payment on the note within a few days for default of which the holder was entitled to demand full payment. When the promised payment was not forthcoming, Schneider, by telephone calls and a personal visit to appellant’s home, sought to locate appellant but learned he had left town. The Packard about that time was in a collision, incurring damage of about $1,000, and was thereupon repossessed in behalf of the bank which held the prior lien for appellant’s car purchase indebtedness. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771d1a1c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant argues that Potomac Distributors could not have been defrauded for the car on September 18, 1952, “had an equity of between $900 and $1,000 and roughly five times the value of the two television sets.” That fact is immaterial. . . .

<p id="771d412d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This appellant has sold two television sets, and apparently had taken payment therefor although he had no television sets to deliver to his customers.

<span class="epub-small-caps">MILLER</span>, J. (dissenting). . . . Nelson did make a false representation; but the question is whether there was evidence from which the jury could properly be permitted to infer that he intended to defraud, and to conclude that Potomac was thereby defrauded. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771d4133-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Differing definitions of the word “defraud” probably cause the difference in opinion between the majority and me. They seem to think it means, in connection with a purchase, to make a false pretense in the process of obtaining goods even though the purchase price is well secured. I think the word means, in connection with a purchase, to make a false pretense as a result of which the seller is deprived of his goods or of the purchase price. . . . A purchaser can be said to have defrauded the seller of his goods only if he intended to defraud him of the purchase price for which the seller was willing to exchange them. It seems to me to follow that a purchaser who makes a false statement in buying on credit has not defrauded the seller of his goods if he nevertheless amply secures the debt. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771d4134-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In considering the criminality vel non of the false statement, it must be remembered that the past due indebtedness of $1,697.87 is to play no part. That credit had already been extended generally, and with respect to it Potomac parted with nothing on September 18. Nelson was only charged with defrauding Potomac by obtaining through false pretense the articles then delivered, which had a total value of only $349.50.</p>
<p id="771d4135-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What was the actual value on September 18 of the property upon which Potomac took a lien, on the strength of which it parted with property worth $349.50? The bank collection manager, testifying for the Government, said that although on September 18 Nelson still owed the bank $3,028.08, he had on that day an equity in the car worth from $900 to $1,000. The mortgaged <span title="1133" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1133">p. 1133</span>television sets were, I suppose, worth their price of $272. Adding to this the minimum equity in the automobile proved by the prosecution, it appears that Potomac had a lien on property worth at least $1,172 to protect a debt of $349.50. The proportion was more than three to one.</p>
<p id="771d4136-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such is the evidence as to what happened September 18, from which the jury was permitted to infer that Nelson then intended to defraud. [I]t is wholly irrational to presume or infer that one intends to defraud when he buys goods on credit and safeguards that credit by giving more than triple security for it—no matter if he does falsely pretend that the security is even greater. It is equally illogical to conclude that the creditor was thereby defrauded. For that reason, my opinion is that the proof I have outlined—which was the only pertinent proof—did not warrant the trial court in submitting the case to the jury. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771d4137-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nelson was guilty of a moral wrong in falsely and grossly misrepresenting his debt to the bank, but in the circumstances he should not have been indicted and convicted because of it. The . . . statute under which he was prosecuted does not make mere falsehood felonious; it only denounces as criminal a false pretense which was intended to defraud and which in fact had that result. Even a liar is entitled to the full protection of the law. I am afraid a grave injustice has been done in this case.</p>

Regent Office Supply Co., 421 F.2d 1174 (2d Cir. 1970), the defendant company sold business supplies through agents who solicited orders by telephone. In order to get secretaries to put their calls through to the purchasing agents of potential customers, and in order to get the purchasing agents to listen to their pitch, Regent’s sales agents told secretaries and purchasing agents a variety of lies, stating, for example, that they had been referred by one of the customer company’s officers or that they had a large volume of supplies that needed to be disposed of because of the death of another customer. These tactics generated a substantial volume of sales, but there was no claim that the merchandise sold by Regent was in any way unacceptable to the purchasers. The government conceded that sales agents always discussed the price and quality of the merchandise honestly, and that customers were free to return any goods found to be unsatisfactory.</p>

Apart from these facts, no customer is pressured to buy a condo, customers who do sign a purchase contract are given the right to revoke it within 30 days (with a full refund of their deposit), and no customer who made a purchase has expressed any regret.

There is nothing in the statute that requires such a restricted meaning of the word ‘accuse’; and to restrict it thus, would well nigh destroy the efficacy of the act.”</p>

<p id="771d8f77-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the time of the writing, the respondent was undecided whether to advise his client to seek “informer fees.” One of the advantages tendered to Morin for a “quiet” and “undamaging” divorce is an “absolute undertaking” on the part of the respondent’s client not to inform against him in any way. The Internal Revenue Service, the United States Customs Service and other governmental agencies are suggested as being interested in such information. Quite clearly, these veiled threats exceeded the limits of the respondent’s representation of his client in the divorce action. Although these matters were not specified in the indictment, they have a competent bearing on the question of intent.</p>
<p id="771d8f78-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from this, the advancement of his client’s claim to the marital property, however well founded, does not afford legal cause for the trial court to direct a verdict of acquittal in the background and context of his letter to Morin. A demand for settlement of a civil action, accompanied by a malicious threat to expose the wrongdoer’s criminal conduct, if made with intent to extort payment, against his will, constitutes the crime alleged in the indictment.</p>
<p id="771d8f79-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence at hand establishes beyond dispute the respondent’s participation was done with preconceived design. The incriminating evidence which his letter threatens to expose was wilfully contrived and procured by a temptress hired for that purpose. These factors in the proof are sufficient to sustain a finding that the respondent acted maliciously and without just cause, within the meaning of our criminal statutes. The sum of the evidence supports the further inference that the act was done with intent to extort a substantial contingent fee to the respondent’s personal advantage. . . . The evidence of guilt is ample to support the verdict and the trial was free from errors in law.</p>

Any time a cause of action involves behavior that is either criminal or embarrassing, a threat to bring the action would be extortionate. Obviously this would effectively preclude many lawyer demand letters. Anomalously, it would be permissible to destroy reputation by bringing suit but not to allow the defendant to avoid that destruction by paying the claim. Not only would this mean a net loss to the privacy that the extortion statute is, in part, aimed at protecting, but it would also involve significantly expanded litigation costs and burdens on efficient utilization of judicial resources.

<i>4. Victims who threaten lawsuits.</i> Should what Harrington did be considered a crime, or merely aggressive advancement of his client’s interests? Consider Rex v. Dymond, [1920] 2 K.B. 260, where defendant, who had been sexually assaulted, demanded that her attacker pay her reparations upon threat of “let[ting] the town knowed all about your going on.” Glanville Williams criticized her conviction for blackmail:</p>

Dymond was an illiterate girl, trying to obtain what she may have believed to be her rights without legal aid. Had she the [money] . . . with which to consult a solicitor, instead of writing herself, he would have written a letter to the [attacker] on her behalf in something like the following terms. “Dear Sir, We have been consulted by . . . who states that . . . Our client claims . . . compensation for the wrong committed against her, and unless we have your cheque for [the requested] amount we are instructed to commence legal proceedings against you.” Such a letter would not constitute a criminal offense.</p>

Williams suggests that had Dymond simply hired a lawyer who threatened to sue, the resulting settlement would not be subject to criminal sanction. But can a threat to sue sometimes be extortionate? The answer turns on statutory <span title="1139" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1139">p. 1139</span>construction. In State v. Rendelman, 947 A.2d 546, 547 (Md. 2008), the Maryland high court held that threats of litigation were not “wrongful” within the meaning of the state extortion statute, regardless of bad faith or legal merit. But in State v. Hynes, 978 A.2d 264, 271, 275 (N.H. 2009), the New Hampshire high court distinguished <i>Rendelman</i> because its state extortion statute did not require “wrongful” means, but rather a comparison of the harm to the recipient against the benefit to the threatener. Under the analysis in <i>Hynes</i>, a threat to sue can be extortion if it fails to provide “actual advantage that is real and definite.” Like <i>Rendelman</i>, the federal extortion statute, 18 U.S.C. §1951, requires “wrongful” conduct, but as may be expected, determining what is “wrongful” is a matter of continuing dispute. See United States v. Pendergraft, 297 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>

<i>5.  Statutory variation.</i> Blackmail (often termed extortion) statutes vary a great deal. A useful review may be found in the Commentaries to Model Penal Code §223.4 at 201-224 (1980). There are important variations in the types of threats required. Threats of personal and property injury or to accuse of crime are always enough. Also commonly included are threats to make disclosures that would defame the victim. But how about threats to expose matters that are not defamatory? Some statutes include threats of this nature. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code §519 (2016) (threats to expose any secret affecting the victim); Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 720, 5/15-5 (2016) (threats to reveal any information sought to be concealed by the victim). The MPC would seem to exclude such threats, unless they are picked up in the catchall provision that includes “any other harm which would not benefit the actor.” Should they be excluded?</p>
<p id="771db69b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutes also vary in how they define what the blackmailer seeks to obtain by his threats. Many statutes, like the MPC, limit the purpose of the threats to obtaining property or other things of value and rely on other code provisions to deal with the use of coercive threats to obtain other benefits for the person who threatens. See, e.g., Model Penal Code §212.5 (criminal coercion offense that covers threats made with the “purpose unlawfully to restrict another’s freedom of action to his detriment”). Some statutes, on the other hand, define the object of the threat more comprehensively. E.g., Minn. Penal Code §609.27 (2016) (threats that cause another against his will to do any act or forbear doing a lawful act).</p>
<p id="771db69c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should blackmail extend beyond using threats to obtain the property of someone else? Consider the case of Toby the bunny. Toby’s owner posted pictures of Toby on his website and announced that he would kill and eat Toby unless his website’s readers sent $50,000 to save Toby’s life. Should the criminal law recognize a form of blackmail that includes the destruction of one’s own property under certain circumstances? What social interest would such a statute serve? Would it punish conduct that should not be criminalized? For an affirmative argument, see Stephen E. Sachs, Comment, Saving Toby: Extortion, Blackmail, and the Right to Destroy, 24 Yale L. &amp; Pol’y Rev. 251 (2006).</p>

<i>6. First Amendment concerns.</i> A constituent sent an e-mail to a state senator saying the senator should “get that bill heard or I will make sure <span title="1140" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1140">p. 1140</span>you regret not doing it” by “mak[ing] you the laughing stock of the Senate” and “dig[ging] into your past, your family, your associates and once we start on you there will be no end to it.” The constituent was charged with blackmail under the state law and argued in defense that the e-mail contained constitutionally protected speech. The reviewing court held that the state law was unconstitutional as applied to that case, finding the e-mail to be “the kind of vehement, caustic and unpleasantly sharp political speech protected by the First Amendment.” Gerhart v. State, 360 P.3d 1194 (Okla. Crim. App. 2015). The court stated the result would have been different if the e-mail threatened to accuse the senator of a crime or stated specific conduct that the constituent would make public. See id. at 1199. Why should the level of specificity determine when the line is crossed from protected speech to blackmail?</p>

<p id="771db6a4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant Fichtner is the manager, and defendant McGuinness the assistant manager, of the Hill Supermarket. . . . [Defendants were charged] with the crime of extortion in that on January 18, 1951, defendants, aiding and abetting each other, obtained $25 from one Smith, with his consent, which consent defendants induced by a wrongful use of fear by threatening to accuse Smith of the crime of petit larceny, and to expose and impute to him a disgrace unless Smith paid them $25.</p>
<p id="771db6a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Smith testified that on January 18, 1951, he purchased a number of articles in the Hill store for a total of about $12, but left the store without paying for a fifty-three-cent jar of coffee, which he had concealed in his pocket. After Smith left the store he returned at defendant Fichtner’s request. Defendants then threatened to call a policeman, to arrest Smith for petit larceny, with resulting publicity in the newspapers and over the radio, unless he paid $75 and signed a paper admitting that during the course of several months he had unlawfully taken merchandise from the store in that amount. Although Smith admitted he had shopped in Hill’s [stores for years and on numerous occasions], he insisted that the only merchandise he had ever stolen was the fifty-three-cent jar of coffee on the evening in question, and a sixty-five-cent roll of bologna one week previously. However, he finally signed the paper admitting that he <span title="1141" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1141">p. 1141</span>had unlawfully taken $50 worth of merchandise from the store during a period of four months. That evening Smith paid $25 in cash and promised to pay the balance in weekly installments of $5. He testified he was induced to sign the paper and make the payment because defendants threatened to accuse him of petit larceny and to expose him to the disgrace of the criminal charge and the resulting publicity. It is not disputed that the $25 taken from Smith was “rung up” on the store register; that the money went into the company funds and that defendants received no part of the money. During the following week Smith reported the incident to the police, and defendants were arrested on January 25, 1951, when Smith, accompanied by a detective, returned to the store and paid the first $5 installment.</p>
<p id="771dddb6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendants testified that over the course of several weeks, they saw Smith steal merchandise amounting to $5.61, and they honestly believed that during the several months that Smith had been shopping, he had stolen merchandise of the value of $75; that on January 18, 1951, Smith freely admitted that during the four-month period he stole merchandise of the value of $50, and that he voluntarily signed the paper admitting thefts in that amount; that on that date he paid $25 on account and promised to pay the balance in weekly installments.</p>
<p id="771dddb7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That the Smith incident was not an isolated one, but rather part of a course of conduct pursued by defendants, even after warning by the police to discontinue the practice, was not only clearly established but admitted by defendant Fichtner. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771dddb8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In my opinion, the verdict is amply supported by the evidence. Implicit in the verdict is a finding that Smith stole only $1.18 in merchandise as he admitted, or at most the $5.61 which defendants claimed they actually saw him steal, and that he was induced to pay the $25 on January 18, 1951, by defendants’ threats to accuse him of crime and to expose him to disgrace. By its verdict, the jury rejected defendants’ contention that Smith voluntarily admitted having stolen $50 worth of merchandise and that they demanded from Smith only what was rightfully due.</p>

 . . . [W]e believe that the portion of the main charge to the effect that, under the circumstances of this case, extortion is committed only when one obtains property from another by inducing fear in that other by threatening to accuse him of crime unless he pays an amount over and above what was rightfully due was more favorable to defendants than that which they were entitled to receive. In our opinion, the extortion statutes were intended to prevent the collection of money by the use of fear induced by means of threats to accuse a debtor of crime, and it makes no difference whether the debtor stole any goods, nor how much he stole, and that defendants may properly be convicted even <span title="1142" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1142">p. 1142</span>though they believed that the complainant was guilty of the theft of their employer’s goods in an amount either equal to or less, or greater than any sum of money obtained from the complainant. Nor is defendants’ good faith in thus enforcing payment of the money alleged to be due to their employer a defense. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771dddbc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The law does not authorize the collection of just debts by threatening to accuse the debtor of crime, even though the complainant is in fact guilty of the crime. In my opinion, it makes no difference whether the indebtedness for which a defendant demands repayment is one arising out of the crime for the prosecution of which he threatens the complainant, or is entirely independent and having no connection with the crime which forms the basis of the accusation. The result in both cases is the concealment and compounding of a felony to the injury of the State. It is that result which the extortion statutes were intended to prevent.</p>

[T]he jury was permitted to convict defendants of the crime of extortion on proof that they had induced complainant, by the threats alleged, to pay to defendants more than he rightfully owed for goods which he had stolen, even though defendants might have honestly believed that the amount demanded from complainant was the amount which he rightfully owed. In my opinion, although the question is one as to which there is a conflict of authority, if defendants, acting without malice and in good faith, made an honest mistake, they were not guilty of the crime charged. There would then be no criminal intent. The defendants were not acting in their own behalf but in that of their employer, in recovering what they believed to be rightfully due it. . . .

[T]he heart of the problem is that two separate acts, each of which is a moral and legal right, can combine to make a moral and legal wrong. For example, if I threaten to expose a criminal act unless I am paid money, I have committed blackmail. Or if I threaten to expose a sexual affair unless I am given a job, once again I have committed blackmail. I have a legal right to expose or threaten to expose the crime or affair, and I have a legal right to seek a job or money, but if I combine these rights it is blackmail.

In that case, some people would be deterred from engaging in embarrassing (but lawful) conduct, while some others who were undeterred would find that their business or social acquaintances or family were informed of their activity. Neither such deterrence nor such information can be counted as a good in many situations, however. These particularly include social and family relations in which the concern of one individual for another is altruistic rather than self-interested; i.e., where one might be distressed to learn another’s secret, but was not harmed by ignorance of it. It is precisely these relationships that are threatened with disruption by the prototypical blackmail threat, and that would be protected by an economically rational law. The general principle of the Model Penal Code closely approximates this result by prohibiting threats that it would not benefit the actor to carry out.</p></div>

Berman, The Evidentiary Theory of Blackmail: Taking Motives Seriously, 65 U. Chi. L. Rev. 795 (1998). Professor Berman argues that none of these efforts provides a persuasive account of why blackmail is a crime. He notes, however, that unconditional disclosure of information ordinarily is not illegal because it may be done for legitimate reasons. In contrast, he argues, a conditional threat to disclose (in the event of nonpayment) is made illegal because it provides strong evidence that any disclosure would be morally blameworthy—“the actor would be inflicting harm knowingly and without good motives.” Id. at 848. An empirical study of subjects’ intuitions about hypothetical blackmail scenarios suggests that Berman’s account of blackmail most closely mirrors people’s moral intuitions about when threats should be criminalized. Paul H. Robinson et al., Competing Theories of Blackmail: An Empirical Research Critique of Criminal Law Theory, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 291, 339-340 (2010). There is strong evidence that people draw sharp moral distinctions between threats that are unlawful and those that are not unlawful, even though many blackmail laws often include both kinds of threats.

<p id="771e5312-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insofar as the pattern of discrete theft offenses covering fundamentally similar kinds of acquisitive conduct has left gaps in the law, only legislative or judicial revision of the definitions of criminal conduct can supply an effective remedy. Another and more direct consequence of this condition of the law of theft is procedural in character. A defendant convicted of one of these theft offenses, say, embezzlement, may be able to obtain a reversal on appeal through the curious device of proving that the evidence technically established another offense, say, larceny. See, e.g., <i>Nolan v. State</i>, p. 1109 supra. This possibility is a constant threat to the efficient administration of criminal justice. Yet the distinctions between many of the separate theft offenses (1) are without criminological significance, and (2) turn on highly technical legal characterizations of basically similar fact situations rather than real differences in conduct, so that in many cases a defendant is not likely to be prejudiced (though he may be) by a variance between charge and proof.</p>

<p id="771ea161-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The source of the false pretenses statute in this country is the common law and the statute law of England. The English courts hold that the thing obtained must be the subject of larceny at common law, and accordingly a conviction for obtaining two dogs by false pretenses was quashed because at common law dog stealing is not larceny; so likewise of an indictment for obtaining food and lodging by false pretenses. Under statutes like ours many of the courts of this country take the same view of the law. The California statute covers “money or property.” Pen. Code, §532. The court in People v. Cummings, 46 P. 284, in holding that the word “property” did not include real property [relied on the fact that real property was not recognized under the English law as the subject of false pretenses.] . . .

<p id="771ea162-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It should be observed at this point that our statute in respect of the present question is not as broad as those in some of the other states. It reads “any money or property whatsoever.” In some of the states, as stated in Burdick [Law of Crime], 481, §640, the statutes, “after enumerating various classes of personal property, conclude the list with what is apparently intended as an all inclusive term, such as ‘other things of value,’ ‘any other valuable thing,’ or ‘any other valuable thing or effects whatsoever.’” The Kansas statute includes “any money, personal property, right in action, or any other valuable thing or effects whatsoever.” G.S. 1949, 21-551. Notwithstanding the comprehensiveness of this provision, the [Kansas] court held, in the light of the origin and history of the crime of false pretenses, that obtaining an extension of time in which to pay a matured debt was not a “valuable thing” within the meaning of the section. [State v. Tower, 251 Pac. 401.] The term “personal property” was said “to denote personal movable things generally.” “Mere pecuniary advantage, devoid of any physical attribute of money, chattel, or valuable security, in the sense of the English statute, was not included.”</p>

But such privilege or advantage is neither money nor property in the sense those terms are ordinarily used and understood.” The court further said: “‘Property’ . . . means worldly goods or possessions, tangible things, and things which have an exchangeable or commercial value.” . . .

<p id="771ec879-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The state’s argument of “policy” that the public are entitled to the protection of the law against immoral and reprehensible conduct such as that with which the accused was charged, and of which, no doubt, he was guilty, is appealing, but should be addressed to the legislature, not to the courts. The legislature has not undertaken to make every fraud a crime, but has set boundaries around the crime of false pretenses which the courts must respect and have no authority to pass. . . .

<i>1. The traditional approach.</i> The Supreme Court took a similar approach to the <i>Miller</i> court when it faced the question whether the defendant, a partner in an investment firm, was guilty of extortion under the Hobbs Act for threatening to expose an affair by the general counsel of a retirement fund if the general counsel did not change his recommendation against investing in the defendant’s firm. The Court concluded that the recommendation of an investment was not “property” because “[t]he property extorted must . . . be <i>transferable</i>—that is, capable of passing from one person to another.” Sekhar v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2720 (2013).</p>

<i>3. Theft of services.</i> In Chappell v. United States, 270 F.2d 274 (9th Cir. 1959), the defendant, an Air Force sergeant, was convicted of knowingly converting property of the United States by making use of the services and <span title="1150" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1150">p. 1150</span>labor of an airman to paint his own private dwellings during the airman’s on-duty hours. The statute, 18 U.S.C. §641, making it criminal to knowingly convert to one’s own use anything of value of the United States, was construed as intending no such revolutionary change in the common law as would be entailed, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, in holding that an employee’s services were property that could be stolen. The conviction was reversed.</p>
<p id="771ec880-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion in a case involving a professor who used the services of a research assistant, paid for out of his grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, to perform work for him on a research contract unrelated to his EPA grant. United States v. Croft, 750 F.2d 1354 (7th Cir. 1984). Affirming his conviction under 18 U.S.C. §641, the court held that the section is designed to punish “intentional conduct by which a person either misappropriates or obtains a wrongful advantage from government property,” and that the defendant “obtained a wrongful advantage by converting and misappropriating the services of [the assistant] for his personal research project while allowing those services to be paid for by the EPA.” Id. at 1362. In United States v. Schwartz, 785 F.2d 673, 681 n.4 (9th Cir. 1986), the Ninth Circuit expressed agreement with <i>Croft</i> and overruled its earlier decision in <i>Chappell.</i> For a criticism of such results as an unwarranted judicial extension of a statute concerned with traditional property offenses, see Ralph G. Picardi, Comment, Theft of Employee Services Under the United States Penal Code, 23 San Diego L. Rev. 897 (1986).</p>
<p id="771ec881-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to theft of services, see MPC §223.7, Appendix. Under Ill. Comp. Stat. ch. 720, 5/16-3 (2016), a person commits theft of services when he obtains “labor or services of another which are available only for hire, by means of threat or deception or knowing that such use is without the consent of the person providing the . . . labor or services.” In People v. Davis, 561 N.E.2d 165 (Ill. 1990), the defendants were city officials who were supervising a construction project being performed for the city by an independent contractor. They were responsible for giving job assignments to the contractor’s employees when the employees reported for work. The defendants asked several of the employees to participate in political campaigning instead of working on the construction project. The employees willingly agreed to do so, but their employer was not aware of the arrangement and lost the value of their services. Are the defendants guilty of theft under the Illinois statute? The court held in the negative. Was there any way, under this statute, to support the opposite result? The Illinois Supreme Court thought so, overruling <i>Davis</i> in People v. Perry, 864 N.E.2d 196 (Ill. 2007).</p>

<i>4. Theft of use of property.</i> In State v. McGraw, 480 N.E.2d 552 (Ind. 1985), a city employee used a city computer and services for his personal business and was convicted of theft under Ind. Code §35-43-4-2: “A person who knowingly or intentionally exerts unauthorized control over property of another person, with intent to deprive the other person of its value or use, commits theft. . . . ” It appeared that the defendant’s unauthorized use cost the city nothing, since the computer service was leased at a fixed charge and the <span title="1151" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1151">p. 1151</span>tapes and discs he had used could be erased and reused. The court held that these facts could not support a conviction, even assuming arguendo that the use of the computer was “property” under the theft statute. The court reasoned that the city was not deprived of any part of the value or use of the property. The court said: “Defendant has likened his conduct to the use of an employer’s vacant bookshelf, for the temporary storage of one’s personal items, and to the use of an employer’s telephone facilities for toll-free calls. The analogies appear to us to be appropriate.” Id. at 554.</p>

<i>(b)</i> How should courts treat the unauthorized use of real property? Unbeknownst to a homeowner who vacated her house and put it up for sale, defendant moved in and lived there for six months. He was discovered when a bank bought the home at a foreclosure sale. The defendant was convicted of theft under a Maryland law, and the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the conviction because the definition of “property” in Maryland includes real estate. Hobby v. State, 436 Md. 526 (2014). Other courts have interpreted their state statutes differently. E.g., Sheffield v. State, 708 So. 2d 899 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997). In a case like <i>Hobby</i>, how should one value the amount of the theft? The state argued the value should be the total fair market value of the house. The reviewing court disagreed and relied on the fair market rental value of the home during the period the defendant used it.</p>
<p id="771ec885-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> How should the law treat the unauthorized use, termed “joyriding,” of unsecured wireless networks? Consider the case of Benjamin Smith, who was arrested and charged after twice parking his SUV outside a stranger’s house in order to access the Internet. See Matthew Bierlein, Policing the Wireless World: Access Liability in the Open Wi-Fi Era, 67 Ohio St. L.J. 1123, 1123-1125 (2006). New York criminal law makes it a misdemeanor to “knowingly use[], cause[] to be used, or access . . . a computer network without authorization,” N.Y. Penal Law §156.05 (2016), and defines “without authorization” to mean that the criminal defendant either knew she lacked permission to access the network or that the defendant knowingly circumvented an installed security measure. See, e.g., People v. Klapper, 902 N.Y.S.2d 305, 309 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2010). Could a prosecutor show that Smith knew he lacked permission to access the network by virtue of the fact that Smith had no preexisting relationship with the resident of the house? Should the default rule be that one acts without authorization whenever there is no affirmative grant of permission? Or should the doctrine of consent protect the joyrider if the resident of the house could have easily set up the wireless network with password protection but chose not to apply any security settings? And does the consent problem change if the joyrider’s operating system is configured to connect automatically to unsecured networks? Who is the victim of the potential theft—the resident who set up the unsecured network or the Internet Service Provider (ISP) who is likely missing out on additional subscription revenues? See S. Gregory Herman, One or More Wireless Networks Are Available: Can ISPs Recover for Unauthorized Wi-Fi Use Under Cable Television Piracy Laws?, 55 Cath. U. L. Rev. 1095 (2006).</p>

<i>5. Sex as property.</i> Recall that false representations to obtain sex generally cannot be the basis for criminal liability, pp. 407-413 supra. Courts that have rejected sex as “property” under federal extortion statutes have focused on the fact that a sexual act is not an “alienable economic or contractual right that carries forward into the future.” United States v. Warme, 2010 WL 125846 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2010). Is this the right definition of property for purposes of criminal law and its coverage? Would the same result occur in a prosecution for fraud?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">VAN GRAAFEILAND</span>, J. Appellants have appealed from judgments convicting them of the unauthorized sale of government property (18 U.S.C. §641) and of conspiring to accomplish the sale (18 U.S.C. §371). . . . 
</p><p id="771eef9e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In May 1977, appellant Lambert was an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Girard was a former agent. During that month, Girard and one James Bond began to discuss a proposed illegal venture that involved smuggling a planeload of marijuana from Mexico into the United States. Girard told Bond that for $500 per name he could, through an inside source, secure reports from the DEA files that would show whether any participant in the proposed operation was a government informant. Unfortunately for Mr. Girard, Bond himself became an informant and disclosed his conversations with Girard to the DEA. . . . Bond asked Girard to secure reports on four men whose names were furnished him by DEA agents. DEA records are kept in computerized files, and the DEA hoped to identify the inside source by monitoring access to the four names in the computer bank. In this manner, the DEA learned that Girard’s informant was Lambert, who obtained the reports through a computer terminal located in his office. The convictions . . . are based on the sale of this information.</p><p id="771eef9f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 641, so far as pertinent, provides that whoever without authority sells any “record . . . or thing of value” of the United States or who “receives . . . the same with intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted,” shall be guilty of a crime. Appellants contend that the statute covers only tangible property or documents and therefore is not violated by the sale of information. [The district court rejected this argument, and we agree.]</p><p id="771eefa0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]e are impressed by Congress’ repeated use of the phrase “thing of value” in section 641 and its predecessors. These words are found in so many criminal statutes throughout the United States that they have in a sense become words of art. The word “thing” notwithstanding, the phrase is generally construed to cover intangibles as well as tangibles. For example, <span title="1153" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1153">p. 1153</span>amusement is held to be a thing of value under gambling statutes. Sexual intercourse, or the promise of sexual intercourse, is a thing of value under a bribery statute. So also are a promise to reinstate an employee and an agreement not to run in a primary election. The testimony of a witness is a thing of value under 18 U.S.C. §876. . . . 
</p><p id="771eefa1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of a property in the contents of unpublished writings was judicially recognized long before the advent of copyright laws. . . . Although we are not concerned here with the laws of copyright, we are satisfied, nonetheless, that the Government has a property interest in certain of its private records which it may protect by statute as a thing of value. It has done this by the enactment of section 641. [If] conversion is the “misuse or abuse of property” or its use “in an unauthorized manner,” the defendants herein could properly be found to have converted DEA’s computerized records.</p><p id="771eefa2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The District Judge also rejected appellants’ constitutional challenge to section 641 based upon alleged vagueness and overbreadth, and again we agree with his ruling. Appellants, at the time of the crime a current and a former employee of the DEA, must have known that the sale of DEA confidential law enforcement records was prohibited. The DEA’s own rules and regulations forbidding such disclosure may be considered as both a delimitation and a clarification of the conduct proscribed by the statute. Where, as here, we are not dealing with defendants’ exercise of a First Amendment freedom, we should not search for statutory vagueness that did not exist for the defendants themselves. Neither should we find a constitutional infirmity simply because the statute might conceivably trespass upon the First Amendment rights of others. In view of the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep in regulating conduct, . . . any overbreadth that may exist [can] be cured on a case by case basis. . . .

<i>1. An Official Secrets Act?</i> Anthony Lewis of the <i>New York Times</i> had some harsh things to say about such an interpretation of §641. Speaking about the same theory sanctioned by a federal trial court in another case, he said (Whisper Who Dares, N.Y. Times, June 19, 1978, at A19):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771eefa7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two men were charged—and convicted—under Section 641. . . . What was the property? The Justice Department said it was information, and Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. followed that view of the law when he charged the jury.</p>
<p id="771eefa8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Information may be government property,” the judge said, “apart from the document or the sheets of paper themselves.” Thus it does not matter if the original government document remains in the files. Anyone who copies it or makes notes from it without official approval has still stolen “property.”</p>
<p id="771eefa9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For advocates of secrecy, the beauty of that legal theory is that it applies no matter what kind of government information is involved.

<i>2. Copies.</i> In United States v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389 (2d Cir. 1966), the defendants purchased documents, for ultimate exportation to Europe, from several former employees of Lederle Laboratories, knowing that the employees had temporarily removed and copied the documents. The documents described secret processes for manufacturing antibiotics. The court upheld their convictions on a charge of violating 18 U.S.C. §2314, which prohibits transporting in interstate or foreign commerce “any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.” The court, per Judge Henry Friendly, said (id. at 393-394):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771f15bc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The serious question is whether, on the facts of this case, the papers showing Lederle processes . . . were “goods” which had been “stolen, converted or taken by fraud” in view of the lack of proof that any of the physical materials so transported came from Lederle’s possession. The standard procedure was for [the defendants] to remove documents from Lederle’s files . . . take these . . . home within New York state, make photocopies, microfilms or notes, and then restore the purloined papers to the files; only the copies and notes moved or were intended to move in interstate or foreign commerce. . . . 
</p>
<p id="771f15bd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To be sure, where no tangible objects were ever taken or transported, a court would be hard pressed to conclude that “goods” had been stolen and transported within the meaning of §2314; the statute would presumably not extend to the case where a carefully guarded secret formula was memorized, carried away in the recesses of a thievish mind and placed in writing only after a boundary had been crossed. The situation, however, is quite different where tangible goods are stolen and transported and the only obstacle to condemnation is a clever intermediate transcription or use of a photocopy machine. In such a case, when the physical form of the stolen goods is secondary in every respect to the matter recorded in them, the transformation of the information in the stolen papers into a tangible object never possessed by the original owner should be deemed immaterial. It would offend common sense to hold that these defendants fall outside the statute simply because, in efforts to avoid detection, their confederates were at pains to restore the original papers to Lederle’s files and transport only copies or notes, although an oversight would have brought them within it.</p>
</div>
<p id="771f15be-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the same logic apply when, instead of making photocopies of documents, someone makes digital copies of digital files? Consider the facts in United States v. Zhang, 995 F. Supp. 2d 340 (E.D. Pa. 2014). Zhang worked as a computer systems manager for a company and copied thousands of confidential digital files from the company to his desktop computer and then ultimately to storage websites overseas. Like the defendants in <i>Bottone</i>, Zhang was <span title="1155" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1155">p. 1155</span>charged with violating 18 U.S.C. §2314. But unlike the defendants in <i>Bottone</i>, Zhang’s charges were dismissed because the court held that the statute does not cover the theft of intangible property in an intangible form. The court found the statute to be ambiguous (and noted other courts have read it not to require a tangibility requirement), but it concluded that, pursuant to the rule of lenity, it had to read it in favor of the defendant.</p>

<i>(a) </i>Jones was visiting the United States Attorney’s office when he overheard conversations between government personnel concerning an ongoing criminal investigation of an employee at Barclays Bank. The conversations took place in a reception area and in an individual office. Jones subsequently told officials at Barclays that he had information relating to a criminal investigation and offered to sell it to them for $100; ultimately he received $60 for revealing what he knew. The court held that these facts were sufficient to support an indictment for larceny under 18 U.S.C. §641. United States v. Jones, 677 F. Supp. 238 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Do you agree?</p>

<i>(b) </i>Dreiman repeatedly called and harassed his ex-girlfriend. In defense she obtained an unlisted telephone number. Dreiman then broke into her trailer, so that he could copy down the unlisted number. He was convicted of burglary, on the theory that he had entered with the intent to commit a crime (larceny). The court held that copying the unlisted number constituted larceny, and it therefore upheld the burglary conviction. Dreiman v. State, 825 P.2d 758 (Wyo. 1992). Is the result sound? If so, does the same principle justify the results in <i>Girard</i> and <i>Jones</i>, or are those situations distinguishable?</p>

<i>(c) </i>While making repairs in a woman’s apartment, the defendant picked up intimate photographs he found in her bedroom, scanned them into his computer, and quickly returned the photographs to their original location. Though he obviously borrowed the photographs temporarily, did he permanently take any “property of another”? Of what, if anything, did he deprive the victim? See State v. Nelson, 842 A.2d 83 (N.H. 2004).</p>

<i>5. Statutory interpretation.</i> The criminality of dishonest appropriation can depend on distinctions in statutory wording. The statute involved in <i>Girard</i>, 18 U.S.C. §641, broadly protects tangible and intangible property, including any “record . . . or thing of value,” but the property involved must belong to the U.S. government. Taking information from a private firm may or may not violate state laws against theft, depending on the extent to which those laws protect intangibles. The statute involved in <i>Bottone</i>, 18 U.S.C. §2314, may apply, but that statute only protects “goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money.” To take another example, a computer password is protected by an Oregon statute that punishes “theft of proprietary information,” State v. Schwartz, 21 P.3d 1128 (Or. Ct. App. 2001). A PIN code is considered “property” under California laws prohibiting extortion. People v. Kozlowski, 96 Cal. App. 4th 853 (2002). But a similar password does not qualify as “goods, wares [or] merchandise” protected under §2314; in United States v. Stafford, 136 F.3d 1109, 1115 (7th Cir. 1998), the court said: “Given the [1934] statute’s age . . . and wording, and the principle that the definition of federal crimes is a legislative rather than a judicial function . . . we don’t think the [wording] of section 2314 will stretch this far.” For examination of these issues, see Geraldine Szott Moohr, Federal Criminal Fraud and the Development of Intangible Property Rights in Information, 2000 U. Ill. L. Rev. 683.</p>

<span title="1157" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1157">p. 1157</span>The limits of statutory language were on display when prosecutors tried to secure a conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer. Aleynikov copied Goldman’s computer source code for high-frequency trading and later used it in a new job at a different firm. The Second Circuit reversed Aleynikov’s federal conviction under §2314 because it held that the stolen code was not a “good” under the meaning of the statute, State v. Aleynikov, 676 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2012). The court also reversed the count of conviction under the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. §1832, because that law covered the misappropriation of trade secrets relating to a product placed in interstate commerce, and the court found Goldman’s code was never intended to be sold or licensed to anyone outside the firm. State prosecutors then tried their hand at pursuing Aleynikov under New York Penal Law §165.07, which was enacted in 1967, and rarely used. Section 165.07 prohibits making “a tangible reproduction or representation” of secret scientific material without a right to do so. The New York Supreme Court rejected the government’s argument that Aleynikov made a “tangible reproduction or representation” when he duplicated the source code because it found that the word “tangible” means having or possessing physical form that is capable of being touched. People v. Aleynikov, 49 Misc. 3d 286, 310 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2015).</p>
<p id="771f3cdb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The shortcomings of these statutes to reach Aleynikov’s actions prompted both Congress and the New York state legislature to act. Congress, specifically prompted by the <i>Aleynikov</i> case and what it viewed as an unwarranted loophole, amended the Economic Espionage Act to cover a “product <i>or service</i> that is <i>used</i> or <i>intended for use</i> in interstate or foreign commerce.” See, e.g., 158 Cong. Rec. H6849 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2012) (statement of Rep. Smith) (noting the <i>Aleynikov</i> decision created a “dangerous loophole”). The New York Senate also passed a bill to cover Aleynikov’s conduct, and that legislation is currently pending in the state Assembly as of summer 2016. The <i>Aleynikov</i> case thus illustrates the difficulty in using existing statutory laws to address new technologies and the potential need for those laws to be amended to cover situations unanticipated by the initial drafters. For a helpful overview of Congress’s response to the <i>Aleynikov</i> case, see Robert Damion Jurrens, Fool Me Once: <i>U.S. v. Aleynikov</i> and the Theft of Trade Secrets Clarification Act of 2012, 28 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 833 (2013).</p>

<i>6. Intellectual property theft.</i> As the preceding notes suggest, intellectual property theft has become a vexing problem for the courts. It is also a significant problem for the economy because intellectual capital represents a third of the total value of American business, and intellectual capital is the fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy. The misappropriation of intellectual property costs American businesses several hundred billion dollars every year. Green, supra, at 204. Given the importance of intellectual property, it is not surprising that it was in an effort to provide greater federal protection of <span title="1158" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1158">p. 1158</span>trade secrets that Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act in 1996. Trade secrets are broadly defined to include “all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information.” Id. §1839(3). For discussion of the statute, see Kent B. Alexander &amp; Kristen L. Wood, The Economic Espionage Act: Setting the Stage for a New Commercial Code of Conduct, 15 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 907 (1999). For an analysis of how trade secrets are valued, see Gavin C. Reid et al., What’s It Worth to Keep a Secret?, 13 Duke L. &amp; Tech. Rev. 116 (2015).</p>

<i>Problem:</i> The defendant, a paralegal working for a firm representing plaintiffs in a class action suit, e-mailed to opposing attorneys an excerpt from the plaintiff firm’s 400-page “trial plan,” and offered to sell them the entire plan for $2 million. The defense attorneys contacted the FBI, and an undercover agent arranged a meeting that led to the defendant’s arrest. Could the defendant be charged with violating the Economic Espionage Act, on the theory that the trial plan excerpt was “business [or] economic . . . information”? The government chose instead to prosecute under §2314. Did the defendant’s e-mail message transmit “goods, wares [or] merchandise”? See United States v. Farraj, 142 F. Supp. 2d 484 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).</p>

<i>7. Identity theft.</i> Identity theft—the unauthorized use of identifying information such as a person’s name, social security number, or credit—has been the number one consumer fraud complaint for the past 15 years.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F31_12a1c29b-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F31_12a1c29b-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> The federal aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. §1028A, imposes additional penalties on an individual who, during the commission of certain crimes, “knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.” Conviction requires that the defendant know that the identification actually belongs to someone else (and is not fake, for instance). Thus, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of an illegal immigrant who presented a counterfeit social security card whose number, allegedly unbeknownst to the defendant, belonged to someone else. Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U.S. 646 (2009). In the ordinary prosecution, of course, proof of knowledge is easy because the defendant’s aim was precisely to exploit the victim’s real identity. Consider United States v. Blixt, 548 F.3d 882 (3d Cir. 2008), where an employee forged her employer’s signature on 352 bank checks. The court upheld the aggravated identity theft conviction for the forgery on the theory that forging another person’s signature is the use of that person’s name and therefore a “means of identification.” Should the theft of identify be recognized as a form of property crime?</p>

<p id="771f63ff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Oxford v. Moss, [1978] 68 Crim. App. 183 (B.D.), the defendant, an engineering student, managed to obtain the page proof to the civil engineering exam to be given at his university the following month. He was caught and charged with theft. It was stipulated that the defendant intended only to “borrow” the proofs and hoped to return them undetected after acquiring advance knowledge of the questions to be asked. Section 1(1) of the English Theft Act of 1968 provided that “[a] person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.” Section 4(1) defined “property” to include “money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.” The court held that the confidential information contained in the exam paper was not “intangible property” within the meaning of the statute. As the <i>Girard</i> case indicates, however, the result could be different in the United States, at least if the test had been sponsored by a federal agency.</p>

The Supreme Court described these cases as follows in McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 362 (1987):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="771f8b15-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the public sector . . . officials have secretly made governmental decisions with the objective of benefiting themselves or promoting their own interests, instead of fulfilling their legal commitment to provide the citizens of the State or local government with their loyal service and honest government. . . . In the private sector, purchasing agents, brokers, union leaders, and others with clear fiduciary duties to their employers or unions have been found guilty of defrauding their employers or unions by accepting kickbacks or selling confidential information. In other cases, defendants have been found guilty of using the mails to defraud individuals of their rights to privacy and other nonmonetary rights.</p>
</div>
<p id="771f8b16-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The victims in these cases—shareholders or the public—do not lose tangible property or money, but their right to honest services. Courts have accepted this loss of intangible rights as a substitute for economic loss. In addition, although the defendants in many of these cases did not typically engage in express deceit or misrepresentation, courts have found the element of fraud satisfied through a failure to disclose their dishonest or corrupt actions. Courts have justified the honest services doctrine “by positing that the public has an intangible right to the honest services of government officials,” such that the “official’s failure to disclose his crookedness may then constitute the basis of a mail fraud conviction.” Thomas J. Miles, Dupes and Losers in Mail Fraud, 77 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1111, 1135 (2010). For example, in United States v. Margiotta, 688 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1982), the Second Circuit affirmed the mail fraud conviction of a local chair of a political party committee who distributed thousands of dollars in insurance commissions to numerous brokers, lawyers, and friends who failed to do legitimate work. The court held that Margiotta breached a fiduciary duty owed to the public by failing to disclose material information about the commissions. Judge Winter’s dissent criticized the sweep of the honest services theory: “[T]here is no end to the common political practices which may now be swept within the ambit of mail fraud,” including “[a]n elected official who for political purposes performs an act imposing unnecessary costs on taxpayers” without making disclosure, “[a] <span title="1162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1162">p. 1162</span>partisan political leader who throws decisive support behind a candidate known to the leader to be less qualified than his or her opponent,” and “[a] partisan political leader who causes elected officials to fail to modernize government to retain jobs for the party faithful.” Id. at 140 (Winter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>
<p id="771f8b17-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the private context, honest services cases included violations of duties of loyalty, such as securities brokers trading for their own accounts based on their employer’s information. Miles, supra, at 1135-1136. This, too, sparked criticism, with some courts concluding that honest services was “problematic” in the private sector because it could potentially turn any kind of dishonesty by an employee into a crime. These courts thus demanded a showing of some risk of economic harm to the party to whom the duty of honest services was owed. See, e.g., United States v. Frost, 125 F.3d 346 (6th Cir. 1997).</p>
<p id="771f8b18-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court rejected the broad reading of honest services in 1987 in <i>McNally</i>, concluding that a deprivation of money or tangible property was necessary under §1341. Justice Stevens dissented and questioned the logic of criminalizing schemes to defraud that involved trivial sums of money but not allowing prosecutions to go forward when citizens were deprived of honest government. 483 U.S. at 366 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Congress seemed to agree with Justice Stevens, for it quickly responded by passing a revised statute, 18 U.S.C. §1346, that expressly stated that the “‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” In the wake of that statute, courts continued to recognize honest services deprivation as a form of mail and wire fraud. But the scope of §1346 raised questions of its own, which are addressed in the following case.</p>

The Government’s investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron’s short-run stock prices by overstating the company’s financial well-being. In the years following Enron’s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the <span title="1163" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1163">p. 1163</span>scheme.

United States, 117 F.2d 110 (1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecution of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial to the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city] was to make and did make a saving by the operations there could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court of Appeals maintained. “A scheme to get a public contract on more favorable terms than would likely be got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court observed, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.”</p>

Unlike fraud in which the victim’s loss of money or property supplied the defendant’s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest-services theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract, yet the contract terms were the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm’s length, the city (the betrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property <i>gain</i> for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that party’s right to the offender’s “honest services.”</p>

The possibilities range from any action that is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to only the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his principal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator’s position of trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The duty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but maybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the case of public officials, but perhaps not.

<i>1. Corruption as theft.</i> As the Court observes in <i>Skilling</i>, the honest services doctrine grew out of a desire to promote good government and business behavior by targeting corrupt behavior on the part of public officials and corporate officers in situations where “the offender profited, [but] the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment.” Defining what, exactly, the betrayed party has lost when there is no tangible property or money loss therefore presents difficult definitional questions and explains the ongoing dialogue between the Supreme Court and Congress over the sweep of the theory of honest services.

<i>2. The scope of honest services.</i> Is capturing a broader notion of honest services than the one acknowledged by the Court—bribes and kickbacks—important as a matter of public policy? To some extent, the answer depends on how broadly the courts view bribery and kickbacks. In McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355 (2016), the Supreme Court took a narrow view of what is covered by the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. §201, which prohibits a public official from “receiv[ing] or accept[ing] anything of value” in return for being “influenced in the performance of any official act.” The Court concluded that “official act” means “a formal exercise of governmental power” that is “specific and focused,” involving a matter that is “pending” or “may by law be brought” before a public official. Id. at 2372. It is not bribery, the Court held, if the official accepts something of value merely in exchange for access—“[s]etting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so).” Id. The Court adopted this reading of the statute in part because it was concerned that a broader view “could cast a pall of potential prosecution” over commonplace interactions between public officials and their constituents. Id. For a critique of this view, see Deborah Hellman, A Theory of Bribery, 38 Cardozo L. Rev. ___ (2017). Hellman offers a different theory of bribery to limit its scope that would require the value exchanged for the political act to be something “external to the domain of politics.” So under her theory, a public official could trade his or her vote for someone else’s vote and that would not be bribery because votes are within <span title="1168" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1168">p. 1168</span>the domain of politics; but if the public official traded his or her vote in return for money given to the official personally, it would be bribery because money of that sort is external to politics.</p>
<p id="77200073-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whatever the scope of bribery and kickbacks, some element of undisclosed self-dealing will fall outside its purview. Imagine, for example, that <i>A</i>, the CEO of Acme, owns zero shares in Acme but 40 percent of the shares of Acme’s supplier, Widget. <i>A</i> convinces the board of Acme to acquire Widget, even though he knows Widget is having issues with some of its other customers, who may not renew their contracts next year. <i>A</i> does not disclose his financial interest in the transaction, and Acme buys Widget. Because <i>A</i> breached his fiduciary duty to Acme, <i>A</i> could be subject to criminal liability under the self-dealing theory, but he could not be charged under a notion of honest services that is limited to bribes or kickbacks.</p>

For example, should it be deemed fraud for an employee to use the Internet for personal reasons during job hours without disclosing it to his or her employer? As Samuel W. Buell points out, the scope of fiduciary duties admits of no easy answer. Buell, The Court’s Fraud Dud, 6 Duke J. Const. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 31, 38-39 (2010). And the Court in <i>Skilling</i>, 561 U.S. at 411 n.44, sounded a note of caution should Congress opt to amend §1346 in the wake of the decision to include undisclosed self-dealing:</p>

That formulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct or significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To what extent does the official action have to further that interest in order to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made and what information should it convey?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">GAROUTE</span>, J. [Appellant, a 17-year-old, was convicted of burglary on an information charging that he entered a house with intent to commit larceny. He entered an acquaintance’s house and took a bicycle. He testified: “I didn’t intend to keep it. I just wanted to get even with him. The boy was throwing oranges at me in the evening, and he would not stop when I told him to, and it made me mad. . . . I intended to take it back Sunday night; but, before I got back, they caught me.”]</p>
<p id="77202791-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he court gave the jury the following instruction: . . .

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77202792-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In defining to you the crime of grand larceny, [defense counsel says] that you must find that the taker intended to deprive him of it permanently. I do not think that is the law. I think in this case, for example, if the defendant took this bicycle, we will say for the purpose of riding twenty-five miles, for the purpose of enabling him to get away, and then left it for another to get it, and intended to do nothing else except to help himself away for a certain distance, it would be larceny, just as much as though he intended to take it all the while. . . . He converts it to that extent to his own use and purpose feloniously.</p>
</div>
<p id="77202793-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This instruction is erroneous, and demands a reversal of the judgment.

We think the authorities form an unbroken line to the effect that the felonious intent must be to deprive the owner of the property permanently. [If the defendant] did not intend so to do, there is no felonious intent, and his acts constitute but a trespass. While the felonious intent of the party taking need not necessarily be an intention to convert the property to his own use, still it must in all cases be an intent to wholly and permanently deprive the owner thereof.</p>

<p id="77204ea7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some limited exceptions to the requirement of an intent to take permanently have been made judicially and by statute. Early on, courts found that, where the taker of property recklessly exposed it to loss or abandoned it, this fact was not only evidence of an intent to cause a permanent deprivation but would sustain larceny even if a permanent taking was not the object of the defendant’s acts. State v. Davis, 38 N.J.L. 176 (1875). See N.Y. Penal Law §155.00(3) (2016): “To ‘deprive’ another of property means . . . to dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property.” Similarly, courts and statutes commonly provide that the requirement of an intent to deprive permanently can be satisfied by an intent to take the property for an extended period sufficient to deprive the owner of a major portion of the item’s value. E.g., People v. Avery, 38 P.3d 1 (Cal. 2002). Thus, a defendant who “borrows” a season pass to her team’s home baseball games could not defend on the ground that she had returned the pass after the season was over. See also MPC §223.0(1).</p>
<p id="77204ea8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Significant gaps remain when a defendant keeps the property for a significant period but nonetheless brings it back in time for the owner to benefit from it in the future. To fill part of this gap, many states have long enacted “joy ride” statutes, which make criminal the temporary taking of an automobile and sometimes other vehicles. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code §499b (2016).</p>
<p id="77204ea9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Why should the law of theft confine itself to cases where the intent of the taker is to effect a permanent deprivation? As Holmes observed (The Common Law 71 (1881)): “A momentary loss of possession is not what has been guarded against with such severe penalties. What the law means to prevent is the loss of it wholly and forever. . . . ” But should interference with possession that is more than momentary, though less than permanent, be protected against by the law of theft? Following MPC §223.0(1), N.Y. Penal Law §155.00(3) (2016) now provides: “To ‘deprive’ another of property means (a) to withhold it or cause it to be withheld . . . for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to him. . . . ” Section 155.00(4) provides: “To ‘appropriate’ property of <span title="1171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1171">p. 1171</span>another to oneself or a third person means (a) to exercise control over it . . . permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances as to acquire the major portion of its economic value or benefit. . . . ” These provisions were construed in the following case.</p>

<p id="77204eac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendants, Sentry Armored Courier Corp. and its officers, had an agreement with Chemical Bank to pick up, “fine count,” and deliver Chemical’s bulk deposits to Chemical’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank within 72 hours. Since it took only 24 hours to count the money, defendants used the extra 48 hours to obtain interest on the money by arrangement with the Hudson Valley Bank. The scheme involved little risk, since the “loan” to Hudson, which was a key element in the arrangement, was secured by A-rated bonds. The majority found these facts not to constitute a deprivation or appropriation of Chemical’s money.]</p>
<p id="77204ead-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is lacking here . . . is evidence demonstrating an “intent to deprive . . .  or to appropriate.” The gist of the People’s claim is that by investing Chemical’s money for periods up to 48 hours, defendants evinced an intent to deprive its true owner of the money’s “economic value or benefit,” that is, the interest that the money was capable of generating. The mens rea element of larceny, however, is simply not satisfied by an intent temporarily to use property without the owner’s permission, or even an intent to appropriate outright the benefits of the property’s short-term use.</p>
<p id="77204eae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . [T]he evidence . . . indicates only that defendants exercised control over Chemical’s money to the extent of using it to make short-term, profitable investments and, as a result, appropriated some portion of its economic benefit for themselves. However, in light of the fact that their unauthorized use of Chemical’s money extended over no more than a series of discrete 48-hour periods, the proof was insufficient to show that they intended to use Chemical’s money “for so extended a period or under such circumstances as to acquire the <i>major portion</i> of its economic value or benefit” (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p id="77204eaf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, [i]nasmuch as Chemical had ceded possession of its money to Sentry for various 72-hour periods, it had no legal rights during those periods to the money’s “economic value or benefit,” which is an incident of possession. . . . It is clear that an individual who “joy-rides” and thereby deprives the automobile’s owner of the value arising from its temporary use is not liable in larceny for stealing that intangible “value” under article 155 of the Penal Law. By parity of reasoning, an individual who temporarily invests another’s money and thereby gains interest or profit cannot be deemed guilty of larceny for appropriating that interest or profit. . . . 
</p>
<p id="77204eb0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we note that neither Sentry’s patently false response to Chemical’s inquiry concerning the rerouting of its money through Hudson nor Sentry’s disobedience when ordered by Chemical to deliver the money directly are sufficient to establish that Sentry was acting with the larcenous intent required by Penal Law §155.00(3), (4) and §155.05(1). At worst, Sentry’s <span title="1172" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1172">p. 1172</span>conduct demonstrates its unwillingness to relinquish what was obviously a profitable short-term use of Chemical’s money. It does not, however, alter the inescapable and uncontradicted inference that Sentry was merely emulating the behavior of many reputable financial institutions by taking advantage of the “float” on the temporarily idle money in its possession.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">LAWTON</span>, L.J. . . . The appeal raises an important point of law, namely, can it be a defence <i>in law</i> for a man charged with theft and proved to have taken money to say that when he took the money he intended to repay it and had reasonable grounds for believing and did believe that he would be able to do so.</p>
<p id="772075c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Defendant was a branch manager for a firm of bookmakers. In September 1971, the firm sent a circular to all branch managers that the practice of borrowing from tills was to stop. Defendant nevertheless took about £30 from a branch safe on October 4.

<p id="772075ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At no stage of his summing up did he leave the jury to decide whether the prosecution had proved that the defendant had taken the money dishonestly. This was because he seems to have thought that he had to decide as a matter of law what amounted to dishonesty and he expressed his concept of dishonesty as follows: “ . . . if someone does something deliberately knowing that his employers are not prepared to tolerate it, is that not dishonest?”</p>
<p id="772075cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the jury have been left to decide whether the defendant had acted dishonestly?

The business of the shop got into difficulties and in order to get out of them the wife . . . took money from the Post Office till to discharge some of the debts of the business. [S]he said that she thought she would be able to repay the money out of her salary from the Post Office and from sales from the business. The husband said that he knew it was wrong to do what they had done, but he thought that it would all come right in the end. They were found guilty on a number of counts and in respect of two the jury added a rider that the appellants had intended to repay the money and honestly believed that they would be able to do so. . . .

<p id="772075d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question in the case which is relevant for the purposes of this appeal was whether the facts found by the jury and recorded in their riders afforded any defence. [The court held they did not, stating]: “They knew that they had no right to take the money which they knew was not their money. The fact that they may have had a hope or expectation in the future of repaying that money is a matter which at most can go to mitigation and does not amount to a defence.” . . .

<p id="772075d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We find it impossible to accept that a conviction for stealing, whether it be called larceny or theft, can reveal no moral obloquy. A man so convicted would have difficulty in persuading his friends and neighbours that his reputation had not been gravely damaged. . . . 
</p>
<p id="772075d3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the principle enunciated in [<i>Williams</i>] was right, there would be a strange divergence between the position of a man who obtains cash by passing a cheque on an account which has no funds to meet it and one who takes money from a till. The man who passes the cheque is deemed in law not to act dishonestly if he genuinely believes on reasonable grounds that when it is presented to the paying bank there will be funds to meet it. But, according to [<i>Williams</i>], the man who takes money from a till intending to put it back and <span title="1174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1174">p. 1174</span>genuinely believing on reasonable grounds that he will be able to do so should be convicted of theft. Lawyers may be able to appreciate why one man should be adjudged to be a criminal and the other not; but we doubt whether anyone else would. People who take money from tills and the like without permission are usually thieves; but if they do not admit that they are by pleading guilty, it is for the jury, not the judge, to decide whether they have acted dishonestly. . . .

<i>1. Intent to restore and embezzlement.</i> In State v. Pratt, 220 P. 505, 506-507 (Kan. 1923), the defendant was convicted of embezzlement on the following facts:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77209ce8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Building &amp; Loan Association purchased $10,000 worth [of bonds], which passed into the custody of the appellant as secretary-treasurer of the association. Without any authority to do so, and without the knowledge of the directors and other officers of the association, appellant sold these bonds in January, 1920. . . . The money was not used for the benefit of the association. In fact, appellant concealed his disposition of these bonds from the association until some time in May or June, 1921.</p>
</div>
<p id="77209ce9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal the defendant contended “that before he could be convicted of the crime of embezzlement the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time he wrongfully converted the bonds he had the intent to deprive the owner, not temporarily, but permanently, of its property,” and that error was committed in refusing evidence of his intent to restore the bonds or their equivalent and in failing to instruct that such an intent was a good defense. The court affirmed, resting on the weight of authority that as long as “the money of the principal is knowingly used by the agent in violation of his duty,” it is still embezzlement even if “at the time he intended to restore it.” Similarly, in People v. Sisuphan, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654, 662 (Ct. App. 2010), the court held that the intent to restore is not a defense, even if it is present at the time the property is taken and the property is restored before criminal charges are filed.</p>
<p id="77209cea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Intent to restore and false pretenses.</i> The intent to restore is likewise held to be no defense to a false pretense charge. See People v. Weiger, 34 P. 826 (Cal. 1893). The defendant obtained goods on credit from the complaining witness on false representations concerning his financial position. The court affirmed a conviction of obtaining by false pretenses, holding it immaterial that the defendant intended to pay for the goods he purchased.</p>
<p id="77209ceb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Suppose the goods the defendant obtained in <i>Weiger</i> were a set of law books and that his defense was that he was an attorney expecting a visit from a potential client of substance whom he wanted to impress. He obtained <span title="1175" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1175">p. 1175</span>the books for this purpose, fully intending to ship them back to the seller after the client’s visit. Would it follow from <i>Weiger</i> that he would be guilty of obtaining by false pretenses? If so, consider the liability of the attorney if he secretly removed the books from another attorney’s office for the same purpose and with the same intent to return them after the client’s visit. This, presumably, would be a temporary taking, a circumstance inconsistent with larceny. Why should he have a defense if charged with physically taking the books by stealth but not if charged with obtaining the books by a false representation?</p>
<p id="77209cec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Intent to restore and federal law.</i> Courts have concluded that the intent to repay is irrelevant when defendants are charged with federal statutes prohibiting “conversion” and “steal[ing].” United States v. Van Elsen, 652 F.3d 955, 961 (8th Cir. 2011). In <i>Van Elsen</i>, the defendant’s intent to repay funds misappropriated from his employer’s retirement accounts did not preclude his conviction under 18 U.S.C. §664, which imposes criminal liability on “[a]ny person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or to the use of another, any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan, or of any fund connected therewith.”</p>

<p id="77209cee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deprivation accompanied by an intent to make good later, by payment of money or by the actor’s repurchasing an equivalent article for restoration to the owner, is quite different in effect from the taking of a thing for temporary use of the taker. In the latter situation, the actor’s retention of the property offers some assurance of his ability to restore, beyond his general credit. In the former situation, the man who takes money intending to repay or the broker who sells his client’s bonds meaning to repurchase and restore the bonds later, substitutes his own credit for the owner’s property in hand. Even if the actor carries out his intent to restore, he is simply paying off a liability from his own assets, rather than restoring property which has continued to belong to the owner during the interval of deprivation.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Does this account suffice to explain why the young attorney who obtains a discrete item of physical property under false pretenses should not have a defense when she intends to restore the property after a brief interval? Does it explain why a person <i>does</i> have a defense if she steals cash and spends it, but can prove that she intended to repay the money later?</p>
<p id="77209cf0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC addresses these issues by defining theft by <i>unlawful taking</i> in slightly different terms from those used to define theft by <i>deception</i>. The former offense is committed when the defendant has a purpose to “deprive” the owner of his or her property, while the latter offense is committed when the defendant purposely “obtains” another person’s property. See Model Penal Code §§223.2, 223.3. The definitions of “deprive” and “obtain” are distinct. See Model Penal Code §223.0(1), (5). Consider how these provisions apply to the case of the young attorney who dishonestly acquires a set of law books for temporary use, intending to return them. If he secretly removes the books from another office, is he guilty of theft by unlawful taking? If he tricks a distributor into selling them to him under false pretenses, is he guilty of theft by deception?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">SIMONS</span>, J. [Appellants Reid and Riddles were convicted of armed robberies of money from their victims, despite evidence that they were only trying to recover money owed to them. In one case, the trial court, conducting a trial without a jury, stated that it credited the testimony of defendant that he had taken the money to satisfy a debt, but the court denied him the defense of claim of right because he used force.]</p><p id="7720c406-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common issue presented by these two appeals is whether a good-faith claim of right, which negates larcenous intent in certain thefts . . . also negates the intent to commit robbery by a defendant who uses force to recover cash allegedly owed him. We hold that it does not [and affirm the convictions]. . . . 
</p><p id="7720c407-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person “commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force.” The larceny statute, in turn, provides that an assertion that “property was appropriated under a claim of right made in good faith” is a defense to larceny. Since a good-faith claim of right is a defense to larceny, and because robbery is defined as forcible larceny, defendants contend that claim of right is also a defense to robbery. They concede the culpability of their forcible conduct, but maintain that because they acted under a claim of right to recover their own property, they were not guilty of robbery, but only some lesser crime, such as assault or unlawful possession of a weapon.</p><p id="7720c408-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Lower courts in New York] have uniformly ruled that claim of right is not a defense to robbery . . . based upon the interpretation of the applicable statutes and a policy decision to discourage self-help and . . . consistent with what appears to be the emerging trend of similar appellate court decisions from other jurisdictions. For similar reasons, we conclude that the claim of right defense is not available in these cases. We need not decide the quite different question of whether an individual who uses force to recover a specific chattel which he owns may be convicted of robbery. It should be noted, however, that because taking property “from an owner thereof” is an element of robbery, a person who recovers property which is his own (as compared to the fungible cash taken to satisfy a claimed debt in the cases before us) may not be guilty of robbery.</p><p id="7720c409-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

For example, extortion is a form of larceny, but the Legislature, consistent with a prior decision of this court, has not authorized a claim of right defense to extortion (see People v. Fichtner, 118 N.Y.S.2d 159). The exception is significant for extortion entails the threat of actual or potential force or some form of coercion. Thus, the inference may reasonably be drawn that in failing to authorize a claim of right defense for extortion in Penal Law §155.15(1), and by failing to incorporate it in article 160 of the statute, which governs robbery, the Legislature recognized that an accused should not be permitted to invoke it in crimes involving force. We assume that if the Legislature intended to excuse forcible taking, it would have said so.</p><p id="7720c40b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our decision also rests upon policy considerations against expanding the area of permissible self-help. . . . [F]orcible conduct is not merely a transgression against property, but also entails the risk of physical or mental injury to individuals, [and] it should be subjected to criminal sanctions. Consequently, we find the courts in both [cases] correctly denied defendants’ requests to assert claim of right defenses.</p></div>

<i>1. Chattels versus cash.</i> In accord with <i>Reid</i>, courts routinely distinguish between the use of force to reclaim a specific chattel and the use of force to obtain cash as repayment for an alleged debt, normally allowing a claim-of-right defense in the former situation but not the latter. See People v. Tufunga, 987 P.2d 168 (Cal. 1999).</p>

<i>2. The Model Penal Code.</i> MPC §223.1(3)(b) provides a claim-of-right defense that is available to all forms of theft, including robbery and extortion, and regardless of whether the property appropriated is money or a discrete physical item. The Commentaries offer this justification for allowing claim of right as a defense to robbery (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §223.1(3) at 157 n.99 (1980)):</p>
