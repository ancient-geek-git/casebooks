<p id="7725cd25-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The subject matter of criminal law, broadly speaking, is the framework of rules and principles that defines certain conduct as crimes and determines the degree of punishment attached to any given instance of criminal behavior. Because the media tends to focus on the cases that go to trial, the image of this process is usually of an adversarial battle in a courtroom, with opposing counsel putting forward their strongest arguments before a decision maker (a jury or a trial judge) who resolves all disputed questions, in order to arrive at the decision that best reflects the requirements of established law.</p>
<p id="7725cd26-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that image ignores the reality and complexity of how substantive law and punishment typically gets implemented. At crucial points, the binding force of this body of law is qualified, and may even be nullified completely, by discretion. Discretion allows decisions concerning culpability and punishment to be made outside the ordinary doctrinal framework, in a process that often can be described as unilateral and administrative rather than adversarial and adjudicative. This chapter provides an opportunity to examine this phenomenon systematically and to reflect upon its implications.</p>
<p id="7725cd27-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“Discretion,” for present purposes, exists when the institutions charged with implementing criminal law doctrine are endowed with authority—<i>legitimate</i> authority—to ignore established rules and decide questions of liability and punishment on different grounds or on no particular grounds at all.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1002E_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1002E_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> We have already examined one example—the jury’s unreviewable power to render a verdict of acquittal in the face of incontrovertible evidence of guilt. See pp. 63-76 supra. Jury nullification has been enshrined in Anglo-American criminal procedure for more than 200 years. But its importance has faded to some extent, as jury trials have become increasingly rare, with only 2 percent of state court convictions coming after a jury trial.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10036_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10036_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span>
</p>
<p id="7725cd2a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a system dominated by plea bargaining instead of jury trials, it is the discretion of prosecutors that has the most significance. Prosecutors have <span title="1180" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1180">p. 1180</span>broad discretion for two main reasons. First, the potential reach of criminal law has widened because the number of criminal laws has exponentially increased, and their scope is ever broader—covering “more conduct than any jurisdiction could possibly punish.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10048_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10048_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span> The abundance of legislated crimes permits prosecutors to file a multiplicity of serious charges or to pick and choose among possible statutes. Second, authorized sentences have become increasingly severe, and nominally “mandatory” sentences have been attached to more and more offenses. This allows prosecutors effectively to pick and choose the sentence a defendant will receive by deciding on which charges to file. Thus, in many ways, prosecutors in the modern era of criminal justice are now the key adjudicators, and not simply advocates, because of the power they wield.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10050_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10050_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> And at each of these points, discretion is pervasive; the formal doctrines of criminal law must compete for influence with unofficial norms and the decision maker’s personal and professional motivations.</p>
<p id="7725cd2d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A common intuition is that formal adjudications of guilt at trial require stronger moral justification than charge dismissals, plea bargaining, and jury nullification because the last three processes involve the exercise of leniency. The thought seems to be that decisions to <i>impose</i> pains and penalties require better reasons and more oversight than decisions to <i>withhold</i> sanctions.</p>
<p id="7725cd2e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing this intuition, two points must be stressed. First, as Professor Kenneth Culp Davis insisted, “the power to be lenient is the power to discriminate.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10066_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10066_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span> Second, whatever may have been true in the past, we can no longer describe charging and bargaining discretion as simply the discretion to <i>withhold</i> deserved punishment. Criminal statutes now commonly permit (or purport to require) draconian punishments that no one expects to be imposed in the typical case. Indeed, prisons are already filled to capacity and beyond capacity, even in a world where the most severe available sentences are infrequently inflicted. “Leniency” has therefore become not merely common but an expected systemic imperative. Under these circumstances, as we shall see in this chapter, it is just as valid to describe the current American criminal justice system as one that imposes a “trial penalty” instead of saying that it is a system of plea “bargains.” Put another way, the decision to “withhold leniency” (i.e., not to bargain in exchange for a plea) is effectively a decision to <i>impose</i> severe punishment, and to do so selectively, on grounds that need not be adjudicated or even disclosed.</p>
<p id="7725cd30-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter reflects the view that examination of these practices has become an important complement to the study of criminal law:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10078_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10078_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span>

</div>
<p id="7725f443-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This chapter does not deal with criminal <i>procedure</i> in the conventional sense. Rather, its focus is on the quintessentially <i>substantive</i> problem of understanding the criteria (or lack of criteria) by which culpability and punishment are determined in contemporary America. Section A examines the charging decision, Section B considers plea bargaining, and Section C explores the sentencing process.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10097_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10097_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">7</a></span> This division, though necessary for purposes of exposition, is somewhat artificial. Charging decisions are often shaped by the prospect of plea negotiation, and plea negotiation is almost always shaped by expectations about the potential sentence. We take up the three processes in the order that they arise in litigation, but it must be remembered that they are interdependent.</p>

Consider the rape allegations against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. A maid at a hotel where Strauss-Kahn was staying alleged that he sexually assaulted her. At the time the alleged assault was initially reported, prosecutors believed the maid’s story. Later, however, several facts undermined the housekeeper’s credibility, including her ties to individuals with drug convictions, false information on her immigration forms, and recordings where she discussed a desire to profit from the allegations. The prosecutors ultimately dismissed the charges, stating that “for generations, before determining whether a case should proceed to <span title="1182" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1182">p. 1182</span>trial, felony prosecutors in New York County have insisted that they be <i>personally</i> convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt, and believe themselves able to prove that guilt to a jury.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100D6_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100D6_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">10</a></span> Because prosecutors did not believe the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt, their view was they could “not ask a jury to do so.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100E2_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100E2_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">11</a></span>
</p>
<p id="7725f44e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ABA proposed but did not pass a revised standard that would have comported with the standard applied by the prosecutors in the Strauss-Kahn case, requiring a prosecutor to dismiss charges when he or she “reasonably believes that proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is lacking.” Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function §3-5.5(c) (Proposed Revisions 2009).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100EE_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100EE_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">12</a></span> Does a standard that requires prosecutors themselves to believe in guilt beyond a reasonable doubt properly protect defendants’ rights, or does it risk disadvantaging certain types of victims when credibility is a central issue in the case? The Department of Justice authorizes prosecutors to bring charges when they have “probable cause” that a person committed a federal offense. U.S. Attorneys’ Manual §9-27-200. That threshold has been criticized as too low “barring exceptional circumstances such as the need to interdict an immediate threat to public safety or national security.” Anthony S. Barkow &amp; Beth George, Prosecuting Political Defendants, 44 Ga. L. Rev. 953, 1014-1015 (2010). Are those exceptions warranted? Are there other circumstances where probable cause should be sufficient?</p>
<p id="7725f450-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These issues have been at the core in many cases involving police killings of unarmed civilians. Consider the fatal police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was playing with a toy gun in a Cleveland park. A 911 caller reported seeing Rice brandishing the gun, but the dispatch operator failed to tell the responding officers that the caller also noted that Rice was probably a juvenile and that the gun was probably fake. The officers responded to the call by driving their car within a few feet from Rice, and allegedly one officer started shooting even before the car had come to a complete stop, without issuing Rice a warning or observing furtive movements. A Cleveland judge viewing a video of the encounter found that there was probable cause to charge the shooting officer with murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, and dereliction of duty, and to charge the shooting officer’s partner with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty. Richard Pérez-Peña &amp; Mitch Smith, Cleveland Judge Finds Probable Cause to Charge Officers in Tamir Rice Death, N.Y. Times, June 11, 2015. The Cleveland prosecutor ultimately recommended to a grand jury that they not indict the officers because in his view “the law gives the benefit of the doubt to officers who must make split second <span title="1183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1183">p. 1183</span>decisions.” Timothy Williams &amp; Mitch Smith, Cleveland Officer Will Not Face Charges in Tamir Rice Shooting Death, N.Y. Times, Dec. 28, 2015. Is the prosecutor correct that charges in circumstances like these are inappropriate because the benefit of the doubt should go to the officer? Is it appropriate for the prosecutor to play such a large gatekeeping role? Or should cases involving fatal police shootings of unarmed civilians be charged whenever there is probable cause so that jurors can resolve these cases on a full trial record?</p>
<p id="7725f451-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when there is evidence that prosecutors believe shows guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, they still often choose not to pursue all legally sustainable charges. Two reasons commonly offered are limited available enforcement resources and the need to individualize justice. See Wayne R. LaFave, The Prosecutor’s Discretion in the United States, 18 Am. J. Comp. L. 532, 533 (1970). Josh Bowers argues that prosecutors are well positioned to assess the first but not the second. Prosecutors understand the office’s strategic priorities and resource limits, but there are reasons to doubt their ability “to reach commonsense determinations of whether defendants normatively ought to be charged.” Josh Bowers, Legal Guilt, Normative Innocence, and the Equitable Decision Not to Prosecute, 110 Colum. L. Rev. 1655, 1657 (2010). Why might prosecutors be ill positioned to make assessments about individual blameworthiness? Would it be more appropriate for prosecutors to take into account more systemic concerns, such as racial disparities, in deciding to decline charges? One commentator argues that, given the overburdened criminal justice system, prosecutors should decline to prosecute entire classes of minor offenses when they are the result of policing strategies that disproportionately target people of color. K. Babe Howell, Prosecutorial Discretion and the Duty to Seek Justice in an Overburdened Criminal Justice System, 27 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 285 (2014). Is that an appropriate prosecutorial decision?</p>
<p id="7725f452-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should prosecutors take other discretionary steps to address the political dynamic that produces “overcriminalization”? Legislators have many incentives to cast criminal prohibitions in broad terms and to authorize severe punishments. Legislation expanding the reach of the criminal law and raising penalties is relatively easy to enact and often virtually impossible to repeal. See LaFave, supra; Stuntz, supra footnote 3. This one-way ratchet produces an ever-expanding body of criminal prohibitions that often overlap and that contain ever-increasing sanctions. Such laws presuppose discretion because there are not enough resources to prosecute all violators, and in many cases the sentence authorized would be grossly disproportionate to behavior that falls within the letter, if not the spirit, of the law.</p>
<p id="77261b63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> If we were designing a criminal justice system from scratch, would it be better to narrow the reach of criminal law and provide resources sufficient to permit consistent, full enforcement? Or would prosecutorial discretion remain desirable (and perhaps impossible to eliminate) in any event?</p>
<p id="77261b64-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if enforcement discretion is inevitable, not every legal system accepts the kind of <i>broad, unstructured</i> discretion commonly found in the United States. Is it desirable to channel prosecutorial discretion by formal standards <span title="1184" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1184">p. 1184</span>and to control it by some system of supervision or review?

<i>2. Standards.</i> What factors justify a decision not to prosecute a legally provable case? The current standards of the American Bar Association (ABA) recommend that prosecutors consider a long list of factors: the strength of the evidence, the harm caused, the prosecutor’s doubt of guilt, the potential collateral impact on third parties, the possible disproportion between the authorized punishment and the gravity of a particular crime, the defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the prosecution of others, the fair and efficient distribution of prosecutorial resources, whether public interests might be vindicated by any available civil, administrative, or private remedies, and the likelihood of prosecution in another jurisdiction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1011B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1011B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> Recent revisions to the ABA Standards also include additional factors, such as “the background and characteristics of the offender,” and “the possible influence of any cultural, ethnic, socioeconomic or other improper biases.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10123_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10123_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span> Were these revisions advisable? Would failing to consider these factors ignore important differences between offenders that should be considered in making charging decisions? Or are the standards so malleable as to lead to disparate results in similarly situated cases based on the varying views of the prosecutors applying the standards? For the latter view, see Bennett L. Gershman, Prosecutorial Decisionmaking and Discretion in the Charging Function, 62 Hastings L.J. 1259, 1276 (2011).</p>
<p id="77261b68-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For federal prosecutors, the United States Attorneys’ Manual lists in some detail the circumstances to be considered in making decisions to charge, but many are obvious (e.g., the strength of the evidence) and all are essentially open-ended, nonbinding examples of factors to be weighed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1012F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1012F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">15</a></span> A few U.S. Attorneys and local prosecutors have more specific rules for handling recurring issues, such as the appropriate charging of various kinds of assault, theft, and drug cases. See, e.g., Ronald Wright &amp; Marc Miller, The Screening/Bargaining Tradeoff, 55 Stan. L. Rev. 29 (2002) (describing charging standards in New Orleans). Most, however, give their subordinates no rule books or manuals sufficiently concrete to constrain the front-line prosecutor’s discretion to do whatever she thinks best. What are the advantages and disadvantages of establishing detailed standards in advance?</p>
<p id="77261b6a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When a prosecutor’s office has established detailed charging guidelines, as many scholars recommend, should it then make those guidelines available to the general public and the defense bar? Will publication allow wrongdoers to exploit loopholes? But without publication, can consistency and political accountability be achieved?

<i>Questions:</i> Should courts in the United States similarly require prosecutors to provide guidance in advance when the scope of a law is unclear? Is the case of assisted suicide and end-of-life decision making unique because of the heightened risk of evasion and/or the importance of the rights at stake, or is the need for advance planning and notice sufficiently strong in other situations as well? Regardless of whether the ultimate guidelines are published, is obtaining public comment on enforcement policies a good idea for prosecutors?</p>

<i>3. Federal versus state prosecution.</i> The last factor mentioned in the ABA Standards—the likelihood of prosecution in another jurisdiction—is especially important for federal prosecutors, because many of the most important federal crimes (drug distribution, firearms offenses, bank robbery, and mail fraud) also can be charged as state crimes and prosecuted by local district attorneys. State penalties, however, typically are much lower. Indeed, the decision to bring a federal case is often driven by the desire to obtain a longer sentence than could be obtained in state court. Rachel E. Barkow, Federalism and Criminal Law: What the Feds Can Learn from the States, 109 Mich. L. Rev. 519, 573-578 (2011). As a result, the decision to refer a case for state rather than federal prosecution can be as significant as the decision whether to prosecute the case at all. See Daniel C. Richman, Federal Criminal Law, Congressional Delegation, and Enforcement Discretion, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 757 (1999). Should there be formal criteria to determine when federal prosecutors take the lead in cases of overlapping federal/state crimes? Is the difference in punishment an appropriate basis for federal jurisdiction? What should be done to ensure that any criteria established are consistently applied? The important issue of potential racial bias in the decision to charge a federal rather than a state crime is explored in connection with <i>United States v. Armstrong</i>, p. 1197 infra.</p>
<p id="77261b6e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What should federal prosecutors do when the conduct at issue constitutes a federal crime, but the state expressly disagrees with the decision to criminalize the conduct? Twenty-three states allow the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and four states (Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington) and the District of Columbia authorize marijuana for recreational use. These state <span title="1186" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1186">p. 1186</span>policies conflict with federal law, which criminalizes all use of marijuana. The Department of Justice issued memos providing guidance to federal prosecutors to help them decide when conduct that is legal under state law should nevertheless be prosecuted federally.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1015C_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1015C_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">16</a></span> But critics argue that these memos speak in such broad terms that individual federal prosecutors have too much discretion to make their own decisions about whether to bring cases. Should prosecutorial charging decisions that implicate fundamental issues of federalism be subject to special oversight, such as requiring special authorization from Main Justice before a case can move forward? Or is this discretionary decision no more troublesome than the many other decisions vested with prosecutors?</p>
<p id="77261b70-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Internal review and office design.</i> In several prosecutors’ offices, supervisors systematically review the charging recommendations of front-line prosecutors. See, e.g., Wright &amp; Miller, supra. In most, however, the charging decision is left to the assistant district attorney assigned to the case. These front-line prosecutors are often inexperienced and suffer from what Ronald F. Wright and Kay L. Levine call “Young Prosecutor’s Syndrome,” which is a tendency to be overly aggressive and adversarial in charging decisions. Wright &amp; Levine, The Cure for Young Prosecutors’ Syndrome, 56 Ariz. L. Rev. 1065 (2014). In addition, if the same individual who investigated a case also makes the charging decision, there are reasons to doubt whether she can objectively review the evidence.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10177_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10177_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">17</a></span> Despite these concerns, supervisory review of front-line prosecutors’ charging recommendations is typically perfunctory or nonexistent. This tradition seems to have developed without much conscious thought about its merits. One senior federal prosecutor claimed that his “office cannot hire excellent attorneys unless they are granted unfettered control over their cases.” See Stephen J. Schulhofer &amp; Ilene H. Nagel, Plea Negotiations Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1284, 1295 (1997). Another—more plausible—explanation may simply be that supervisory review takes time. The charging decision is only the first step in a potentially lengthy process of examining and reexamining a case. Does the initial charging decision, by itself, have implications sufficiently important to justify the resources required for a systematic process of review? If supervisory review is too resource intensive, another option is to change the allocation of responsibilities within offices so that more senior attorneys who do not <span title="1187" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1187">p. 1187</span>suffer from “Young Prosecutors’ Syndrome” make the initial charging decisions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10181_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10181_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">18</a></span>
</p>
<p id="77264283-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because charging decisions shape the overall criminal justice landscape, it is critical to obtain data on how prosecutors’ offices are making those calls. This data can reveal “practices built into the system—into the articulated and unspoken priorities and habits of the office—that turn out to have a racial impact.” Marc L. Miller &amp; Ronald F. Wright, The Black Box, 94 Iowa L. Rev. 125, 165 (2008). It can also reveal how the aggregate decisions by prosecutors influence the larger phenomenon of mass incarceration. John F. Pfaff, The Micro and Macro Causes of Prison Growth, 28 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 1237, 1239 (2012).</p>
<p id="77264284-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Independent checks.</i> Should some institution independent of the prosecution have power to ensure that charging decisions in fact conform to applicable office guidelines and other legitimate charging criteria? Aside from the trial process, there are few additional mechanisms to police prosecutorial overreaching or misconduct in bringing charges. State bars almost never impose sanctions; criminal charges are virtually unheard of, even when the prosecutorial misconduct is egregious; and civil suits typically fail because prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity when their misconduct is associated with “the judicial phase of the criminal process.” Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430 (1976). As discussed below, selective and vindictive prosecution is similarly difficult to establish. Should the system do more to check against prosecutorial overcharging, or does the trial process provide an adequate check?</p>
<p id="77264285-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What remedies should be available in the opposite situation, where a prosecutor drops a readily provable case or fails to bring charges in the first place? Consider the material that follows.</p>

The mandatory nature of the word “required” as it appears in §1987 is insufficient to evince a broad Congressional purpose to bar the exercise of executive discretion in the prosecution of federal civil rights crimes. Similar mandatory language is contained in [many statutes]. Such language has never been thought to preclude the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. . . .

<i>1. Special prosecutors.</i> The <i>Attica</i> case involved at least the appearance of a potential conflict of interest (and many would say an actual conflict of interest) for the state prosecutors, because they were part of the same government as the corrections officers being investigated. Indeed, a recent book describes state government efforts to impede the investigation of what happened when state troopers and corrections officers regained control of the prison. The book argues that there was ample evidence to indict various officers for murder, including evidence of torture, physical evidence that some inmates had been shot multiple times at close range, and witness statements that some prisoners had been seen alive immediately after the takeover but were later found dead. Heather Ann Thompson, Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy (2016).</p>
<p id="772669a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A concern with a conflict of interest is not unique to dramatic situations like the Attica uprising. In many cases, an actual or perceived conflict of interest might give one reason to doubt whether a prosecutor can make a fair assessment of whether to bring charges because the prospective defendant is a government employee or has some other connection to the prosecutor’s office. Because prosecutors work in partnership with their local police department on a daily basis, some have argued that this situation presents a paradigmatic situation where “there is an inherent conflict of interest in giving local prosecutors so much control over the decision whether to charge police for allegations of bias or excessive use of force—and a compelling need for an independent special prosecutor to handle such cases from start to finish.” Jay Sterling Silver, Fixing the Conflict of Interest at the Core of Police Brutality Cases, Wash. Post, Dec. 4, 2014. For a detailed analysis of how the law addressing conflicts of interest applies to the police/prosecutor relationship, see Kate Levine, Who Shouldn’t Prosecute the Police, 101 Iowa L. Rev. 1447 (2016).</p>
<p id="772669a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Special prosecutors—appointed to handle specific matters where the prosecutor normally assigned the case has an actual or perceived conflict—have been used in other contexts. At the federal level, the Ethics in Government Act was passed to deal with this situation by allowing a panel of three federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor (known as the “Independent Counsel”) to pursue charges against high officials of the federal executive branch, with guarantees against interference or control by the attorney general.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10252_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10252_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">19</a></span> In Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this regime. The Act lapsed in 1999, and there is currently no federal statute requiring the appointment of a special prosecutor in high-profile political cases. The attorney general nonetheless retains, and on occasion has exercised, the discretion to appoint a special prosecutor, outside the ordinary Justice Department chain of command, to handle politically sensitive cases.</p>

<span title="1191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1191">p. 1191</span>In many states, the law permits the governor or state attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to assume responsibility when a case is especially complicated or when the local district attorney faces a conflict of interest (as, for example, when serious criminal allegations are made against the district attorney’s child or spouse). Such situations present no separation-of-powers problems, however, because the special prosecutor remains an official of the executive branch, with discretion not to file charges, even when strong evidence is available to sustain them; the <i>Attica</i> case itself was an effort to compel prosecution in a case under the responsibility of a special prosecutor.</p>

<i>2. Prosecutions initiated by judges and victims.</i> American courts have uniformly held that separation-of-powers requirements prohibit judges from compelling an unwilling prosecutor to file charges. A Wisconsin statute, for example, provided that if a judge finds probable cause to believe that an individual has committed an offense and the district attorney nonetheless refuses to file a complaint, the judge can direct the commencement of a prosecution. The statute was tested in State ex rel. Unnamed Petitioners v. Connors, 401 N.W.2d 782 (Wis. 1987), where a female dancer alleged that she had been assaulted by two professional football players in her dressing room at a Milwaukee night club. When the prosecutor acknowledged the existence of probable cause but refused to proceed, because he had doubts about his ability to win convictions at trial, a circuit judge invoked the statute and ordered the prosecution to go forward. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute violated the separation-of-powers requirements of the state constitution. A recent decision from the California Supreme Court raised similar separation-of-powers concerns about a state law that could have been read to allow a judicial employee to issue misdemeanor complaints for failure to appear in court; the court read the law narrowly to require prosecutorial approval in order to avoid the constitutional question. Steen v. Appellate Div., Superior Court, 331 P.3d 136 (Cal. 2014).</p>
<p id="772669ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Private prosecution, like judge-initiated prosecution, likewise violates American separation-of-powers principles.

<i>Questions:</i> <i>(a)</i> Would granting the victims of serious crimes a formal right to compel prosecution (when there is sufficient legally admissible evidence) give victims undue control over the prosecutor’s resource-allocation decisions and result in less effective law enforcement? Or would such a right tend to correct resource allocation decisions that disfavor minorities and other disadvantaged groups? How could we ensure that, in practice, victims’ rights of this sort do not serve merely to enhance the leverage of groups that may already have disproportionate influence?</p>
<p id="77268fc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Granting victims a right to compel prosecution could lead to even more cases being brought that trigger very long prison sentences attached to the highest grades of many offenses. Would that outcome represent progress, in the sense that the legislative will was being more fully respected? Or would this role contradict legislative sentencing judgments premised on the worst instances of a given offense, without intending for such sentences to be imposed on a regular basis? In an age already characterized by unprecedented levels of incarceration, would giving victims such a role exacerbate existing problems of systemic harshness and misallocation of resources? Are victims well placed to make systemically appropriate decisions in individual cases?</p>

<i>3. Victim participation in the prosecutor’s charging decision.</i> Every American jurisdiction grants victims a right to be kept informed about the course of the investigation and to discuss the case with the prosecutor. The federal statute, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 (CVRA), is typical. It provides victims with the right to notice of hearings, the right to attend those hearings, and a “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government,” 18 U.S.C. §3771(a) (2016). Some have argued that this statute vests victims with rights even before prosecutors choose to bring formal charges, but the Department of Justice has taken the view that victims do not have rights under the Act until prosecutors file a complaint, information, or indictment. See Paul G. Cassell et al., Crime Victims’ Rights During Criminal Investigations?, 104 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 59, 61-62 (2014). The issue arose in a case involving juvenile victims of sex abuse who argued they should have received advance notice of the government’s decision to offer the abuser a nonprosecution agreement. The government contended that because formal charges were never brought, no notice was required under the Act. In Doe v. United States, 950 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1266 (S.D. Fla. 2013), the court disagreed with the government and held that “the CVRA can apply before formal <span title="1193" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1193">p. 1193</span>charges are filed against an accused.” State laws vary on whether victims receive notice before charges are filed. Cassell et al., supra, at 98-101.</p>
<p id="77268fc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether jurisdictions provide victims with notice of possible charges in advance or not, they are in universal agreement that victims cannot control or legally challenge the charging decision. Those who support this limit on a victim’s involvement typically stress that the victim’s individual interest in “safety and redress” must be subordinate to “the effective and efficient administration of law enforcement.” Dix v. Superior Court, 807 P.2d 1063, 1067 (Cal. 1991). One observer asks why victims should play a large role in charging decisions when they “would be instantly disqualified from serving on the defendant’s jury.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1029F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1029F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span> But if victims cannot have a voice in charging decisions, is there too great a risk that prosecutors will not sufficiently account for victims’ concerns? See Erin Ann O’Hara, Victim Participation in the Criminal Process, 13 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 229, 233 (2005). If victims cannot control or challenge the charging decision, why should it matter whether they receive notice of pending investigations before a formal charge is brought? What kind of influence <i>should</i> victims exercise?</p>

<i>4. Domestic violence cases.</i> The historical treatment of domestic violence cases has presented a distinctive set of challenges. Until the 1980s, many police departments discouraged officers from making arrests in such cases; as a result, prosecutors seldom had to deal with them. In response to widespread concern that this approach was dangerous to women, police departments began to encourage or mandate an arrest, and some district attorneys’ offices adopted policies to encourage or mandate the filing of charges. Leigh Goodmark, A Troubled Marriage: Domestic Violence and the Legal System 107-113 (2012). The traditional problem—excessive use of the discretion not to prosecute—was largely erased.</p>
<p id="77268fc7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concerns began to emerge, however, about whether victims were now being hurt by the opposite problem—<i>over</i>enforcement. See Stephen J. Schulhofer, The Feminist Challenge in Criminal Law, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2151, 2158-2170 (1995). Mandatory arrest and “no-drop” prosecution policies typically require that charges must be pursued even without the victim’s consent, because of the danger that a battered woman, succumbing to intimidation, might (against her own real desires or interests) tell officials that she was opposed to the arrest or prosecution of her abuser. Although some studies suggest that mandatory arrest and prosecution deters batterers more effectively than discretionary policies do, other evidence suggests the reverse—that mandatory policies deter calls for help by women more than they deter violence by men, and that such policies may even aggravate subsequent violence by some types of defendants. (We consider this problem in more detail in connection with our discussion of battered woman’s syndrome, at pp. 832-840 supra.)</p>
<p id="77268fc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1194">p. 1194</span>There continues to be a broad consensus that prosecutors should press charges when the domestic violence victim supports this step, and indeed special evidentiary rules for domestic violence cases now make it easier for the government to win these prosecutions. See Erin Collins, The Evidentiary Rules of Engagement in the War Against Domestic Violence, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 397 (2015). But when the victim <i>opposes</i> prosecution or simply fails to cooperate, prosecutors disagree over whether they should respect the victim’s wishes or press charges anyway. Some victims’ advocates protest that the legal system endangers and in effect re-victimizes the battered woman if it fails to respect the victim’s own sense of what would be best for her. See, e.g., Linda G. Mills, Killing Her Softly: Intimate Abuse and the Violence of State Intervention, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 550 (1999). Many argue that criminalization should not be the only response available to the victims of domestic violence and contend that they should receive an array of options, including social services. Beth E. Richie, Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America’s Prison Nation 163 (2012). Others argue that a successful attack on domestic violence requires mandatory prosecution, and that “leaving the choice of prosecution to the victim . . . creates more problems than it solves.” Cheryl Hanna, No Right to Choose: Mandated Victim Participation in Domestic Violence Prosecutions, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1848, 1909 (1996).</p>
<p id="77268fc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the role of victims be any different in these cases? And if not, what should be the general approach when a victim prefers <i>leniency</i>? As the person most affected by a criminal offense, should the victim who desires leniency be given a decisive voice? Or are there substantial public interests that can justify prosecution even when the victim, after careful thought, decides that she prefers otherwise?</p>

<i>5. Victimless crimes.</i> If victim participation provides a valuable safeguard against misguided prosecutorial priorities or “selective indifference” to the concerns of particular groups, what safeguards can serve this function in the case of so-called victimless crimes? Drug cases represent a substantial segment of the workload in most prosecutors’ offices, and concerns about discriminatory patterns of investigation, arrest, and enforcement are probably more prominent in this area than in any other. What mechanisms should be available to prevent the abuse of discretion in the large volume of selective judgments that prosecutors inevitably must make with respect to drug crimes?</p>

<i>1. The European prosecution model.</i> Absent special circumstances, prosecutors in many European countries are required to file and pursue all charges for which there is evidence sufficient to support a conviction. The European prosecutor does have discretion, but that discretion is typically limited by statute and subject to judicial oversight. When a prosecuting attorney decides not to prosecute, he must give a written explanation for his action and obtain approval of his superior. Regina E. Rauxloh, Formalization of Plea Bargaining in Germany: Will the New Legislation Be Able to Square the Circle?, 34 Fordham Int’l L.J. 296 (2011); Erik Luna &amp; Marianne Wade, Prosecutors as Judges, 67 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1413, 1478 (2010); Ralph Grunewald, Comparing Injustices: Truth, Justice, and the System, 77 Alb. L. Rev. 1139, 1165-1166 (2014). Traditionally, European prosecutors lack the vast discretion American prosecutors enjoy regarding whether and how to bring a case, though the European system is becoming more American in practice. Luna &amp; Wade, supra at 1429-1430. Most decisions to forgo prosecution are subject to judicial review in Europe. See id. at 1450, 1478-1479; Shawn Marie Boyne, Procedural Economy in Pre-Trial Procedure: Developments in Germany and the United States, 24 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. 329, 345 (2015). Some observers doubt that judicial review imposes truly significant constraints. See Joachim Herrmann, Bargaining Justice—A Bargain for German Criminal Justice, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 755, 759 (1992) (“a judge consents as a matter of course”). Nonetheless, such review, even if a mere formality, provides a degree of accountability unknown in American criminal justice. In addition, aggrieved victims have standing to file a mandamus action that serves to compel prosecution when a dismissal is found to be unwarranted. See Richard S. Frase &amp; Thomas Weigend, German Criminal Justice as a Guide to American Law Reform, 18 B.C. Int’l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. 317, 338 (1995).</p>

<i>2. An illustration of European practice.</i> M.C. v. Bulgaria, [2003] ECHR 39272/98 (Eur. Ct. Hum. Rts.), illustrates common European practice. <span title="1196" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1196">p. 1196</span>A prosecutor initially rebuffed a date-rape victim’s efforts to press criminal charges. She then lodged a formal objection that required prosecutors to reopen the investigation. After more evidence was gathered, the local prosecutor decided that criminal charges were not warranted, but he was required to support this conclusion by a written opinion, which the victim then appealed to higher levels within the supervising state prosecutor’s office. Senior prosecutors concurred in the initial decision, supporting their views in two lengthy written opinions. Those opinions, in turn, formed the basis of the victim’s complaint to the European Court of Human Rights, which held that the prosecutors’ restrictive interpretation of their rape law, and their failure to go forward with a criminal prosecution, violated the victim’s right to protection of her bodily integrity, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. That procedural background and the substantive rape law issues raised by the case are considered in detail in Chapter 4, p. 391 supra.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> What social and systemic factors might make broad prosecutorial discretion not to charge more (or less) justifiable in the United States than in Europe? In proportion to caseloads, the resources available to the European prosecutor are greater than those available to American state prosecutors, but not significantly greater than those available to U.S. federal prosecutors. The resource constraint arguably makes charging discretion more necessary in American states than in Europe, though of course states and localities <i>choose</i> the level of funding they provide to their prosecutors and courts. Another contrast is that sentences authorized or mandated are far more severe in America than in Europe. In addition, European prosecutors tend to be professional bureaucrats with extensive training and merit-based selection on the basis of competitive national exams, and they are “expected to make decisions about individual cases on their merits, without regard to public attitudes, opinions, and emotions or to politicians’ preferences or priorities.” Michael Tonry, 41 Crime &amp; Just. 1, 2 (2012). In contrast, American prosecutors in charge of offices are typically elected and openly admit to responding to voter preferences and often campaign on promises to be tough on crime. Id. at 4. Do these factors make it more desirable—or less desirable—for prosecutors in America to have broad and unreviewable discretion not to pursue legally provable cases? Are there some subsets of cases—perhaps involving excessive use of force by the police or domestic violence—where special oversight over decisions not to charge is needed? Or would subject-matter specific review inject its own source of anti-defendant bias into the system?</p>

Those provisions treat one gram of crack as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. . . . These penalties result in sentences for crack offenders that average three to eight times longer than sentences for comparable powder offenders.</p><p id="7726de0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the disparity between the treatment of crack cocaine and powder cocaine is matched by the disparity between the severity of the punishment imposed by federal law and that imposed by state law for the same conduct. . . . For example, if respondent Hampton is found guilty, his federal sentence might be as long as a mandatory life term. Had he been tried in state court, his sentence could have been as short as 12 years, less worktime credits of half that amount.</p><p id="7726de0f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, it is undisputed that the brunt of the elevated federal penalties falls heavily on blacks. While 65% of the persons who have used crack are white, in 1993 they represented only 4% of the federal offenders convicted of trafficking in crack. Eighty-eight percent of such defendants were black. . . . The Sentencing Commission acknowledges that the heightened crack penalties are a “primary cause of the growing disparity between sentences for Black and White federal defendants.”</p><p id="7726de10-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The extraordinary severity of the imposed penalties and the troubling racial patterns of enforcement give rise to a special concern about the fairness of charging practices for crack offenses. [T]he District Judge . . . acted well within her discretion to call for the development of facts that would demonstrate what standards, if any, governed the choice of forum where similarly situated offenders are prosecuted. . . . 
</p><p id="7726de11-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority discounts the probative value of [respondents’] affidavits, claiming that they recounted “hearsay.” . . . But the [affidavit of defense attorney] Reed offered information based on his own extensive experience in both federal and state courts. . . . The criticism that the affidavits were based on “anecdotal evidence” is also unpersuasive. [D]efendants do not need to prepare sophisticated statistical studies in order to receive mere discovery in cases like this one. Certainly evidence based on a drug counselor’s personal observations or on an attorney’s practice in two sets of courts, state and federal, can “tend to show the existence” of a selective prosecution.</p><p id="7726de12-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

There can be no doubt that such individuals exist, and indeed the Government has never denied the same. . . . I fail to see why the District Court was unable to take judicial notice of this obvious fact and demand information from the Government’s files to support or refute respondents’ evidence. The presumption that some whites are prosecuted in state court is not “contradicted” by the statistics the majority cites, which show only that high percentages of blacks are convicted of certain federal crimes, while high percentages of whites are convicted of other federal crimes. Those figures are entirely consistent with the allegation of selective prosecution. . . . The District Court, therefore, was entitled to find the evidence before her significant and to require some explanation from the Government.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103FF_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N103FF_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span>

The very act of stereotyping is constitutionally illegitimate. . . . By contrast, when it came to “the presumption that people of all races commit all types of crimes,” . . . the Court [in <i>Armstrong</i>] took precisely the opposite tack. Relying on a somewhat circular set of statistics that showed that more than ninety percent of the defendants sentenced for crack-related offenses were black, it declared that “presumptions at war with presumably reliable statistics have no proper place in the analysis of this issue.” [In no other area is the Court] prepared to assume, based on ambiguous statistics, that blacks and whites differ in a legally cognizable way. That the Court adopts such a position here illustrates a broader point. . . . Whatever the Court says about its commitment to ridding the criminal justice process of racial discrimination, it is in fact quite skeptical that this can be done, at least at an acceptable social cost.

<i>1. Disparate patterns.</i> In <i>Armstrong</i>, the lower courts inferred a pattern of discriminatory enforcement based on two factual assumptions—that both whites and blacks were committing crack offenses and that only blacks were <span title="1202" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1202">p. 1202</span>being prosecuted in federal court. Which of these alleged facts does the Supreme Court seem to question? Does the Court consider it possible that significant numbers of whites <i>were</i> being prosecuted in federal court, or does the Court believe that no significant numbers of whites were committing crack offenses? Note the statistics cited by the Court—that more than 90 percent of those convicted on federal crack charges were black,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1044B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1044B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">21</a></span> while 93 percent of those convicted on federal LSD charges were white. The Court concludes that these statistics contradict the lower courts’ assumption that whites are also committing crack cocaine offenses. Do they? Under what circumstances would these statistics be <i>irrelevant</i> to the lower courts’ analysis?</p>
<p id="7727052c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. </i>Armstrong<i>’s impact.</i> The Court says that in order to establish the prima facie case of discrimination required to get discovery, a complainant must offer evidence that “similarly situated persons of other races were prosecuted by the State of California and were known to federal law enforcement officers, but were not prosecuted in federal court.” This requirement can pose a significant barrier to obtaining discovery in aid of a selective prosecution claim because evidence of unprosecuted violations is difficult to obtain without access to government files, since these violations often occur in private and cannot be uncovered without police work. Richard H. McAdams, Race and Selective Prosecution, Discovering the Pitfalls of <i>Armstrong</i>, 73 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 605, 618-623 (1998). Courts, moreover, have held that providing one or two cases where someone of a different race was treated differently is not sufficient to establish the prima facie case.</p>
<p id="7727052d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, courts seem to interpret the “similarly situated” language to require defendants to identify uncharged individuals who are virtually identical to themselves. Consider the facts in United States v. Lewis, 517 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2008), involving a defendant charged with false statements on a federal firearms application. Lewis sought discovery to demonstrate that he was singled out for prosecution because he is African American and Muslim. To meet the threshold for discovery, Lewis “introduced a series of analyses showing that over a three-year period no one else [who had no prior record] had been prosecuted in the District of Massachusetts for a weapons-related offense as picayune as misstating an address on a federal firearms application. [He argued] that statistical probability indicates that while white non-Muslims quite probably have committed such minor infractions, they have not been prosecuted.” Id. at 26. The appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision that the “pool of offenders situated similarly to the defendant consisted of non-African-Americans and/or non-Muslims who had committed multiple misrepresentation offenses in connection with firearms paperwork, who posed a danger of violence, and who may have had links to terrorism.” Was this an appropriate way to define the pool? Or did the court set the bar too high?</p>

<i>3. The federalism issue.</i> The selective prosecution claim in <i>Armstrong</i> is atypical in a sense, because the complaint is not that white defendants are not prosecuted at all, but only that they are prosecuted in state courts, where penalties generally are lower. What considerations and what features of a case should legitimately affect the federal prosecutor’s judgment about whether federal rather than state prosecution is appropriate? See pp. 1185-1186 supra.</p>
<p id="7727052f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The transparency issue.</i> The immediate goal of the defendants in <i>Armstrong</i> was simply to get discovery, in order to reveal the criteria being used to make charging decisions. The Court’s approach to that issue was governed by its sense that exposure of such information could be harmful. Based on that view, the Court believed the threshold showing required to obtain such information should be “demanding,” so that it will pose “a significant barrier.” One could, of course, argue the opposite—that the public would be well served by making such information available on a routine basis, even when no one is alleging an egregious abuse of discretion. Are there good reasons to protect the confidentiality of information about the prosecutor’s charging criteria? If so, should such information be protected across the board, or should the public interest in disclosure prevail at least with respect to some aspects of the prosecutor’s charging policies?</p>
<p id="77270530-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Crack reform.</i> For cases brought after its effective date, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, reduced the disparity between federal penalties for crack-cocaine and powder-cocaine offenses from a 100:1 ratio to an 18:1 ratio. The law also eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack. Does Congress’s passage of this law show that judicial involvement was unnecessary? Or does the long period of time before Congress addressed the issue (more than two decades after the crack/powder disparity was put into place), the lack of retroactive relief for those continuing to serve sentences under the old 100:1 ratio, and the continued disparity in the 18:1 ratio suggest that the political process is a poor outlet for resolving discriminatory effects?</p>

<p id="77270533-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In highly publicized congressional testimony, Attorney General John Ashcroft proclaimed his intention to use every available means to combat terrorists operating in the United States. He likened his approach to the one Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy used in cracking down on organized crime—tracking terror suspects and arresting them for any offense they commit, no matter how trivial. He said he would prosecute them even for “spitting on the sidewalk.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1049B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1049B_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span>

<span title="1204" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1204">p. 1204</span>Should this tactic be considered legitimate? If citizens considered above suspicion are never prosecuted for spitting on the sidewalk, then the only people prosecuted and jailed will be those whom the attorney general suspects of doing or planning something else. Should it matter whether the attorney general can show any basis for his suspicions? Should it matter what penalty is authorized for spitting on the sidewalk? Suppose a state law authorizes a penalty of up to two years in prison for spitting on the sidewalk, jaywalking, or driving even one mile per hour faster than the posted speed limit. When someone happens to violate one of these provisions, is it appropriate to file criminal charges and seek the maximum prison sentence only because a prosecutor suspects the person of more serious wrongdoing?

Since the indictment charged that the victim of the kidnaping was not liberated unharmed, petitioner faced a maximum penalty of death if the verdict of the jury should so recommend. Petitioner, represented by competent counsel throughout, first elected to plead not guilty. . . . Upon learning that his codefendant, who had confessed to the authorities, would plead guilty and be available to testify against him, petitioner changed his plea to guilty. His plea was accepted after the trial judge twice questioned him as to the voluntariness of his plea.

</p><p id="77272c51-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the agents of the State may not produce a plea by actual or threatened physical harm or by mental coercion overbearing the will of the defendant. But nothing of the sort is claimed in this case; nor is there evidence that Brady was so gripped by fear of the death penalty or hope of leniency that he did not or could not, with the help of counsel, rationally weigh the advantages of going to trial against the advantages of pleading guilty. Brady’s claim is of a different sort: [T]hat a guilty plea is coerced and invalid if influenced by the fear of a possibly higher penalty for the crime charged if a conviction is obtained after the State is put to its proof.</p><p id="77272c52-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Insofar as the voluntariness of his plea is concerned, there is little to differentiate Brady from (1) the defendant, in a jurisdiction where the judge and jury have the same range of sentencing power, who pleads guilty because his lawyer advises him that the judge will very probably be more lenient than the jury; (2) the defendant, in a jurisdiction where the judge alone has sentencing power, who is advised by counsel that the judge is normally more lenient with defendants who plead guilty than with those who go to trial; (3) the defendant who is permitted by prosecutor and judge to plead guilty to a lesser offense included in the offense charged; and (4) the defendant who pleads guilty to certain counts with the understanding that other charges will be dropped. In each of these situations,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104FA_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N104FA_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> as in Brady’s case, the defendant might never plead guilty absent the possibility or certainty that the plea will result in a lesser penalty than the sentence that could be imposed after a trial and a verdict of guilty. We decline to hold, however, that a guilty plea is compelled and invalid under the Fifth Amendment whenever motivated by the defendant’s desire to accept the certainty or probability of a lesser penalty rather than face a wider range of possibilities extending from acquittal to conviction and a higher penalty authorized by law for the crime charged.</p><p id="77272c54-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue we deal with is inherent in the criminal law and its administration because guilty pleas are not constitutionally forbidden, because the criminal law characteristically extends to judge or jury a range of choice in setting the sentence in individual cases, and because both the State and the defendant often find it advantageous to preclude the possibility of the maximum penalty authorized by law. For a defendant who sees slight possibility of acquittal, the advantages of pleading guilty and limiting the probable penalty are obvious—his exposure is reduced, the correctional processes can begin immediately, and the practical burdens of a trial are eliminated. For the State there are also advantages—the more promptly imposed punishment <span title="1206" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1206">p. 1206</span>after an admission of guilt may more effectively attain the objectives of punishment; and with the avoidance of trial, scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources are conserved for those cases in which there is a substantial issue of the defendant’s guilt or in which there is substantial doubt that the State can sustain its burden of proof. It is this mutuality of advantage that perhaps explains the fact that at present well over three-fourths of the criminal convictions in this country rest on pleas of guilty, a great many of them no doubt motivated at least in part by the hope or assurance of a lesser penalty than might be imposed if there were a guilty verdict after a trial to judge or jury.</p><p id="77272c55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, that the prevalence of guilty pleas is explainable does not necessarily validate those pleas or the system which produces them. But we cannot hold that it is unconstitutional for the State to extend a benefit to a defendant who in turn extends a substantial benefit to the State and who demonstrates by his plea that he is ready and willing to admit his crime and to enter the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period of time than might otherwise be necessary. . . . 
</p><p id="77272c56-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532 (1897), held that the admissibility of a confession depended upon whether it was compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. To be admissible, a confession must be “‘free and voluntary: that is, must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence.’” . . . 
<i>Bram</i> dealt with a confession given by a defendant in custody, alone and unrepresented by counsel. In such circumstances, even a mild promise of leniency was deemed sufficient to bar the confession, not because the promise was an illegal act as such, but because defendants at such times are too sensitive to inducement and the possible impact on them too great to ignore and too difficult to assess. . . .

His plea of guilty was entered in open court and before a judge obviously sensitive to the requirements of the law with respect to guilty pleas.

</p><p id="77272c5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that guilty plea convictions hold no hazards for the innocent or that the methods of taking guilty pleas presently employed in this country are necessarily valid in all respects. This mode of conviction is no more foolproof than full trials to the court or to the jury. . . . We would have serious doubts about this case if the encouragement of guilty pleas by offers of leniency substantially increased the likelihood that defendants, advised by competent counsel, would falsely condemn themselves. But our view is to the contrary and is based on our expectations that courts will satisfy themselves that pleas of guilty are voluntarily and intelligently made by competent defendants with adequate advice of counsel and that there is nothing to question the accuracy and reliability of the defendants’ admissions that they committed the crimes with which they are charged. . . .

<p id="77272c61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t may be reasonable to equate a competently counseled guilty plea with a knowing guilty plea. . . . In <i>Brady</i>, however, the Supreme Court seemed to conclude that a competently counseled guilty plea would ordinarily be, not only a knowing plea, but a voluntary plea as well. [But] the presence of counsel has little relevance to the question of voluntariness. A guilty plea entered at gunpoint is no less involuntary because an attorney is present to explain how the gun works.</p>
<p id="77272c62-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under today’s guilty-plea system, the basic function of the defense attorney is indeed to explain “how the gun works”—something that was illustrated by the record in <i>Brady</i>. . . . The defense attorney had two allies in his effort to persuade the defendant to plead guilty. The trial judge announced from the bench that he thought the defendant “might get the death penalty.” Moreover, when the defense attorney told the judge in chambers that he thought that a guilty plea would probably be entered at a later date, the judge replied, “Well, I think you are very wise, because I was certainly going to submit the death penalty to the jury.” The attorney dutifully reported this comment to the defendant.</p>
<p id="77272c63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant’s mother may also have been influential in altering the defendant’s choice of plea. She attempted to visit the defendant in jail but found that “it wasn’t visiting hours.” She testified:</p>

Brady came to the window and he said, “Mom what are you doing? You are going to get yourself in trouble,” and I just said, “For God’s sake, plead guilty. They are going to give you the death sentence.”</p>

<p id="77272c65-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it became apparent that a codefendant would probably testify against him, the defendant agreed to plead guilty. The defense attorney reported that he “felt very gratified when [the defendant] decided to change his plea in that we saved him from a death penalty in my opinion.”</p>
<p id="77272c66-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defense attorney was, I think, entitled to feel gratified; he had done a capable job and may indeed have saved the defendant from a death sentence. The defendant’s principal complaint did not, however, concern his attorney’s performance; it was directed to the fact that exercise of the right to trial might have incurred an awesome penalty. This underlying reality was beyond the defense attorney’s control but not beyond the control of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="77275377-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrary to the Supreme Court’s suggestion, the presence of the defense attorney in <i>Brady</i> did not “dissipate” the “possibly coercive impact” of this reality. Indeed, the record in <i>Brady</i> suggests that the principal function of a competent attorney in the guilty-plea system is exactly the opposite of the function suggested by the Supreme Court. Rather than dispel the coercive impact of a promise of leniency, the attorney must make the defendant realize with full clarity the coercive power of the alternatives that he faces. In that way, the attorney may persuade the defendant to choose the course that within the confines of a cynical system, is likely to injure him least.</p>

<i>1. Guilty plea procedure.</i> As <i>Brady</i> indicates, a guilty plea, to be valid, must be the product of a knowing and intelligent choice, and it must be “voluntary,” in the sense that it does not result from threats or promises <i>other than</i> those involved in any plea agreement. Before accepting a guilty plea, the trial judge typically will address the defendant in open court, in a colloquy that makes explicit the elements of the offense, the potential sentence, and the three principal rights being waived by the plea (the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to jury trial, and the right to confront one’s accusers). See, e.g., Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c), (d).</p>
<p id="7727537b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Knowing and intelligent.</i> The Supreme Court in <i>Brady</i> stated that defendants need “sufficient awareness of relevant circumstances” and any “direct consequences” of a guilty plea for it to be knowing and intelligent. <i>Brady</i>, 397 U.S. at 748, 755. What are those relevant circumstances and direct consequences? Courts are clear that maximum sentence exposure is one. Should defendants also be told of mandatory minimum sentences? The Third Circuit believes so, reasoning that “the mandatory minimum sentence <span title="1209" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1209">p. 1209</span>may be far more relevant than the theoretical maximum because that is rarely imposed.” See Jamison v. Klem, 544 F.3d 266, 277 (3d Cir. 2008). Why did the Court in <i>Brady</i> focus on “direct” consequences and not collateral consequences? Note that collateral consequences, such as termination of federal benefits or the loss of a professional license, can be enormously significant, especially if the “direct” consequence is only a small fine.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105BD_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105BD_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">23</a></span> For an argument that prosecutors and judges should take on a greater role in notifying defendants about collateral consequences of pleas, see Brian M. Murray, Beyond the Right to Counsel: Increasing Notice of Collateral Consequences, 49 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1139 (2015).</p>
<p id="7727537d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Effective assistance of counsel.</i> The Supreme Court has recently paid greater attention to the importance of trial counsel during plea bargaining. In Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399, 1407 (2012), the Court explicitly acknowledged “[t]he reality . . . that plea bargains have become so central to the administration of the criminal justice system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargaining process.” Those duties include informing defendants of formal plea offers that may be favorable to the accused, id. at 1408, and advising them about possible deportation consequences before they plead guilty, Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).</p>
<p id="7727537e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When counsel is ineffective at the plea bargaining stage, there remains the question of what remedy is appropriate if the defendant ultimately rejects the plea offer and receives a longer sentence after being convicted at a fair trial. The Supreme Court recently rejected the argument that a subsequent trial automatically cures any defect at the plea-bargaining stage so that no additional remedy is necessary. Instead, the Court held that trial courts should have the discretion to determine whether the appropriate remedy is to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea proposal, to adhere to the post-trial sentence, or to issue a sentence somewhere in between. Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1388-1390 (2012). For an argument that these recent cases signal a broad recognition of the right to effective counsel at plea bargaining and an outline of the specific professional standards that should apply, see Jenny Roberts, Effective Plea Bargaining Counsel, 122 Yale L.J. 2650 (2013). For a more skeptical view that sees these cases as minor steps forward, see Albert W. Alschuler, <i>Lafler</i> and <i>Frye</i>: Two Small Band-Aids for a Festering Wound, 51 Duq. L. Rev. 673 (2013).</p>

<i>4. The extent of plea bargaining.</i> At the time of the <i>Brady</i> decision, 70-85 percent of American felony convictions were obtained by guilty plea. The guilty plea rate has risen substantially since the Court expressly endorsed the process. Nationally, about 94 percent of state court felony convictions <span title="1210" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1210">p. 1210</span>are currently obtained by guilty plea,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105E8_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105E8_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">24</a></span> and in the federal courts, the figure is about 97 percent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105F4_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105F4_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span> These statistics led the Supreme Court in <i>Frye</i> to concede that “[i]n today’s criminal justice system . . . the negotiation of a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost always the critical point for a defendant.” 132 S. Ct. at 1407. Nonetheless, there are variations in guilty plea rates, both among states and among jurisdictions within states. Moreover, the variations do not seem to correspond to differences in population or other factors indicative of caseload pressure. In some states, for example, guilty plea rates are more prevalent in rural than in urban counties, and guilty plea rates are much greater in some large cities than in others. One study found that for cities with populations over 500,000, the mean guilty plea rate was 93 percent in New York State but only 65 percent in Pennsylvania.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10605_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10605_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">26</a></span> The guilty plea rate, moreover, cannot be equated with the <i>bargaining</i> rate. Studies suggest that many defendants plead guilty even though they have no expectation of receiving more lenient treatment in return.</p>
<p id="77275383-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Suppose the defendant and his counsel do not <i>negotiate</i> for a specific sentencing concession; instead they decide on a guilty plea because they believe, in light of past experience, that the judge will probably impose a more lenient sentence than he would impose if the defendant is convicted at trial. Should a guilty plea tendered for that reason be considered the product of “plea bargaining”? Is a practice of tacit or indirect inducements preferable to one in which parties negotiate explicitly and the defendant knows in advance the precise difference between the sentences to be imposed after a plea and after conviction at trial?</p>
<p id="77275384-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Honoring the bargain.</i> In Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971), the Court held that if the prosecution fails to honor commitments made to the defendant in exchange for his or her plea, then the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea. This safeguard does not, however, mean that the defendant who pleads guilty will receive precisely the sentence he or she expects. The prosecutor’s commitment might take the form of a promise to dismiss certain counts or to “recommend” a certain sentence to the judge; the bargain is therefore fulfilled if the prosecutor takes the action promised, even if the judge then imposes a different sentence from the one the defendant expected. Defendants who seek a commitment that a specific sentence <i>will</i> be imposed are sometimes told that local practice forbids that sort of offer because it intrudes upon the sentencing authority of the judge. Are nonbinding recommendations a preferable form of guilty plea inducement, because they preserve the judge’s role in setting the appropriate punishment? Or are they undesirable because they can mislead a defendant about <span title="1211" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1211">p. 1211</span>the actual value of his plea bargain? For discussion, see Wes R. Porter, The Pendulum in Federal Sentencing Can Also Swing Toward Predictability: A Renewed Role for Binding Plea Agreements Post<i>-Booker</i>, 37 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 469, 515-523 (2011).</p>
<p id="77275385-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>6. The trial judge’s role.</i> ABA Standards provide that the trial judge may not initiate plea discussions, but if the parties request her to become involved, she is free to meet and indicate the plea concessions that she would consider appropriate. ABA Standards: Pleas of Guilty, §14-3.3(c). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure forbid judicial participation in plea negotiation (Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)), but they also provide that the judge must explicitly accept or reject an agreement and must inform the parties whether she is willing to be bound by it. Id., Rule 11(e)(3), (4). As a result, the judge in federal cases is inevitably an unseen but important presence in negotiations, with decisive power to control the contours of any bargain if she wishes to do so. For discussion of the issues, see Albert W. Alschuler, The Trial Judge’s Role in Plea Bargaining, Part I, 76 Colum. L. Rev. 1059 (1976).</p>
<p id="77275386-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To what extent is it desirable for the judge who will try a case to discuss with the defendant the sentence reduction she will grant in return for a guilty plea? Is judicial involvement of this sort unduly coercive? Or is it beneficial because it allows the defendant to find out what his plea bargain is really worth? Should the judge seek to provide unambiguous information without coercion, or are these features just two sides of the same coin?</p>
<p id="77275387-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Jenia Iontcheva Turner analyzed three jurisdictions (Connecticut, Florida, and Germany) that permit greater judicial involvement in plea negotiations than the federal system does, and she is optimistic that safeguards can guard against judicial coercion. Turner, Judicial Participation in Plea Negotiations: A Comparative View, 54 Am. J. Comp. L. 199 (2006). Some of the safeguards she discusses are (1) placing all plea discussions with the judge on the record and having appellate courts closely monitor the exchanges for coercion; (2) prohibiting judges from initiating plea discussions; and (3) precluding a judge who is involved with plea discussions from presiding over the trial or sentencing of the case should the defendant ultimately decide not to plead guilty or withdraw his plea. Id. at 262-263. Are these sound policies? What are the tradeoffs with adopting these measures? For a 50-state review of judicial participation in the plea process, see Rishi Raj Batra, Judicial Participation in Plea Bargaining: A Dispute Resolution Perspective, 76 Ohio St. L.J. 565 (2015).</p>

<i>Questions:</i> If a trial with the full package of due process safeguards is simply too time-consuming and expensive to provide in every criminal case, should jurisdictions seek, in lieu of plea bargaining, to solve that problem by streamlining their trial procedures while ensuring that these more efficient trials are afforded without penalty to every defendant who wants one?

<p id="77277aa7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In one approach to the resource problem, pioneered in Philadelphia, defendants typically receive no inducement to plead guilty but gain sentencing concessions by waiving their right to a jury and accepting a bench trial.

<i>2. The propriety of sentencing concessions.</i>
</b> Is there a legitimate justification for imposing a lower sentence on a defendant who pleads guilty than on a defendant whose offense and other relevant circumstances are identical, except that he was found guilty at trial? In United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135 (1st Cir. 1998), three members of a cocaine distribution conspiracy pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time served, 17 months, and 60 months respectively, with the differences primarily reflecting differences in their prior records. Two of their co-conspirators, whose records were comparable and whose alleged roles in the offense were essentially identical, pleaded not guilty; after conviction at trial, they were sentenced to 235 months and 260 months respectively. Why should the defendants who chose to go to trial have received longer sentences? Why should they have received sentences that were <i>that much</i> longer?</p>
<p id="77277aab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courthouse legend has it that many a judge will justify these kinds of sentence differentials by explaining openly and without embarrassment, “He takes some of my time; I take some of his.” Are there better reasons? The American Bar Association has noted that concessions are appropriate when a defendant is “genuinely contrite;” when concessions allow for “alternative correction measures”; when “the defendant, by making public trial unnecessary, has demonstrated genuine remorse or consideration for the victims”; and when the defendant’s cooperation results in the prosecution of others who have committed equally serious or more serious crimes.

But, by the same token, the defendant who pleads innocent and is acquitted receives no sentence.

<p id="77277ab1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The situation is quite different when the prosecutor engages in bargaining not because he is willing to take a sure half loaf rather than to await the outcome of a trial, but because his limited resources convince him he must deter defendants from demanding a trial. The divide between the two situations may be difficult to locate for even the best-intentioned prosecutor, and even more difficult for a trial judge to review. . . . But this reality imposes a special duty upon courts to provide what guidance they can for prosecutors entrusted with such discretion. In the area of plea bargaining, the lodestar must be the realization that our law solemnly promises each man accused his day in court. If a prosecutor enters plea and charge negotiations not with the purpose of adjusting the charge to reflect the uncertainties of litigation but with the goal of deterring the defendant from the exercise of his right to a trial, the chasm between promise and reality is no narrower because the trial court affects a righteous air of non-involvement.</p>

<i>3. Cooperation.</i>
</b> The ABA highlights cooperation as an appropriate ground for making a sentencing concession in a plea deal. At the federal level, the number one basis for a departure below the recommended sentencing guideline is a prosecution motion that the defendant provided substantial assistance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10701_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10701_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">28</a></span> Offering substantial assistance to the government is also the only way for most defendants to avoid an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C. §3553(e). In a letter opposing reforms to federal mandatory minimum laws, an organization representing Assistant United States Attorneys emphasized that those sentences are needed to entice defendants to cooperate and to enable prosecutors to work their way “up the food <span title="1215" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1215">p. 1215</span>chain” of drug conspiracies. Letter from the Natl. Assn. of Asst. U.S. Attorneys to Patrick Leahy, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Comm. 2-3, available at https://www.naausa.org /2013/images/docs/MandMinSentencingLegOppose 013114.pdf (Jan. 31, 2014). On what theory of punishment is cooperation worthy of a sentencing discount? Are cooperation discounts different in principle from discounts for waiving the right to trial? If so, which practice is more dubious?</p>
<p id="77277ab4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What are the costs of giving discounts to cooperators? For a general discussion, see Miriam Hechler Baer, Cooperation’s Cost, 88 Wash. U. L. Rev. 903 (2011). Note that only defendants who know about other offenders can obtain this discount. As a result, a bigger fish in a criminal organization, because he knows of lots of other criminal activity, often can obtain a significant discount, yet those at the lowest level may have nothing to offer and receive a much higher sentence. Is there adequate justification for imposing more severe sentences on the defendants at the lowest levels of criminal responsibility? The Innocence Project estimates that 15 percent of the wrongful conviction cases involved false testimony by informants who had incentives to lie, including from deals with prosecutors for lower sentences.

<b>
<i>4. Criminal history.</i>
</b> Sentencing laws that mandate long sentences for repeat offenders increase the bargaining power of prosecutors because offenders with criminal histories face especially long sentences if convicted at trial. As a result, one scholar argues, prosecutors effectively bear a lower burden of proof in cases involving recidivists than cases with first-time offenders. Russell D. Covey, Longitudinal Guilt: Repeat Offenders, Plea Bargaining, and the Variable Standard of Proof, 63 Fla. L. Rev. 431 (2011). Is this situation justified by the offender’s criminal past or should greater protections be in place to ensure that an offender with a criminal history is not coerced into pleading guilty to a crime he or she did not commit?</p>

<b>
<i>5. Freedom of choice.</i>
</b> Many critics of plea bargaining believe that defendants are harmed by sentencing concessions that pressure them to waive their trial rights. Others see plea bargaining through the lens of contract, arguing that defendants who take pleas view their trial rights as worth less than the leniency they gained by “selling” them; if not, they would have rejected the offer. As in a commercial transaction, when each party can choose whether to accept or reject a proposal, an agreement they both prefer to accept seems, by definition, to leave them better off (in their own best judgment) than they would be without the deal. Consider Robert E. Scott &amp; William J. Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101 Yale L.J. 1909, 1914-1915 (1992):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="77277ab7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant has the right to . . . force the prosecutor to prove the case at trial. The prosecutor has the right to seek the maximum sentence. . . . It is easy to imagine some circumstances where each party values the other’s entitlement more than his own. If so, the conditions exist for an exchange that <span title="1216" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1216">p. 1216</span>benefits both parties and harms neither.

</p>
<p id="77277ab8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, the gains the participants realize from the exchange presumably have <i>social</i> value, not just value to the bargaining parties. Plea bargaining provides a means by which prosecutors can obtain a larger net return from criminal convictions, holding resources constant. Criminal defendants, as a group, are able to reduce the risk of the imposition of maximum sanctions. . . .  In short, the existence of entitlements implies the right to exploit those entitlements fully, which in turn implies the right to trade the entitlement or any of its associated risks.</p>
</div>
<p id="77277ab9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> <i>(a)</i> Given that prosecutors are entitled to seek the maximum sentence for any provable offense, does it follow that the existence of those entitlements “implies the right to exploit those entitlements fully”? Or are there considerations, independent of the plea, that should guide the prosecutor’s judgment about the appropriate sanction?</p>
<p id="7727a1ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> As applied to a defendant like Brady (p. 1204 supra), who faced the death penalty, is it plausible to consider his guilty plea a voluntary choice? Or, as Alschuler puts it (p. 1207 supra), was his decision in effect made “at gunpoint,” like a robbery victim who agrees to turn over his cash to avoid physical violence? Should plea bargains be treated like coerced confessions, where too much pressure renders the defendant’s choice unlawful? See Dripps, supra. Does it make a meaningful difference that Brady’s predicament resulted only because there was a significant chance of <i>lawfully</i> sentencing him to death after conviction at trial?</p>
<p id="7727a1cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> If a bargain is beneficial to a particular defendant (because of the severe sentence he would face after conviction at trial), does it follow that the institution of plea bargaining benefits defendants <i>as a group</i>? The unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids bargains in which parties agree to abandon their constitutional rights, because such bargains may detract from overall social welfare. Absent such a doctrine, individuals might nevertheless agree to such socially destructive bargains. For an argument that plea bargains place unconstitutional conditions on the exercise of the jury trial right, see Robert Schehr, The Emperor’s New Clothes: Intellectual Dishonesty and the Unconstitutionality of Plea-Bargaining, 2 Tex. A&amp;M L. Rev. 385 (2015). The Court’s willingness to accept plea bargaining appears to be an exception to the general rule against bargaining away constitutional rights. Why should criminal trial rights be treated differently from other constitutional rights?</p>
<p id="7727a1cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plea-bargaining system presumably benefits defendants generally if—after abolition of plea bargaining—defendants convicted at trial would face the same severe sentences that they had faced before abolition; such defendants would be worse off after abolition than when they were able to plead guilty in exchange for leniency. But if guilty plea concessions were abolished, would society impose on <i>all</i> defendants the relatively severe sentences that are now reserved for defendants who refuse to plead guilty? What would happen to <span title="1217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1217">p. 1217</span>prison populations and state budgets in that event? Alternatively, if the abolition of guilty plea concessions required a substantial reduction of average sentences imposed after conviction at trial, would defendants <i>as a group</i> be better or worse off than they were in the system that permits plea bargaining?</p>
<p id="7727a1cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d)</i> Josh Bowers argues that the system of plea bargaining helps one common type of innocent defendant: an innocent recidivist in a low-stakes case. He argues that such a defendant is better off with the option of a plea bargain than not having such an option because the guilty plea often gets that defendant out of pretrial detention quickly and avoids an unwelcome pretrial process. Josh Bowers, Punishing the Innocent, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1117 (2008). But is the plea-bargaining system—the practice of imposing higher sentences on defendants who go to trial—necessary for the innocent defendant in misdemeanor cases to realize those benefits? Why can’t jurisdictions abolish plea <i>bargaining</i> without insisting that every defendant go through a full trial?</p>

<b>
<i>6. Structural problems.</i>
</b> Can we be reasonably confident that defendants considering a plea offer will make the choice that is in their own best interest? Of course, “buyer’s remorse” is a common phenomenon in ordinary commercial transactions; it does not in itself suggest that consumers should be prohibited from buying what they think they want. But plea bargaining presents an additional complication because—unlike a contract negotiation between a single buyer and seller—the relevant parties to a plea bargain (the defendant and the public) are each represented by agents (the defense attorney and the prosecutor). And those agents may be influenced by personal interests at odds with the best interests of the party they represent. Are there times when a plea bargain could be to the advantage of a prosecutor, even though it was not in the best interests of the public? Prosecutors, particularly in large counties and districts, face crushing caseloads. Some commentators argue that these resource pressures create an environment where prosecutors are “asked to commit malpractice on a daily basis by handling far more cases than any lawyer can competently manage,” which can lead to errors that harm defendants, victims, and the public. Adam M. Gershowitz &amp; Laura R. Killinger, The State (Never) Rests: How Excessive Prosecutorial Caseloads Harm Criminal Defendants, 105 Nw. U. L. Rev. 261, 263-265 (2011). For a discussion of cognitive factors that may distort prosecutorial priorities, see Sarah Anne Mourer, Believe It or Not: Mitigating the Negative Effects Personal Belief and Bias Have on the Criminal Justice System, 43 Hofstra L.

<b>
<i>7. Penalties and coercion.</i>
</b> The very phrase plea “bargain” suggests that defendants get a benefit for pleading guilty. But another way to view the dynamic is that defendants get penalized for opting to go to trial. How one characterizes the nature of the arrangement may depend on how big the difference is between the offer made and the sentence a defendant receives if he or she goes to trial. In the 1970s, when the official acknowledgment and endorsement of plea bargaining was still recent, statistics suggested that, on average, the sentencing concession received for a guilty plea was small or nonexistent. See Stephen J. Schulhofer, Due Process of Sentencing, 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 733, 757 &amp; n.97 (1980). Current data indicate, however, that “the trial penalty has ballooned in magnitude” and is now substantial; controlling for relevant differences among cases, sentences after jury trial were on average three times longer than sentences imposed in comparable cases after a plea. Candace McCoy, Plea Bargaining as Coercion: The Trial Penalty and Plea Bargaining Reform, 50 Crim. L.Q. 67, 89, 91 (2005). A recent study found that federal defendants receive sentences that are 64 percent longer after trial than after conviction on a guilty plea. Andrew Chongseh Kim, Underestimating the Trial Penalty, 84 Miss. L.J. 1195 (2015). There is some evidence that trial penalties are greater in large urban counties. Jeffrey T. Ulmer &amp; Mindy S. Bradley, Variation in Trial Penalties Among Serious Violent Offenses, 44 Criminology 631, 656 (2006). Nonetheless, there is still considerable evidence that defendants sometimes plead guilty, believing they are getting a “good deal,” only to receive a sentence just as severe as the one they would have received if convicted at trial. Is this phenomenon unfair, or does it give society “the best of both worlds”? Conversely, consider the situation in jurisdictions where sentences imposed after jury trials routinely are three times longer than those imposed in comparable cases after pleas. Is that phenomenon reassuring or worrisome?</p>
<p id="7727a1d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that the number of acquittals after a trial has declined dramatically in many jurisdictions in recent decades, raising the possibility that many defendants who previously would have elected a trial and won acquittal are now pleading guilty instead. Ronald F. Wright, Trial Distortion and the End of Innocence in Federal Criminal Justice, 154 U. Pa. L. Rev. 79 (2005). We also know that 10 percent of individuals exonerated by DNA evidence had pled guilty. Jed S. Rakoff, Why Innocent People Plead Guilty, N.Y. Rev. Books, Nov. 20, 2014. John Blume and Rebecca Helm point out that the incentives may vary depending on the type of crime the defendant is accused of committing. Defendants charged with minor crimes who are innocent may have an incentive to plead guilty to avoid process costs. Many are detained in jail pending their trial because they are too poor to make bail; thus a guilty plea gets them out of confinement and back to work or caring for their families. <span title="1220" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1220">p. 1220</span>Even those released pending trial may prefer to plead guilty to avoid having to report for various hearings that cause them to miss work or other obligations. John H. Blume &amp; Rebecca K. Helm, The Unexonerated: Factually Innocent Defendants Who Plead Guilty, 100 Cornell L. Rev. 157, 174 (2014). Innocent individuals facing more serious charges have a different set of incentives and are more likely to plead guilty when the risk of a much longer sentence after conviction at trial is too great to run. Id. at 180. A recent experimental study tested this dynamic in the context of students facing academic discipline and found that more than half of innocent students were willing to falsely admit wrongdoing in exchange for leniency.

Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 725, that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.” . . . To punish a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort. . . . But in the “give-and-take” of plea bargaining, there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or reject the prosecution’s offer.</p><p id="7727a1e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Plea bargaining flows from “the mutuality of advantage” to defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for wanting to avoid trial. Defendants advised by competent counsel and protected by other procedural safeguards are presumptively capable of intelligent choice in response to prosecutorial persuasion, and unlikely to be driven to false self-condemnation. . . . 
</p><p id="7727a1e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a “discouraging effect on the defendant’s assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices [is] an inevitable”—and permissible—“attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.” It follows that, by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation of pleas, this Court has necessarily accepted as constitutionally legitimate the simple reality that the prosecutor’s interest at the bargaining table is to persuade the defendant to forgo his right to plead not guilty. [So] long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10814_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10814_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> Within the limits set by the legislature’s constitutionally valid definition of chargeable offenses, “the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation” so long as “the selection was [not] deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.” To hold that the prosecutor’s desire to induce a guilty plea is an “unjustifiable standard,” which, like race or religion, may play no part in his charging decision, would contradict the very premises that underlie the concept of plea bargaining itself. Moreover, a rigid constitutional rule that would prohibit a prosecutor from acting forthrightly in his dealings with the defense could only invite unhealthy subterfuge that would drive the practice of plea bargaining back into the shadows from which it has so recently emerged.</p><p id="7727c8f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt that the breadth of discretion that our country’s legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries with it the potential for both individual and institutional abuse.

The Court’s holding gives plea bargaining full sway despite vindictiveness.

The consequences to the accused would still be adverse, for then he would bargain against a greater charge, face the likelihood of increased bail, and run the risk that the court would be less inclined to accept a bargained plea.

By allowing plea bargaining, . . . Lincoln County judges successfully dumped the burdens of sentencing most criminal defendants onto prosecutors. How did prosecutors in Lincoln County handle this sentencing burden? The answer, I quickly learned, was “any way they wanted to.” There were no official rules that bound me or my fellow prosecutors in the making of plea-bargaining offers. And though some counties here and there do have them, there were no internal office guidelines in Lincoln County either. . . . Prosecutors, then, had nearly complete discretion in deciding what offers to make to defense counsel.</p><p id="7727c904-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike judges, who in Lincoln County were required by law to consider sentences in light of official guidelines developed by the state legislature, Lincoln County prosecutors merely used such guidelines as general starting points. If their “gut” told them that the guidelines weren’t appropriate, they could ignore them entirely, or else re[-]label one crime as something else, so that it would fit neatly into the sentence guideline range they desired. There were many instances in which prosecutors would decide the appropriate sentence; offer it to defense counsel who then accepted; then search the crimes code for some offense that would produce the “correct” sentence.</p><p id="7727c905-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not to say that prosecutors spent long periods of time agonizing over appropriate sentences.

These few minutes (perhaps 3 or so for misdemeanors and 10 for serious felonies) included all the time devoted to (1) examining police reports and all the evidence; (2) reviewing the defendant’s prior criminal history; (3) deciding the defendant’s fate as to sentencing; and (4) putting the plea offer into a form letter to be sent to defense <span title="1224" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1224">p. 1224</span>counsel.

But these reports were typically prepared only when judges were going to be doing the sentencing.

<i>1. Line-attorney discretion.</i> The environment described in the preceding excerpt appears to be common. Most district attorneys’ offices do not significantly constrain the plea-agreement terms that front-line prosecutors can negotiate. The prevailing pattern in U.S. Attorneys’ offices seems to be somewhat different. Nearly all offices require that plea agreements be in writing, and most have review procedures of some sort. See Mary Patrice Brown &amp; Stevan E. Bunnell, Negotiating Justice: Prosecutorial Perspectives on Federal Plea Bargaining in the District of Columbia, 43 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1063 (2006). But in practice supervisory review is often cursory, and the review procedures leave considerable room for evasion. In some U.S. Attorneys’ offices, for example, prosecutors must seek approval to dismiss readily provable counts, but need not seek approval to dismiss a count that the front-line prosecutor deems not readily provable. See Stephen J. Schulhofer &amp; Ilene H. Nagel, Plea Negotiations Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1284, 1295 (1997).</p>

<i>Questions  (a)</i> David Lynch is skeptical of the value of allowing front-line prosecutors the kind of unsupervised discretion that he himself was permitted to exercise in “Lincoln County.” Does such a system have any advantages? Why do so many chief district attorneys accept it?</p>
<p id="7727c90b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> If district attorneys’ offices are unwilling to channel or supervise the plea-bargaining practices of their front-line prosecutors, should the courts themselves impose some guidelines or review procedures? Would doing so violate the separation of powers, by interfering with a legitimate prosecutorial function? Or would it preserve the separation of powers, by protecting the judicial authority to determine appropriate punishment? Consider State v. Lagares, 601 A.2d 698 (N.J. 1991). The case involved a statute allowing prosecutors complete discretion in deciding whether to seek an extended sentence for drug offenders with a previous drug conviction. The court required the state attorney general to develop guidelines for determining when it was permissible for a prosecutor to seek the extended sentence. Did this measure violate or preserve an appropriate separation of powers?</p>

<i>2. Imposing a consistency requirement.</i> For another possible approach for promoting the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion in plea bargaining, consider William J. Stuntz, The Political Constitution of Criminal Justice, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 780, 838, 841 (2005):</p>

[T]his rule would limit prosecutors’ ability to threaten unusual criminal liability in order to extract guilty pleas. . . . For prosecutors, the message [of <i>Bordenkircher</i>] is: threaten everything in your arsenal in order to get the plea you want. [L]egislators [then] have every reason to vote for harsh penalties, secure in the knowledge that prosecutors need not and will not enforce them as written.

<i>Questions:</i> What does it mean to require a law to be enforced “regularly”? Would this requirement get to the root problem of plea bargaining or simply give prosecutors an incentive to threaten harsh penalties more often, in order to get to “some number” of convictions that would be sufficient to establish a regular practice?</p>

<i>3. Putting a cap on the trial penalty.</i> Another possible solution to excessive prosecutorial leverage is for jurisdictions to limit the differential between sentences offered in pleas and those given after trial. One commentator argues for plea-based ceilings to guarantee that defendants would not receive a sentence following a trial conviction that is more severe than any plea offer made to them—except by a “modest, pre-determined amount.” Russell D. Covey, Fixed Justice: Reforming Plea Bargaining with Plea-Based Ceilings, 82 Tul. L. Rev. 1237 (2008). Máximo Langer similarly suggests that, during the plea colloquy, the trial judge should ask the defendant what the prosecutor threatened the sentence would be after trial, and advocates that the judge should reject the plea if the potential trial sentence is “clearly disproportionate.” Langer, Rethinking Plea Bargaining: The Practice and Reform of Prosecutorial Adjudication in American Criminal Procedure, 33 Am. J. Crim. L. 223, 284 (2006). Another scholar proposes that trial penalties should be ruled unconstitutionally coercive as a matter of due process when a rational innocent person would plead guilty, a determination made by looking at the difference between the likely sentence after conviction as compared to the plea offer and the risk that the trial will result in an erroneous conviction. Donald A. Dripps, Guilt, Innocence, and Due Process of Plea Bargaining, 57 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1343 (2016).</p>

[B]ecause [the prosecutor] does not see herself as an interested party seeking personal advantage [but] as a public official, seeking “justice” . . . [,] the self-definition of the prosecutor affects the nature of the arguments that can be used. . . . The ideology of at least some marketplaces permits the merchant openly to rely on superior bargaining power and to reject arguments from fairness; prosecutors, who will often have the power to impose terms, would be sharply criticized if they declined to consider arguments that the terms imposed are unjust. . . . 
</p><p id="7727f02b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The frequent disparity of power between the prosecutor and the defendant makes the role-definition of the prosecutor particularly important to the outcome of the negotiation. [T]he prosecutor may hold the virtually unilateral power to inflict pain on the defendant. In many cases, for example, potential defendants perceive that an indictment alone, even if it ultimately results in acquittal, is an unbearable outcome. . . . In other situations, conviction [and a] harsh outcome at trial [may be a certainty], given the elastic definitions of substantive crimes, the severe and unpredictable (or in the case of mandatory sentences, all too predictable) sentences that may be applicable. . . . In such cases, the defendant is often likely to take, in the end, whatever plea the prosecutor can be persuaded to offer. Defense counsel’s bargaining posture may implicitly threaten a trial, but both sides may know that the defense is very likely arguing to the ultimate decisionmaker about the nature of a fair outcome, rather than proposing an exchange of values based on relative bargaining strength. . . . 
</p><p id="7727f02c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because American lawyers have a large investment in the myth of the adversarial system, it is hard for us even to see this administrative system of punishment, let alone to approve of it. . . . Because the prosecutor represents one side in an anticipated adversarial proceeding, to acknowledge her role as a de facto adjudicator would be to make her the judge in her own case. Of course, if we continue to see the prosecutor as an adversarial “bargainer,” settling her client’s dispute with the defendant, this problem disappears, for this kind of bargaining between adversaries is an accepted part of an adversarial system. Legitimizing plea bargaining by insisting on the prosecutor’s role as an adversarial bargainer, however, may encourage prosecutors to indulge exactly the wrong aspects of their divided mentality. . . . Treating pre-indictment decisionmaking and plea bargaining as an aspect of the adversary process makes it inevitable that decisions that ought to be taken in a spirit of judgment will be heavily influenced by considerations of adversarial tactics. Justice is much better served when prosecutors determining whether to indict or making plea offers see themselves as quasi-judicial decisionmakers, obligated to reach the fairest possible results, rather than as <span title="1228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1228">p. 1228</span>partisan negotiators looking to extract every ounce of advantage for their client. . . .

First, an appreciation of the true role of the jury trial in our system might make us a little more cautious about efforts to streamline courtroom procedure in the interest of more efficient law enforcement. In our actual system, [the] jury trial serves . . . as the fail-safe appellate process that promotes the reasonableness of prosecutorial-administrative determinations by setting the limits within which it operates. That trials are cumbersome does not directly harm the efficiency of criminal procedure, because most cases do not involve trials at all. . . .

In [European] systems, both prosecutors and judges are career civil servants, selected at an early age by merit-based criteria, and then advanced over the course of their careers by normal bureaucratic processes. American prosecutors [often] are more transient, seeking a few years of excitement, public service, or intense trial experience before pursuing private sector opportunities as criminal defense lawyers or civil litigators. The district attorneys and United States Attorneys who direct their efforts may be elected or appointed, and constitute a mix of career prosecutors, prominent members of the bar, and politically active lawyers. . . . Some greater measure of independence and judiciousness would seem suited to officials who have the awesome and often final power wielded by prosecutors today. . . .

<p id="7727f033-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The administrative law/criminal law contrast.</i> If charging and the making of plea offers have indeed become administrative processes of the <span title="1229" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1229">p. 1229</span>sort Judge Lynch describes, should they be subject to the safeguards we routinely require for other administrative actions affecting individuals? In formal administrative proceedings, individuals get notice of charges, a right to be heard, a written decision supported by reasons and evidence, and a right of appeal to higher levels within the agency. Should all of these rights be available in the context of charging decisions and plea offers? Would giving defendants these rights increase the perceived legitimacy of the criminal justice system? See Michael O’Hear, Plea Bargaining and Procedural Justice, 42 Ga. L. Rev. 407 (2008). Or would such requirements prove so cumbersome that prosecutors would evade them—moving decisions about charges and plea offers even further into the shadows than they are now? Which safeguards are both required for fairness and workable in practice?</p>
<p id="7727f034-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Administrative law suggests other caveats for plea bargaining. Judge Lynch observes that prosecutors essentially “adjudicate guilt and set punishments.” If one takes seriously the notion that charging and bargaining are an administrative process, should criminal law follow the administrative-law principle that those who investigate a case should be barred from adjudicating—in this case, from deciding what to charge or what plea to accept? Some scholars argue that this is a workable means to police plea bargaining.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109C6_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109C6_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">29</a></span> For additional institutional-design proposals, see Stephanos Bibas, Prosecutorial Regulation versus Prosecutorial Accountability, 157 U.

<i>2. The federal/state contrast.</i> Judge Lynch focuses especially on the dynamics of charging and bargaining in federal prosecutions for white-collar crime. That setting has several distinctive features. First, although no prosecutor’s resources are ever unlimited, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, together with the federal agencies that investigate white-collar crime—for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency—have greater resources at their disposal for investigating and trying cases than the typical district attorney’s office. Second, a federal prosecutor has more freedom to set priorities and choose cases than her state counterpart does. Some white-collar cases (such as fraud) can be referred out for prosecution in the state courts, and nearly all cases can be downgraded to civil enforcement actions or dropped completely; in state courts, in contrast, much of the caseload consists of traditional crimes against persons and property that may be more difficult to disregard. Finally, the white-collar defendant in a federal case is typically represented by experienced, well-compensated counsel.</p>
<p id="7727f037-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What safeguards would be appropriate to ensure that an “administrative” system functions properly when (as in more than 80 percent of all criminal cases) the defendant is represented by the public defender or by court-appointed counsel paid under a schedule of strictly limited fees?</p>

SENTENCING</p></h2></div>


<p id="7728174a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In no area of contemporary criminal law is there as much controversy, as much doctrinal movement, and as much diversity of approach throughout the country as there is in matters relating to sentencing. In historical perspective, this is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Until the 1970s, sentencing at the federal level and in almost all states took largely the same discretionary and indeterminate form. Trial judges could select any sentence within wide statutory boundaries, subject to few if any constraints. After the defendant had served some proportion of a sentence behind bars, parole officials could determine the ultimate release date. Regimes with these parole powers were deemed indeterminate sentencing schemes because defendants sentenced to prison did not learn their actual date of release until a parole board made its decision, usually many years later. Today, some form of discretionary sentencing scheme—with or without indeterminate powers in a parole board—remains in effect in more than half the American states.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109EC_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109EC_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">30</a></span> But dissatisfaction with so much discretion from across the political spectrum triggered fundamental change in many places. Numerous jurisdictions have replaced their traditional systems with alternatives that limit—sometimes drastically—the discretion of the sentencing judge and parole officials.</p>
<p id="7728174c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Chapter 2 we considered sentencing from a strictly substantive angle. We sought to examine the justification of punishment and to discuss which facts about an offender or his offense should be deemed relevant in determining the kind and degree of punishment imposed. We considered these issues as they would be confronted by any decision maker, in any legal setting, who was empowered to select an optimally appropriate sentence. Embedded in those issues, of course, is the problem of determining <i>who</i> the decision maker should be and what should be the constraints under which that decision maker operates. Accordingly, we touched briefly on recent developments that modify the traditional discretion of the sentencing judge. See p. 132 supra.</p>
<p id="7728174d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Here we examine these developments in depth. We consider the concerns that prompted them, the legal issues they have spawned, and their implications for the rule of law. Section C.1 examines the traditional discretionary approach and Section C.2 discusses the newer determinate systems, including the federal sentencing guidelines and the recent round of problems and reforms prompted by the Supreme Court’s renewed attention to the relationship between the jury’s role and sentencing.</p>

The jury recommended life imprisonment, but the trial judge imposed sentence of death. In giving his reasons . . . the judge discussed in open court the evidence upon which the jury had convicted, stating that this evidence had been considered in the light of additional information obtained through the court’s “Probation Department, and through other sources.” . . . 
</p><p id="77281756-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals of New York affirmed the conviction and sentence over the contention that . . . the controlling penal statutes are in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . “in that the sentence of death was based upon information supplied by witnesses with whom the accused had not been confronted and as to whom he had no opportunity for cross-examination or rebuttal.” . . . 
</p><p id="77281757-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence [at trial] proved a wholly indefensible murder committed by a person engaged in a burglary. The judge instructed the jury that if it returned a verdict of guilty as charged, without recommendation for life sentence, “The Court must impose the death penalty,” but if such recommendation was made, “the Court may impose a life sentence.” The judge went on to emphasize that “the Court is not bound to accept your recommendation.”</p><p id="77281758-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About five weeks after the verdict of guilty with recommendation of life imprisonment, and after a statutory pre-sentence investigation report to the judge, the defendant was brought to court to be sentenced. [T]he judge . . .  narrated the shocking details of the crime as shown by the trial evidence, [and] stated that the pre-sentence investigation revealed many material facts concerning appellant’s background which though relevant to the question of punishment could not properly have been brought to the attention of the jury. . . . He referred to the experience appellant “had had on thirty other burglaries in and about the same vicinity” where the murder had been committed. The appellant had not been convicted of these burglaries although the judge had information that he had confessed to some and had been identified as the perpetrator of some of the others. The judge also referred to certain activities of appellant as shown by the probation report that indicated appellant possessed “a morbid sexuality” and classified him as a “menace to society.” The accuracy of the statements made by the judge as to appellant’s background and past practices were not challenged by appellant or his counsel, nor was the judge asked to disregard any of them or to afford appellant a chance to refute or discredit any of them by cross-examination or otherwise.</p><p id="77281759-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case presents a serious and difficult question [concerning] the manner in which a judge may obtain information to guide him in the imposition of <span title="1232" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1232">p. 1232</span>sentence upon an already convicted defendant. Within limits fixed by statutes, New York judges are given a broad discretion to decide the type and extent of punishment for convicted defendants. . . . To aid a judge in exercising this discretion intelligently the New York procedural policy encourages him to consider information about the convicted person’s past life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities. The sentencing judge may consider such information even though obtained outside the courtroom from persons whom a defendant has not been permitted to confront or cross-examine. . . . 
</p><p id="7728175a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant urges that the New York statutory policy is in irreconcilable conflict with . . . the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [and its requirement] that no person shall be tried and convicted of an offense unless he is given reasonable notice of the charges against him and is afforded an opportunity to examine adverse witnesses. . . . 
</p><p id="7728175b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Tribunals passing on the guilt of a defendant always have been hedged in by strict evidentiary procedural limitations. But both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law. Out-of-court affidavits have been used frequently, and of course in the smaller communities sentencing judges naturally have in mind their knowledge of the personalities and backgrounds of convicted offenders. . . . 
</p><p id="7728175c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the historical basis for different evidentiary rules governing trial and sentencing procedures there are sound practical reasons for the distinction. . . . Rules of evidence have been fashioned for criminal trials which narrowly confine the trial contest to evidence that is strictly relevant to the particular offense charged. These rules rest in part on a necessity to prevent a time-consuming and confusing trial of collateral issues. They were also designed to prevent tribunals concerned solely with the issue of guilt of a particular offense from being influenced . . . by evidence that the defendant had habitually engaged in other misconduct. A sentencing judge, however, is not confined to the narrow issue of guilt. . . . Highly relevant—if not essential—to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.</p><p id="7728175d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undoubtedly the New York statutes emphasize a prevalent modern philosophy of penology that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime. The belief no longer prevails that every offense in a like legal category calls for an identical punishment without regard to the past life and habits of a particular offender. This whole country has traveled far from the period in which the death sentence was an automatic and commonplace result of convictions—even for offenses today deemed trivial. Today’s <span title="1233" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1233">p. 1233</span>philosophy of individualizing sentences makes sharp distinctions for example between first and repeated offenders. Indeterminate sentences, the ultimate termination of which are sometimes decided by non-judicial agencies have to a large extent taken the place of the old rigidly fixed punishments. The practice of probation which relies heavily on non-judicial implementation has been accepted as a wise policy. . . . Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law. Reformation and rehabilitation of offenders have become important goals of criminal jurisprudence.</p><p id="7728175e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern changes in the treatment of offenders make it more necessary now than a century ago for observance of the distinctions in the evidential procedure in the trial and sentencing processes. For indeterminate sentences and probation have resulted in an increase in the discretionary powers exercised in fixing punishments. [A] strong motivating force for the changes has been the belief that by careful study of the lives and personalities of convicted offenders many could be less severely punished and restored sooner to complete freedom and useful citizenship. This belief to a large extent has been justified.</p><p id="7728175f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Probation workers making reports of their investigations have not been trained to prosecute but to aid offenders. Their reports have been given a high value by conscientious judges who want to sentence persons on the best available information rather than on guesswork. . . . We must recognize that most of the information now relied upon by judges to guide them in the intelligent imposition of sentences would be unavailable if information were restricted to that given in open court by witnesses subject to cross-examination. And the modern probation report draws on information concerning every aspect of a defendant’s life. The type and extent of this information make totally impractical if not impossible open court testimony with cross-examination. Such a procedure could endlessly delay criminal administration in a retrial of collateral issues.</p><p id="77281760-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The considerations we have set out admonish us against treating the due process clause as a uniform command that courts throughout the Nation abandon their age-old practice of seeking information from out-of-court sources to guide their judgment toward a more enlightened and just sentence. [W]e do not think the Federal Constitution restricts the view of the sentencing judge to the information received in open court. The due process clause should not be treated as a device for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial procedure. So to treat the due process clause would hinder if not preclude all courts—state and federal—from making progressive efforts to improve the administration of criminal justice. . . . We hold that appellant was not denied due process of law.</p><p id="77281761-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">J<span class="epub-small-caps">USTICE</span> M<span class="epub-small-caps">URPHY</span>, dissenting. . . . Due process of law includes at least the idea that a person accused of crime shall be accorded a fair hearing through all the stages of the proceedings against him. I agree with the Court as to the value and humaneness of liberal use of probation reports as developed by modern penologists, but, in a capital case, against the unanimous recommendation of a <span title="1234" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1234">p. 1234</span>jury, where the report would concededly not have been admissible at the trial, and was not subject to examination by the defendant, I am forced to conclude that the high commands of due process were not obeyed.</p></div>

</div><p id="77283d75-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The practical problem which is posed is not that of admissibility but the utilization of procedural devices to ensure accuracy and allow argument on the relevancy of the disclosed information to the particular circumstances of the case. The presentence probation report in <i>Williams v. New York</i> illustrates this problem. The probation department there concluded that Williams was a “psychopathic liar” whose ideas “revolve around a morbid sexuality,” that he was “a full time burglar,” “emotionally unstable,” “suffers no remorse,” and was deemed to be “a menace to society.” His criminal record, confined to a charge of theft when he was 11 years old and a conviction as a wayward minor, did not support such generalizations. The conclusions of the probation department were apparently based upon (1) stolen goods found in his room, (2) identification of Williams by a woman whose apartment he allegedly burglarized and a seven-year-old girl he had allegedly raped, (3) allegations that he had committed “about 30 burglaries,” and (4) “ . . . information” that he had acted as a “pimp” and had been observed taking indecent photographs of young children. Aside from the truth or falsity of these statements or their adequacy as a basis for a death sentence, in this case life or death turned upon conclusions drawn by probation officers from hearsay and from unproven allegations. Such information is highly relevant to the question of sentence, but its accuracy depends upon the ability and fairness of the probation officer, who must weigh evidence, judge the credibility of the informants and be zealous in closely examining them. [A]t best this method of ascertaining facts has serious deficiencies because it relies for cross-interrogation and cross-investigation upon one “who has neither the strong interest nor the full knowledge that are required,” and which usually only the defendant can provide.</p></div>

<p id="77283d78-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Developments in sentencing law after</i> Williams. There are two key aspects of <i>Williams</i>. First, it provides an example of a discretionary system of sentencing that allows judges wide latitude to determine the ultimate sentence (even in a capital case). Second, it shows the thin process protections in sentencing proceedings, with hearsay and confidential information influencing sentencing. In <i>capital</i> cases, both of these doctrines have in effect been held unconstitutional. In Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977), a jury recommended life imprisonment, but the judge, relying on a confidential presentence report, sentenced the murder defendant to death. The Court found the procedure constitutionally defective and vacated the death sentence. A plurality emphasized that constitutional developments since <i>Williams</i> now mandate heightened care in death penalty sentencing and rejected the state’s <span title="1235" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1235">p. 1235</span>argument that confidentiality was necessary to “enable investigators to obtain relevant but sensitive disclosures from persons unwilling to comment publicly.” The Court has also curtailed the role that judges alone can play in determining whether a defendant receives a death sentence. In Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616 (2016), the Court held that a jury, not a judge, must find the facts that are necessary to impose a sentence of death.</p>
<p id="77283d79-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court has also made clear since <i>Williams</i> that sentencing hearings, even in non-capital cases, must comport with many due process requirements; the defendant must, for example, be afforded the effective assistance of counsel. Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128 (1967). But for non-capital cases, the central holding of <i>Williams</i>—that the federal Constitution does not bar reliance on confidential information at sentencing—remains undisturbed. Judges relying on such information continue to make critical factual findings that dictate a defendant’s sentence. Nonetheless, most states now allow felony defendants to review the presentence report, or at least most portions of it, prior to imposition of sentence. Federal practice affords less disclosure. Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d) guarantees the defense unrestricted access to a document called “the presentence report,” (PSR) but it allows the judge to receive other information in a separate document that is not made available to the defense. The report supplied to the defendant “must exclude” three types of information that the judge receives confidentially: a diagnostic opinion that, if disclosed, might disrupt a rehabilitation program; “information obtained on a promise of confidentiality”; and “information that, if disclosed, might result in physical or other harm to the defendant or others.” The defendant receives only the trial judge’s summary of information excluded from the report. Rule 32 gives the defense an opportunity to comment on the report, and at the court’s discretion, to offer evidence to rebut alleged factual inaccuracies. But in cases of factual dispute, the prosecution needs to prove its version only by a preponderance of the evidence. Moreover, the defendant usually is afforded no opportunity to confront or cross-examine those who may have provided adverse information. See Alan Michaels, Trial Rights at Sentencing, 81 N.C. L. Rev. 1771 (2003).</p>
<p id="77283d7a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a sense of what these rules can mean in practice, consider United States v. Weston, 448 F.2d 626 (9th Cir. 1971). The defendant was convicted of transporting 537 grams of heroin. The PSR asserted that federal agents “feel that she . . . has been the chief supplier to the Western Washington area,” making trips to Mexico every two weeks and earning up to $140,000 in profit on each trip. Their source for these conclusions, presumably a confidential informant, was not disclosed. Defense counsel hotly denied the accusation, saying that he “had never seen Weston display any sign of wealth,” and “can’t conceive of what type of investigation I can do to come back and say that she isn’t [a major dealer].” Nonetheless, the trial judge stated that, with nothing more than the defendant’s vehement denial, he had “no alternative . . . but to accept as true the information [obtained from] the Federal <span title="1236" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1236">p. 1236</span>Bureau of Narcotics.” He then imposed the maximum sentence, 20 years’ imprisonment. Was the judge’s action justified, or should he have disregarded the accusation and treated Weston as a low-level dealer? Which approach runs the greater risk of an inappropriate sentence?</p>

<i>2. Discretion and the rationale of punishment.</i> In non-capital cases, the discretionary sentencing model followed in <i>Williams</i> still exists in many jurisdictions. What purposes of punishment call for individualized sentencing and wide discretion for the decision maker? In <i>Williams</i>, the Court defends individualization on the ground that “[r]etribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law. Reformation and rehabilitation have become important goals.” Indeed, the premise of indeterminate sentences, with broad discretion for judges and parole officials, rests on the aim of rehabilitation.</p>
<p id="77283d7c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeterminate sentencing fell into disfavor in the 1970s both because of a concern with disparity and because of doubts that rehabilitation was effective and that parole officials could identify when a prisoner was, in fact, rehabilitated. See Tapia v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 2382, 2387 (2011); Michelle S. Phelps, Rehabilitation in the Punitive Era: The Gap Between Rhetoric and Reality in U.S. Prison Programs, 45 Law &amp; Soc’y Rev. 33, 36-38 (2011). When Congress overhauled federal sentencing with the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984, it eliminated parole and cabined judicial discretion based on these concerns. Although judges are charged under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(D) with considering what sentence will provide the defendant with “needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner,” the Sentencing Reform Act also made clear that judges must “recognize[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.” 18 U.S.C. §3582(a). Thus, while rehabilitation may still be a goal of sentencing in the federal system, it cannot be used as a justification for imposing or extending a term of incarceration. <i>Tapia</i>, 131 S. Ct. at 2388-2389. Although the rhetoric around rehabilitation has changed over time, the amount of actual programming in prisons has stayed relatively modest and constant from the 1970s until today; its emphasis, however, has changed from academic programs to reentry-related counseling. Phelps, supra, at 56-59. Sharon Dolovich argues that whatever benefit flows from the minimal rehabilitation programming that is offered in prison, it is outweighed by the harm to rehabilitation caused by the dehumanizing experience of incarceration itself. Sharon Dolovich, Foreword: Incarceration American-Style, 3 Harv. L. &amp; Pol’y Rev. 237, 245-254 (2009).</p>

If we understand retribution to mean punishment tailored to the culpability of the offender, doesn’t retribution also require a highly individualized, discretionary judgment? Even if we understand retribution and deterrence to mandate a punishment set solely as a function of the seriousness of the offense, don’t these goals still require a highly individualized, discretionary judgment about the nature of the offense in that particular case? <span title="1237" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1237">p. 1237</span>Conversely, can a highly discretionary system <i>undermine</i> any goals of punishment?

Some states addressed the perceived injustice of indeterminate sentencing systems either by requiring the parole-release date to be fixed early in the prisoner’s term or by abolishing parole altogether.

<i>1. Mandatory minimums.</i> A solution initially popular with lawmakers was the enactment of mandatory minimum sentences for specified crimes. Congress introduced stiff mandatory minimums for drug offenses in 1956, but soon concluded that they were a failure, and in 1970, it repealed virtually all the drug mandatories. Among those supporting the 1970 repeal was Congressman George H.W. Bush (R-TX), who argued that mandatories were ineffective and unjust. See Stephen J. Schulhofer, Rethinking Mandatory Minimums, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 199, 200-201 (1993). Just as Congress was repealing its mandatories, New York turned to them, enacting long mandatory drug sentences (the so-called Rockefeller drug laws) in 1973. In 1984, Congress once more enacted severe mandatory minimums for drug offenses (as well as for certain firearms offenses), and has continued to pass statutes with mandatory minimum sentences on a regular basis ever since. Roughly one-quarter of offenders sentenced in federal court in fiscal year 2014 were convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BA3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BA3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">31</a></span> Most of these—more than 67 percent—are for drug offenses, and firearms offenses make up another 15 percent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BAB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BAB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">32</a></span> Roughly 40 percent of the offenders in federal prison as of 2010 were subject to a mandatory minimum penalty at sentencing.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BB3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BB3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">33</a></span> The tide might be turning on mandatory minimums again, however, as 29 states since 2000 have rolled back their mandatory sentencing laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BBB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BBB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">34</a></span>

Although it is difficult to pin down a direct causal link between the racial disparities in the prison population and these mandatory minimum laws, there are signs of a connection. In a 2004 report, the United States Sentencing Commission concluded that “[t]oday’s sentencing policies, crystallized into sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimum statutes, have a greater adverse impact on Black offenders than did the factors taken into account by judges in the [prior] discretionary system. . . . ”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BDF_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BDF_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">37</a></span> The Commission’s 2011 report finds that black offenders make up 38 percent of the offenders convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty, even though black offenders represent 21 percent of the total offender population.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BE7_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BE7_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">38</a></span>

<p id="77288bc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One possible reason for this disparity is that mandatory minimum schemes are usually a misnomer. They are truly mandatory only when they require filing of the most serious charge and prohibit bargaining, or when they require judges to ignore the formal charge and base the sentence on the actual conduct, as revealed by a presentence investigation. Even if some jurisdictions—such as the federal system—espouse this view, in practice they fail to achieve it. A comprehensive study of the federal mandatory minimums showed, for example, that among defendants who entered into plea agreements, almost half were sentenced below the mandatory level for which they appeared eligible, because they provided substantial assistance to the government or qualified for a statutory safety valve provision, or both.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BF3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BF3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span> This made an enormous difference in an offender’s sentence, with “[o]ffenders who were convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty and remained subject to that penalty at sentencing receiv[ing] an average sentence of 139 months,” compared to 63 months for those offenders who received relief from a mandatory penalty.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BFB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BFB_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">40</a></span> More disturbingly, the distribution of cases did not fall proportionately on all offenders.

Far more common are mandatories that require a given sentence only in the event of conviction on a given charge. Such “discretionary mandatories” constrain judges but not prosecutors, who are sometimes perceived as less likely to be “soft on crime.” As a result, in most places, the greatest impact of mandatory minimums is to give prosecutors a powerful bargaining chip for use in plea negotiation.

 . . . Most people, including me, agree that the kingpins, masterminds, and mid-level managers of drug trafficking enterprises deserve severe punishment. But right from the start Congress made a mistake: it made a drug defendant’s eligibility for the mandatory sentences depend not on his or her role in the offense, but on the quantity of drugs involved in the crime. Thus, if the crime involved one kilogram of heroin, five kilograms of cocaine, or only 50 grams of crack, every defendant involved in that crime, irrespective of his or her actual <span title="1242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1242">p. 1242</span>role, is treated as a kingpin or mastermind and must get at least ten years in jail.</p>

The government concedes, as it must, that Vasquez played a <i>minor</i> role in his brother’s modest drug operation, not the mid-level managerial role the five-year mandatory sentence was enacted to punish. . . . Yet, by the simple act of invoking the sentence-enhancing provision of the statute, the government has dictated the imposition of the severe sentence intended only for those with an aggravating role.</p>

The prosecutor agreed, and welcomed my direction that she go back to the United States Attorney with a request from the Court that he withdraw the aspect of the charge that required the imposition of the five-year minimum. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7728b2dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[When the prosecutor returned, s]he reported that the United States Attorney would not relent. She offered two reasons. The first was that I might have failed to focus on the fact that Vasquez . . . was allowed to plead to the five-year mandatory minimum rather than to the ten-year mandatory minimum that he, his brother, and three other co-defendants were originally charged with. I think this means that Vasquez should be grateful the government did not insist on a ten-year minimum sentence based on additional quantities of cocaine it concedes he knew nothing about. . . . I suppose there is some consolation in the fact that the government did not pursue that absurd course. . . . But that hardly explains, let alone justifies, the government’s insistence on the injustice at hand.</p>
<p id="7728b2de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, the prosecutor suggested that I had failed to “focus” on the seriousness of Vasquez’s crimes against his ex-wife, Melendez. Implicit in that assertion is the contention that even if Vasquez does not deserve the five-year minimum because he was not a mid-level manager of a drug enterprise, he deserves it because of his past crimes. This rings especially hollow. Those past crimes have been front and center at all times. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7728b2df-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I recognize that the United States Attorney is not required to explain to judges the reasons for decisions like this one, and for that reason I did not ask for them. But the ones that were volunteered do not withstand the slightest scrutiny.</p>
<p id="7728b2e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a result of the decision to insist on the five-year mandatory minimum, there was no judging going on at Vasquez’s sentencing. . . . The defendant’s difficult childhood and lifelong struggle with mental illness were out of bounds, as were the circumstances giving rise to his minor role in his brother’s drug business, . . . the fact that he tried to cooperate but was not involved enough in the drug trade to be of assistance, the effect of his incarceration on his three-year-old daughter and the eight-year-old child of Caraballo he is raising as his own, the fact that he has been a good father to them for nearly <span title="1243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1243">p. 1243</span>five years, the fact that his prior convictions all arose out of his ex-wife’s refusal to permit him to see their three children. Sentencing is not a science, and I don’t pretend to be better than anyone else at assimilating these and the numerous other factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that legitimately bear on an appropriate sentence. But I try my best . . . to do justice for the individual before me and for our community. In this case, those efforts would have resulted in a prison term of 24 months, followed by a five-year period of supervision with conditions including both other forms of punishment (home detention and community service) and efforts to assist Vasquez with the mental health, substance abuse, and anger management problems that have plagued him, in some respects for his entire life. If he had failed to avail himself of those efforts, or if, for example, he intentionally had contact with Melendez without the prior authorization of his supervising probation officer, he would have gone back to jail on this case.</p>
<p id="7728b2e1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mandatory minimum sentence . . . supplanted any effort to do justice, leaving in its place the heavy wooden club that was explicitly meant only for mid-level managers of drug operations. The absence of fit between the crude method of punishment and the particular set of circumstances before me was conspicuous; when I imposed sentence on the weak and sobbing Vasquez on March 5, everyone present, including the prosecutor, could feel the injustice. . . .

<i>Questions:</i> How should we appraise the value and drawbacks of mandatory minimums? <i>(a)</i> For “discretionary mandatories,” are the risks of unequal treatment and disproportionate punishment outweighed by potential deterrence gains? For that matter, are potential gains in deterrence dissipated by the uncertainty that these nominally mandatory sentences will actually be applied? A bipartisan congressional task force report took a careful look at the relationship between federal mandatory minimums and prison population growth and unanimously called for dramatic limits on the reach of mandatory minimums because their costs outweigh their benefits.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C7F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C7F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">42</a></span>

<i>(b)</i> Should a jurisdiction try to avoid these difficulties by making its mandatory minimums truly mandatory, for prosecutors as well as for judges? Is there a way to ensure that prosecutors will fully comply with the requirements of a mandatory minimum? If they do comply, will the result be <i>too much</i> equality—equal treatment of offenders who committed their offenses under very different circumstances? Is <i>Vasquez</i> an example of too much equality, or were prosecutors correct to charge the defendant as they did? If a mandatory minimum is truly mandatory, why would any defendant who commits one of the subject crimes ever be willing to plead guilty?

<i>(c)</i> In addition to their power to withhold charges that carry a mandatory minimum sentence, prosecutors often can enable a defendant to avoid the mandatory minimum by filing a motion with the court attesting to the defendant’s cooperation. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §3553(e). In multi-defendant cases, will this just reward the defendant who gets to the prosecutor’s office first? Colson Report, supra, at 6 n.5.

<i>2. Presumptive and guideline sentencing.</i>
</b> Given the drawbacks of mandatory minimums, no American legislature has attempted to extend that approach to all crimes; rather, legislatures have targeted selected crimes, such as drug distribution, firearms offenses, and sex offenses against children. To address the problems of sentencing discretion more generally, reformers have turned to more flexible techniques. California, for example, adopted legislation specifying within narrow limits the normal sentence for each offense and tightly restricted the trial judge’s discretion to depart from the specified terms.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CA7_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CA7_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">43</a></span>
</p>
<p id="7728d9f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most states, unlike California, were not prepared to undertake the complex task of identifying appropriate sentences in detail and making the statutory revisions and refinements necessary to keep them current. Several jurisdictions therefore opted to create an expert body—a sentencing commission—charged with drafting guidelines that judges would be required or encouraged to follow in making sentencing decisions. The commissions are administrative agencies accountable to the legislature but insulated to some degree from immediate political pressures, and they are afforded the time and resources to deal with the complex array of sentencing problems. A 2008 study found that of 21 jurisdictions (including D.C.) with sentencing guidelines, 10 use guidelines that are relatively mandatory, and 11 use guidelines that are relatively voluntary.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CB3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CB3_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">44</a></span> In its tentative draft of new sentencing provisions to the MPC, the American Law Institute has endorsed the view that the best approach is to have a sentencing commission adopt presumptive guidelines.

<p id="7728d9fa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Developments in the federal system have received the most attention and generated the most controversy because Congress enacted a guideline system that is far less flexible than any of the systems used to control judicial discretion in the states. In 1984, in addition to abolishing parole, Congress created a United States Sentencing Commission charged with promulgating guidelines for judges to use in federal sentencing decisions. See 28 U.S.C. §§991-998. The Commission was directed to establish sentencing categories based on specific <span title="1245" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1245">p. 1245</span>combinations of offense and offender characteristics and to identify a narrow range of authorized sentences (with no more than a 25 percent spread between maximum and minimum terms of imprisonment) for each category. See 28 U.S.C. §994(b). Except under restricted conditions, judges were required to impose a sentence within the authorized range. See 18 U.S.C. §3553:</p>

First, the substantive federal criminal law is sprawling and unorganized. [L]egislators recognized that a body of experts was needed to draft reasonable <span title="1246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1246">p. 1246</span>sentencing rules. Second, Congress realized that the first set of rules would certainly be imperfect and would require monitoring, study, and modification over time. For this task, too, a body of experts was required. Third, creating sentencing rules requires not only expertise, but some insulation from the distorting pressures of politics. Thus, the Sentencing Commission was situated outside both of the political branches of government and made independent even of the normal chain of command in the judicial branch in which it formally resides.</p><p id="77292829-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal sentencing guidelines are, in a sense, simply a long set of instructions for one chart: the sentencing table[,] a two-dimensional grid which measures the seriousness of the current offense on its vertical axis and the defendant’s criminal history on its horizontal axis.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D1F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D1F_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> The goal of guidelines calculations is to determine an offense level and a criminal history category, which together generate an intersection in the body of the grid. Each intersection designates a sentencing range expressed in months. Most American sentencing guidelines systems use some form of sentencing grid [employing] measurements of offense seriousness and criminal history to place defendants within a sentencing range. The federal system, however, is unique in the complexity of its sentencing table, which has 43 offense levels, 6 criminal history categories, and 258 sentencing range boxes.</p><p id="7729282b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal history category reflected on the horizontal axis of the sentencing table attempts to quantify the defendant’s disposition to criminality.

</p><p id="7729282e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A unique and controversial aspect of the guidelines is “relevant conduct.” The guidelines require that a judge calculating the applicable offense level and any chapter three adjustments must consider not only a defendant’s conduct directly related to the offense or offenses for which he was convicted, but also the foreseeable conduct of his criminal partners, as well as his own uncharged, <span title="1247" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1247">p. 1247</span>dismissed, and sometimes even acquitted conduct<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D47_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D47_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">51</a></span> undertaken as part of the same transaction or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.

</p><p id="77292830-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once a district court has determined a defendant’s sentencing range, the judge retains effectively unfettered discretion to sentence within that range. However, to sentence outside the range, the judge must justify the departure on certain limited grounds. [Specifically, there must be “an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.”] Critically, both the rules determining the guideline range and those governing the judge’s departure authority are made enforceable by a right of appeal given to both parties. . . . 
</p><p id="77292831-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many important respects, the federal sentencing system fulfilled the objectives of its framers. First, the SRA abandoned the rehabilitative or medical model of punishment. . . . Second, the SRA [achieved] “truth in sentencing” by abolishing parole and requiring that federal defendants sentenced to incarceration serve at least eighty-five percent of the term imposed by the court. . . . Third, the SRA addressed the problem of unwarranted disparity. . . .  The available evidence suggests that the guidelines have succeeded in reducing judge-to-judge disparity within judicial districts. On the other hand, researchers have found significant disparities between sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants in different districts and different regions of the country, and interdistrict disparities appear to have grown larger in the guidelines era, particularly in drug cases. The question of whether the guidelines reduced or exacerbated racial disparities in federal sentencing remains unresolved.</p><p id="77292832-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the SRA and the guidelines brought law and due process to federal sentencing by requiring that sentencing judges find facts and apply the guidelines’ rules to those findings, and by making the guidelines legally binding and enforceable through a process of appellate review. Not all forms of guidelines accomplish this end. Some states have voluntary guidelines systems in which judges need not apply the rules at all. Other states have advisory guidelines systems in which judges are required to perform guidelines calculations, but are not required to sentence in conformity with the result. In neither voluntary nor advisory guidelines systems is the judge’s sentencing decision subject to meaningful appellate review. In theory, bringing law to sentencing makes sentencing outcomes more predictable and gives the parties a fair opportunity to present and dispute evidence bearing on legally relevant sentencing factors. Relatedly, bringing law to sentencing promotes transparency, such that one can ascertain from the record many, if not all, of the factors which were dispositive in generating the final sentence.</p><p id="77292833-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

<i>NOTES ON THE SENTENCING GUIDELINE APPROACH</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="772a613a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From one perspective, sentencing guidelines appear to offer an ideal solution to the problems of unguided judicial sentencing discretion. The sentence must fall within a predetermined range that varies according to the specific details of the offense and the offender. At the same time, flexibility is preserved because the judge can depart from that range when unusual circumstances present themselves. Appellate review is available in most jurisdictions with guidelines, to ensure that the judge stays within these boundaries, takes the required factors into account, and departs from them (if she does) only for legitimate reasons. The governing principles become visible and can be tested and progressively refined through the time-honored common-law process. Is there any downside to this optimistic scenario? Is it too good to be true? The complicated dynamics of criminal law and criminal justice examined in previous chapters of this book, and especially in the previous sections of this chapter, should alert us to several potential sources of trouble. Consider some of the possible dangers of the sentencing guidelines approach:</p>
<p id="772a613b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Is equity predictable?</i> What, precisely, makes a sentence appropriate? Is it possible to identify all the relevant factors in advance, without squeezing out an essential but intangible human element? Recall that in capital sentencing, the Supreme Court has held it unconstitutional to “treat[] all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind imposition of the penalty. . . . ” Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303-304 (1976), discussed at pp. 573-574 supra. The Court has not recognized this constitutional imperative outside the death penalty context. But if a guidelines system can indeed succeed in making sentencing wholly predictable, will the resulting process become so mechanical that the criminal law will lose some of its ability to communicate moral condemnation of the individual offender? Professor Erik Luna observes (Gridland: An Allegorical Critique of Federal Sentencing, 96 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 25, 28 (2005)) that “the language and practice of formulaic sentencing [now] reign in U.S. district courts[, resulting in] the purging of moral judgment in punishment.” Does a largely mechanical process forfeit its moral credibility, or does it gain credibility by providing assurance of evenhandedness and consistency? A recent bipartisan congressional task force concluded that public safety requires consideration of “[t]he unique circumstances and attributes of each case and each person” to formulate the right sentence, rehabilitative programs, and services.

Are soft factors less important?</i> Under the federal guidelines system, the guideline ranges are particularly narrow and the system attempts to make especially detailed provision for the diverse circumstances that a <span title="1250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1250">p. 1250</span>well-conceived sentencing system should take into account.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11166_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11166_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">45</a></span> But can any system take into account all relevant factors? Because the variables that can legitimately influence the severity of a punishment are almost limitless, a sentencing commission inevitably must choose which ones will enter into the guideline calculus and which ones will not. In making this decision, factors that are easily quantified, like dollar losses and drug quantities, are especially attractive because it is easy to assign “points” to them on a continuous scale, and because it is relatively easy to ensure that different judges make the required computation in a consistent way. In contrast, factors that depend on subjective impression—like a defendant’s motives or family circumstances—are hard to integrate into a numerical calculation. And judges can easily manipulate these subjective considerations to reintroduce unwarranted disparities. To the extent that consistency is important, therefore, “soft” factors almost inevitably must be allowed less influence. Yet if such factors are excluded from consideration (or allowed little weight) in the interest of eliminating disparity, the guidelines would tend toward a <i>false</i> uniformity, with offenders receiving identical sentences when their circumstances were not truly comparable. See Stephen J. Schulhofer, Assessing the Federal Sentencing Process: The Problem Is Uniformity, Not Disparity, 29 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 833 (1992). In determining a defendant’s sentence, is it more important to know the exact value of a car that he stole or the circumstances that prompted the theft? How can a guideline approach eliminate <i>unwarranted</i> disparity without eliminating <i>justified</i> disparity as well? If we must choose, are we better off eliminating both forms of disparity or neither?</p>

<i>3. Can visibility be dangerous?</i> Reconsider the federal sentencing grid at p. 1248 supra. A simple robbery case would normally be assigned an offense level of 20,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1117E_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1117E_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">46</a></span> so if the perpetrator is a first-time offender, his guideline range would be 33-41 months—a maximum of less than 3½ years. Does that severity level seem about right? Once Congress or a state legislature gets a look at a grid like this, will the legislators be tempted to change the numbers—and if so, in what direction? As William Stuntz, supra, has documented, when punishment levels are made highly visible and easily understandable, the political process generates strong pressure to push the levels upward, subject only to the haphazard constraints of a state’s budget. That process has been especially marked in connection with the federal guidelines. See Bowman, supra, at 1328-1350. Is this phenomenon a good or a bad thing? Without “truth in sentencing,” where you know the punishment clearly in advance of its imposition, punishment policies are obscured, which could allow criminal justice insiders to implement their own preferences, whether or not voters approve. Stephanos Bibas, Transparency and Participation in Criminal Procedure, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 911 (2006). Should greater visibility and accountability be <span title="1251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1251">p. 1251</span>counted as improvements? Or will the emotions attached to crime control politics and media coverage of criminal cases make highly visible sentencing policies worse than policies that remain obscure to the general public?</p>

<i>4. Can discretion increase in one part of the system when it is eliminated in another?</i> Discretion so thoroughly pervades the criminal justice system that eliminating it <i>completely</i> cannot be considered an option. The only plausible goal of reform, therefore, is to tackle the extent of discretion and how it is allocated among different actors. Thus, sentencing reform typically seeks to control the discretion of sentencing judges and, perhaps, that of parole boards as well. If prosecutors retain their discretion over charging and plea-bargaining discretion, while the discretion of judges is eliminated, is it accurate to say that there is less discretion in the system? Or is there <i>more</i> discretion, because judges and parole boards have lost their ability to oversee and offset abuses of discretion by the prosecutor? For a discussion of this issue, see Kate Stith, The Arc of the Pendulum: Judges, Prosecutors, and the Exercise of Discretion, 117 Yale L.J. 1420 (2008).</p>
<p id="772a8851-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider also the institutional environment in which discretionary decisions are made. If discretion <i>moves</i> from judges to prosecutors, should we expect the quality and consistency of the decisions to improve or deteriorate? If we have to choose between having largely unregulated discretion in the hands of either prosecutors or judges, which arrangement is preferable? Why?</p>
<p id="772a8852-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One hope of sentencing reformers was to control the discretion of <i>both</i> judges and prosecutors. As Professor Bowman explains, the U.S. Sentencing Commission instructed judges to base their guideline calculations on all “relevant conduct,” that is, on what is sometimes called the “real offense” as opposed to the charged offense. The expectation was that federal probation officers would become a “truth squad,” providing judges with a complete picture of the crime, even if prosecutors agreed, in order to induce a plea, that they would withhold or fudge crucial details. The prosecutors, of course, could try to counter that check by dismissing most of the counts and accepting a plea to an offense that carried a low statutory maximum; whatever the guideline calculation might suggest, the judge could never impose a sentence greater than the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction. The Commission in turn attempted to neutralize that maneuver by instructing judges to reject any guilty plea when the terms of the proposed charge dismissal or plea agreement did not “adequately reflect the seriousness of the underlying offense behavior.” U.S.S.G. §6B1.2.</p>
<p id="772a8853-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should judges reject a plea agreement if the inevitable effect of doing so would be to force compliance with a guideline sentencing calculation that all the parties consider too severe? Is it appropriate for judges to force the parties to go to trial on charges more serious than the prosecutor considers warranted? For one view, suggesting that such an action violates the separation of powers (and principles of efficient government), see United States v. O’Neill, 437 F.3d 654, 658 (7th Cir. 2006) (Posner, J., concurring). But if <span title="1252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1252">p. 1252</span>judges should not (or will not) reject plea agreements that are inconsistent with guideline calculations, does a guideline system really reduce discretion? Or, once again, does it simply transfer discretion from judges to prosecutors? And in the latter event, do the guideline reforms improve the sentencing process or make it worse?</p>
<p id="772a8854-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To date, no state sentencing guidelines scheme has attempted to follow the federal “real offense” system. One reason states have rejected this approach is that it leaves important determinations that can affect a sentence to be made by a judge in the sentencing phase (by a preponderance of the evidence), rather than by a jury at trial (beyond a reasonable doubt). This worry is particularly pronounced when a jury acquits a defendant of a charge, but a judge nonetheless finds the conduct to have occurred by a preponderance of the evidence and therefore uses that conduct as a basis to increase a defendant’s sentence. The use of so-called acquitted conduct to increase a defendant’s sentence has been widely criticized, but it remains part of the federal “real offense” framework. See, e.g., United States v. Waltower, 643 F.3d 572, 577 (7th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p id="772a8855-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Advisory versus mandatory guidelines.</i> The Sentencing Reform Act specified that judges had to follow the federal guidelines whenever the case fell within the heartland of typical or ordinary cases on which the guidelines were based. Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 92-94 (1996). That constraint was substantially relaxed in 2005 when the Supreme Court held that it ran afoul of the jury trial guarantee because the Guidelines system allowed judges, as opposed to jurors, to find facts that “the law makes essential” to a defendant’s punishment by mandating that they must increase a sentence in a particular way. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 232 (2005). The Court distinguished facts that are <i>necessary</i> as a matter of law to authorize a new sentence from facts that have <i>no predetermined legal significance</i>. Id. at 233. The remedy adopted by the Court was therefore to make the federal guidelines “advisory” and to allow an appellate court to set aside the decision of the sentencing judge, whether within the guideline range or not, only when the sentence was “unreasonable.” For discussions of appellate review under the post-<i>Booker</i> federal regime, see Carissa Byrne Hessick &amp; F. Andrew Hessick, Appellate Review of Sentencing Decisions, 60 Ala. L. Rev. 1 (2008); Lindsay C. Harrison, Appellate Discretion and Sentencing After <i>Booker</i>, 62 U. Miami L. Rev. 1115 (2008).</p>
<p id="772a8856-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many states also have advisory or voluntary guidelines, some with less appellate review than the post-<i>Booker</i> federal guidelines or even no appellate review at all. Are such guidelines likely to be effective in reducing disparity, or will judges ignore them? Empirical studies of voluntary and advisory guidelines show that judges follow these guidelines in roughly 75 percent of cases, a rate of within-guideline sentencing that is similar to the rate of within-guideline sentencing in mandatory guideline jurisdictions that allow for <span title="1253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1253">p. 1253</span>departures.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN111CD_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N111CD_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">47</a></span> Why might judges sentence within the guidelines in advisory and voluntary regimes even if they do not face reversal for ignoring them? For a discussion, see Pfaff, supra at 238-239; Mark W. Bennett, Confronting Cognitive “Anchoring Effect” and “Blind Spot” Biases in Federal Sentencing: A Modest Solution for Reforming a Fundamental Flaw, 104 J. Crim. &amp; Criminology 489 (2014).</p>

Scott, Inter-Judge Sentencing Disparity After <i>Booker</i>: A First Look, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1 (2010). One study finds that inter-judge disparities have doubled post-<i>Booker</i>, but the differences in absolute terms are relatively small, with defendants facing the “harsher” judges pre-<i>Booker</i> receiving sentences 2.8 months longer compared to defendants facing the “harsher” judges post-<i>Booker</i> receiving sentences 5.9 months longer. Crystal S. Yang, Have Interjudge Sentencing Disparities Increased in an Advisory Guidelines Regime? Evidence from <i>Booker</i>, 89 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1268, 1275 (2014).

She then left the house, intentionally leaving the baby alone without food or a caregiver. When she returned two weeks later, she found the baby dead, placed his remains in a suitcase, and put the suitcase in a ditch, where it was later discovered. Pursuant to a plea agreement, she pled guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to ten years in prison, the bottom of the advisory guidelines range.]</p><p id="772aaf74-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Deegan] urged the court to vary from the advisory guidelines and sentence her to probation or to a very short period of incarceration [because of] what she described as her “psychological and emotional condition” at the time of the offense, her history as a victim of abuse, and the fact that she acted impulsively. . . . 
</p><p id="772aaf75-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As support, she submitted a report prepared by Dr. Phillip Resnick, an expert in “neonaticide[,]” a term coined by Resnick to describe the killing of an infant within the first twenty-four hours following birth.

 . . . On appeal, Deegan argues that the sentence is unreasonable, because the advisory guideline for second-degree murder is not based on empirical data and national experience, and because the sentence imposed is greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2). . . . 
</p><p id="772ad587-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In explaining why it chose a sentence of 121 months’ imprisonment rather than a greater punishment, the court acknowledged that Deegan’s life had not been “easy,” and that it had been plagued with physical abuse and sexual abuse. . . . The court said that it “underst[ood] why [Deegan] took the steps that she did . . . ” and that “under the circumstances,” a sentence under the 2007 guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, <i>i.e.</i>, 19.5 to 24.5 years’ imprisonment, would not have been fair.

 . . . Where, as here, a sentence imposed is within the advisory guideline range, we typically accord it a presumption of reasonableness.

 . . . To determine whether the Commission contemplated neonaticide . . . in its guidelines for second-degree murder, this writer inquired of the Sentencing Commission [and it responded that its records since 2006 contain no other case involving neonaticide.] Thus, a neonaticide case clearly falls outside the “heartland” for second-degree murder sentences. . . .

It relied on Dr. Resnick’s testimony that incarcerating Deegan would not likely deter others from committing neonaticide, in part because, after Deegan committed her crime, all 50 states enacted safe haven laws allowing women to drop off a baby at a hospital or police station with no questions asked. Resnick also explained that Deegan is a low recidivism risk because she had a tubal ligation, so she won’t have more children; she has no criminal record; no substance abuse history; and is remorseful. Moreover, a study of women who commit neonaticide found that most of them go on to be good mothers, suggesting, Resnick said, that “this is a crime based upon circumstances as opposed to bad character in the perpetrator.” The dissent also considered Deegan’s family ties:]</p><p id="772afca7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the guidelines do not ordinarily consider matters such as family ties, such a consideration is permissible under §3553(a). . . . Deegan spoke of her children’s needs for her. . . . Instead of the prosecutor acknowledging that the children’s needs [their ages were one, two, and five] can play a role in reducing a federal sentence, he justified the guideline sentence saying, “[T]he punishment that comes to those siblings as well comes at the hand of the defendant. Basically her choice is what has caused all of this.” . . . But what blame should be placed on Mr. Hale who did not support the children he fathered and consistently abused Ms. Deegan?

[The record revealed another neonaticide crime in North Dakota, but committed off the Indian reservation and, thus, subject only to state law. That defendant was sentenced to three years’ probation.] Dr. Resnick informed the court that women who plead guilty to neonaticide are “infrequently sentenced to more than three years in prison.” These are all state sentences and, as observed by the majority, ordinarily state sentences are <span title="1258" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1258">p. 1258</span>not germane to showing disparities in sentencing.

<p id="772afcad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Guidelines and the purposes of punishment.</i> As <i>Deegan</i> illustrates, under the current federal scheme, judges first determine the appropriate guideline sentence and whether a departure is warranted because a case falls outside the heartland. Next, judges are to determine whether the sentence is warranted under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a), supra, p. 1245, which requires judges to consider, among other things, whether the sentence serves retributive and utilitarian goals of punishment. Will the consideration of these broad factors undercut the goals of the more specific and finely tuned guidelines? Is Judge Bright’s approach to §3553(a) an example of how that approach can undermine those goals, or does his opinion illustrate the value of keeping the overall goals of sentencing in mind to determine which cases are, in fact, alike?</p>
<p id="772afcae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Family circumstances.</i> The Sentencing Commission, when it promulgated the guidelines, concluded that family and community ties are “not ordinarily relevant.” What justifies that conclusion? Is this factor ruled out because it is not relevant to penal law objectives or only because it is likely to be applied inconsistently? If the latter, is consistency important enough to trump the substantive objectives of punishment? Judge Bright thought family circumstances (the three preschool children whose mother would be taken away if she is sentenced to prison) could be relevant under §3553(a), even though those circumstances are not ordinarily relevant under the guidelines. Which of the §3553(a) factors is implicated by family circumstances? What theory of punishment justifies a reduced sentence when a defendant’s incarceration will harm third parties such as the defendant’s children?</p>
<p id="772afcaf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the innocent victims of an offense are relevant third parties whose interests should be taken into account, does that mean the defendant’s innocent family members should also have their interests factored into a sentence? One commentator argues that the children of incarcerated parents have First Amendment freedom of association and due process liberty interests at <span title="1259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1259">p. 1259</span>stake in sentencing determinations and that those interests should be considered. Chesa Boudin, Children of Incarcerated Parents: The Child’s Constitutional Right to the Family Relationship, 101 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 77, 92-97 (2011). For a general argument that family circumstances should be part of the sentencing calculation, see Emily W. Anderson, Note, “Not Ordinarily Relevant”: Bringing Family Responsibilities to the Federal Sentencing Table, 56 B.C. L. Rev. 1501 (2015).</p>
<p id="772afcb0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Other offender circumstances.</i> Now that the federal guidelines are merely advisory, many judges have used their greater flexibility to sentence defendants below the applicable guideline range, in the manner urged by Judge Bright in dissent. The Sentencing Commission followed some of these cues and changed its course on certain offender characteristics. Before 2010, a defendant’s age, mental and emotional conditions, physical condition, and military service were deemed “not ordinarily relevant.” Now the Commission’s policy statement provides that these factors “may be relevant” in determining whether a departure is permitted—if these factors are “present to an unusual degree and distinguish the case from the typical cases.” The Commission did not, however, change its views on family circumstances and community service. Was the Commission correct to distinguish between these two groups of offender characteristics? What might justify its approach? Why should military service be a factor in a defendant’s sentence? Should it count only when the military service creates a condition—such as post-traumatic stress disorder—that is related to the criminal behavior? Or is service relevant even if it does not bear such a relationship, because it demonstrates prior good acts by the defendant? Every sentencing regime takes into account a defendant’s prior bad acts (i.e., past criminal conduct) at sentencing; is there a principled reason for not taking into account prior good acts as well? See Carissa Byrne Hessick, Why Are Only Bad Acts Good Sentencing Factors?, 88 B.U. L. Rev. 1109 (2008).</p>
<p id="772afcb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Culture.</i> Judge Bright included an appendix to his dissent entitled “Lifting the Curtain on Assaults Against Women and Children in Indian Country.” It quoted at length from Mark J. MacDougall &amp; Katherine Deming Brodie, Strange Justice in Indian Country, Nat’l L.J. (Sept. 28, 2009), which contains some sobering statistics, including the fact that one in three women living on reservations will be raped in her lifetime, a rate roughly double that found in surveys of American adult women generally.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11357_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11357_12a1e9ac-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">51</a></span> Such statistics led Judge Bright to conclude: “The violence against women and children on Indian reservations is a national scandal. . . . If the violence against Ms. Deegan had been stopped . . . and she had been given moral and societal assistance in raising the three children in her family, this crime of neonaticide might never have occurred.” Id. at 664. How, if at all, should the prevalence of violence on reservations in general and in Deegan’s life in particular affect her sentence?</p>
<p id="772afcb3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="1260" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1260">p. 1260</span>In Canada, judges must pay particular attention in sentencing to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders in an effort to ameliorate their overrepresentation in prison. R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 (Can.); see Christopher Sewrattan, Apples, Oranges, and Steel: The Effect of Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Drug Offences on the Equality Rights of Aboriginal Peoples, 46 U.B.C. L. Rev. 121, 129-130 (2013). Should a similar approach be taken in the United States to its native population? Should that same standard apply to African Americans, given their long history of disadvantage in the United States? Should judges consider more lenient treatment for anyone coming from economically disadvantaged circumstances? For the debate about the relevance of environmental deprivation to just punishment, see supra p. 1089. How would Justice Thomas (p. 1092 supra) assess the appropriate punishment for Deegan?</p>
<p id="772afcb4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. The defendant’s personal experience.</i> Should a sentencing court take into account how a particular defendant will experience his or her sentence? Consider State v. Thompson, 735 N.W.2d 818 (Neb. 2007). The defendant had sexually assaulted a child, and the trial court imposed a sentence of probation. One factor in that decision was the defendant’s relatively small stature. Thompson is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 125-130 pounds, and those facts led the trial court to observe: “I look at your physical size . . . and, quite frankly, I shake to think of what might happen to you in prison. . . . I am going to try to put together some kind of order that will keep you out of prison.” Assuming that Thompson’s physical size would increase his risk of being the victim of physical or sexual abuse in prison, was that an appropriate consideration in setting the sentence?</p>
<p id="772afcb5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should a defendant’s <i>subjective</i> experience of punishment be relevant? For an argument that proportionality requires one to consider variations in how defendants experience the suffering associated with punishment, see Adam J. Kolber, The Subjective Experience of Punishment, 109 Colum. L. Rev. 182 (2009); John Bronsteen, Christopher Buccafusco &amp; Jonathan Masur, Happiness and Punishment, 76 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1037 (2009). What are the dangers of a subjectivist approach? For critiques, see Dan Markel &amp; Chad Flanders, Bentham on Stilts: The Bare Relevance of Subjectivity to Retributive Justice, 98 Cal. L. Rev. 907 (2010); David Gray, Punishment as Suffering, 63 Vand. L. Rev. 1619 (2010). Even if judges do not consider the subjective experience of punishment, should prison officials? For a probing, in-depth account of a special unit established in the Los Angeles County Jail to protect the personal security of gay men and trans women, see Sharon Dolovich, Strategic Segregation in the Modern Prison, 48 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1 (2011).</p>

<i>NOTES ON THE JURY’S ROLE IN SENTENCING</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="772afcb8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The constitutional right to jury factfinding.</i> As noted supra p. 38, the defendant has a constitutional right to require the prosecution to prove every <i>element</i> of the offense to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. But as <i>Williams v. <span title="1261" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1261">p. 1261</span>New York</i>, supra p. 1231, makes clear, judges can consider a wide range of factors, and reach judgments about what the facts were, when deciding how severe a sentence to impose. The line between offense elements and sentencing factors is therefore important for delineating the respective province of the judge and the jury. In a series of cases, beginning with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the Supreme Court has taken an active role in policing the line between the jury’s province and that of the judge. The Court has held that “[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 490. The Court then concluded in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 303 (2004), that “the ‘statutory maximum’ for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</i>[,] . . . 
<i>without</i> any additional findings.” The Court in <i>Blakely</i> held that the defendant’s sentence, which Washington state guidelines made mandatory on the basis of facts determined by the sentencing judge, ran afoul of the Sixth Amendment. The Court required the trial judge either to sentence the defendant within the sentencing range supported by the jury’s findings or to hold a separate sentencing hearing before a jury.</p>
<p id="772afcb9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The implications for sentencing under guidelines.</i> In light of <i>Blakely</i>, a number of state courts—after holding their sentencing guideline systems unconstitutional—have required jury findings, beyond a reasonable doubt, for facts necessary to trigger a higher sentencing range. E.g., State v. Shattuck, 704 N.W.2d 131 (Minn. 2005); State v. Schofield, 876 A.2d 43 (Me. 2005).</p>
<p id="772afcba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A year after <i>Blakely</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court, as noted (p. 1252 supra), held the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional as well, but adopted a different remedy. The Court simply made the federal guidelines “advisory” rather than mandatory, and allowed the court of appeals to set aside the sentencing decision of a lower court, whether within the guideline range or not, only when the sentence was found “unreasonable.” The upshot is that the federal guidelines, though no longer mandatory, remain an important factor in the sentencing process. And on the heels of <i>Booker</i>, several states likewise adopted this approach, made their guidelines “advisory,” and held that this step was sufficient to save their constitutionality. E.g., State v. Foster, 845 N.E.2d 470 (Ohio 2006); State v. Natale, 878 A.2d 724 (N.J. 2005). Some commentators view <i>Booker</i> as a welcome restoration of balance in a system that had previously tilted too heavily toward prosecutors. E.g., Paul J. Hofer, Has <i>Booker</i> Restored Balance? A Look at Data on Plea Bargaining and Sentencing, 23 Fed. Sent’g Rep. 326 (2011). Others have argued that without stringent appellate review, trial judges will have too much discretion under <i>Booker</i>. See Stephanos Bibas, Max M. Schanzenbach &amp; Emerson H. Tiller, Policing Politics at Sentencing, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1371 (2009).</p>
<p id="772b23cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The implications for mandatory minimums.</i> Although the Supreme Court initially held that the right to a jury trial does not apply to facts that <span title="1262" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-1262">p. 1262</span>increase only the <i>minimum</i> term as opposed to the <i>maximum</i> term, McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79 (1986), and Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545 (2002), it changed course in Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013), holding that any factual finding that increases a mandatory minimum sentence is an offense element that must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p id="772b23cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Problems. (a)</i> If the system inevitably leads to mistakes by prosecutors, judges, and juries, what kind of second look is appropriate? The American Law Institute’s current draft proposal of new sentencing provisions for the MPC contains a provision that allows judges to revisit long sentences after 15 years. Model Penal Code §305.6 (Am. L. Inst., Tentative Draft, No. 2, 2011). Are judges best positioned to take this second look, or would it be more desirable to have a system of parole and review by parole officers? Is there a role for executive clemency in correcting excessively long sentences? In 2014, President Obama announced a broad effort to use his commutation power to reduce long sentences for nonviolent offenders. Some have criticized the President’s <i>ad hoc</i> approach. For an argument that he should have instead introduced structural changes to the clemency process to correct systemic sentencing errors and prosecutorial overreach and to use evidence-based practices to reduce recidivism and aid with reentry, see Rachel E. Barkow &amp; Mark Osler, Restructuring Clemency: The Cost of Ignoring Clemency and a Plan for Renewal, 82 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1 (2015).</p>
<p id="772b23cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) </i>Where in the criminal justice system should sentencing discretion be located, and how should it be channeled? With or without mandatory minimums, how can a sentencing system simultaneously ensure consistency, effective deterrence, and punishments proportionate to individual culpability?</p>

A loss of $1,000 would produce no increase in the base offense level for fraud of seven, while a loss of $1,000,001 would add sixteen levels and thus increase the offense level from seven to twenty-three. [Other “specific offense characteristics” for which the guidelines mandate upward adjustments of the offense level include the extent of a victim’s physical injury, the quantity of drugs sold, and use of a firearm to commit the offense.—<span class="epub-small-caps">EDS</span>.]</p>

A defendant’s offense level may be reduced based on factors such as his “mitigating role” in the offense, or on “acceptance of responsibility.”</p>

For sentences in Zone B, the judge is permitted to substitute for the minimum term of confinement an equivalent term of home detention or intermittent confinement. In Zone C, the judge may substitute home detention or intermittent confinement, but must impose incarceration for at least half of the minimum term. In Zone D, neither probation nor substitute sanctions are permitted; the judge must impose a prison sentence for at least the term at the low end of the guideline range.
