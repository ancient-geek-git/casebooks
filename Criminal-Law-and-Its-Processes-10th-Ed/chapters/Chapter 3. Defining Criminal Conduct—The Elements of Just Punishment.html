INTRODUCTION</p></h2></div>


<p id="7686313c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three foundational principles limit the imposition of punishment: legality, culpability, and proportionality. Each of these principles has a long history of recognition in common-law precedents and in state penal codes based on them. This chapter explores that common-law tradition in depth.</p>
<p id="7686313d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, American criminal law has been shaped by the Model Penal Code (MPC)—a project of the American Law Institute, which is a private nonprofit association of prominent lawyers, judges, and academics. Proposals for this “model” code, drafted over a ten-year period by a large group of criminal law scholars and practitioners, culminated in a “Proposed Official Draft,” which the Institute endorsed in 1962. The MPC is not, in itself, “law,” and it is not legally binding anywhere. But since 1962, more than half of the states have enacted modern criminal codes that draw heavily on the MPC, so many state codes look like the MPC. Moreover, the MPC has been influential with courts throughout the country, even in jurisdictions that have not adopted codes based on the MPC. Courts have increasingly used the MPC as a persuasive source of the doctrines and principles that govern the imposition of criminal liability. The Appendix to this book reprints the principal provisions of the MPC in their entirety and, as an introduction to them, provides an overview of the origins and evolution of the MPC. See p. 1263 infra.</p>
<p id="7686313e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like the common-law tradition, the MPC gives central importance to the principles of legality, culpability, and proportionality. Its statement of guiding purposes (§1.02(1)) emphasizes that its provisions aim “to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense” (legality), “to safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal” (culpability), and “to differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses” (proportionality). The Code expands upon the common law by implementing these principles systematically and in detail. Accordingly, along with our close examination of the common-law approach, this chapter focuses on the relevant provisions of the MPC as well.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">HIRT</span>, J. [Two indictments charged that the defendant “intending the morals and manners of the good citizens of this Commonwealth . . . to debauch and corrupt, and further devising and intending to harass, embarrass and vilify . . . one Louise Zivkovich . . . unlawfully, wickedly and maliciously did . . .  make numerous telephone calls to the dwelling house of the said Louise Zivkovich at all times of the day and night, in which said telephone calls and conversations resulting therefrom the said Michael Mochan did wickedly and maliciously refer to the said Louise Zivkovich as a lewd, immoral and lascivious woman of an indecent and lewd character, and other scurrilous opprobrious, filthy, disgusting and indecent language . . . to the great damage, injury and oppression of the said Louise Zivkovich and other good citizens of this Commonwealth . . . , and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” . . . Defendant was tried and convicted before a judge without a jury. He appealed on the ground that the conduct charged in the indictments, concededly not a criminal offense under any Pennsylvania statute, did not constitute a misdemeanor at common law.]</p><p id="76865857-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a number of States and especially in the common law State of Pennsylvania the common law of England, as to crimes, is in force except in so far as it has been abrogated by statute. The indictments . . . by their language, clearly purported to charge a common law crime not included in our Penal Code or elsewhere in our statutory law. . . . 
</p><p id="76865858-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is of little importance that there is no precedent in our reports which decides the precise question here involved. The test is not whether precedents can be found in the books but whether the alleged crimes could have been prosecuted and the offenders punished under the common law. In Commonwealth v. Miller, 94 Pa. Super. 499, 507, the controlling principles are thus stated: “The common law is sufficiently broad to punish as a misdemeanor, although there may be no exact precedent, any act which directly injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer, as in the case of acts which injuriously affect public morality, or obstruct, or pervert public justice, or the administration of government.” Cf. Com. of Penna. v. DeGrange, 97 Pa. Super. 181, in which <span title="159" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-159">p. 159</span>it is said: “Whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public morals is a misdemeanor at common law.” Any act is indictable at common law which from its nature scandalously affects the morals or health of the community. . . .

Commonwealth, 54 Pa. 209. The present defendant’s criminal intent was evidenced by a number of overt acts beyond the mere oral solicitation of adultery. The vile and disgusting suggestions of sodomy alone and the otherwise persistent lewd, immoral and filthy language used by the defendant, take these cases out of the principle of the <i>Smith</i> case. Moreover potentially at least, defendant’s acts injuriously affected public morality. The operator or anyone on defendant’s four-party telephone line could have listened in on the conversations, and at least two other persons in Mrs. Zivkovich’s household heard some of defendant’s immoral and obscene language over the telephone.</p><p id="7686585a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] charges in the body of the indictments identify the offense as a common law misdemeanor and the testimony established the guilt of the defendant.</p><p id="7686585b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judgments and sentences affirmed.</p><p id="7686585c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">WOODSIDE</span>, J.

They have done this by the application of such general principles as “it is a crime to do anything which injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer”; and “whatever openly outrages decency and is injurious to public morals is a misdemeanor.” . . . Under the division of powers in our constitution it is for the legislature to determine what “injures or tends to injure the public.”</p><p id="7686585e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most important functions of a legislature is to determine what acts “require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer.” There is no reason for the legislature to enact any criminal laws if the courts delegate to themselves the power to apply such general principles as are here applied to whatever conduct may seem to the courts to be injurious to the public.</p><p id="7686585f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no doubt that the common law is a part of the law of this Commonwealth, and we punish many acts under the common law. But after nearly two hundred years of constitutional government in which the legislature and not the courts have been charged by the people with the responsibility of deciding which acts do and which do not injure the public to the extent which requires punishment, it seems to me we are making an unwarranted invasion of the legislative field when we arrogate that responsibility to ourselves by declaring now, for the first time, that certain acts are a crime.</p><p id="76865860-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the legislature invades either the judicial or the executive fields, or the executive invades either the judicial or legislative fields, the courts stand <span title="160" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-160">p. 160</span>ready to stop them. But in matters of this type there is nothing to prevent our invasion of the legislative field except our own self restraint. . . . Until the legislature says that what the defendant did is a crime, I think the courts should not declare it to be such.</p><p id="76865861-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I would therefore reverse the lower court and discharge the appellant.</p></div>

<i>1. The legality principle.</i> One of the most ancient and widely repeated doctrines of the criminal law is the legality principle, often stated as <i>nulla poena sine lege</i>—no punishment without law. Does the conviction in <i>Mochan</i> violate the <i>nulla poena</i> requirement? Or is that requirement satisfied by the preexisting Pennsylvania doctrine making it a misdemeanor to commit “any act which directly injures or tends to injure the public to such an extent as to require the state to interfere and punish the wrongdoer”?</p>
<p id="76867f75-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In thinking about these questions, consider what values the <i>nulla poena</i> requirement might serve. Perhaps most obvious is the need to give individuals <i>fair warning</i> as to the conduct that could subject them to prosecution. Another is the need to <i>control discretion</i> of police, prosecutors, and juries. Reflecting these concerns, the legality principle bars both <i>retroactivity</i> and <i>vagueness</i>: The <i>nulla poena</i> principle requires previously established law and that law must be announced in reasonably clear terms, so that the average person does not have to guess its meaning. The bans on retroactivity and vagueness now have constitutional status, at least under some circumstances. The constitutional issues are explored below, retroactivity in connection with <i>Keeler v. Superior Court</i>, p. 176 infra, and vagueness in connection with <i>City of Chicago v. Morales</i>, p. 185 infra.</p>
<p id="76867f76-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is it wise to place strict limits on fashioning new criminal offenses retroactively? Do the requirements of prospectivity and clarity give devious criminals an opportunity to engage in “loop-holing,” finding clever ways to cheat and injure others in ways not specifically prohibited? Or is loop-holing a price we must pay for affording fair notice and controlling discretion? An unusual British decision similar to <i>Mochan</i> upheld a conviction for a new common-law offense (in this instance, “conspiracy to corrupt public morals”) on the basis of conduct involving publication of a directory of prostitutes and their services (Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1962] A.C. 220 (House of Lords)). Viscount Simonds stated:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76867f77-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]here remains in the courts of law a residual power to enforce the supreme and fundamental purpose of the law, to conserve not only the safety and order but also the moral welfare of the State, and . . . it is their duty to guard it against attacks which may be the more insidious because they are novel and unprepared for. [G]aps [in statutory law] will always remain since no one can foresee every way in which the wickedness of man may disrupt the order of society. [I]f the common law is powerless in such an event, then we should no longer do her reverence.</p>

<i>2. The institutional limits of courts.</i> Suppose that the Pennsylvania court had reversed Mochan’s conviction for lack of fair warning but had held that, in the future, anyone making obscene phone calls with intent to harass or embarrass the recipient would be guilty of a misdemeanor. Suppose that the court, concerned about possible vagueness, had given specific examples of the kind of language that would be considered “obscene.” If Mochan then continued to engage in similar conduct after the court’s decision and if he were convicted for his subsequent behavior, would that conviction still be troublesome? Is it acceptable for courts to provide the needed specificity, so long as they only do so prospectively? Or does the legality principle reflect important separation-of-powers values in addition to those protected by requiring prospectivity and clarity? Reconsider Judge Woodside’s dissent.</p>
<p id="76867f79-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Old common-law crimes.</i> For centuries, the English Parliament met infrequently and legislated only sporadically. The criminal law, like the rest of the law, was left to the courts, and it developed slowly, case by case, in what we call the common-law method. As a result, crimes like murder, manslaughter, larceny, and many others were defined by the judges, with essentially no guidance from Parliament. By the time of the American Revolution, the definitions of these offenses had been largely settled through this common-law process.</p>
<p id="76867f7a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After Independence, most of the new American states continued to apply the common law of England, except to the extent that it was specifically repealed by new statutes. Thus, judge-made crimes like murder, manslaughter, and larceny, often called “common law crimes,” remained in force throughout the United States. As more penal laws were enacted, some states made their new legislation exclusive and abrogated all common-law crimes not recognized in new statutes. Others—like Pennsylvania at the time of <i>Mochan</i>—took the position that the common law of England remained applicable in the absence of contrary state legislation. See Note, Common Law Crimes in the United States, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 1332 (1947).</p>
<p id="76867f7b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The initial round of state criminal enactments, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, typically codified the common-law definitions, or sometimes simply incorporated them by implication, for example, by enacting a homicide statute that gave no definition of murder and stated merely that “all murder is punishable by death.” Thus, many offenses against persons and property retained their traditional, judge-made definitions and continued to be referred to as “common law crimes,” even after they had been promulgated in statutory form.</p>
<p id="76867f7c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Starting in the 1960s, statutes adopting the common-law definitions were replaced in most states by modern codifications inspired by the Model Penal Code. But penal codes that reflect the older pattern can still be found in perhaps as many as a third of the states. In these states, “common law crimes” of the older sort remain in force; their definitions, though initially judge-made, have long since solidified and won legislative approval. These older common-law crimes, despite their name, pose none of the problems presented in a case <span title="162" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-162">p. 162</span>like <i>Mochan</i>, where judges define and punish an offense not previously recognized by statute or precedent.</p>

<i>4. New common-law crimes.</i> Contrary to the decision in <i>Mochan</i>, nearly all American jurisdictions—including Pennsylvania—have now abolished the common-law doctrine that courts can create new crimes. See, e.g., 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §107(b) (2016). The doctrine still survives in a few states, however. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. §775.01 (2016) (“The common law of England in relation to crimes, except so far as the same relates to the modes and degrees of punishment, shall be of full force in this state where there is no existing provision by statute on the subject.”); Mich. Const. art. III, §7 (2016); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §750.505 (2016); N.M. Stat. Ann. §30-1-3 (2016).</p>
<p id="76867f7e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court has never held it unconstitutional for state judges to create new common-law crimes. To the contrary, the Court recently confirmed that judicial crime-creation is constitutionally permissible under some circumstances, as we will discuss in connection with <i>Rogers v. Tennessee</i>, p. 181 infra. Nonetheless, as a matter of general criminal law principles (as distinct from the narrower requirements of constitutional law), the Court led the opposition to common-law crimes, with an early decision rejecting the authority of federal judges to create new crimes for matters prosecuted in federal courts. United States v. Hudson &amp; Goodwin, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812). Soon thereafter, in United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820), Chief Justice John Marshall elaborated, emphasizing the “plain principle, that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the court, which is to define a crime, and ordain a punishment.” See also United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971): “Because of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity.”</p>
<p id="76867f7f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. The meaning of legislation.</i> Because, under the prevailing view, crimes must be defined by statute, the reach of the criminal law is determined solely by statutory language. But it is left to the courts to interpret what the statutory language means. How should judges go about this task? Should they approach it differently in criminal than in civil cases? How can judges make sure the crime is really defined by the legislature, not by the court? Consider these questions as you read the cases that follow.</p>

The judgment was affirmed. . . . A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on the question whether the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applies to aircraft. That Act provides: “Sec. 2. That when used in this Act: (a) The term ‘motor vehicle’ shall include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motor cycle, or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails; . . . Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.”</p><p id="7686a696-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . The question is the meaning of the word “vehicle” in the phrase “any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails.” No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to signify a conveyance working on land, water or air, and sometimes legislation extends the use in that direction. . . . But in everyday speech “vehicle” calls up the picture of a thing moving on land. . . . So here, the phrase under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words “any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails” still indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land, is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Airplanes were well-known in 1919, when this statute was passed; but it is admitted that they were not mentioned in the reports or in the debates in Congress. It is impossible to read words that so carefully enumerate the different forms of motor vehicles and have no reference of any kind to aircraft, as including airplanes under a term that usage more and more precisely confines to a different class. . . . 
</p><p id="7686a697-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft, simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that, if the legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used.</p><p id="7686a698-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judgment reversed.</p></div>

<p id="7686a6a3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, legislation designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation.

Mindful that in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching construction of §1519 is in order: A tangible object captured by §1519, we hold, must be one used to record or preserve information.</p>

At the time, federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red grouper less than 20 inches long. Violation of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension. Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship’s catch, [and] determined that 72 fish fell short of the 20-inch mark. With few exceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20 inches; . . . none were less than 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring below 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus segregated, in the <span title="165" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-165">p. 165</span>crates until the <i>Miss Katie</i> returned to port [where Jones again] measured the fish. . . . This time, however, the measured fish . . . slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board. [O]ne of the crew members admitted that, at Yates’s direction, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.</p>
<p id="7686cdb6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Yates] was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in violation of §2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of §1519. By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. No measured fish in Yates’s catch fell below that limit. The record does not reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation.</p>

<p id="7686cdb9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron’s massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company’s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents. . . . Prior law made it an offense to “intimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e] <i>another person</i>” to shred documents. §1512(b). Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself. . . . In the Government’s view, §1519 extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage [to impose] a general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under federal investigation.</p>
<p id="7686cdba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yates urges a contextual reading of §1519, tying “tangible object” to the surrounding words, the placement of the provision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time. . . . Section 1519, he maintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records, documents, and tangible objects used to preserve them, <i>e.g.</i>, computers, servers, and other media on which information is stored.</p>
<p id="7686cdbb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We agree with Yates and reject the Government’s unrestrained reading. “Tangible object” in §1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world.</p>

<span title="166" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-166">p. 166</span>
<b>A.</b> The ordinary meaning of an “object” that is “tangible,” as stated in dictionary definitions, is “a discrete . . . thing” that “possess[es] physical form,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the Government concludes that “tangible object,” as that term appears in §1519, covers the waterfront, including fish from the sea.</p>
<p id="7686cdbd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather, “[t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Ordinarily, a word’s usage accords with its dictionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things. [A]lthough dictionary definitions . . . bear consideration, they are not dispositive of the meaning of “tangible object” in §1519.</p>
<p id="7686cdbe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Supporting a reading of “tangible object,” as used in §1519, in accord with dictionary definitions, the Government points to . . . Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 [which] requires the prosecution to . . . grant a defendant’s request to inspect “tangible objects” within the Government’s control that have utility for the defense. . . . Rule 16’s reference to “tangible objects” has been interpreted to include any physical evidence. Rule 16 is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive construction of “tangible objects” is fitting. In contrast, §1519 is a penal provision that refers to “tangible object” not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind, including those not yet begun. Just as the context of Rule 16 supports giving “tangible object” a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition, the context of §1519 tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.</p>
<p id="7686cdbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>B.</b> Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words “tangible object” as they appear in §1519. We note first §1519’s caption: “Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.” That heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence. . . . Neither does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which §1519 was placed: “Criminal penalties for altering documents.” . . . While these headings are not commanding, they supply cues that Congress did not intend “tangible object” in §1519 to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind. . . . If Congress indeed meant to make §1519 an all-encompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the dissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent.</p>
<p id="7686cdc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . The contemporaneous passage of §1512(c)(1) . . . is also instructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides: “(c) Whoever corruptly—(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.” . . .

<span title="167" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-167">p. 167</span>Yates does not dispute . . . that §1512(c)(1)’s reference to “other object” includes any and every physical object. But if §1519’s reference to “tangible object” already included all physical objects . . . then Congress had no reason to enact §1512(c)(1): . . . Nowhere does the Government explain what independent function §1512(c)(1) would serve if the Government is right about the sweeping scope of §1519. We resist a reading of §1519 that would render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.</p>
<p id="7686f4d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words immediately surrounding “tangible object” in §1519—“falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document”—also cabin the contextual meaning of that term. [W]e rely on the principle of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>—a word is known by the company it keeps—to “avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.” [“Tangible object”] is therefore appropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents, <i>i.e.</i>, objects used to record or preserve information. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7686f4d3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A canon related to <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, <i>ejusdem generis</i>, counsels: “Where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.” . . . Had Congress intended “tangible object” in §1519 to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no reason to refer specifically to “record” or “document.” The Government’s unbounded reading of “tangible object” would render those words misleading surplusage. . . . It is highly improbable that Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial record-keeping. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7686f4d4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt . . . , we would invoke the rule that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” . . . “[T]he rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining criminal liability.” “[I]t is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.”</p>
<p id="7686f4d5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . For the reasons stated, we resist reading §1519 expansively to create a coverall spoliation of evidence statute, advisable as such a measure might be. Leaving that important decision to Congress, we hold that a “tangible object” within §1519’s compass is one used to record or preserve information. . . .

A related canon, <i>ejusdem generis</i> teaches that general words following a list of specific words should usually . . . mean something “similar.” Applying these canons to §1519’s list of nouns, the term “tangible object” should refer to something similar to records or documents. A fish does not spring to mind. . . .  [W]ho wouldn’t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to a “record” or “document,” said “crocodile”?</p>
<p id="7686f4d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This reading, of course, has its shortcomings . . . because “record” and “document” are themselves quite general. [A]dding “tangible object” to §1519 would ensure beyond question that electronic files are included. . . .  Congress enacts “catchall[s]” for “known unknowns.” But where <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> apply, “known unknowns” should be similar to known knowns, <i>i.e.</i>, here, records and documents. This is especially true because reading “tangible object” too broadly could render “record” and “document” superfluous.</p>
<p id="7686f4da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next, consider §1519’s list of verbs: “alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in.” . . . How does one make a false entry in a fish? “Alters” and especially “falsifies” are also closely associated with filekeeping. . . . Finally, my analysis is influenced by §1519’s title: “Destruction, alteration, or falsification of <i>records</i> in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.” This too points toward filekeeping, not fish. [T]he title would not be enough on its own. In conjunction with those other two textual features, however, the Government’s argument, though colorable, becomes too implausible to accept.</p>

 . . . The term “tangible object” is broad, but clear. . . . And in §1519, context confirms what bare text says: All the words surrounding “tangible object” show that Congress meant the term to have a wide range. That fits with Congress’s evident purpose . . . to punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence—<i>any</i> physical evidence—with the intent of thwarting federal law enforcement. . . .

 . . . When Congress has not supplied a definition, we generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning. . . . [T]he ordinary meaning of “tangible object” is “a discrete thing that possesses physical form.” A fish is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form. See generally Dr. Seuss, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960). So the ordinary meaning of the term “tangible object” in §1519, as no one here disputes, covers fish (including too-small red grouper).</p>

 . . . I agree with the plurality (really, who does not?) that context matters in interpreting statutes. . . . And sometimes that means, as the plurality says, that the dictionary definition of a disputed term cannot control. But this is not such an occasion, for here the text and its context point the same way. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76871bf0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Begin with the way the surrounding words in §1519 reinforce the breadth of the term at issue. . . . And the adjacent laundry list of verbs in §1519 (“alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry”) further shows that Congress wrote a statute with a wide scope. Those words are supposed to ensure—just as “tangible object” is meant to—that §1519 covers the whole world of evidence-tampering, in all its prodigious variety. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76871bf1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And legislative history, for those who care about it, puts extra icing on a cake already frosted. [Section] 1519 . . . prohibited a person from inducing another to destroy “record[s], document[s], or other object[s]”—of every type—but not from doing so himself. Congress . . . enacted §1519 to close that yawning gap. But §1519 could fully achieve that goal only if it covered all the records, documents, and objects §1512 did. . . . And so §1519 was written . . . “to apply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence,” as long as performed with the requisite intent. “When a person destroys evidence,” the drafters explained, “overly technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution.” Ah well: Congress, meet today’s Court, which here invents just such a distinction with just such an effect. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 343 (1963) (“[C]reat[ing] a large loophole in a statute designed to close a loophole” is “illogical and disrespectful of . . . congressional purpose”). . . .

<b>A.</b> The plurality searches far and wide for anything—<i>anything</i>—to support its interpretation of §1519. But its fishing expedition comes up empty.</p>
<p id="76871bf4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality’s analysis starts with §1519’s title: “Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.” [But] we have followed “the wise rule that the title of a statute and the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.” . . . A title is, almost necessarily, an abridgment. [A]ccordingly, “matters in the text . . . are frequently unreflected in the headings.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76871bf5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality’s [further] argument, relying on the surplusage canon, at least invokes a known tool of statutory construction—but it too comes to nothing. Says the plurality: If read naturally, §1519 “would render superfluous” §1512(c)(1), which Congress passed “as part of the same act.” But that is not so: Although the two provisions significantly overlap, each applies to conduct the other does not. The key difference between the two is that §1519 protects the integrity of “matter[s] within the jurisdiction of any [federal] department or agency” whereas §1512(c)(1) safeguards “official proceeding[s].” . . . Section 1519’s language often applies more broadly than <span title="170" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-170">p. 170</span>§1512(c)(1)’s. . . . For example, an FBI investigation counts as a matter within a federal department’s jurisdiction, but falls outside the statutory definition of “official proceeding” as construed by courts. [C]onversely, §1512(c)(1) sometimes reaches more widely than §1519. For example, because an “official proceeding” includes any “proceeding before a judge or court of the United States,” §1512(c)(1) prohibits tampering with evidence in federal litigation between private parties [but] §1519 wouldn’t ordinarily operate in that context because a federal court isn’t a “department or agency.” So the surplusage canon doesn’t come into play. Overlap—even significant overlap—abounds in the criminal law. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76874306-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Getting nowhere with surplusage, the plurality switches canons, hoping that <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> will save it. [But] this Court uses <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i> to resolve ambiguity, not create it. [W]hen words have a clear definition, and all other contextual clues support that meaning, the canons cannot properly defeat Congress’s decision to draft broad legislation. Anyway, assigning “tangible object” its ordinary meaning comports with <i>noscitur a sociis</i> and <i>ejusdem generis</i>
 . . . . Those canons require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a statutory phrase. [T]he plurality characterizes records and documents as things that preserve information—and so they are. But just as much, they are things that provide information, and thus potentially serve as evidence. . . . The destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries. And so too does the destruction of tangible objects—of whatever kind. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76874307-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, when all else fails, the plurality invokes the rule of lenity. But even in its most robust form, that rule only kicks in when, “after all legitimate tools of interpretation have been exhausted, ‘a reasonable doubt persists’ regarding whether Congress has made the defendant’s conduct a federal crime.” No such doubt lingers here. The plurality points to the breadth of §1519, as though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity. It is not. Section 1519 <i>is</i> very broad. It is also very clear. Every traditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the same direction, toward “object” meaning object. Lenity offers no proper refuge from that straightforward (even though capacious) construction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10357_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10357_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span>

<b>B.</b> [T]he concurrence suggests applying the term “tangible object” in keeping with what “a neighbor, when asked to identify something similar to record or document,” might answer. “[W]ho wouldn’t raise an eyebrow,” the concurrence wonders, if the neighbor said “crocodile”? . . . But §1519’s meaning should not hinge on the odd game of Mad Libs the concurrence proposes. No one reading §1519 needs to fill in a blank after the words “records” and <span title="171" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-171">p. 171</span>“documents.” That is because Congress, quite helpfully, already did so—adding the term “tangible object.” The issue in this case is what that term means. So if the concurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question, I’d recommend a more pertinent one: Do you think a fish (or, if the concurrence prefers, a crocodile) is a “tangible object”? As to that query, “who wouldn’t raise an eyebrow” if the neighbor said “no”?</p>
<p id="7687430a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he concurrence neglects the proper function of catchall phrases like “or tangible object.” The reason Congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things that, in the concurrence’s words, “do[] not spring to mind.” . . . Congress realizes that in a game of free association with “record” and “document,” it will never think of all the other things—including crocodiles and fish—whose destruction or alteration can (less frequently but just as effectively) thwart law enforcement. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687430b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concurrence suggests that the term “tangible object” serves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to “ensure beyond question” that e-mails and other electronic files fall within §1519’s compass. But that claim is eyebrow-raising in its own right. Would a Congress wishing to make certain that §1519 applies to e-mails add the phrase “tangible object” (as opposed, say, to “electronic communications”)? Would a judge or jury member predictably find that “tangible object” encompasses something as virtual as e-mail (as compared, say, with something as real as a fish)? If not (and the answer is not), then that term cannot function as a failsafe for e-mails. . . .

 . . . I think the plurality somewhat—though only somewhat—exaggerates the matter. The plurality omits from its description of §1519 the requirement that a person act “knowingly” and with “the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence” federal law enforcement. And in highlighting §1519’s maximum penalty, the plurality glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum. (Let’s not forget that Yates’s sentence was not 20 years, but 30 days.) Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to minor. That is assuredly true of acts obstructing justice. . . . Most district judges, as Congress knows, will recognize differences [and] try to make the punishment fit the crime. Still and all, I tend to think, for the reasons the plurality gives, that §1519 is a bad law—too broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion. And I’d go further: In those ways, §1519 is unfortunately not an outlier, but an emblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code.</p>

<i>1. The rule of lenity.</i> What, precisely, is the “rule of lenity”? In <i>Yates</i>, the plurality opinion states the rule as requiring that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” The opinion further notes that this rule “ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining criminal liability.” Note the qualification that the rule applies only to <i>criminal</i> statutes. Why don’t we apply a similar “fair warning” requirement in civil cases that can result in severe negative consequences, such as the taking of a home or the revocation of a person’s right to practice her profession? And government actions in the civil regulatory sphere raise the same separation of powers concerns about the respective roles of the legislature, the court, and the enforcing agency. What, if anything, is unique about criminal matters?</p>
<p id="76876a24-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two distinct versions of the criminal law’s lenity doctrine have developed. In one, the doctrine operates at the outset to block judicial speculation about the significance of context and legislative intent; it requires courts to adopt the narrowest plausible interpretation of a criminal statute’s text. In the other version, the doctrine comes into play only as a “last resort,” when all other tools of interpretation fail to clarify the statute’s meaning. The first approach was more common in the past, and it still has prominent defenders. See, e.g., United States v. R.L.C., 503 U.S. 291, 307 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring). The second approach is dominant in state and federal courts today. See United States v. Taylor, 640 F.3d 255, 260-261 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[W]hen there are two equally plausible interpretations. . . . ‘[T]he tie must go to the defendant.’”). But doesn’t the second approach defeat the lenity doctrine’s goal of ensuring fair warning? If a defendant could have determined a statute’s meaning only by consulting legislative history and applying other complex tools of statutory interpretation, can we really say that he had fair warning?</p>
<p id="76876a25-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the rule of lenity is typically applied as a matter of judge-made common law, it can be codified. In 2015, Texas promulgated a statute that requires reasonable ambiguities in statutes to be resolved in favor of defendants. Tex. Govt. Code §311.035 (2015). The Model Penal Code, along with many state statutes, takes a different approach, in which lenity gets no special consideration at all. See MPC §1.02(3), Appendix.</p>
<p id="76876a26-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In evaluating each of these approaches, consider how they apply in the following situations:</p>

<i>(a) McBoyle.</i> What purpose was served by reversing McBoyle’s conviction? Would upholding the conviction have subjected McBoyle to punishment without fair warning? Perhaps the Court was less concerned with fairness to McBoyle than with protecting the prerogatives of the legislature. But was there any reason to think that Congress did not want to punish actions like McBoyle’s? Do we know what punishment Congress thought appropriate to authorize? Are the reasons for federal involvement weaker in the case of stolen airplanes than in the case of stolen automobiles?</p>
<p id="76876a28-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Yates.</i> What purpose was served by reversing Yates’s conviction? Yates certainly knew it was wrong for him to throw the fish overboard. And he does not contest his conviction under 18 U.S.C. §2232(a). Under these circumstances, how can Yates reasonably claim a lack of fair warning for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. §1519? Perhaps the problem is that Yates is exposed to greater punishment (a maximum of 20 years) under §1519 than under §2232(a) (a maximum of five years). But given that he received a sentence of only 30 days, does this argument hold? Arguably, there is a broader principle at work: If the dissent is right that “§1519 is a bad law—too broad and undifferentiated, with too-high maximum penalties, which give prosecutors too much leverage and sentencers too much discretion,” isn’t the rule of lenity still necessary to mitigate the problems of severity and discretion, even if a particular defendant did not suffer the harshest potential consequences? But if the dissent is correct that §1519 is “not an outlier, but an emblem of a deeper pathology,” does that suggest that courts have been too lax in their commitment to principles of legality and lenity?</p>
<p id="76876a29-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As in <i>McBoyle</i>, an additional concern may have been the court’s desire to ensure that criminalization decisions be made by the legislature, not by the courts. Are there reasons to think that Congress did not want to punish conduct like Yates’s? What result seems more consistent with Congress’s intent? Both the plurality and the dissent observe that the provision came about because of a previous loophole in the law: While the prior law reached instances where an individual coerced a third person to destroy evidence, it did not cover situations where an individual destroyed such evidence on his or her own. Does it make sense to limit the coverage of a law that is designed to fill such a loophole? Or is it unclear how far Congress intended to go in filling the gap? But even if filling the loophole is a laudable goal, there remains a question whether the best way to do so is to use broad language that leaves wide charging discretion to prosecutors. Does the prosecutor’s charging decision in <i>Yates</i> itself demonstrate the need for reading statutes more narrowly to cabin prosecutorial overreach?</p>

<i>(c) Using a gun.</i> A federal statute, 18 U.S.C. §924(c), imposes a five-year mandatory minimum sentence on anyone who “during and in relation to [a drug trafficking crime] uses or carries a firearm.” John Angus Smith attempted to buy two ounces of cocaine, but instead of paying cash, he offered to trade the drugs for his MAC10 firearm. Prosecutors argued that the five-year penalty enhancement applied to anyone who “uses” a firearm in this fashion. The <span title="174" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-174">p. 174</span>legislative history was silent on the subject. In Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993), the Court acknowledged that the statutory language “normally evokes an image of . . . use as a weapon.” But the Court also saw “no reason why Congress would have [drawn] a fine metaphysical distinction between a gun’s role in a drug offense as a weapon and its role as an item of barter; it creates a grave possibility of violence and death in either capacity.” On that ground, the Court held that “use” should be interpreted to include use of a gun as a form of payment. Do you agree? Is the result consistent with <i>McBoyle</i>?</p>

<i>2. Legislative intent.</i> Statutory interpretation, in criminal cases and all others, begins with the text of the statute itself. But determining a statute’s meaning by considering legislative history and other evidence of the legislature’s apparent intent is also well accepted, especially for statutes outside the domain of criminal law. See, e.g., Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597, 610 n.4 (1991). That is not to say that divining legislative intent from sources beyond the text is always straightforward. State legislatures often produce spotty legislative history. Even where legislative history exists, it is often hard to determine what was the intent of the body as a whole, because different members may express different views and support a law for different reasons. In part because of these concerns, Justice Scalia was an outspoken critic of the use of legislative history. Consider Antonin Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 17-18, 22 (1997):</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Though he objects to reliance on legislative history, Justice Scalia maintains that textual meaning, when ambiguous, can be identified by resort to “canons of construction,” such as the canons of <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis</i> discussed in <i>Yates</i>. But notice that the plurality and the dissent, both relying on those canons, drew diametrically opposed conclusions from them. Under those circumstances, do the canons leave judges just as much (or more) room for discretionary judgment as legislative history does? See William N. Eskridge, Jr., The New Textualism, 37 UCLA L. Rev. 621, 675-676 (1990). With respect to the <i>legitimacy</i> of resort to legislative history, consider Stephen Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S. Cal. L.

<i>3. Lenity and the politics of crime</i>. Professor Dan Kahan argues that in practice the federal courts have abandoned lenity. He further claims that the abandonment of lenity is a good thing—that courts should seek to fashion sensible laws rather than leaving this task to Congress. Dan H. Kahan, Lenity and Federal Common Law Crimes, 1994 Sup. Ct. Rev. 345. He notes that “[m]aking law takes time, [and] takes political consensus, which is difficult and time-consuming to generate.” Further, the “same constraints that prevent Congress from enacting a detailed solution to a complex and controversial problem may also prevent Congress from adapting any such solution to changed circumstances.” Id. at 351-352. As a result, he argues that allowing Congress to delegate its criminal lawmaking responsibilities to the courts “is much more efficient and more effective than [requiring Congress] to make criminal law without judicial assistance.” Id. at 345.</p>
<p id="76879140-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But doesn’t the problem of congressional inertia arise again if courts misunderstand what Congress would have wanted? How easy will it be for Congress to fix such misunderstandings? The answer may depend on the direction in which the judicial error lies. If the courts resolve doubts in favor of <i>broader</i> criminal liability than Congress prefers, will potential defendants have effective ways to lobby Congress to correct the error? Studies find that the one area where Congress is relatively quick to act to fix a judicial interpretation with which it disagrees involves criminal statutes that have been interpreted more leniently than the prosecution prefers; the Department of Justice gets Congress’s ear quickly. Matthew R. Christiansen &amp; William N. Eskridge, Jr., Congressional Overrides of Supreme Court Statutory Interpretation Decisions, 1967-2011, 92 Tex. L. Rev. 1317, 1383 (2014). The Supreme Court has noted this dynamic in favor of invoking the “venerable” rule of lenity precisely because it “places the weight of inertia on the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress’s stead.” United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008).</p>

If it was not, petitioner cannot be charged with its “murder.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687b85e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 187 was enacted as part of the Penal Code of 1872. Inasmuch as the provision has not been amended since that date, we must determine the intent of the legislature at the time of its enactment. But section 187 was, in turn, taken verbatim from the first California statute defining murder, part of the <span title="177" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-177">p. 177</span>Crimes and Punishments Act of 1850. . . . We begin, accordingly, by inquiring into the intent of the Legislature in 1850 when it first defined murder as the unlawful and malicious killing of a “human being.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687b85f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that . . . the Legislature of 1850 intended that term to have the settled common law meaning of a person who had been born alive, and did not intend the act of feticide—as distinguished from abortion—to be an offense under the laws of California. . . . We hold that in adopting the definition of murder in Penal Code section 187 the Legislature intended to exclude from its reach the act of killing an unborn fetus.</p>
<p id="7687b860-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The People urge, however, that the sciences of obstetrics and pediatrics have greatly progressed since 1872, to the point where with proper medical care a normally developed fetus prematurely born at 28 weeks or more has an excellent chance of survival, i.e., is “viable”; that the common law requirement of live birth . . . is no longer in accord with scientific fact, since an unborn but viable fetus is now fully capable of independent life; and that one who unlawfully and maliciously terminates such a life should therefore be liable to prosecution for murder under section 187. We may grant the premises of this argument. . . . But we cannot join in the conclusion sought to be deduced. . . . To such a charge there are two insuperable obstacles, one “jurisdictional” and the other constitutional.</p>
<p id="7687b861-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Penal Code section 6 declares in relevant part that “No act or omission” accomplished after the code has taken effect “is criminal or punishable, except as prescribed or authorized by this code, or by some of the statutes which it specifies as continuing in force . . . , or by some ordinance, municipal, county, or township regulation. . . . ” This section embodies a fundamental principle of our tripartite form of government, i.e., that subject to the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the power to define crimes and fix penalties is vested exclusively in the legislative branch. . . . Stated differently, there are no common law crimes in California. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687b862-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We recognize that the killing of an unborn but viable fetus may be deemed by some to be an offense of similar nature and gravity; but . . . to thus extend liability for murder in California is a determination solely within the province of the Legislature. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687b863-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second obstacle to the proposed judicial enlargement of section 187 is the guarantee of due process of law. Assuming arguendo that we have the power to adopt the new construction of this statute as the law of California, such a ruling, by constitutional command, could operate only prospectively, and thus could not in any event reach the conduct of petitioner on February 23, 1969.</p>
<p id="7687df74-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first essential of due process is fair warning of the act which is made punishable as a crime. “That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties, is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law.” (Connally v. General Constr. Co. (1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391.) . . .

<span title="178" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-178">p. 178</span>This requirement of fair warning is reflected in the constitutional prohibition against the enactment of ex post facto laws (U.S. Const., art. I, §§9, 10; Cal. Const. art. I, §16). When a new penal statute is applied retrospectively to make punishable an act which was not criminal at the time it was performed, the defendant has been given no advance notice consistent with due process. And precisely the same effect occurs when such an act is made punishable under a preexisting statute but by means of an unforeseeable <i>judicial</i> enlargement thereof. (Bouie v. City of Columbia (1964) 378 U.S. 347.)</p>
<p id="7687df76-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Bouie</i> two Negroes took seats in the restaurant section of a South Carolina drugstore; no notices were posted restricting the area to whites only. When the defendants refused to leave upon demand, they were arrested and convicted of violating a criminal trespass statute which prohibited entry on the property of another “after notice” forbidding such conduct. Prior South Carolina decisions had emphasized the necessity of proving such notice to support a conviction under the statute. The South Carolina Supreme Court nevertheless affirmed the convictions, construing the statute to prohibit not only the act of entering after notice not to do so but also the wholly different act of remaining on the property after receiving notice to leave.</p>
<p id="7687df77-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The United States Supreme Court reversed the convictions, holding that the South Carolina court’s ruling was “unforeseeable” and when an “unforeseeable state-court construction of a criminal statute is applied retroactively to subject a person to criminal liability for past conduct, the effect is to deprive him of due process of law in the sense of fair warning that his contemplated conduct constitutes a crime.” Analogizing to the prohibition against retrospective penal legislation, the high court reasoned:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7687df78-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, §10, of the Constitution forbids. An ex post facto law has been defined by this Court as one “that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was <i>innocent</i> when done, criminal; and punishes such action,” or “that <i>aggravates</i> a <i>crime</i>, or makes it <i>greater</i> than it was, when committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. If a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction. The fundamental principle that “the required criminal law must have existed when the conduct in issue occurred,” must apply to bar retroactive criminal prohibitions emanating from courts as well as from legislatures.</p>
</div>
<p id="7687df79-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court remarked in conclusion that “Application of this rule is particularly compelling where, as here, the petitioners’ conduct cannot be deemed improper or immoral.” In the case at bar the conduct with which petitioner is charged is certainly “improper” and “immoral,” and it is not contended he was exercising a constitutionally favored right. But the matter is simply one of degree, and it cannot be denied that the guarantee of due process extends to violent as well as peaceful men. The issue remains, would the judicial <span title="179" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-179">p. 179</span>enlargement of section 187 now proposed have been foreseeable to this petitioner? . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687df7a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Turning to the case law, we find no reported decision of the California courts which should have given petitioner notice that the killing of an unborn but viable fetus was prohibited by section 187. . . . Finally, although a defendant is not bound to know the decisional law of other states, . . . the cases decided in our sister states from [1947] to the present are unanimous in requiring proof that the child was born alive before a charge of homicide can be sustained. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687df7b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that the judicial enlargement of section 187 now urged upon us by the People would not have been foreseeable to this petitioner, and hence that its adoption at this time would deny him due process of law. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">BURKE</span>, J., dissenting. The majority hold that “Baby Girl” Vogt, who according to medical testimony, had reached the 35th week of development, had a 96 percent chance of survival, and was “definitely” alive and viable at the time of her death, nevertheless was not a “human being” under California’s homicide statutes. In my view, in so holding, the majority ignore significant common law precedents, frustrate the express intent of the Legislature, and defy reason, logic and common sense. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687df7d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority opinion suggests that we are confined to common law concepts, and to the common law definition of murder or manslaughter. However, the Legislature, in Penal Code sections 187 and 192, has defined those offenses for us: homicide is the unlawful killing of a “human being.” Those words need not be frozen in place as of any particular time, but must be fairly and reasonably interpreted by this court to promote justice and to carry out the evident purposes of the Legislature. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7687df7e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We commonly conceive of human existence as a spectrum stretching from birth to death. However, if this court properly might expand the definition of “human being” at one end of that spectrum, we may do so at the other end. Consider the following example: [There have been continuous] advances in the field of medicine, including new techniques for life revival, restoration and resuscitation such as artificial respiration, open heart massage, transfusions, transplants and a variety of life-restoring stimulants. . . . Would this court ignore these developments and exonerate the killer of an apparently “drowned” child merely because that child would have been pronounced dead in 1648 and 1850? Obviously not. Whether a homicide occurred in that case would be determined by medical testimony regarding the capability of the child to have survived prior to the defendant’s act. And that is precisely the test which this court should adopt in the instant case. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7688068f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority suggest that to do so would improperly create some new offense. However, the offense of murder is no new offense. Contrary to the majority opinion, the Legislature has not “defined the crime of murder in California to apply only to the unlawful and malicious killing of one who has been born alive.” Instead, the Legislature simply used the broad term “human being” and directed the courts to construe that term according to <span title="180" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-180">p. 180</span>its “fair import” with a view to effect the objects of the homicide statutes and promote justice. (Pen. Code, §4.) What justice will be promoted, what objects effectuated, by construing “human being” as excluding Baby Girl Vogt and her unfortunate successors? Was defendant’s brutal act of stomping her to death any less an act of homicide than the murder of a newly born baby? No one doubts that the term “human being” would include the elderly or dying persons whose potential for life has nearly lapsed; their proximity to death is deemed immaterial. There is no sound reason for denying the viable fetus, with its unbounded potential for life, the same status.</p>
<p id="76880690-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority also suggest that such an interpretation of our homicide statutes would deny defendant “fair warning” that his act was punishable as a crime. Aside from the absurdity of the underlying premise that defendant consulted Coke, Blackstone or Hale before kicking Baby Girl Vogt to death, it is clear that defendant had adequate notice that his act could constitute homicide. Due process only precludes prosecution under a new statute insufficiently explicit regarding the specific conduct proscribed, or under a preexisting statute “by means of an unforeseeable <i>judicial</i> enlargement thereof.” . . . The fact that the California courts have not been called upon to determine the precise question before us does not render “unforeseeable” a decision which determines that a viable fetus is a “human being” under those statutes. Can defendant really claim surprise that a 5-pound, 18-inch, 34-week-old, living, viable child is considered to be a human being? . . .

<i>1. The legislative response.</i> Soon after the <i>Keeler</i> decision, the California legislature amended §187 to include the killing of “a fetus” in the definition of murder. Section 187(b) expressly excludes cases of legal abortion with the consent of the mother. The amendment differs from the approach urged in Justice Burke’s dissent, in that viability is not an element of the offense; a killing can constitute murder, within the meaning of §187, whenever the fetus has progressed beyond the embryonic stage of seven to eight weeks. People v. Davis, 872 P.2d 591 (Cal. 1994). Several other states punish fetal homicide as a separate offense, with penalties generally equivalent to those applicable to murder. These statutes, even broader than California’s, apply from the moment of conception. E.g., 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1.2 (2015).</p>

<i>2. Prosecuting pregnant women.</i> Fetal homicide laws were initially enacted to address situations such as the one in <i>Keeler</i>, where a third party attacks a pregnant woman. However, in recent years, states have used fetal homicide laws to prosecute pregnant women themselves for behavior (including substance abuse) that resulted in the death of their unborn children. See, e.g., Bei Bei Shuai v. State, 966 N.E.2d 619 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (charging the defendant with homicide after she ingested rat poison in an effort to kill herself, which resulted in the premature birth and subsequent death of her fetus).

<i>3. The retreat from</i> Bouie. In <i>Bouie v. City of Columbia</i> (discussed in <i>Keeler</i>), the Court reasoned that the due process restrictions on courts include the same ex post facto restrictions applicable to legislatures. That premise remained well entrenched in the case law for more than three decades. But in Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451 (2001), the Supreme Court reconsidered and gave judges considerable scope to change criminal law retroactively.</p>
<p id="76880696-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Wilbert Rogers had stabbed James Bowdery with a butcher knife. Bowdery went into cardiac arrest and then a coma; he died of related complications about 15 months later. Rogers was convicted of murder, but Tennessee at the time followed the long-standing common-law rule that a homicide could be prosecuted as murder only when the victim had died within a year and a day of the defendant’s acts. The Tennessee Supreme Court nonetheless sustained the murder conviction. It concluded that the original justifications for the rule were no longer applicable, announced that “we hereby abolish the common law rule,” and held that its decision eliminating the year-and-a-day requirement applied to Rogers’s case. The U.S. Supreme Court held that this result did not violate the Due Process or Ex Post Facto Clauses:</p>

<p id="76882daa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Petitioner contends that the Ex Post Facto Clause would prohibit the retroactive application of a decision abolishing the year and a day rule if accomplished by the Tennessee Legislature. He claims that the purposes behind the Clause are so fundamental that due process should prevent the Supreme Court of Tennessee from accomplishing the same result by judicial decree. . . . To be sure, our opinion in <i>Bouie</i> does contain some expansive language that is suggestive of the broad interpretation for which petitioner argues. . . . This language, however, was dicta. Our decision in <i>Bouie</i>
 . . . rested on core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent conduct. [N]owhere in the opinion did we go so far as to incorporate jot-for-jot the specific [ex post facto rules] into due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial decisions.</p>

 . . . The Ex Post Facto Clause, by its own terms, does not apply to courts. Extending the Clause to courts through the rubric of due process thus would circumvent the clear constitutional text. It also would evince too little regard for the important institutional and contextual differences between legislating, on the one hand, and common law decisionmaking, on the other.</p>
<p id="76882dac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . In the context of common law doctrines (such as the year and a day rule), there often arises a need to clarify or even to reevaluate prior opinions as new circumstances and fact patterns present themselves. Such judicial acts, whether they be characterized as “making” or “finding” the law, are a necessary part of the judicial business in States in which the criminal law retains some of its common law elements. Strict application of ex post facto principles in that context would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system. . . . It was on account of concerns such as these that <i>Bouie</i> restricted due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial interpretations of criminal statutes to those that are “unexpected and indefensible. . . . ”</p>
<p id="76882dad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We believe this limitation . . . accords common law courts the substantial leeway they must enjoy as they engage in the daily task of . . . reevaluating and refining [criminal defenses] as may be necessary to bring the common law into conformity with logic and common sense. It also adequately respects the due process concern with fundamental fairness and protects against vindictive or arbitrary judicial lawmaking by safeguarding defendants against unjustified and unpredictable breaks with prior law. Accordingly, we conclude that judicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law violates the principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, only where it is “unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.”</p>
<p id="76882dae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Tennessee court’s abolition of the year and a day rule was not <span title="183" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-183">p. 183</span>unexpected and indefensible. The year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law. [T]he primary and most frequently cited justification for the rule is that 13th century medical science was incapable of establishing causation beyond a reasonable doubt when a great deal of time had elapsed between the injury to the victim and his death; . . . advances in medical and related science have so undermined the usefulness of the rule as to render it without question obsolete.</p>
<p id="76882daf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue. [P]etitioner contends that the judicial abolition of the rule in other jurisdictions is irrelevant to whether he had fair warning that the rule in Tennessee might similarly be abolished. . . . Due process, of course, does not require a person to apprise himself of the common law of all 50 States in order to guarantee that his actions will not subject him to punishment in light of a developing trend in the law that has not yet made its way to his State. At the same time, however, the fact that a vast number of jurisdictions have “abolished a rule that has so clearly outlived its purpose” is surely relevant to whether the abolition of the rule in a particular case can be said to be unexpected and indefensible. . . . The [year-and-a-day] rule did not exist as part of Tennessee’s statutory criminal code [and] had never once served as a ground of decision in any prosecution for murder in the State.</p>
<p id="76882db0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is, in short, nothing to indicate that the Tennessee court’s abolition of the rule in petitioner’s case represented an exercise of the sort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against which the Due Process Clause aims to protect. [T]he court’s decision was a routine exercise of common law decisionmaking in which the court brought the law into conformity with reason and common sense. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">SCALIA</span>, J., dissenting: The Court today . . . violates a principle—encapsulated in the maxim <i>nulla poena sine lege</i>—which “dates from the ancient Greeks” and has been described as one of the most “widely held value-judgments in the entire history of human thought.” J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960). Today’s opinion produces, moreover, a curious constitution that only a judge could love. One in which . . . the elected representatives of all the people cannot retroactively make murder what was not murder when the act was committed; but in which unelected judges can do precisely that. . . . I do not believe this is the system that the Framers envisioned—or, for that matter, that any reasonable person would imagine.</p>

</p>
<p id="768854c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court attempts to cabin <i>Bouie</i> by reading it to prohibit only “‘unexpected and indefensible’” judicial law revision. . . . 
<i>Bouie</i> does indeed use those quoted terms; but they have been wrenched entirely out of context. The “fair warning” to which <i>Bouie</i> and subsequent cases referred was not “fair warning that the law might be changed,” but fair warning <i>of what constituted the crime at the time of the offense</i>. . . . According to <i>Bouie</i>, not just “unexpected and indefensible” retroactive changes in the common law of crimes are bad, but all retroactive changes.</p>
<p id="768854c4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . There is no doubt that “fair warning” of the legislature’s intent to change the law does not insulate retroactive legislative criminalization. Such a statute violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, no matter that, at the time the offense was committed, the bill enacting the change was pending and assured of passage. . . . “[F]air warning” of impending change cannot insulate retroactive judicial criminalization either.</p>
<p id="768854c5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . According to the Court, . . . prohibiting retroactive judicial criminalization . . . would “unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system.” That assessment ignores the crucial difference between simply applying a law to a new set of circumstances and changing the law that has previously been applied to the very circumstances before the court. [T]he action before us here [is] a square, head on overruling of prior law. [S]uch retroactive revision of a concededly <span title="184" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-184">p. 184</span>valid legal rule . . . was unheard-of at the time the original Due Process Clause was adopted. [P]roceeding in that fashion would have been regarded as contrary to the judicial traditions embraced within the concept of due process. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768854c6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not a matter, therefore, of “extending the [Ex Post Facto] Clause to courts through the rubric of due process,” and thereby “circumventing the clear constitutional text.” It is simply a matter of determining what due judicial process consists of—and it does not consist of retroactive creation of crimes. . . . Madison wrote that “ex-post-facto laws . . . are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of social legislation.” The Federalist No. 44, p. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). I find it impossible to believe, as the Court does, that this strong sentiment attached only to retroactive laws passed by the legislature, and would not apply equally (or indeed with even greater force) to a court’s production of the same result. . . . The injustice to the individuals affected is no less.</p>
<p id="768854c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if I agreed with the Court that the Due Process Clause is violated only when there is lack of “fair warning” . . . , I would not find such fair warning here. It is not clear to me, in fact, what the Court believes the fair warning consisted of. Was it the mere fact that “the year and a day rule is widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law”? So are many of the elements of common-law crimes, such as “breaking the close” as an element of burglary, or “asportation” as an element of larceny. Are all of these “outdated relics” subject to retroactive judicial rescission? Or perhaps the fair warning consisted of the fact that “the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue.” But why not count in petitioner’s favor . . . (rather than <i>against</i> him) those jurisdictions that have abolished the rule <i>legislatively</i>, and those jurisdictions that have abolished it through <i>prospective</i> rather than <i>retroactive</i> judicial rulings (together, a large majority of the abolitions)? [E]ven if it was predictable that the rule would be changed, it was not predictable that it would be changed <i>retroactively</i>. . . .

Picotte, 661 N.W.2d 381, 394 (Wis. 2003). The Alabama Supreme Court held that any decision to modify that state’s common-law year-and-a-day rule must be made by its legislature.

For example, the Colorado Supreme Court abandoned the judicially created corpus delecti rule (which requires the prosecution to prove that a crime occurred with evidence other than a defendant’s confession), but did not apply the change retroactively because the defendant did not have fair warning, given that the rule had been used in Colorado for more than 100 years. People v. LaRosa, 293 P.3d 567 (Colo. 2013). The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, in contrast, allowed retroactive application of a new exception to the corpus delecti rule because that exception was “not so unexpected and indefensible.” Miller v.

As the city argues in its brief, “the very presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways intimidates residents, who become afraid even to leave their homes and go about their business. That, in turn, imperils community residents’ sense of safety and security, detracts from property values, and can ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods.” . . . We have no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating conduct would be constitutional, but this ordinance broadly covers a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty about the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for respondents’ claim that the ordinance is too vague. . . .

The Illinois Supreme Court recognized that the term “loiter” may have a common and accepted meaning, but the definition of that term in this ordinance—“to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose”—does not. It <span title="188" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-188">p. 188</span>is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an “apparent purpose.” If she were talking to another person, would she have an apparent purpose? If she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street, would she have an apparent purpose?</p>
<p id="7688ca19-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of “loitering,” but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not. . . .

<p id="7688f12d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law. “No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.” Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit. If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. If the police are able to decide arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to disperse, then the Chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth v.

It provides that the officer “shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area.” This vague phrasing raises a host of questions. After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers remain apart? How far must they move?

The Constitution does not permit a legislature to “set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.” United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221 (1876). This ordinance is therefore vague “not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.” Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614 (1971).</p>

Lawson, 461 U.S. at 358. There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes. It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may—indeed, she “shall”—order them to disperse.</p>
<p id="7688f133-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of innocent conduct, we turn, then, to its language to determine if it “necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at 359. . . . The principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this case is the definition of loitering as “to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose.”</p>
<p id="7688f134-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the Illinois Supreme Court interprets that definition, it “provides absolute discretion to police officers to determine what activities constitute loitering.” We have no authority to construe the language of a state statute more narrowly than the construction given by that State’s highest court. . . .

<p id="7688f135-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, the city disputes the Illinois Supreme Court’s interpretation, arguing that the text of the ordinance limits the officer’s discretion. . . .

 . . . Chicago’s gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers. In particular, it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an “apparent purpose.” Indeed, because any person standing on the street has a general “purpose”—even if it is simply to stand—the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible. Under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is “threatening the public peace” to issue a dispersal order. [Infra, Thomas, J., dissenting]. Any police officer in Chicago is free, under the Illinois Supreme Court’s construction of the ordinance, to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse.</p>
<p id="7689174e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence. For example, the Court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance <span title="191" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-191">p. 191</span>from laws that require loiterers to have a “harmful purpose,” from laws that target only gang members, and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced. In addition, the ordinance here is unlike a law that “directly prohibits” [the kind of behavior described in the city’s brief—the] “presence of a large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang members and hangers-on on the public ways.” . . .

<p id="7689174f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The] ordinance could have been construed more narrowly. The term “loiter” might possibly be construed . . . to mean “to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal activities.” Such a definition would be consistent with the Chicago City Council’s findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court. [S]o would limitations that restricted the ordinance’s criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members. . . .

Rather, it penalizes a loiterer’s failure to obey a police officer’s order to move along. . . . Far from according officers too much discretion, the ordinance merely enables police officers to fulfill one of their traditional functions. Police officers are not, and have never been, simply enforcers of the criminal law. They wear other hats—importantly, they have long been vested with the responsibility for preserving the public peace. . . . In their role as peace officers, the police long have had the authority and the duty to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse. . . .

By directing a police officer not to issue a dispersal order unless he “observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place,” Chicago’s ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between those two extremes. Just as we trust officers to rely on their experience and expertise in order to make spur-of-the-moment determinations about amorphous legal standards such as “probable cause” and “reasonable suspicion,” so we must trust them to determine whether a group of loiterers contains individuals (in this case members of criminal street gangs) whom the city has determined threaten the public peace. . . . In sum, the Court’s conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague because it “‘necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat,’” cannot be reconciled with common sense [and] longstanding police practice. . . .

<p id="76893e68-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens of Chicago.

Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 584 (1974) (White, J., concurring in judgment).

Rather, the people who will suffer from our lofty pronouncements are . . . people who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs and violence and drugs. They are good, decent people who must struggle to overcome their desperate situation, against all odds, in order to raise their families, earn a living, and remain good citizens. As one resident described, “There is only about maybe one or two percent of the people in the city causing these <span title="193" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-193">p. 193</span>problems maybe, but it’s keeping 98 percent of us in our houses and off the streets and afraid to shop.” By focusing exclusively on the imagined “rights” of the two percent, the Court today has denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that Justice Stevens, elevates above all else—the “freedom of movement.” And that is a shame.

<i>1. Vagrancy laws.</i> Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), has long been regarded as the leading case on the constitutionality <span title="194" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-194">p. 194</span>of vagrancy-type laws.

[S]leepless people often walk at night, perhaps hopeful that sleep-inducing relaxation will result. [A] former Governor . . . commented once that “loafing” was a national virtue . . . and that it should be encouraged. It is, however, a crime in Jacksonville. “Persons able to work but habitually living upon the earnings of their wives or minor children” [might implicate] unemployed people out of the labor market, by reason of a recession. . . . Persons “neglecting all lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequenting . . . places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served” would literally embrace many members of golf clubs. . . .

Loafers or loiterers may be “casing” a place for a holdup. . . . The difficulty is that these activities are historically part of the amenities of life as we have known them. They are not mentioned in the Constitution or in the Bill of Rights. These unwritten amenities have been in part responsible for giving our people the feeling of independence and self-confidence, the feeling of creativity. These amenities have dignified the right of dissent and have . . . encouraged lives of high spirits rather than hushed, suffocating silence. . . .

<p id="7689658a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another aspect of the ordinance’s vagueness appears when we focus, not on the lack of notice given a potential offender, but on the effect of the unfettered discretion it places in the hands of the Jacksonville police. [P]oor people, nonconformists, dissenters, idlers may be required to comport themselves according to the lifestyle deemed appropriate by the Jacksonville police and <span title="195" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-195">p. 195</span>the courts. Where, as here, there are no standards governing the exercise of the discretion granted by the ordinance, the scheme permits and encourages an arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law. . . . It results in a regime in which the poor and the unpopular are permitted to “stand on a public sidewalk . . . only at the whim of any police officer.” Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 90. . . .

<p id="7689658b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The implicit presumption in these generalized vagrancy standards—that crime is being nipped in the bud—is too extravagant to deserve extended treatment. Of course, vagrancy statutes are useful to the police. Of course, they are nets making easy the roundup of so-called undesirables. But the rule of law . . . , evenly applied to minorities as well as majorities, to the poor as well as the rich, is the great mucilage that holds society together.</p>
<p id="7689658c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Jacksonville ordinance cannot be squared with our constitutional standards and is plainly unconstitutional.</p>

Under the <i>Papachristou</i> opinion, are laws aimed at nipping crime in the bud always unconstitutional if their terms permit discriminatory enforcement or an unequal impact on the poor and minorities? <i>Should</i> such laws be unconstitutional? The justices in the <i>Morales</i> majority may have been reluctant to reaffirm the broadest implications of <i>Papachristou</i>, but the dissenters may have been reluctant to question them.

<i>2. The Chicago response to</i> Morales<i>.</i> In February 2000, the Chicago City Council passed a new anti-gang ordinance to replace the one struck down in <i>Morales.</i> The new ordinance (Chi. Municipal Code §8-4-015) again directs police officers to disperse all persons engaged in “gang loitering” in a public place, whenever they believe that one or more of those present are members of a criminal street gang. This time, the ordinance specifies that dispersal, in compliance with the order, means “remov[ing] themselves from within sight and hearing of the place at which the order was issued.” It requires the police superintendent to designate particular areas within the city in which the ordinance will be enforced, and dispersal orders can be issued only when gang loitering occurs within such areas, but the location of the designated areas is not revealed to the public. The ordinance defines gang loitering as</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Does the new ordinance meet the objections of Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O’Connor? Suppose that on a hot night, three teenagers hang out on a street corner, talking loudly and listening to music blaring from a nearby car radio. An elderly neighbor calls the police and asks them to disperse the group, saying that they are treating the corner as their private turf and that she feels intimidated from walking by in order to get to the corner store. If police reasonably believe that one of the youth is a gang member, are the teenagers subject to being dispersed under the ordinance? If the ordinance applies in this situation, should it be upheld under <i>Morales</i>?</p>

<i>3. Other anti-gang and anti-loitering legislation.</i> The Model Penal Code prohibits “loiter[ing] in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.” See MPC §250.6, Appendix. Consider whether this provision addresses the kind of gang activity that troubled the Chicago City Council. Would it give police the authority to arrest gang members who stake out their “turf” by congregating in parks and on street corners?</p>
<p id="76896593-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the MPC provision constitutional after <i>Morales</i>? An ordinance in Athens, Georgia, was written in terms similar to those of the MPC. It prohibited loitering, defined as being “in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals . . . under circumstances which cause a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern that such person is involved in unlawful drug activity.” Relying on <i>Morales</i>, the Georgia Supreme Court held this ordinance unconstitutionally vague. The court explained that “[t]here are no overt acts necessary to trigger criminal liability under the statute, and no specific guidelines to inform law enforcement officers of what behavior might legitimately bring the officer to believe a person was ‘involved in unlawful drug activity.’” Johnson v. Athens-Clarke County, 529 S.E.2d 613, 617 (Ga. 2000).</p>
<p id="76896594-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ordinances reviewed in the wake of <i>Morales</i> have been upheld where they target loitering with a criminal intent or where they are limited to loitering in a specific, narrow location (such as loitering on a bridge). Thus, in State v. Showens, 845 N.W.2d 436 (Iowa 2014), the court upheld a statute that prohibited registered sex offenders from loitering within 300 feet of a library.</p>
<p id="76896595-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even when framed in this way, anti-loitering ordinances continue to raise concern about the potential for abusive enforcement. Consider Silvar v. District Court, 129 P.3d 682 (Nev. 2006), involving a county ordinance that prohibited loitering in a manner “manifesting the purpose of . . . soliciting for . . . prostitution.” In an attempt to provide added clarity, the ordinance identified circumstances that could be considered in determining whether the unlawful purpose had been manifested, for example, “repeatedly beckon[ing] to . . . or engag[ing] persons passing by in conversation, or repeatedly . . .  attempt[ing] to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any other bodily gesture.” Should this law pass muster under <i>Morales</i>? The Nevada Supreme Court held the ordinance unconstitutionally vague. The court viewed the ordinance as giving police officers unlimited discretion to <span title="197" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-197">p. 197</span>arrest, because it did not require proof of an intent to commit prostitution and because it therefore could apply to persons strolling aimlessly or hailing a cab and to “effusive tourists celebrating a public holiday.” Courts have likewise struck down ordinances that prohibit loitering “under circumstances manifesting the purpose [to sell drugs]” when “[r]epeatedly beckoning” can establish a manifested purpose, without proof of the defendant’s actual intent. State v. Mello, 684 S.E.2d 477, 479 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009). For a review of <i>Morales</i>-based challenges, see Kim Strosnider, Anti-Gang Ordinances After <i>City of Chicago v.

<i>4. The notice prong of vagueness.</i> As the plurality opinion in <i>Morales</i> notes, there are two independent grounds on which a statute can be unconstitutionally vague.

<i>5. Problem.</i> Until recently, Montana had no specific speed limit on rural roads.

<i>6. The arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement prong and proactive policing.</i> The second independent ground on which a statute can be void for vagueness is when it encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. A majority of the Court thought Chicago’s gang ordinance ran afoul of this prong.</p>
<p id="76898cb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the police cannot tackle high rates of crime in a neighborhood with an anti-gang ordinance strategy, they may turn to other approaches. One popular policing strategy, commonly referred to as “broken windows” policing, rests on the idea that graffiti, unrepaired damage in decaying neighborhoods (“broken windows”), and “quality of life” offenses like spitting, littering, and public drinking are not trivial matters. According to this view, effective control of major crime, not to mention maintenance of decent urban environments, requires police to enforce quality-of-life laws vigorously, even though such enforcement inevitably will involve considerable discretion. See, e.g., Debra Livingston, Police Discretion and the Quality of Life in Public Spaces, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 551 (1997).</p>
<p id="7689b3c2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One aspect of this argument—the claimed connection between order maintenance and reduction of the most serious crimes—has been questioned. During the 1990s, crime fell dramatically in cities that practiced vigorous quality-of-life policing, but crime also fell dramatically in cities that introduced police initiatives of other sorts and in cities that simply followed traditional policing practices. See Bernard E. Harcourt, Reflecting on the Subject: A Critique of the Social Influence Conception of Deterrence, the Broken Windows Theory, and Order-Maintenance Policing New York Style, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 291 (1998). After examining the data in detail, Professor Harcourt concludes that quality-of-life enforcement and fixing “broken windows” have no significant effect on the level of serious crime.</p>
<p id="7689b3c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A related proactive policing strategy known as hot-spot policing involves putting more officers in high-crime areas. This strategy may reduce crime in those areas, according to some studies. Anthony Braga et al., The Effects of Hot Spots Policing on Crime: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, 31 Just. Q. 633 (2014). But this strategy raises other questions. It often involves the intense use of stop-and-frisk or stop-question-and-frisk, which involves stopping large numbers of people in these high-crime neighborhoods. Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), a police officer is permitted to stop someone if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person is engaged in criminal activity. The New York City Police Department heavily relied on this practice, making 4.4 million stops between January 2004 and June 2012. In 88 percent of the stops, no further law enforcement action was taken, thus indicating no criminal activity was afoot. The police conducted frisks for weapons in 52 percent of the stops, and in 98.5 percent of the frisks, no weapon was found. More than 80 percent of the people stopped were black or Hispanic. On the basis of these statistics, a district court found that the New York stop-and-frisk program was unconstitutional and constituted indirect racial profiling. Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).</p>

This benefits the communities where the need for policing is greatest. But the police are not permitted to target people for stops based on their race. Some may worry about the implications of this decision. They may wonder: if the police believe that a particular group of people is disproportionately responsible for crime in one area, why should the police <i>not</i> target that group with increased stops? . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause prohibits the practices described in <i>this</i> case. A police department may not target a racially defined group for stops <i>in general</i>—that is, for stops based on suspicions of general criminal wrongdoing—simply because members of that group appear frequently in the police department’s suspect data. The Equal Protection Clause does not permit the police to target a racially defined group as a whole because of the misdeeds of some of its members.</p>

As the plurality and the two concurring justices noted there, a law must not “authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Doesn’t police authority to stop on the basis of “reasonable suspicion” do precisely that? For that matter, doesn’t police authority to make an arrest for littering do so as well? What rules tell the police which litter-bugs to arrest and which to ignore? Critics of broken windows and stop-and-frisk policing programs, like critics of the gang-loitering ordinance in <i>Morales</i>, point out that these strategies give too much discretion to police officers. See Jeffrey Bellin, The Inverse Relationship Between the Constitutionality and Effectiveness of New York City “Stop and Frisk,” 94 B.U. L.

<i>7. Race.</i> Concerns with police discretion are inexorably tied to concerns about racial discrimination, as <i>Morales</i> and the <i>Floyd</i> litigation make clear. But supporters of proactive policing often suggest that racial justice concerns motivate these policing techniques because racial minorities bear the brunt of inner-city crime and disorder. Moreover, those in favor of order maintenance policing further argue that the political empowerment of urban black <span title="201" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-201">p. 201</span>residents and their entry into the ranks of the urban police make racial harassment far less likely.

In the wake of a string of police shootings of unarmed people caught on video, such as the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, there is a renewed focus on this issue. On December 18, 2014, President Obama appointed a task force to identify best policing practices and offer recommendations for police departments to help build community trust and promote effective crime reduction. In establishing the task force, the President spoke of “the distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities—the sense that in a country where our basic principle is equality under the law, too many individuals, particularly young people of color, do not feel as if they are being treated fairly.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109CF_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109CF_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> The distrust exists not only in communities in which the police departments lack diversity (such as Ferguson, in which two-thirds of the community is black, but the police force is 94 percent white), but also in departments with a more diverse force (such as Baltimore, in which 63 percent of the residents are black, and 44 percent of the police force is black).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109DB_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109DB_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span>

<p id="7689dae4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement that punishment be proportional to the seriousness of the offense is a core principle of punishment, both as a central limit dictated by the Eighth Amendment, and as a statutory statement of purpose in modern criminal codes. The MPC (§1.02) includes among its purposes the aim “to differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses,” and “to safeguard offenders against excessive, disproportionate or arbitrary punishment.” The New York Penal Law similarly aims “[t]o differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses and to prescribe proportionate penalties therefor.” N.Y. Penal Law §1.05 (2016). The California Penal Code declares that “punishment” is the purpose of imprisonment for crimes, which purpose is “best served by terms proportionate to the seriousness of the offense.” Cal.

Having completed that step (by a discussion which, in all fairness, does not convincingly establish that 25-years-to-life is a “proportionate” punishment for stealing three golf clubs), the plurality must then add an analysis to show that “Ewing’s sentence is justified by the State’s public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons.” [W]hy that has anything to do with the principle of proportionality is a mystery.

<i>1. Determining whether a punishment is proportionate.</i> The justifications for punishment explored in Chapter 2 also inform the question of whether a given punishment is proportionate. Should the prospect of large benefits in deterrence or incapacitation (that is, utilitarian concerns) suffice to render a punishment “proportionate,” or should proportionality be viewed as requiring punishment that is commensurate with culpability and the gravity of the crime for which an offender is being sentenced (that is, retributive justice)? What is the plurality’s view in <i>Ewing</i>? On what grounds do Justices Scalia and Breyer disagree with the plurality?</p>
<p id="768a9e82-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A second fundamental question is an institutional one, which asks whether the proportionality judgment is best made by the people, through the laws enacted by legislatures, or whether the courts must play a more robust role. Professor Youngjae Lee frames the debate between “elite” or “popular” understanding as follows (Desert and the Eighth Amendment, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 101, 103-104 (2008)):</p>

According to this view, the purpose of the Eighth Amendment is to enforce the retributivist constraint, the content of which does not change with the whims of the democratic majority. This understanding of retribution coheres well with a common image of constitutional rights in general and of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause in particular, as the Clause is typically understood as playing the role of holding the excessive, and frequently irrational, punitive instincts of “the people” in check by imposing a moral constraint.</p>

<p id="768ac598-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Erik Luna similarly describes the three-strikes law in California as a “prime example of a moral panic.” Erik Luna, Criminal Justice and the Public Imagination, 7 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 71, 84 (2009). Can courts effectively identify when a law is the product of “passion” or “panic” that does not deserve deference as an assessment of proportionality? Should courts be guided by Bentham’s point that the public and the legislature are “naturally inclined” to “undue severity” and therefore “we should take the most precautions” to guard against excessive punishments because “there has been shown the greatest disposition to err”? Does the result in <i>Ewing</i> reject this view? Is excessive reliance on incarceration inevitable if courts do not take precautions to guard against “panic”?</p>
<p id="768ac599-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As <i>Ewing</i> illustrates, Justices Scalia and Thomas hold that the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality requirement. John Stinneford takes issue with that claim on originalist grounds, arguing that proportionality was part of the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment. John F. Stinneford, Rethinking Proportionality Under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, 97 Va. L. Rev. 899 (2011). Ian Farrell also disputes the argument against a proportionality requirement, disagreeing in particular with the claim that proportionality review is impossible once the Court accepts deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation as legitimate goals of punishment. Ian P. Farrell, Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and Scalia: Philosophy, Proportionality, and the Eighth Amendment, 55 Vill. L. Rev. 321 (2010).

<i>2. Proportionality and recidivism.</i> Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63 (2003), decided together with <i>Ewing</i>, was another California three-strikes case. Andrade had stolen from a Kmart on two occasions, taking videotapes worth $84.70 the first time and $68.84 the second. Because both amounts were under $200, the offenses were classified as petty thefts, normally a misdemeanor. But because Andrade had previous convictions (two misdemeanor thefts, two counts of transporting marijuana, and three counts of residential burglary), the three-strikes statute applied. As a result, for <i>each</i> of the petty thefts, he was sentenced to a term of 25 years to life, the terms to run consecutively. Justice O’Connor, writing for five members of the Court, refused to overturn the sentence.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CBF_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CBF_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> Justice Souter, for the four dissenters, said that “[i]f <span title="213" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-213">p. 213</span>Andrade’s sentence is not grossly disproportionate, the principle has no meaning.” 538 U.S. at 83.</p>
<p id="768ac59c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the sentences in <i>Ewing</i> and <i>Andrade</i> seem severe in relation to the crimes charged in those cases, both decisions involve the distinct problem of how proportionality should be affected by the <i>prior</i> criminal conduct of the offenders. Utilitarians consider longer punishments necessary because the offender was not deterred by the initial sanction. But does the enhanced punishment violate the principles of retributivism? For an argument that longer sentences are not disproportionate to culpability because an offender has a greater duty to avoid committing a new crime after being convicted the first time, see Youngjae Lee, Recidivism as Omission: A Relational Account, 87 Tex. L. Rev. 571, 610 (2009). Do you agree? Does this reasoning suffice to justify the life sentences imposed on Andrade for his two petty thefts?</p>

Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before them. . . .

<i>1. Individual versus categorical challenges.</i> The <i>Graham</i> Court’s test for whether an <i>individual</i> non-capital sentence is disproportionate comes from Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in <i>Harmelin</i>. The Court must find as a threshold matter that the sentence is grossly disproportionate, and a sentence will pass that threshold inquiry so long as the state has a “reasonable basis for believing” <span title="217" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-217">p. 217</span>that it will serve either deterrent, retributive, rehabilitative, or incapacitative goals. <i>Ewing</i>, 538 U.S. at 28. Until <i>Graham</i>, the Court had not struck down a single non-capital sentence as disproportionate under that inquiry. In capital cases, in contrast, the Court has held several death sentences disproportionate, partly because the test in capital cases lacks the threshold requirement of gross disproportionality. Instead, the Court turns immediately to the questions of how other jurisdictions treat the crime at issue and how the same jurisdiction treats other crimes. The Court also uses its independent judgment as to whether the gravity of the crime and the culpability of the offender merit the sentence. See pp. 587-589 infra.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC8_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10DC8_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span>

<p id="768b3aec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Graham</i>, the Supreme Court continued to reject the capital disproportionality test as a basis for challenging <i>individual</i> non-capital sentences, but for the first time it applied that test to determine the proportionality of <i>an entire category</i> of non-capital sentences. What other categories of offenders and types of punishments can be challenged successfully under this new test? Because the Court took the categorical test from its death penalty jurisprudence, capital cases may provide some guidance. For example, the Court has rejected mandatory death sentences and held discretionary death penalties for murder impermissible in the case of certain types of offenders, such as juveniles, those with intellectual disabilities, and accomplices who were not aware of the risk that their co-felons would kill. Should the Court be willing to strike down LWOP sentences in these situations as well?</p>
<p id="768b3aed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In that vein, in Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), the Court held that mandatory LWOP sentences for juveniles are unconstitutional, even for those who commit homicide. Justice Kagan, writing for a majority, combined “two strands of precedent” to inform the Court’s proportionality review (132 S. Ct. at 2463-2464):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768b3aee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The first had adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. So, for example, we have held that imposing the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or imposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the Eighth Amendment. Several of the cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability. Thus, <i>Roper</i> held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and <i>Graham</i> concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense. <i>Graham</i> further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking a second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death. Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion <span title="218" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-218">p. 218</span>that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>
</div>
<p id="768b3aef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court in <i>Miller</i> relied on both the special situation of juveniles <i>and</i> the mandatory nature of the challenged laws. In so doing, the Court explicitly declined to adopt an alternative argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a <i>categorical ban</i> on LWOP for juveniles. Id. at 2469. Does <i>Miller</i> lend support for the idea that all mandatory minimum sentences, and not just LWOP, are categorically unconstitutional as applied to juveniles? See State v. Lyle, 854 N.W.2d 378 (Iowa 2014); Lindsey E. Krause, One Size Does Not Fit All: The Need for a Complete Abolition of Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Juveniles in Response to <i>Roper</i>, <i>Graham</i>, and <i>Miller</i>, 33 Law &amp; Ineq. 481 (2015).</p>
<p id="768b3af0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The European Court of Human Rights has gone further, ruling that LWOP sentences violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Court concluded that jurisdictions must provide for review of a life sentence no later than 25 years after it was imposed, with periodic reviews thereafter, to determine whether there have been significant changes and rehabilitative progress such that detention is no longer justified on legitimate penological grounds. Vinter and Others v. United Kingdom, 2013-III Eur. Ct. H.R. 317 §§119-122 (2013). Should the United States Supreme Court have reached a similar categorical conclusion about LWOP sentences, either in general or for juveniles specifically?</p>
<p id="768b3af1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Is LWOP different from other non-capital sentences?</i> Is LWOP unique, or should the Court be equally willing to scrutinize terms of years? For discussion of how the extinguishment of hope makes LWOP qualitatively different from other punishments, see Alice Ristroph, Hope, Imprisonment, and the Constitution, 23 Fed. Sent’g Rep. 75 (2010). If the Court treats LWOP as unique, can a state avoid <i>Graham</i>-type scrutiny by imposing term-of-years sentences that exceed a natural life span (say, a sentence of 100 years)? Can a state avoid scrutiny by <i>authorizing</i> parole but rarely granting it? What if there is less than a 1 percent chance that parole will be granted? Does <i>Graham</i> give guidance for drawing these lines?</p>

<i>3. Proportionality in other contexts.</i> The Supreme Court has enforced a proportionality requirement for fines (where the Eighth Amendment expressly prohibits “excessive[ness]”) and forfeitures, United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998), as well as punitive damages. Scrutiny of punitive damage awards has been strict. For example, in punitive-damage challenges, the Court examines proportionality issues de novo, rather than under a deferential standard of review. Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001). The Court has held that states may not impose punitive damage awards to punish a defendant for harms to non-parties. Phillip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346, 349 (2007). And it closely scrutinizes awards, striking them down when “<i>a more modest <span title="219" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-219">p. 219</span>punishment</i> for [the] reprehensible conduct <i>could have satisfied</i> the State’s legitimate objectives.” State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 419-420 (2003) (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="768b6203-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contrasting the Court’s approaches to punitive damages and prison sentences, Professor Richard Frase observes (Excessive Prison Sentences, Punishment Goals, and the Eighth Amendment: “Proportionality” Relative to What?, 89 Minn.

[And] in assessing punitive damages awards, the Court has added a limitation on the relevance of the defendant’s “prior record”: only violations of a similar nature may be considered. Thus, in at least three respects—de novo review, more frequent use of comparative analysis, and more lenient treatment of recidivists—the Court seems to be much more protective of civil defendants’ bank accounts than it has been of criminal defendants’ liberty.</p>

<p id="768b6205-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Is there a legitimate basis for more searching review of punitive damage awards than of prison terms? In <i>State Farm</i>, Justice Kennedy sought to justify the difference as follows (538 U.S. at 417-418):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768b6206-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[D]efendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding. This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered. “[P]unitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property. Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendant’s net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses,—particularly those without strong local presences.” . . . Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an “application of law, rather than a decisionmaker’s caprice.”</p>

Many commentators (e.g., Frase, supra) question whether the safeguards applicable at the criminal trial on the question of guilt suffice to protect against caprice in sentencing.

<i>4. Proportionality review in practice</i>. Even after <i>Graham</i>, challenges to individual sentences—as opposed to challenges to entire categories of sentences—must pass the high hurdle set by <i>Ewing</i>. As a result, successful Eighth Amendment challenges continue to be rare. But they are not unheard of. In State v. Bruce, 796 N.W.2d 397 (S.D. 2011), the court struck down a 100-year sentence for possessing child pornography. Similarly, in People v. Carmony, 127 Cal. App. 4th 1066 (2005), the court struck down a sentence of 25 years to life imposed upon a previously convicted sex offender for the “harmless technical violation” of failing to update his sex offender registration as required. State v. Davis, 79 P.3d 64 (Ariz. 2003), struck down a mandatory minimum sentence of 52 years without possibility of parole, imposed upon a 20-year-old <span title="220" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-220">p. 220</span>male for four counts of having had voluntary sex with an underage teenaged girl. But State v. Berger, 134 P.3d 378 (Ariz. 2006), upheld a sentence of 200 years of imprisonment without possibility of parole (consecutive 10-year sentences on each of 20 counts) imposed on a first-time offender for possession of 20 images of child pornography that he had downloaded from the Internet. A dissenting justice observed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768b6209-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arizona’s mandatory minimum 200-year sentence . . . exceeds that imposable in any other state. It is the unique combination of long mandatory minimum sentences, coupled with the requirements that each image be charged separately and that the terms be served consecutively and fully—that is, without possibility of early release—that renders Arizona’s sentences extraordinarily long. Indeed, the <i>minimum</i> ten-year sentence in Arizona for possession of one image [equals or exceeds] the <i>maximum</i> sentence for possession of child pornography in [45] states. . . . Moreover, the sentence at issue is longer than that imposed in Arizona for many crimes involving serious violence. [T]he minimum sentence for possession of an image of child pornography is longer than the <i>presumptive</i> [i.e., midrange] sentence for rape or aggravated assault. [The minimum] sentence for possession of five images (fifty years) amounts as a practical matter to a life sentence without parole, more serious than the sentence imposed for virtually any crime in the state.</p>

<i>5. State constitutions.</i> Many state constitutions contain provisions similar to the Eighth Amendment, but state courts sometimes read them as imposing more significant limits on the legislature. In People v. Bullock, 485 N.W.2d 866 (Mich. 1992), the Michigan Supreme Court overturned on state constitutional grounds the Michigan statute that the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld in <i>Harmelin</i>—a statute imposing a mandatory sentence of life without parole for possession of 650 grams of cocaine. The Michigan court emphasized the textual difference between the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment” and the Michigan Constitution’s prohibition of “cruel <i>or</i> unusual punishment” (italics added). The court held that under the Michigan Constitution, courts must apply a three-prong test, identical to that advanced in <i>Solem</i>, to determine whether a punishment is “cruel or unusual.”</p>
<p id="768b620b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of state constitutions require that “[a]ll penalties shall be proportioned to the nature of the offense.” Ind. Const. art. 1, §16; see also Me. Const. art. 1, §9; Neb. Const. art. 1, §15; N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 18; Or. Const. art. I, §16. As Richard Frase notes, even when state constitutions are worded identically to the Eighth Amendment, “many state courts have recognized their power to interpret state constitutional law more favorably to offenders.” Richard S. Frase, Limiting Excessive Prison Sentences Under Federal and State Constitutions, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 39, 40 (2008). The Georgia Supreme Court, for example, applied <i>Harmelin</i> and condemned as cruel and unusual a 10-year prison sentence for a 17-year-old defendant who had consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old. Humphrey v. Wilson, 652 S.E.2d 501 (Ga. 2007). For a description of state proportionality review, see Thomas A. Balmer, Some <span title="221" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-221">p. 221</span>Thoughts on Proportionality, 87 Or. L. Rev. 783 (2008). Some commentators suggest that experience with state proportionality review establishes that more robust proportionality review is readily administrable. See Julia Fong Sheketoff, Note, State Innovations in Noncapital Proportionality Doctrine, 85 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 2209 (2010).</p>

<i>6. Proportionality and culpability.</i> The preceding material focuses on offenders who were unquestionably guilty of committing serious offenses. In all such cases, <i>some</i> punishment is unquestionably deserved; concern arises only because <i>a portion</i> of the punishment imposed arguably exceeds the offender’s just deserts. That concern can arise in an even more fundamental way when circumstances suggest that the alleged offender may not be morally blameworthy at all. The next section deals in depth with this foundational issue—the constituent elements of <i>culpability</i> and the question of whether or to what extent culpability should always be a prerequisite for just punishment.</p>

<i>1. The rationale of</i> Martin. The reversal of Martin’s conviction seems intuitively fair. But what principle explains that result? Is it simply the need to respect the statutory definition of the offense? The court says that “[u]nder the plain terms of the statute, a voluntary appearance is presupposed.”</p>
<p id="768bb03f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is this explanation convincing? The court’s account raises two problems.

Second, if a conviction under the circumstances of <i>Martin</i> is troubling, it would presumably remain troubling even if the statutory wording had not specifically required that the accused “appear.” For example, suppose that the Alabama statute had been re-worded to provide: “Any person who, while drunk, is found in a public place is guilty of an offense.” If Martin’s conviction is troublesome, shouldn’t it be equally troublesome under this statute as well?</p>

<i>2. The actus reus requirement.</i> Notice that in a prosecution under the re-worded statute just mentioned, a person forced to swallow alcohol and then carried into public by the police (call him Peter Passive) would seem to meet the statutory requirements for conviction, even though he had not engaged in any conduct at all. But a conviction under those circumstances would violate the fundamental principle that criminal liability always requires an “actus reus,” that is, the commission of some voluntary act that is prohibited by law. For one statutory statement of this principle, see Model Penal Code §2.01(1), Appendix. Presumably, the Alabama court’s understanding of this background principle played a large role in its approach to interpreting the statute.</p>

<i>3. Testing the result in</i> Martin. Notice that Martin, unlike Peter Passive, cannot claim that he engaged in no voluntary conduct at all. Martin presumably drank, and once in public he used loud and profane language. Is the <i>Martin</i> court in effect requiring that <i>all</i> the proscribed acts be committed voluntarily? Consider whether a requirement of that sort is really desirable. If Martin <i>voluntarily</i> used loud and profane language in public, would it be fair to punish him, regardless of how he came to be in public? How would that situation be handled under MPC §2.01(1)?</p>

<i>(a)</i> In People v. Low, 232 P.3d 635 (Cal. 2010), the defendant was arrested for driving a stolen vehicle and taken to jail, where a search found drugs hidden in one of his socks. He was convicted not only of the stolen vehicle offense but also of “knowingly bring[ing] [a] controlled substance” into a county jail. He conceded knowing possession but invoked <i>Martin</i> to argue that since he had been taken to jail against his will, he had not <i>voluntarily</i> <span title="223" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-223">p. 223</span>committed the required act of “bring[ing]” the drug into the jail. The California Supreme Court distinguished <i>Martin</i> and upheld the conviction on the ground that defendant had “a clear opportunity to avoid [the prohibited act] by voluntarily relinquishing the forbidden object . . . before entering the premises.” Id. at 644. State v. Barnes, 747 S.E.2d 912 (N.C. Ct. App. 2013), reached a similar conclusion. Barnes was arrested for drunk driving and placed in jail, where a bag containing marijuana fell out of his pants. The North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld his conviction for possession of a controlled substance in a penal institution even though he was not voluntarily present in the facility and had been put there because of his arrest for a different crime. The court concluded the “necessary voluntary act occurs when the defendant knowingly possesses the controlled substance.” Id. at 920. In contrast, the Supreme Court of Washington reached a different conclusion on largely identical facts. A Washington defendant was convicted of “possess[ing] a controlled substance . . . while in a county jail.” The state supreme court found <i>Martin</i> controlling and reversed the drugs-in-jail conviction. State v. Eaton, 229 P.3d 704 (Wash. 2010). Responding to the state’s argument that “the plain language of the statute does not contain a volitional element,” the court noted that the defendant had no available choice other than to surrender evidence that would convict him of another crime, and therefore failing to read a voluntariness requirement into the statute would produce “absurd” results incompatible with the principles of criminal responsibility. Id. at 706-708.

<i>(b)</i> A Los Angeles ordinance makes it an offense for any person to “sit, lie or sleep in or upon any street, sidewalk or other public way.” L.A. Municipal Code §41.18(d). Thousands of homeless people living in the Los Angeles “skid row” brought suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance against them during nighttime hours. They proved that the city had an insufficient number of beds available to accommodate them and argued that convicting them under these circumstances would simply punish them for the “universal and unavoidable consequences of being human.” The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed, holding that “the state may not criminalize ‘being’; that is, the state may not punish a person for who he is, independent of anything he has done.” Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118, 1133 (9th Cir. 2006). A dissenting judge argued that the ordinance “does not punish people simply because they are homeless.

After the Canadian officers “forcibly returned” him to U.S. customs officials in handcuffs, the defendant was charged and convicted of being “voluntarily present and found in the United States.” Id. at 98. The Second Circuit reversed the conviction because when the defendant was “found in” the United States, he had “been returned involuntarily.” Id. at 102. On similar facts, the Ninth Circuit upheld a defendant’s conviction on the grounds that because the defendant “was never legally in Canada,” he had never left the United States. United States v.

<i>5. When is an act considered voluntary?</i> The MPC defines an “act” as a “bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary.” §1.13(2).

<i>1. The rationale of the voluntary act requirement.</i> The reason for excluding criminal liability in the absence of voluntary action is explained as follows (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.01 at 214-215 (1985)):</p>

<p id="768bfd7d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That penal sanctions cannot be employed with justice unless these requirements are satisfied seems wholly clear. It is fundamental that a civilized society does not punish for thoughts alone. Beyond this, the law cannot hope to deter involuntary movement or to stimulate action that cannot physically be performed; the sense of personal security would be undermined in a society where such movement or inactivity could lead to formal social condemnation of the sort that a conviction necessarily entails. People whose involuntary movements threaten harm to others may present a public health or safety problem, calling for therapy or even for custodial commitment; they do not present a problem of correction.</p>

<i>2. Distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary acts.</i> The MPC defines voluntariness indirectly, by simply listing examples of involuntary acts. The examples are consistent with the general approach at common law, but they differ from everyday usage; they do not include many types of conduct that are often described as “involuntary” in ordinary speech—such as an act that is the product of an “irresistible impulse.” See MPC §2.01(2). To add further confusion, the term “involuntary” does not have a consistent meaning even within the criminal law: Many types of conduct that are considered “involuntary” for purposes of some criminal law rules are not considered “involuntary” for purposes of others. One example is the case of a motorist who drives too fast, goes through a stop sign, and unintentionally kills a pedestrian. In everyday speech and in the criminal law itself, this offense is usually described as “involuntary manslaughter.” (We explore the offense in detail in Chapter 5, pp. 490-509 infra.) Yet the motorist’s actions are <i>not</i> considered “involuntary” for purposes of either the common-law actus reus requirement or MPC §2.01(2).</p>
<p id="768bfd7f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Why should the definition of an involuntary act, for purposes of the actus reus requirement, be narrower than the ordinary person’s understanding of what counts as an involuntary act? Consider Bratty v. Attorney-General [1963] A.C. 386, 409-410 (H.L. 1961):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768bfd80-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No act is punishable if it is done involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context—some people nowadays prefer to speak of it as “automatism”—means <span title="227" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-227">p. 227</span>an act which is done by the muscles without any control by the mind such as a spasm, a reflex action or a convulsion; or an act done by a person who is not conscious of what he is doing such as an act done whilst suffering from concussion or whilst sleep-walking. . . . The term “involuntary act” is, however, capable of wider connotations: and to prevent confusion it is to be observed that in the criminal law an act is not to be regarded as an involuntary act simply because the doer does not remember it. . . . Nor is an act to be regarded as an involuntary act simply because the doer could not control his impulse to do it. When a man is charged with murder, and it appears that he knew what he was doing, but he could not resist it, then his assertion “I couldn’t help myself” is no defence in itself. . . . Nor is an act to be regarded as an involuntary act simply because it is unintentional or its consequences are unforeseen. When a man is charged with dangerous driving, it is no defence for him to say, however truly, “I did not mean to drive dangerously.”</p>

<i>3. Distinguishing between voluntary acts and blameworthy acts.</i> Involuntary acts are <i>never</i> blameworthy. But the opposite is not true. We cannot say that <i>voluntary</i> acts are <i>always</i> blameworthy, because the law and ordinary morality ordinarily impose blame only when a number of additional requirements are met in addition to voluntariness. Thus a voluntary act is necessary, but not sufficient for criminal liability. For example, a person may act voluntarily by driving carefully to work, but may have an accident and injure someone unintentionally. Accident and mistake relate to the <i>effects that one has in mind</i> as possible results of one’s voluntary actions; the normal assumption that blame entails some awareness that one’s actions can cause harm is called the mens rea requirement, and we examine it in detail in Section D.2, pp. 258-350 infra. Another example involves persons who choose to act in a certain way because an overwhelming external threat of force or a mental disorder leads them to believe they have no choice; these defenses, such as duress and insanity, are called <i>excuses</i>, and we examine them in detail in Chapter 8.C, pp. 982-1095 infra.</p>
<p id="768c2492-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although we are only beginning our consideration of the different categories of defenses, it is worth pausing to consider why the law might distinguish between the various reasons why a person who causes harm can avoid blame. Professor J.G. Murphy (Involuntary Acts and Criminal Liability, 51 Ethics 332 (1971)) points out that there are two situations in which human actions “misfire.” One is where actions are done accidentally or under duress. The other is where the action misfires in a more basic way—such as in cases of convulsions, reflex movements, or somnambulism. In the first group of cases, we speak of mitigating the actor’s responsibility or of excusing the act. In the second group of cases, however, we do not think of excuse but rather believe that no human action occurred at all—“talk of excuse here seems to make no more sense than would talk of excusing a rock for falling on one’s head.” For in-depth discussion of these issues, see Michael S. Moore, Act and Crime (1993); Douglas Husak, Rethinking the Act Requirement, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 2437 (2007).</p>

<span title="228" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-228">p. 228</span>But the differences are more than semantic or theoretical. Even though most defenses, whatever their label, result in an acquittal, there are important legal differences that depend on whether we put them into the category of actus reus, mens rea, or excuse. One concerns the burden of proof. Since a voluntary act is a necessary element of every crime, the prosecution bears the burden of proving that act—and typically its voluntary character—beyond a reasonable doubt.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11057_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11057_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">9</a></span> But, as we have seen in Chapter 1, pp. 43-53 supra, the legislature has some flexibility to convert mens rea requirements from “elements” of an offense to affirmative defenses on which the prosecution need not bear the burden of proof. And the burden of proving excuses such as insanity may be, and often is, placed upon the defendant. (See p. 1029 infra.) Another important practical consequence concerns the disposition of the defendant. When a defendant is acquitted on grounds of insanity, he is often subject to civil commitment or other protective or therapeutic protocols. (See pp. 1025-1027 infra.) In contrast, if a defendant like Newton is acquitted on the ground that his act was involuntary, he is immediately discharged without further supervision over his conduct.</p>

<i>Question:</i> When a defendant is acquitted for lack of a voluntary act, is it always wise to release him without further supervision? What if, for example, a defendant is prone to spasms and seizures? Consider the problems that follow.</p>
<p id="768c2496-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Problems. (a) Habit.</i> The MPC treats habitual action done without thought as voluntary action. Why should this be so? Suppose, for example, that a person firmly resolves to stop saying “You know” before every sentence, but then continues to do so, in spite of her best intentions. Why is her slip-up treated as a voluntary act? Suppose that a person is driving on an interstate when his cell phone rings, and without thinking, he reaches for the phone, possibly causing an accident and violating a traffic safety regulation against using cellphones while driving. Can his act of reaching for the phone be considered a “reflex” within the meaning of the MPC? Or will his act be considered “voluntary”? Why should a movement like this be treated as a voluntary act? See Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, Opaque Recklessness, 91 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 597, 646-647 (2001).</p>
<p id="768c2497-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Hypnosis.</i> The MPC takes the position that the acts of a hypnotized subject are not voluntary. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.01 at 221 (1985):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768c2498-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The widely held view that the hypnotized subject will not follow suggestions which are repugnant to him was deemed insufficient to warrant treating his conduct while hypnotized as voluntary; his dependency and helplessness are too pronounced.</p>

<i>Question</i>: If habitual actions that a person has great difficulty controlling are considered voluntary, why should actions under hypnosis, which the subject apparently <i>can</i> control, be considered <i>in</i>voluntary? The MPC view seems to be that habitual actions, even when unintentional, are nonetheless “a product of the effort or determination of the actor.” §2.01(2)(d). Isn’t that also true of actions under hypnosis? Scientific disagreement over the hypnotized subject’s ability to control his own conduct, together with the difficulty of distinguishing normal from hypnotized actions, apparently have led most jurisdictions not to adopt a statutory hypnosis defense like the one in the MPC. See Paul H. Robinson et al., 2 Criminal Law Defenses §191 (2010). Is it fair to preclude a defendant from raising this defense and seeking to persuade the jury of its validity?</p>

<i>(1) The</i> Cogdon <i>case.</i> Consider Norval Morris, Somnambulistic Homicide: Ghosts, Spiders, and North Koreans, 5 Res Judicatae 29, 29-30 (1951):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768c249c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Cogdon was charged with the murder of her only child, a daughter called Pat, aged nineteen. . . . Describing the relationship between Pat and her mother, Mr. Cogdon testified: “I don’t think a mother could have thought any more of her daughter. I think she absolutely adored her.” On the conscious level, at least, there was no reason to doubt Mrs. Cogdon’s deep attachment to her daughter.</p>
<p id="768c4bad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the charge of murdering Pat, Mrs. Cogdon pleaded not guilty. Her story, though somewhat bizarre, was not seriously challenged by the Crown, and led to her acquittal. She told how, on the night before her daughter’s death she had dreamt that their house was full of spiders and that these spiders were crawling all over Pat. In her sleep, Mrs. Cogdon left the bed she shared with her husband, went into Pat’s room and awakened to find herself violently brushing at Pat’s face, presumably to remove the spiders. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768c4bae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The morning after the spider dream she told her doctor of it. He gave her a sedative and, because of the dream and certain previous difficulties she had reported, discussed the possibility of psychiatric treatment. That evening [there] was some desultory conversation . . . about the war in Korea, and just before she put out her light Pat called out to her mother, “Mum, don’t be so silly worrying about the war, it’s not on our front door step yet.”</p>
<p id="768c4baf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Cogdon went to sleep. She dreamt that “the war was all around the house,” that the soldiers were in Pat’s room, and that one soldier was on the bed attacking Pat. This was all of the dream that she could later recapture. Her first “waking” memory was of running from Pat’s room, out of the house to the home of her sister who lived next door. When her sister opened the front door Mrs. Cogdon fell into her arms crying, “I think I’ve hurt Pattie.”</p>
<p id="768c4bb0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In fact Mrs. Cogdon had, in her somnambulistic state, left her bed, fetched an axe from the woodheap, entered Pat’s room, and struck her two accurate forceful blows on the head with the blade of the axe, thus killing her.</p>
<p id="768c4bb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Mrs. Cogdon’s story was supported by the evidence of her physician, a psychiatrist, and a psychologist. The burden of the evidence of all three, which was not contested by the prosecution, was that Mrs. Cogdon was <span title="230" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-230">p. 230</span>suffering from a form of hysteria with an overlay of depression and that she was of a personality in which such dissociated states as fugues, amnesias, and somnambulistic acts are to be expected. They agreed that she was not psychotic and that if she had been awake at the time of the killing no defence could have been spelt out under the <i>M’Naghten Rules</i> [defining the terms of the defense of legal insanity]. They hazarded no statement as to her motives, the idea of defence of the daughter being transparently insufficient. However, the psychologist and the psychiatrist concurred in hinting that the emotional motivation lay in an acute conflict situation in her relations with her own parents; that during marital life she suffered very great sexual frustration; and that she over-compensated for her own frustration by over-protection of her daughter. Her exaggerated solicitude for her daughter was a conscious expression of her subconscious emotional hostility to her, and the dream ghosts, spiders, and Korean soldiers were projections of that aggression. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768c4bb2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At all events the jury believed Mrs. Cogdon’s story. [S]he was acquitted because the act of killing itself was not, in law, regarded as her act at all.</p>
</div>
<p id="768c4bb3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(2) The traditional rule.</i> The common law and the MPC are in accord with the result in <i>Cogdon</i>; on her version of the events, her act would be considered involuntary. See MPC §2.01(2)(c). But does it make sense for a person like Mrs. Cogdon to be acquitted outright and released?</p>
<p id="768c4bb4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(3) Recent developments.</i> In a Canadian case similar to <i>Cogdon</i>, the accused drove several miles to the home of his in-laws and killed his mother-in-law with a fireplace iron. He won acquittal by producing convincing evidence that he had been in a state of sleep throughout the episode. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that his defense was properly treated as one of involuntary act, rather than insanity, because the law’s concern, for purposes of punishment, is with the <i>conscious</i> mind. R. v. Parks, 95 D.L.R.4th 27 (1992). In another Canadian case, a defendant was acquitted on charges of forcible rape, after a doctor specializing in sleep disorders testified that the defendant’s prior history of sleepwalking, together with studies of his brain waves during sleep and other circumstances corroborated his claim to have acted involuntarily during a state of “sexsomnia.” R. v. Luedecke, [2005] 35 C.R. 6th 205. Should such a defendant be subject to confinement on the ground that his sleep disorder makes him dangerous? What if medication can control the disorder but has serious side effects that give the defendant good reasons to stop taking it? See R. v. Luedecke, 2010 ONCJ 59 (Can.).</p>
<p id="768c4bb5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is now an extensive medical literature on “sleep-related violence,” and a growing effort to make use of medical testimony to buttress the defense. See William Wilson et al., Violence, Sleepwalking and the Criminal Law, 2005 Crim. L. Rev. 601, 614. What should happen in cases of this sort if a defendant’s evidence is strong enough to raise a reasonable doubt about whether his actions were voluntary, but not strong enough to permit the authorities to confine him in a mental hospital? (We consider related dispositional issues that arise under the <i>insanity defense</i> at pp. 1025-1028 infra.)</p>

<i>(d) Epilepsy.</i> A person’s movements during an epileptic seizure are indisputably involuntary. Can the prosecution nonetheless establish liability by pointing to earlier acts that <i>were</i> voluntary? Consider People v. Decina, 138 N.E.2d 799, 803-804 (1956):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768c4bb7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The indictment states essentially that defendant, <i>knowing</i> “that he was subject to epileptic attacks or other disorder rendering him likely to lose consciousness for a considerable period of time,” was culpably negligent “in that he consciously undertook to and <i>did operate</i> his Buick sedan on a public highway” (emphasis supplied) and “while so doing” suffered such an attack which caused said automobile “to travel at a fast and reckless rate of speed, jumping the curb and driving over the sidewalk” causing the death of 4 persons. In our opinion, this clearly states a violation of section 1053-a of the Penal Law. . . . [“A person who operates or drives any vehicle of any kind in a reckless or culpably negligent manner, whereby a human being is killed is guilty of criminal negligence in the operation of a vehicle resulting in death.”]</p>
<p id="768c4bb8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Assuming the truth of the indictment, as we must on a demurrer, this defendant knew he was subject to epileptic attacks and seizures that might strike at any time. He also knew that a moving motor vehicle uncontrolled on a public highway is a highly dangerous instrumentality capable of unrestrained destruction. With this <i>knowledge,</i> and without anyone accompanying him, he deliberately took a chance by making a conscious choice of a course of action, in disregard of the consequences which he knew might follow from his conscious act, and which in this case did ensue. How can we say as a matter of law that this did not amount to culpable negligence within the meaning of section 1053-a?</p>
<p id="768c4bb9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To hold otherwise would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution under the statute. His awareness of a condition which he knows may produce such consequences as here, and his disregard of the consequences, renders him liable for culpable negligence, as the courts below have properly held. To have a sudden sleeping spell, an unexpected heart or other disabling attack, without any prior knowledge or warning thereof, is an altogether different situation.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> If the prosecution can defeat the voluntary act requirement by expanding the time frame in this way, how far back in time should the prosecution be permitted to go? After all, every defendant has committed some voluntary act at some point in his life. Consider the following comments:</p>

It cannot be that the involuntary, harmful act at time two was unforeseeable. The probability of an epileptic black-out is almost certainly far lower than the probability of ending up in public after engaging in behavior likely to draw police attention. . . . Ultimately, the <i>Martin</i> finding of voluntariness “works” not because it is “right,” but because all the hard points disappear in the initial interpretive construction of the potentially relevant facts.</p></div>

There was no mental disposition to commit any act, much less a harmful one. But suppose that a person conceives of the idea to burn down a building and writes in his diary the list of supplies he would need and enters in his calendar a “to do” item that says “formulate a detailed plan to burn down the building.” Now assume he is arrested before he takes any action to formulate the details of the arson plan or to purchase any of the needed supplies. (Police may, for example, have discovered the diary after arresting the defendant on an unrelated charge.) Here there is a mental disposition to take harmful action; the defendant appears to be both culpable and dangerous. Should the absence <span title="233" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-233">p. 233</span>of a voluntary act nonetheless preclude liability? The law is unequivocal on this point. MPC §2.01(1) would afford a full defense, and a long-honored maxim of the criminal law states: <i>cogitationis poenam nemo patitur</i>—no one is punishable solely for his thoughts. Though the law of attempt will allow criminal liability if a defendant moves beyond thoughts to some actions, even if they do not result in a completed offense, attempt still requires an act of some kind. See Chapter 6, pp. 651-672 infra. But why should this be so? Consider the following comments:</p>

<p id="768c9a05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is the contention of the Government that either the third or the fourth ground is applicable here. However, it is obvious that in any of the four situations, there are critical issues of fact which must be passed on by the jury—specifically in this case, whether appellant had entered into a contract with the mother for the care of Anthony Lee or, alternatively, whether she assumed the care of the child and secluded him from the care of his mother, his natural protector. On both of these issues, the evidence is in direct conflict, appellant insisting that the mother was actually living with appellant and Anthony Lee, and hence should have been taking care of the child herself, while Shirley Green testified she was living with her parents and was paying appellant to care for both children.</p>

<i>1. Finding a legal duty.</i> <i>Jones</i> reflects the general Anglo-American position that unless a penal statute specifically requires a particular action to be performed, criminal liability for omission arises only when the law of torts or some other law imposes a duty to act. This is a position also taken in Model Penal Code §2.01(3) (recognizing liability for an omission only when “a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law”).</p>
<p id="768cc11b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Omissions and homicide.</i> Most cases where liability for homicide is imposed for a failure to act are, like the <i>Jones</i> case, cases of involuntary manslaughter because the defendant does not have an intent to kill. See Chapter 5, pp. 490-509 infra. Such a case might be murder, however, if the defendant refused aid with the intention of causing death, or with full knowledge of a great risk that the decedent would die. For example, in Commonwealth v. Pestinikas, 617 A.2d 1339 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992), the defendant permitted a 92-year-old man to die of starvation after agreeing to feed him and knowing that there was no other way for him to obtain food. The defendant was convicted of murder in the third degree.</p>

<i>3. Interpreting the scope of a duty.</i> The rule that there is generally no legal duty to act is inapplicable, of course, when statutory language or common-law doctrines create such a duty. But social resistance to imposing liability for omissions makes itself felt even when statutes and precedents could be readily interpreted to establish a duty to aid.

<p id="768ce839-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Pope’s lack of any attempt to prevent the numerous acts of abuse committed by the mother over a relatively protracted period and her failure to seek medical assistance for the child, although the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent, could constitute a cause for the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to the child’s death. In such circumstances, Pope’s omissions constituted in themselves cruel and inhumane treatment within the meaning of the statute. It follows that Pope would be guilty of child abuse <i>if her status brought her within the class of persons specified by the statute.</i> It being clear that she was neither the child’s parent nor adoptive parent, and there being no evidence sufficient to support a finding that she had “the permanent or temporary care or custody” of the child so as to be in loco parentis to the child, the sole question is whether she had “responsibility for the supervision of” the child in the circumstances. If she had such responsibility the evidence was legally sufficient to find her guilty of child abuse as a principal in the first degree.</p>
<p id="768ce83a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State would have us translate compassion and concern, acts of kindness and care, performance of maternal functions, and general help and aid with respect to the child into responsibility for the supervision of the child. The crux of its argument is that although Pope was not under any obligation to assume responsibility for the supervision of the child at the outset, “once she undertook to house, feed, and care for [the mother and child], she did accept the responsibility and came within the coverage of the statute.” But the mother was always present. Pope had no right to usurp the role of the mother even to the extent of responsibility for the child’s supervision. . . . It would be most incongruous that acts of hospitality and kindness, made out of common decency and prompted by sincere concern for the well-being of a mother and her child, subjected the Good Samaritan to criminal prosecution for abusing the very child he sought to look after. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768ce83b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence does not show why Pope did not intervene when the mother abused the child or why she did not, at least, timely seek medical assistance, when it was obvious that the child was seriously injured. . . . But Pope’s conduct, during and after the acts of abuse, must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child, she was under no legal obligation to do so unless she then had responsibility for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute. She may not be punished as a felon under our system of justice for failing to fulfill a moral obligation, and the short of it is that she was under no legal obligation. . . . We hold that the evidence was not sufficient in law to prove that Pope fell within that class of persons to whom the child abuse statute applies. . . .

We see no basis in the statute for an interpretation that a person “has” responsibility for the supervision of a child, if that person believes or may have reason to believe that a parent is not capable of caring for the child. There is no right to make such a subjective judgment in order to divest parents of their rights and obligations with respect to their minor children, and therefore, no obligation to do so. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768ce83d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an understandable feeling of outrage at what occurred, intensified by the fact that the mother, who actually beat the child to death, was held to be not responsible for her criminal acts. But it is the law, not indignation, which governs. The law requires that Pope’s conviction of the felony of child abuse be set aside as clearly erroneous due to evidentiary insufficiency. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768ce83e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We assume, arguendo, that misprision of felony was a crime under the common law of England, and that it became the law of this State pursuant to Art. 5 of the Declaration of Rights. The question is whether it is to be deemed an indictable offense in Maryland today. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768ce83f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are satisfied, considering its origin, the impractical and indiscriminate width of its scope, its other obvious deficiencies, and its long non-use, that it is not now compatible with our local circumstances and situation and our general code of laws and jurisprudence. Maintenance of law and order does not demand its application, and, overall, the welfare of the inhabitants of Maryland and society as enjoyed by us today, would not be served by it. If the Legislature finds it advisable that the people be obligated under peril of criminal penalty to disclose knowledge of criminal acts, it is, of course, free to create an offense to that end, within constitutional limitations, and, hopefully, with adequate safeguards. We believe that the common law offense is not acceptable by today’s standards, and we are not free to usurp the power of the General Assembly by attempting to fashion one that would be. We hold that misprision of felony is not a chargeable offense in Maryland.</p>

<p id="768ce845-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the gang rape in March at the New Bedford, Mass., tavern happened as the witnesses said, it was unquestionably heinous and revolting. But some say the answer does not lie in laws like the one passed in Rhode Island. That measure was opposed by, surprisingly enough, the Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center, which raised questions about rape victims’ privacy. The Rhode Island <span title="239" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-239">p. 239</span>chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union also opposed it, citing constitutional and practical objections. Others think such statutes may be valid but ineffective. “These statutes will be no more effective than jaywalking laws,” said Arthur Miller, Harvard law professor and television law commentator. “But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t legislate in this area. It would give legal effect to a moral principle that we are our brother’s keeper.”</p>
<p id="768ce846-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The public outcry in the New Bedford situation recalled the uproar that followed the 1964 murder of Catherine “Kitty” Genovese in Queens, N.Y. The young bar manager was stabbed to death on the street in her middle-class neighborhood in an attack that lasted some 35 minutes. Witnesses peered through their curtains and did nothing. The assailant followed Genovese from her parking lot toward her apartment building as she came home from work about 3:20 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M.</span> He started stabbing her, then fled when she screamed for help. But when her calls went unheeded, he returned to strike again. After the second assault he headed for his car and drove away while Genovese slowly crawled to her apartment doorway. Amazingly, the killer returned a third time, repeated his attack, and Genovese died. The first call to police was not made until 3:40 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M.</span> The man who finally called said he waited because he “didn’t want to get involved.”</p>

But later investigations have shown that bystander apathy in her case was overstated. There were two, not three, attacks on Genovese, and few people saw the attacks. Moreover, two people did call the police, and one neighbor went to Genovese and was holding her when the police arrived, even though she did so at great risk, without knowing that the killer had fled. Nicholas Lemann, A Call for Help: What the Kitty Genovese Story Really Means, The New Yorker, Mar. 10, 2014. Nevertheless, the original portrayal of the Genovese killing prompted a great deal of social psychology research confirming that people are less likely to intervene to help when they believe there are many others who can also help.</p>

Moreover, the victim may spurn, attack, or become completely dependent on the rescuer, while the legal system may enlist the rescuer as a witness subject to innumerable encounters with police, lawyers and judges.

He has no doubt that there are cases of each, even where the imperiled person dies. If a gaoler omits to supply a prisoner with food; if an official omits to warn travelers that the river is too high to ford; if the owner of a dog which is attacking someone omits to call it off; and death results, the person who failed to act is guilty of murder. But, if a man omits to give alms to a starving beggar; if a surgeon refuses to go from Calcutta to Meerut to perform a life-saving operation; if one traveler omits to warn others that the river is too high to ford; if a passer-by omits to call off the attacking dog; and death results, the person who failed to act is not guilty of murder. Macaulay . . . [is] prepared to grant that a rich man who lets a beggar die at his feet is morally worse than some for whom severe punishment was prescribed. “But we are unable to see where, if we make such a man legally punishable, we can draw the line.” How rich is rich enough, and how much can be required? If it takes a thousand rupees to save the beggar’s life, should the rich man be required to provide it? If not, where is the line to be drawn? And if the potential Good Samaritan is not a rich man, how much should he be required to give? Macaulay therefore proposes that omissions which cause or threaten harm be punishable only where they are, “on other grounds, illegal.” In other words, only where there are already existing legal duties to aid should the failure to aid be indictable. . . .

<p id="768d3677-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What are the consequences of Good Samaritan legislation so feared by Macaulay and other opponents? On the surface it looks like a problem of legal draftsmanship. Such are the differences between men and circumstances that no workable formula for specifying those occasions on which a Samaritan ought to be legally required to render aid can be produced. . . . Livingston’s criterion,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN113E0_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N113E0_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> that aid ought to be mandatory when it can be given “without personal danger or pecuniary loss,” is considered to be open to serious <span title="242" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-242">p. 242</span>objection. The surgeon summoned from Calcutta to Meerut might profit financially, and the trip might present no greater dangers than staying in Bengal, but it might still be extremely inconvenient for him: “He is about to proceed to Europe immediately, or he expects some members of his family by the next ship, and wishes to be at the presidency to receive them.” If he refuses to go, he is no “murderer,” and a good sight better than another who, “enjoying ample wealth, should refuse to disburse an anna to save the life of another.” On Livingston’s criterion, the latter but not the former should go free.</p>
<p id="768d3679-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">About the best that could be said for this argument is that it shows the inadequacy of Livingston’s criterion. . . . It does nothing to show that if Good Samaritan legislation is introduced, unreasonable sacrifices of welfare and interests will be demanded of Samaritans. As is the case with Good Samaritan provisions in those countries that already have them, the Samaritan will be required only to take reasonable steps to give or procure aid for the imperiled person. Judgments of reasonableness are not impossible of determination, and are the bread and butter of the courts. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768d367a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, I think another, rather different fear underlies Macaulay’s opposition to Good Samaritan legislation. [I]t is basically the fear that Good Samaritan legislation will substantially diminish freedom. In a culture steeped in individualism, nothing produces more hysteria than measures which encroach on individual liberty. “You owe me nothing; I owe you nothing. You stay out of my way, and I’ll stay out of yours.” That is an extreme expression, but it constitutes an important thread within the Anglo-American sociomoral fabric. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768d367b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The freedom to pursue one’s interests is not, as Mill and Bentham clearly saw, unlimited. Where the pursuit of one’s interests is a causal factor in another’s harm, or threatens additional harm, as in Bad Samaritanism, we have the important beginnings of a case for justifiable state interference. . . .

<i>1. Statutory duties to rescue.</i> Three American states, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Vermont, make it a criminal offense to refuse to render aid to a person in peril. See Gabriel D.M. Ciociola, Misprision of Felony and Its Progeny, 41 Brandeis L.J. 697, 735-738 (2003). The Vermont statute (Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, §519 (2016)) provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768d5d8f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person who knows that another is exposed to grave physical harm shall, to the extent that the same can be rendered without danger or peril to himself or without interference with important duties owed to others, give reasonable assistance to the exposed person unless that assistance or care is being provided by others. [Penalty $100 fine.]</p>
</div>
<p id="768d5d90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Rhode Island statute is similar but imposes the duty only at the scene of an “emergency” and provides a penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment and a $500 fine. R.I. Gen. Laws §11-56-1 (2016).</p>
<p id="768d5d91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="243" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-243">p. 243</span>Three additional states, Florida, Hawaii, and Wisconsin, also require bystanders to be Good Samaritans, but only in more limited situations. In all three states, the duty to assist is not triggered by natural disasters but only when the person in peril is the victim of a crime. The Wisconsin and Hawaii duties to render aid extend to the victims of all violent crime, but Florida imposes a duty to assist only on persons who personally observe the commission of a sexual battery. See Ciociola, supra at 738-742. What, if anything, explains these limitations? Isn’t the justification for requiring assistance <i>at least</i> as strong when the peril does not result from criminal conduct?</p>
<p id="768d5d92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In all six “Good Samaritan” states, a violation of the duty to rescue is only a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor. Even so, prosecutions are rare. See Ciociola, supra at 739. See also David A. Hyman, Rescue Without Law: An Empirical Perspective on the Duty to Rescue, 84 Tex. L. Rev. 653 (2006).</p>
<p id="768d5d93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Appropriate boundaries.</i> Professor Ken Levy argues that a general duty to assist is justified by its potential for mitigating injury and loss of life, but that such a duty must not interfere unduly with the liberty interests of the individual. He therefore proposes that citizens not in a special relationship with the victim should have a duty to assist when (but only when) they are in close proximity to a person in grave danger and know that it will be “easy and safe” to render assistance. See Ken Levy, Killing, Letting Die, and the Case for Mildly Punishing Bad Samaritanism, 44 Ga. L. Rev. 607, 690 (2010). The proposed duty to aid is thus narrower than that imposed by the Vermont statute, for example. Is the proposed duty <i>too</i> narrow, or is it still too broad to be widely acceptable in American jurisdictions?</p>
<p id="768d5d94-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The European contrast.</i> European countries have long used the criminal law to enforce a duty to aid a person in distress. See Jacobo Gómez-Aller, Criminal Omissions: A European Perspective, 11 New Crim. L. Rev. 419 (2008). An example is Article 323c of the German Criminal Code:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768d5d95-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whoever does not render help in cases of accident, common danger or necessity although help is needed and can be provided in the circumstances without danger of serious injury to the person and without violation of other important duties, will be punished by imprisonment up to one year or by fine.</p>
</div>
<p id="768d5d96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">France was slower than other continental countries to recognize a general duty to rescue, but a provision similar to that of German law (art. 63(2) of the French Penal Code) was added in 1945. It carries a penalty of up to five years’ imprisonment, and it has been enforced with some frequency. For example, motorists have often been prosecuted and convicted for failure to stop and assist the victims of vehicle accidents caused by others. See Edward A. Tomlinson, The French Experience with a Duty to Rescue, 20 N.Y.L. Sch. J. Int’l &amp; Comp. L. 451 (2000).</p>
<p id="768d5d97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Using a duty to rescue to charge a more serious offense.</i> Being charged under existing “Good Samaritan” laws yields relatively minor misdemeanor penalties (always less than a year in jail or a relatively small fine). But <span title="244" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-244">p. 244</span>prosecutors can use the “Good Samaritan” duty to charge an individual under a different crime. Consider State v. Martinez, 68 P.3d 606 (Haw. 2003). The defendant failed to seek medical assistance after his girlfriend severely beat her daughter, inflicting injuries that proved fatal. His duty to aid was based on the Hawaii Good Samaritan statute, and violations of that statute are classified as petty misdemeanors. Nonetheless, he was convicted of reckless manslaughter and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. The court upheld the conviction, on the theory that the statute imposed a duty to act and that his omission, with awareness of the danger to the child, caused her death.</p>
<p id="768d5d98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Misprision—the duty to report.</i> The common-law offense of misprision of felony, discussed in <i>Pope</i>, was abolished in England in 1967, and most American jurisdictions have likewise abolished or refused to recognize the offense. See Ciociola, supra Note 1, at 710-718. Congress enacted a misprision-of-felony statute in 1909, 18 U.S.C. §4, but this offense requires active concealment of a known felony; the mere omission of failing to report is not sufficient. United States v. Brantley, 803 F.3d 1265, 1277 (11th Cir. 2015). Only a few American states still recognize the common-law offense, see, e.g., State v. Smith, 592 S.E.2d 302 (S.C. 2004); Ciociola, supra at 710-721, but two others (South Dakota and Ohio) have re-established the offense through statutes that create a general obligation to report any known felony, and many states impose a reporting obligation on eyewitnesses to specific crimes. See Ciociola, supra at 726-734.</p>
<p id="768d84a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additionally, all American jurisdictions require members of certain designated professions to report suspected cases of child abuse; usually the failure to do so is a misdemeanor. In recent years, the duty to report in such situations has been expanded from doctors, nurses, and teachers to include clergy, optometrists, psychotherapists, and (in some jurisdictions) even attorneys. See Sandra Guerra Thompson, The White Collar Police Force: “Duty to Report” Statutes in Criminal Law Theory, 11 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 3 (2002). Building on that model, Congress and state legislatures have required individuals to report suspicions concerning a variety of other crimes, such as elder abuse, domestic violence, environmental crimes, and certain financial crimes. In many professions, the web of reporting obligations is now quite dense, with important implications for client confidentiality and the traditional conception of the individual’s right to “mind his own business.” See Thompson, supra.</p>
<p id="768d84aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Are there legitimate objections to imposing a general duty to report <i>any</i> felony? One concern may be that such a duty would pose an unacceptable threat to the privacy of victims, especially in the case of sexual offenses. Another concern may be the bystander’s reluctance to become obliged to testify in court for fear of retaliation by the person reported. Is resistance to a reporting obligation justified if it is based not on protecting the victim’s privacy but instead on preserving the bystander’s autonomy right to remain uninvolved? For a discussion of these issues, see Kleinig, supra.</p>

<p id="768d84ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Family members.</i> As the court notes in the <i>Jones</i> case, it is well settled that a duty to aid arises “where one stands in a certain status relationship to another.” But not every significant status relationship will do. Parents have a duty to aid and protect their minor children, and spouses have a similar duty to each other. Generally speaking, duties are not automatically imposed on siblings to aid each other, on parents to aid their adult children, or on adult children to aid their parents—even when the parents are elderly and unable to care for themselves. Jurisdictions will sometimes recognize broader family duties, however. See, e.g., Bartley v. Commonwealth, 400 S.W.3d 714, 729 (Ky. 2013) (parent has duty under Kentucky statutory law to provide for an adult child who is “wholly dependent” because of a “permanent physical or mental disability”); State v. Gargus, 462 S.W.3d 417, 423 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013) (adult child has duty to care for elderly, vulnerable parent who could not care for herself when child has assumed that responsibility).</p>
<p id="768dabbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. De facto family members.</i> Traditionally, the categories of spouse and parent would trigger a duty to aid only in the case of formal legal relationships. Consider People v. Beardsley, 150 Mich. 206, 113 N.W. 1128 (1907). Beardsley, who was married, apparently was having an affair with Blanche Burns, and he spent a weekend with her at his home, while his wife was out of town. At the end of the weekend, Burns took a fatal dose of morphine tablets. Beardsley failed to call a physician to help her. She died, and he was convicted of manslaughter. The court reversed the conviction because defendant owed the deceased no legal duty (113 N.W. at 1131):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="768dabc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged by the prosecutor that the respondent “stood towards this woman for the time being in the place of her natural guardian and protector, and as such owed her a clear legal duty which he completely failed to perform.” The fact that this woman was in his house created no such legal duty as exists in law and is due from a husband towards his wife, as seems to be intimated by the prosecutor’s brief. Such an inference would be very repugnant to our moral sense.</p>
</div>
<p id="768dabc1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do you agree? <i>Beardsley</i> has been widely criticized. One commentator concludes that <i>Beardsley</i> “proclaims a morality which is smug, ignorant and vindictive” (Graham Hughes, Criminal Omissions, 67 Yale L.J. 590, 624 (1958)), and courts have described its holding as “outmoded.” State ex rel. Kuntz v. District Court, 995 P.2d 951, 956 (2000). See Arthur Leavens, A Causation Approach to Criminal Omissions, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 547, 561 (1988). <span title="246" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-246">p. 246</span>But on facts like <i>Beardsley</i>, should the result be different today? Few contemporary courts (if any) would say that a formal marriage is always necessary to establish a familial duty. But is a de facto marriage required, or is a more casual dating relationship (like that in <i>Beardsley</i>) sufficient? If any romantic liaison will suffice, isn’t a duty to aid equally justified for other personal relationships, even without a sexual dimension? In that vein, isn’t the result in <i>Pope</i> even harder to defend than the result in <i>Beardsley</i>?</p>
<p id="768dabc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cases are beginning to expand—but only slightly—the notion of who qualifies as a spouse or parent. In People v. Carroll, 715 N.E.2d 500 (N.Y. 1999), a stepmother was charged with child endangerment for failing to prevent her husband from killing his daughter during a week when the daughter was temporarily visiting them. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the indictment, ruling that the stepmother owed a duty of care to her husband’s children (715 N.E.2d at 500):</p>

By expanding the bounds of who is legally responsible for children beyond the realm of the traditional family and legal guardian, this standard takes into account the modern-day reality that parenting functions are not always performed by a parent.</p>
</div>
<p id="768dabc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other states have imposed duties on any adult residing with a child who assumes a parent-like role and “substantial responsibility for such necessities as food, shelter, and protection.” Staples v. Commonwealth, 454 S.W.3d 803, 818 (Ky. 2014). Not every jurisdiction takes this approach. Consider State v. Miranda, 274 Conn. 727, 878 A.2d 1118 (2005). Miranda, a live-in boyfriend, failed to protect a four-month-old child from a fatal beating inflicted by his girlfriend, the child’s mother. While residing with the family, he had taken care of the child and considered himself to be her stepfather. He was convicted of first-degree assault, and in his initial appeal the Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the conviction, ruling that because he had a family-like relationship with the mother and had assumed responsibility for the welfare of her children, he was under a duty to protect the baby girl from her mother’s abuse. 715 A.2d 680 (Conn. 1998). In a subsequent appeal, however, the court overruled its original decision. This time (with one of the judges who had voted to uphold the conviction now changing his vote), the court set aside the assault conviction. Writing for a plurality, the judge who changed his vote explained (878 A.2d at 1130-1131):</p>

[T]he children who are the most at risk for abuse are likely to suffer the greatest harm from this amorphous criminal liability, because it will discourage well-meaning relatives, friends of the family and other members of the community from taking an active and intense interest in them, for fear of being caught in a web of criminal liability for the egregious conduct of another.</p>

For a probing critique of this approach, see Michael O’Hear, Yes to Nondiscrimination, No to New Forms of Criminal Liability, 88 B.U. L. Rev. 1437 (2008).</p>

<i>3. When the parent herself is a victim.</i> There is no doubt, of course, that a mother has a duty to protect her minor children from abuse by a third party. As a result, mothers are frequently prosecuted and convicted on child abuse or homicide charges, including murder, when their children are the victims of assault perpetrated by a male member of the household. See Jennifer M. Collins, Ethan J. Lieb &amp; Dan Markel, Punishing Family Status, 88 B.U. L. Rev. 1327, 1329-1330, 1335 (2008). Although—in theory—her duty to take protective actions is clear, culpability and the appropriate targets of criminal law enforcement become clouded when the context is infected by pervasive domestic violence. Consider Commonwealth v. Cardwell, 515 A.2d 311 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Defendant Julia Cardwell lived with her daughter, Alicia, and Clyde Cardwell, who was Julia’s husband and Alicia’s stepfather. For four years, beginning when Alicia was about 11 years old, Clyde sexually abused Alicia. In October 1983, Alicia told her mother Julia about the assaults. Ten <span title="248" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-248">p. 248</span>months later, Alicia ran away from home.

<p id="768dd2dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In those ten months, Julia’s only actions directed at protecting her daughter consisted of writing two letters to Clyde that did little more than express her knowledge of and anger at his abuse of Alicia; applying for Alicia to transfer schools; and moving some of her and Alicia’s clothing to Julia’s mother’s house. We note that the remedy of moving to Julia’s mother’s house was tragically frustrated by the destruction by fire of that house in May 1984, but the fact remains that Julia took no further steps to relieve her daughter’s desperate situation in the four months that ensued from May 1984 until Alicia ran away from home in September 1984.</p>

<i>4. The duty of one who creates another person’s peril.</i> The law has long been clear that “one who by his overpowering criminal act has put another in danger of drowning has a duty to preserve her life. . . . ” Jones v. State, 43 N.E.2d 1017, 1018 (Ind. 1942). The duty to act in these situations is obviously fair, but it’s not so obvious why it matters. After all, if the victim drowns, the prosecution can argue simply that the defendant killed her by his initial criminal act—for example, the act of pushing her into the water. Why would it make any difference whether he had an obligation to rescue her?</p>
<p id="768df9f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer becomes clear if we compare the defendant’s state of mind—and the resulting degree of blame—that attach to the initial act and to the omission. That comparison is important because the nature of an offense depends on the interaction of three elements—the actus reus (a voluntary act or culpable omission), the defendant’s state of mind at the time of that actus reus (his or her mens rea), and the result caused. Suppose that Arthur, in a boisterous mood after drinking four beers, runs along a crowded fishing pier, fails to watch where he is going, and collides with Frank Fisherman, knocking him into the water. Frank yells that he can’t swim and implores Arthur to throw him the nearby life preserver, but Arthur simply watches as Frank struggles and eventually drowns. Arthur’s affirmative act, running heedlessly along the pier, is probably careless enough to constitute criminal negligence, and as a result, he could be convicted of involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide. But is he guilty of murder? That offense, as we shall see,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11540_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11540_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">11</a></span> could be established by proof that the defendant <i>knew</i> his conduct would cause death. It would be difficult to prove that Arthur had that knowledge when he ran along the pier and collided with Frank. But it would be easy to prove that Arthur had that knowledge later, while he watched Frank struggle and did nothing to save him. Imposing a duty to rescue (as the law does in this instance) will bring into the picture a much more culpable state of mind and will therefore markedly increase the degree of Arthur’s liability in the event that Frank drowns.</p>

<i>5. Problem.</i> Should the duty to rescue based on “creating another person’s peril” be triggered when the acts that create danger are not culpable at all? Suppose that Barry, while walking slowly down the pier, accidentally and without fault bumps into a child, knocking her into the water. Barry and another bystander, Carl, then watch the child drown. On the basis of his actions alone, Barry has not committed any criminal offense. Should his innocent act, imperiling the child, give rise to a duty to rescue? Consider <span title="250" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-250">p. 250</span>J.C.

<p id="768df9f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I venture, therefore, to suggest a general principle: . . . Whenever the defendant’s act, though without his knowledge, imperils the person, liberty or property of another, or any other interest protected by the criminal law, and the defendant becomes aware of the events creating the peril, he has a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the peril from resulting in the harm in question.</p>

In Commonwealth v. Levesque, 766 N.E.2d 50 (Mass. 2002), the defendants accidentally started a fire and then, despite their awareness of the danger, failed to report it. The blaze got out of control, and six firefighters died attempting to put it out. The court upheld the defendants’ conviction of involuntary manslaughter.</p>
<p id="768df9fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions: (a)</i> Under the approach of cases like <i>Levesque</i>, supra, the result in the example involving the child knocked from the pier into the water is that a duty to act would be imposed on Barry (who accidentally created the peril) but not on the bystander Carl. Does this make sense? If the law is sound in allowing Carl to ignore the child’s plight, why should Barry’s wholly faultless act put him in a different position? And how should we analyze the liability of a third person (Dorothy) who is standing on the pier when Barry accidentally bumps into her, knocking her into the child, who as a result falls into the water? As an involuntary agent, Dorothy—or her body—caused the peril to the child. Is Dorothy, who committed no act, in the same moral (and legal) position as Carl, who also committed no act, or should she be treated like Barry, who committed a voluntary but innocent act? Recall that the law imposes no general duty to rescue. The problem, then, is to determine when the reasons for that rule (which presumably apply in the case of Carl) are no longer applicable. For a careful discussion of the issues, see Larry Alexander, Criminal Liability for Omissions, in Criminal Law Theory 121 (Stephen Shute &amp; A.P. Simester eds., 2002).</p>
<p id="768df9fd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Should the duty to rescue based on “creating another person’s peril” be triggered when the defendant helps a person who voluntarily <i>chooses</i> to place <span title="251" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-251">p. 251</span>herself in danger? In R. v. Evans, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 1999, the defendant supplied heroin to her sister, who self-injected the drug, and then developed symptoms of overdose. Though aware of her sister’s life-endangering condition, the defendant failed to summon assistance. Her conviction for manslaughter was upheld on the ground that a duty to rescue was triggered because she had “contributed to” creating the perilous situation. Id. at 31. Is the result sound?</p>
<p id="768e210e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> Are the duties to rescue that arise under tort law sufficiently well defined to afford adequate notice to affected citizens, thus meeting the criminal-law “legality” principle? Or do penal prohibitions triggered by evolving tort precedent violate the constitutional void-for-vagueness doctrine? We examined the legality and vagueness doctrines in depth at pp. 158-202 supra. In terms of these doctrines—or merely in terms of simple fairness—does evolving tort law provide an acceptable foundation for criminal liability? In cases like <i>Levesque</i> and <i>Evans</i>, supra, courts have not considered criminal liability unfair. Compare State v. Lisa, 945 A.2d 690, 691 (N.J. 2008). Early one evening, the defendant illegally sold a methadone tablet to his girlfriend, A.R. She then proceeded to attend several parties, where she drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. Around 3:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M.</span>, she went to the defendant’s home, drank more beer, had sex with him, and then passed out in his bedroom. When the defendant attempted to awaken her, she was unresponsive. Several friends, including one who was a nurse, urged him to call 911, but he refused, hoping she would “sleep it off.” When emergency aid was finally summoned the following afternoon, A.R. was unconscious and had suffered major brain damage; she died ten days later without regaining consciousness. The defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter for failing to summon aid at a time when he knew that A.R. was in grave danger. But the trial court dismissed the indictment on the ground that he owed no duty to A.R. Affirming the dismissal, the New Jersey Supreme Court said (id. at 691):</p>

<p id="768e2113-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is possession an omission or an act? If it is an omission, when is there a duty to avoid or terminate the possession? These questions assume great importance as a result of the proliferation of drug-possession and firearms-possession offenses and the high priority that federal and state prosecutors continue to give to the “war on drugs.”</p>
<p id="768e2114-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="252" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-252">p. 252</span>In the simplest cases, a person buys an illegal item—a gun, for example—and puts it into his coat pocket. Here we would say that he <i>takes</i> possession; his possession is clearly an act. But suppose that Smuggler places a packet of heroin into the baggage of Respectable Traveler, hoping that Traveler will not be searched and that Smuggler can later steal Traveler’s bag to retrieve the drugs. If Traveler is searched and the drugs are found, is she guilty of illegal possession? Most courts hold that she is not; they interpret possession offenses to require that the accused be aware that she has the thing she is charged with possessing, even when the statute is silent on the subject. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Adkins, 331 S.W.2d 260 (Ky. 2011); Commonwealth v. Sespedes, 810 N.E.2d 790 (Mass. 2004). The Model Penal Code likewise provides that possession can satisfy the actus reus requirement of §2.01(1) only when the accused “was aware of his control [of the thing possessed] for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.” Model Penal Code §2.01(4).</p>
<p id="768e2115-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Not all courts agree. State v. Bradshaw, 98 P.3d 1190 (Wash. 2004), involved a commercial truck driver who crossed the Canadian border into the state of Washington driving a large semitrailer on which someone had hidden 77 pounds of marijuana in a space between pallets of cargo. There was no evidence the driver was aware that drugs were on the truck. Nonetheless, the Washington Supreme Court upheld a conviction for possession of illegal drugs, rejecting the argument that awareness of the presence of an item is inherent in the concept of possessing it.</p>
<p id="768e2116-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions: (1)</i> In what sense did the truck driver commit any relevant “act”? Driving the truck, of course, is an act, but the Washington Supreme Court did not attempt to defend liability on that basis. Its approach would support conviction even if the driver simply sat passively in the truck while (a) a smuggler hid drugs on it and then (b) a police officer, acting on a reliable informant’s tip, searched and found the drugs. In what sense would the driver have committed any relevant “act” in such a case?</p>
<p id="768e2117-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(2)</i> If liability is based not on an “act” but simply on the driver’s omission (his failure to get rid of the drugs), what is the justification for imposing that duty to act? Notice that in cases like <i>Pope</i> and other failure-to-rescue situations, the bystander, though well aware of a peril, is permitted to ignore it. Why should a duty be imposed when the accused had no reason to think there was any need for him to act?</p>
<p id="768e2118-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(3)</i> Suppose the truck driver, though still unaware of the presence of drugs, <i>should have</i> suspected that something was amiss? (Suppose, for example, he had noticed a suspicious person loitering near his truck and saw that a flap covering his cargo had either come loose or been untied.) If drugs are subsequently discovered, would Model Penal Code §2.01 permit a conviction for drug possession? <i>Should</i> the driver be guilty of a drug-possession offense under these circumstances?</p>
<p id="768e4829-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(4)</i> Even when liability requires awareness of the “thing possessed,” there may remain a question of what constitutes the “thing.” Consider Ramirez-Memije v. State, 444 S.W.3d 624 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014), in which the <span title="253" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-253">p. 253</span>defendant was charged with fraudulent possession of identifying information when he was caught while delivering a credit card skimming device. The device surreptitiously collected customers’ identifying information and credit card numbers when they paid their bill at a restaurant, and that information was then later used to make fraudulent purchases. The defendant argued that, although he was aware that he possessed the skimming device, he did not know that it contained identifying information. Thus, he argued that he did not have awareness of the “thing possessed,” in this case, identifying information. The court of appeals agreed, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that it was sufficient for the defendant to know he possessed the skimming device. Which is the better view?</p>

<p id="768e6f4f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The House of Lords faced the question whether artificial feeding and antibiotic drugs may lawfully be withheld from an insensate patient with no hope of recovery, when it is known that without the treatment the patient will shortly die. The House of Lords answered the question in the affirmative. Lord Goff stated in his address:]</p>
<p id="768e6f50-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he law draws a crucial distinction between cases in which a doctor decides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for his patient treatment or care which could or might prolong his life and those in which he decides, for example, by administering a lethal drug, actively to bring his patient’s life to an end. [T]he former may be lawful, either because the doctor is giving effect to his patient’s wishes by withholding the treatment or care, or even in certain circumstances in which . . . the patient is incapacitated from stating whether or not he gives his consent. But it is not lawful for a doctor to administer a drug to his patient to bring about his death, even though that course is prompted by a humanitarian desire to end his suffering, however great that suffering may be. So to act is to cross the Rubicon which runs between on the one hand the care of the living patient and on the other hand euthanasia—actively causing his death to avoid or to end his suffering. Euthanasia is not lawful at common law. It is of course well known that there are many responsible members of our society who believe that euthanasia should be made lawful; but that result could, I believe, only be achieved by legislation which expresses the democratic will that so fundamental a change should be made in our law, and can, if enacted, ensure that such legalized killing can only be carried out subject to appropriate supervision and control. It is true that the drawing of this distinction may lead to a charge of hypocrisy, because it can be asked why, if the doctor, by discontinuing treatment, is entitled in consequence to let his patient die, it should not be lawful to put him out of his misery straight away, in a more humane manner, by a lethal injection, rather than let him linger on in pain until he dies. But the law does not feel able to authorize euthanasia, even in circumstances such as these, for, once euthanasia is recognized as lawful in these circumstances, it is difficult to see any logical basis for excluding it in others.</p>
<p id="768e6f51-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the heart of this distinction lies a theoretical question. Why is it that the doctor who gives his patient a lethal injection which kills him commits an unlawful act and indeed is guilty of murder, whereas a doctor who, by <span title="256" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-256">p. 256</span>discontinuing life support, allows his patient to die may not act unlawfully and will not do so if he commits no breach of duty to his patient? Professor Glanville Williams has suggested (see Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd edn, 1983), p. 282) that the reason is that what the doctor does when he switches off a life support machine “is in substance not an act but an omission to struggle” and that “the omission is not a breach of duty by the doctor, because he is not obliged to continue in a hopeless case.”</p>
<p id="768e6f52-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I agree that the doctor’s conduct in discontinuing life support can properly be categorized as an omission. It is true that it may be difficult to describe what the doctor actually does as an omission, for example where he takes some positive step to bring the life support to an end. But discontinuation of life support is, for present purposes, no different from not initiating life support in the first place. In each case, the doctor is simply allowing his patient to die in the sense that he is desisting from taking a step which might, in certain circumstances, prevent his patient from dying as a result of his pre-existing condition; and as a matter of general principle an omission such as this will not be unlawful unless it constitutes a breach of duty to the patient. I also agree that the doctor’s conduct is to be differentiated from that of, for example, an interloper who maliciously switches off a life support machine because, although the interloper may perform exactly the same act as the doctor who discontinues life support, his doing so constitutes interference with the life-prolonging treatment then being administered by the doctor. Accordingly, whereas the doctor, in discontinuing life support, is simply allowing his patient to die of his pre-existing condition, the interloper is actively intervening to stop the doctor from prolonging the patient’s life, and such conduct cannot possibly be categorized as an omission.</p>
<p id="768e6f53-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The distinction appears, therefore, to be useful in the present context in that it can be invoked to explain how discontinuance of life support can be differentiated from ending a patient’s life by a lethal injection. But in the end the reason for that difference is that, whereas the law considers that discontinuance of life support may be consistent with the doctor’s duty to care for his patient, it does not, for reasons of policy, consider that it forms any part of his duty to give his patient a lethal injection to put him out of his agony.</p>

<p id="768e9666-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a later chapter, we will examine the arguments in favor of allowing active euthanasia at a patient’s request to qualify as an affirmative defense to a charge of homicide or assisting a suicide. See pp. 972-982 infra. As we will see, only five American jurisdictions currently come close to recognizing such a defense. Yet “letting the patient die” with her consent is permissible in every American jurisdiction. Indeed, in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Public Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1989), the Supreme Court held that individuals have a constitutional right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. And the Court held this right available even to a person in a permanent vegetative state, provided there is clear and convincing evidence of the patient’s wishes in <span title="257" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-257">p. 257</span>this regard. Thus, the distinction between killing and letting die has enormous legal significance—the former is almost invariably illegal, while the latter is permissible and even constitutionally protected. But is there really a distinction, in the medical context, between an act of killing and an omission of letting die? And even if there is some distinction, does it justify the radically different legal treatment of the two? Consider these comments:</p>

It would not make much sense to say that one may not kill oneself by walking into the sea, but may sit on the beach until submerged by the incoming tide; or that one may not intentionally lock oneself in a cold storage locker, but may refrain from coming indoors when the temperature drops below freezing. . . .  Starving oneself to death is no different from putting a gun to one’s temple as far as the common-law definition of suicide is concerned; the cause of death in both cases is the suicide’s conscious decision to “pu[t] an end to his own existence.” 4 Blackstone, Commentaries *189.</p></div>

<p id="768e966e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he central issue that remains is whether . . . the moral or social threat to respect for human life is greater from physician-assisted suicide than it is from our widely accepted current practices of nontreatment? This question is key because most opponents of physician-assisted suicide accept the patient’s right to refuse life-saving medical treatment. They distinguish the two cases by citing the importance of the active/passive distinction. Opponents of physician-assisted suicide emphasize that overriding the patient’s choice to refuse treatment requires a direct imposition or intrusion on the patient, while assisted suicide and active euthanasia entails a person having something done to them. Proponents of a right to physician-assisted suicide, on the other hand, claim there is no significant moral difference between the two. If causing death by foregoing or removing medical treatment is justified, then causing death by writing a lethal prescription for the patient, or even administering a lethal injection, should also be permitted. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768e966f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The moral distinction between killing and letting die—between actively and passively causing death—has been examined by many bioethicists, philosophers, and lawyers. Most have concluded that the distinction between active and passive, on which opponents [of physician-assisted suicide] so heavily rest, is a distinction without a significant enough moral difference to support the great weight that opponents of physician-assisted suicide have placed on it. From the perspective of the affected individual, the sought for end—the relief of suffering and demise—is the same regardless of whether the immediate cause of death is described as active or passive, killing or letting <span title="258" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-258">p. 258</span>die. If a competent and informed patient knowingly consents, it does not matter morally whether the physician then withholds further treatment or writes a prescription for lethal drugs which the patient then administers to herself. . . . 
</p>
<p id="768ebd80-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The line drawn by opponents of assisted suicide between active and passive is also vulnerable to a charge of inconsistency or arbitrariness. It is difficult to know in practice why one thing is labeled active . . . and therefore not permitted, and another is labeled passive and permitted. A lethal injection is active. . . . Withdrawing treatment is said to be passive, yet many acts of withdrawal are quite active, for example, “pulling the plug” is literally an act. One cannot easily distinguish in all significant respects removing ventilators or feeding tubes from the act of writing a prescription for a drug, which the patient will later take on her own. Finally, because the interest in conserving resources exists in both cases, threats to the poor and elderly to end their life prematurely may be as great with decisions to withhold treatment as they are with asking physicians to write prescriptions for drugs that patients later use to commit suicide.</p>

<p id="768ebd88-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal law does more than simply identify the harms that society seeks to prohibit by threat of punishment; it also includes an elaborate body of qualifications to these threats of punishment, based on the absence of fault. A common usage is to consider all of these qualifications and exceptions to liability as examples of the requirement of “mens rea”—a requirement often identified with the classic maxim, <i>actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea.</i> Or, in Blackstone’s translation, “an unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all.” The vicious will was the mens rea; essentially it refers to the blameworthiness entailed in choosing to commit a criminal wrong. The requirement of mens rea reflects the common sense view of justice that blame and punishment are inappropriate in the absence of choice.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11726_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11726_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> From this perspective, a great variety of defenses to criminal liability—involuntary act, duress, legal insanity, accident, and mistake, for example—can be <span title="259" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-259">p. 259</span>considered “mens rea” defenses, that is, defenses that aim to establish the absence of moral blameworthiness.</p>
<p id="768ebd8a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This all-encompassing usage, which treats the term “mens rea” as synonymous with moral fault, is often referred to as mens rea in its <i>broad</i> sense. But courts and commentators often use the term “mens rea” in a narrower sense. Mens rea in its <i>narrow</i> sense is a more formal and technical requirement; it refers to the kind of mental awareness or intention that must accompany the prohibited act, under the terms of the statute defining the offense.</p>
<p id="768ebd8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Relatively few of the mental attitudes we notice in daily life are used in defining mens rea in this narrow sense. Whether the defendant acted regretfully, arrogantly, eagerly, hopefully, and so forth may be relevant for a judge considering the sentence to be imposed, but attitudes like these seldom factor into the statutory definition of a crime. Instead, almost invariably, the concern of the criminal law is limited to determining whether a defendant intended, expected, or should have expected that his actions would produce particular consequences.</p>
<p id="768ebd8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider some examples: An attempt to commit a crime consists of an act that comes close to its commission when that act is done with the <i>purpose</i> that the crime be committed. Unlawful assembly is the act of joining with a group in a public place with <i>intent</i> to commit unlawful acts. Receiving stolen goods is a crime when one receives stolen goods <i>knowing</i> they are stolen. Manslaughter is typically defined as the killing of another by an act done with the <i>awareness</i> of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of doing so.</p>
<p id="768ebd8d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The fact that criminal liability in these instances requires mens rea in a particular <i>narrow</i> sense is obvious. That is the way these crimes are defined. But it is important to see that they are so defined because the mens rea element is crucial to the description of the conduct we want to make criminal. To revert to the examples just given, it would not make sense to punish someone for receiving stolen goods when he had no reason to know that the goods were stolen. And surely we should see nothing criminal in joining a group in a public place, apart from the intent to commit unlawful acts. Finally, many acts accidentally result in death. The key to whether an accident should be punished as a criminal act depends on whether the defendant was aware of the risk or at least should have been aware of the risk.</p>
<p id="768ee49e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The mental element required by the definition of any crime, therefore, is of central concern. This subsection on basic concepts and terminology is designed to help identify and distinguish the various kinds of mental states that may be used in the definition of crimes. Legislatures have often left the mental element undefined or have treated it ambiguously, leaving it to the courts to figure out what the proper mental state should be for that offense. Unfortunately, the courts often fail to analyze these issues with precision or consistency. This subsection on terminology should help provide a vocabulary and an analytic framework for understanding and assessing what Justice Robert H. Jackson called “the variety, disparity and confusion of [the courts’] definitions of the requisite but elusive mental element.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 252 (1952).</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BYRNE</span>, J., read the following judgment. The appellant was convicted at Leeds Assizes upon an indictment framed under section 23 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, which charged that he unlawfully and maliciously caused to be taken by Sarah Wade a certain noxious thing, namely, coal gas, so as thereby to endanger the life of the said Sarah Wade.</p>
<p id="768ee4a4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts were that the appellant was engaged to be married and his prospective mother-in-law was the tenant of a house, No. 7A, Bakes Street, Bradford, which was unoccupied, but which was to be occupied by the appellant after his marriage. Mrs. Wade and her husband, an elderly couple, lived in the house next door. At one time the two houses had been one, but when the building was converted into two houses a wall had been erected to divide the cellars of the two houses, and that wall was composed of rubble loosely cemented.</p>
<p id="768ee4a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the evening of January 17, 1957, the appellant went to the cellar of No. 7A, Bakes Street, wrenched the gas meter from the gas pipes and stole it, together with its contents, and in a second indictment he was charged with the larceny of the gas meter and its contents. To that indictment he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. In respect of that matter he does not appeal.</p>
<p id="768ee4a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The facts were not really in dispute, and in a statement to a police officer the appellant said: “All right, I will tell you. I was short of money. I had been off work for three days, I got eight shillings from the gas meter. I tore it off the wall and threw it away.” Although there was a stop tap within two feet of the meter the appellant did not turn off the gas, with the result that a very considerable volume of gas escaped, some of which seeped through the wall of the cellar and partially asphyxiated Mrs. Wade, who was asleep in her bedroom next door, with the result that her life was endangered.</p>

What you have to decide here, then, is whether, when he loosed that frightful cloud of coal gas into the house which he shared with this old lady, he caused her to take it by his unlawful and malicious action. “Unlawful” does not need any definition. It is something forbidden by law. What about “malicious”? “Malicious” for this purpose means wicked—something which he has no business to do and perfectly well knows it. “Wicked” is as good a definition as any other which you would get.</p>

When he did that he knew that this old lady and her husband were living next door to him. The gas meter was in a cellar. The wall which divided his cellar from the cellar next door was a kind of honeycomb wall through which gas could very well go, so that when he loosed that cloud of gas into that place he must have known perfectly well that gas would percolate all over the house. If it were part of this offense—which it is not—that he intended to poison the old lady, I should have left it to you to decide, and I should have told you that there was evidence on which you could find that he intended that, since he did an action which he must have known would result in that. As I have already told you, it is not necessary to prove that he intended to do it; it is quite enough that what he did was done unlawfully and maliciously.</p>

<i>NOTES ON COMMON-LAW TERMINOLOGY</i>

<p id="768f31dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Introduction.</i> Traditional common-law offenses often require proof that the defendant acted either “willfully,” “intentionally,” “maliciously,” “corruptly,” “wantonly,” “recklessly,” “negligently,” or with “<i>scienter</i> [roughly, knowledge].” In addition, when “intent” is at issue, courts often distinguish between “general intent” and “specific intent.” And these are just the most common of the mens rea terms encountered in statutes and judicial decisions.</p>
<p id="768f31dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even with so many mens rea terms potentially in play, criminal law analysis could be manageable if each of these terms had a single, generally accepted meaning. Unfortunately, this has never been the case. Each of these terms has been given different meanings in different contexts, and some have been given different meanings by different courts, even in identical contexts. Voisine v. United States, No. 14-10154, slip op. at 11 (U.S. June 27, 2016) (“[t]he common law traditionally used a variety of overlapping and, frankly, confusing phrases to describe culpable mental states”). To add further confusion, some of the often-repeated definitions are merely collections of words that convey more atmosphere or emotion than concrete meaning. Having “malice,” for example, is often defined as having an “abandoned and malignant heart.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11828_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11828_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span>

<p id="768f31df-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under these circumstances, legal analysis in the common-law mens rea framework is inevitably imperfect and somewhat unpredictable; there can seldom be an authoritatively “correct” answer. In considering cases like <i>Cunningham</i>, <i>Faulkner</i>, and those that follow, the reader can escape this tangle only by focusing on concrete, practical questions: What facts, precisely, was the jury required to find in order to convict? What facts <i>should be</i> required in order to support a just conviction?</p>
<p id="768f31e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Malice.</i> Notice that in <i>Cunningham</i>, the trial judge defined “malicious” as “wicked.” The Court of Criminal Appeal relied on a textbook writer (Professor Kenny) for the proposition that malice refers not to wickedness but instead to “foresight of consequences.” This same debate took place in a recent case involving a charge under 49 U.S.C. §46507(1), which makes it a crime to “maliciously” give false information about a bomb threat on an airplane. The government argued that “where a statute does not define a common-law term like malice, courts presume that Congress adopted the common-law definition,” and urged a definition akin to the one adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i>Cunningham</i> that focused on the “disregard of the likelihood that damage or injury would result.” United States v. Gray, 780 F.3d 458, 463-464 (1st Cir. 2015). The defendant, in contrast, argued for a view more like the <span title="264" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-264">p. 264</span>trial judge in <i>Cunningham</i> and said it meant “to do something with an evil purpose or motive.” Id. at 463. The district court in <i>Gray</i> agreed with the defense, and the First Circuit upheld its instruction on the basis of the statutory scheme and its legislative history, which it viewed as sufficient to override the presumption to use the common law definition.</p>
<p id="768f58f1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which of these is the better view of what malice should mean as a general matter? We can approach that question from several different perspectives. Consider first the ordinary meaning of language. Which definition is closer to the meaning of “malice” in everyday speech? Many would think that, from this perspective, the trial judge’s definition in <i>Cunningham</i> was clearly the better one. If so, what considerations might explain the prevailing rule, reflected in both <i>Cunningham</i> and <i>Faulkner</i>, that gives malice a narrower, more technical meaning? Notice, for example, that under the everyday definition (“malicious means wicked”), the sailor in <i>Faulkner</i> would be regarded as committing the same crime as a sailor who deliberately set fire to the ship. Would that approach make sense? What happens to the boundaries between offenses in a complex criminal code if its mens rea requirements are not linked specifically to the kind of harm each offense is designed to prohibit?</p>
<p id="768f58f2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The approach taken in <i>Cunningham</i> (malice means foresight of the prohibited consequence) reflects the prevailing approach at common law. Generally (though not invariably), common-law courts adopt this approach as their “default” rule—that is, the presumptively applicable standard. Absent clear indications to the contrary, courts will interpret “malice” (and other vague or ambiguous mens rea language) to require that the defendant was aware his actions posed a substantial risk of causing the prohibited harm.</p>
<p id="768f58f3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notice that we can easily imagine approaches that are either stricter or more lenient. Why not assume that “malice” requires an actual desire to cause the prohibited harm, not merely awareness that it might occur? Conversely, why not assume that “malice” requires only a careless <i>failure to realize</i> that harm might occur, rather than actual awareness of the risk?</p>
<p id="768f58f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Specific intent and general intent.</i> Two terms often used to describe mens rea are the concepts of “specific intent” and “general intent.” Unfortunately, these terms have been the source of endless confusion in the courts because they are often used inconsistently or in misleading ways. This Note explains how the terms have been used and provides examples, but unfortunately confusion will inevitably remain because there are no uniform or prevailing definitions.</p>
<p id="768f58f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> The least mysterious and most common usage of “specific intent” is to identify those actions that must be done with some specified further purpose in mind. For example, burglary requires (roughly) that a person break and enter a structure with the further objective of committing a felony inside. Without proof of that further objective, there can be no conviction for burglary. It is not enough for the person to knowingly or purposefully do the act itself—the breaking and entering. That latter state of mind is what is often meant by general intent—the intent to do an act without any further purpose <span title="265" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-265">p. 265</span>in mind. It is therefore common to describe burglary as a “specific intent crime”; the description is accurate in the sense that conviction for burglary requires proof of that further (“specific”) purpose to commit a felony inside the building. Similarly, assault with intent to kill requires (roughly) that a person commit a battery upon another with the specific further purpose of killing that person. Without proof of that further purpose, a case of assault with intent to kill must fail. Accordingly, it is likewise common to describe assault with intent to kill as a “specific intent crime.”</p>
<p id="768f58f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">May the person in the above examples be convicted of some other crime, even without proof of the specified further intention? Yes. He can be convicted of a crime that requires only a “general” intent. But what is that? “General” intent in this context usually means that the defendant can be convicted if he did what in ordinary speech we would call a voluntary action. So in the first example, the actor who broke into a building would be guilty of trespass, a general intent crime; so long as he acted intentionally, in the sense that he knew the nature of the acts he performed, he would be guilty, without proof that he desired any particular further consequence. Similarly, in the second example, the actor would be guilty of simple battery, a general intent crime, regardless of whether he desired any further consequence to follow from his conduct.</p>
<p id="768f58f7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Things get more complicated by the fact that there is another usage of specific intent, which is to describe a crime that requires the defendant to have actual knowledge (that is, subjective awareness) of some particular fact or circumstance in addition to knowledge of his or her conduct. Take the crime of bigamy, which prohibits a married person from remarrying while still legally married to his or her spouse. One element of the offense relates to the defendant’s <i>conduct</i> (the act of marrying) and another relates to what is often known as an <i>attendant circumstance</i>—that is, a background fact (being married to another person) that is crucial for determining whether that conduct is harmful. In order to convict a defendant for bigamy, his <i>conduct</i> undoubtedly must be intentional; he must intend to be participating in a genuine marriage ceremony. A defendant who said, “I do,” thinking that he was in a play, acting the part of a groom, would not intend the required conduct, and even if he were already married to another, he obviously would not be guilty of bigamy.</p>
<p id="768f58f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But when a defendant does intend the conduct (the act of marrying), must it also be shown he knew that the required attendant circumstance (the fact of still being married to another) was met at the time? This question can arise when the first spouse has been absent for several years and is assumed (perhaps incorrectly) to be dead, or when the defendant has obtained a divorce decree and assumes (perhaps incorrectly) that the decree is legally effective. Should the offense of bigamy require proof that the defendant <i>knew</i> his first wife was still alive or that his first marriage was still legally in effect? It’s quite clear in bigamy that the <i>conduct</i> element must be committed intentionally; no one would suggest otherwise. But with respect to the <i>attendant circumstance</i> element, different answers are possible. If a particular jurisdiction does not <span title="266" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-266">p. 266</span>require proof that the defendant knew he was still married to another, we would say that bigamy is a general intent crime. In this context, in other words, a “general intent” crime is one for which the awareness of the attendant circumstance need not be proved; some lesser mental state—perhaps recklessness or negligence—will suffice. In contrast, if a jurisdiction requires proof that the defendant knew he was still legally married to another, then we would say that bigamy is a “specific intent” crime; in that state, bigamy would not only require proof of an intent to engage in specified conduct, but would also require proof of actual awareness of the specified attendant circumstances.</p>
<p id="768f58f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the discussion so far, it has been possible to give clear meaning to the terms “specific” and “general” intent, because we have focused on an offense—bigamy—that has only one conduct element and one attendant circumstance element. But most offenses require proof of many elements. Burglary, for example, traditionally was defined at common law as the (1) breaking and entering (2) of a dwelling place (3) of another person (4) in the nighttime (5) with intent to commit a felony inside. Burglary is customarily labeled a specific intent crime, because it requires proof of specified conduct committed with some further intent. But in this case there are three attendant circumstance elements, and a defendant might be unaware of any or all of them. He might think he was entering a building not used as a dwelling, he might think the building was his own home, or he might not realize that it was nighttime. As to any or all of these, a jurisdiction might decide to permit conviction without proof that the defendant was aware of the specified facts. Courts and legislatures need to consider whether they <i>should</i> permit conviction without proof that the defendant was aware of particular attendant circumstances, and we will examine that question, in different contexts, throughout this chapter. But whatever the best answer to that question for various elements of various crimes, it is clearly a question of policy that turns on the particulars of specific offenses. Courts could not wisely answer it—and virtually none do—by simply invoking the observation that “burglary is a specific intent crime.”</p>
<p id="768f58fa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Proving awareness and intent, and the use of presumptions.</i> Most forms of mens rea involve a defendant’s internal thoughts and perceptions. It is straightforward for a prosecutor to prove a defendant’s acts (through eyewitnesses, for example). But how can she prove what was in the defendant’s mind when he was acting? Unless the defendant admits the crucial mental facts, the prosecutor must prove mens rea indirectly, through so-called circumstantial evidence and the inferences one can draw from it. For example, a larceny charge requires the prosecution to prove not only that a defendant took the personal property of another, but that he or she did so with the intent to permanently deprive the other person of that property. If a defendant takes the victim’s jewelry and sells it, the prosecutor can argue persuasively that the defendant had the intent to deprive the victim of the jewelry permanently because the sale of the jewelry makes it highly unlikely there was a plan to give <span title="267" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-267">p. 267</span>it back. But if the defendant took the victim’s jewelry and still had it when caught, the defendant might claim that he or she intended to give the jewelry back and was only borrowing it. In that case, the jury will have to decide whether the government proved the intent to permanently deprive beyond a reasonable doubt. The difficulty of proving what was in the defendant’s mind, and proving it beyond a reasonable doubt, is one reason why prosecutors may argue that certain mental facts should not have to be proved at all.</p>
<p id="768f58fb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an offense does include awareness or intent as one of its elements, the process of proving it is often facilitated by resort to various kinds of presumptions. For example, it is often said that a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts; if Arthur aims a pistol at Barry’s head and fires six times, it is reasonable to assume that Arthur intended to kill Barry. But a presumption of this sort becomes troublesome if, for example, Arthur fired only once, without making obvious efforts to aim. To assume that Arthur must have intended to kill in that situation would dilute the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and shift to the defendant the burden of explaining his actions. For that reason, the Supreme Court has imposed strict limits on the use of mandatory presumptions—those the jury is <i>required</i> to draw in the absence of contrary evidence.</p>
<p id="768f58fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We explored at pp. 52-53 supra the standard for determining when a mandatory presumption is constitutionally permissible. In a nutshell, presumptions are constitutional only when we can have confidence that over all criminal cases in general, the presumed fact will always be present when the fact used to trigger that presumption is present. In Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 312 (1985), the Supreme Court applied this test to the old and then widely used presumption that “[a] person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.” Because this presumption does not hold true in all cases, the Court held the use of this traditional presumption unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="768f58fd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, the Constitution allows more flexibility in the use of <i>permissive inferences</i>, in which the judge informs the jury about a factual conclusion that it is permitted but not required to draw. Permissive inferences are allowed whenever the conclusion is “more likely than not” to be true under the circumstances of the particular case. Thus, in Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld the use of an inference commonly used to help establish knowledge—the inference that “[p]ossession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, is ordinarily a circumstance from which [the jury may infer] that the person in possession knew that the property had been stolen.”</p>
<p id="768f58fe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Negligence.</i> Another response to the difficulty of establishing internal thoughts and perceptions is to eliminate any requirement of proving that sort of subjective mens rea and instead only to require proof that the defendant was <i>negligent</i>, which is an objective standard that uses what a reasonable person would realize as a replacement for a standard that requires a finding about what the particular defendant realized. That form of culpability is <span title="268" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-268">p. 268</span>particularly important in homicide cases, where cases attempting to define “negligence” have developed a distinctive body of doctrine, which we examine at pp. 490-509 infra. But “negligence” is also designated as the required form of mens rea for some crimes outside the homicide context. Like other traditional common-law terms, it lacks precision, and courts often disagree about what it means. Some interpret it to require nothing more than ordinary carelessness. E.g., United States v. Ortiz, 427 F.3d 1278 (10th Cir. 2005). Others hold that negligence requires a “gross” departure from normal standards of care. E.g., State v. Chavez, 211 P.3d 891 (N.M. 2009). Consider the following cases.</p>

This standard is met only when the risk is “of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.” In essence, then, the criminal negligence standard requires the jury to find negligence so gross as to <span title="269" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-269">p. 269</span>merit not just damages but also punishment. It does not spill over into recklessness; there is still no requirement that the defendant actually be aware of the risk of harm.

What factors should guide that decision? Justice Alito suggests that the default should be recklessness when a statute is silent, thus eliminating any further inquiry. Does that one-size-fits-all default rule represent the best guide to statutory interpretation? Should the severity of the authorized punishment matter? What about the typical mens rea for analogous crimes? Recall that in <i>Cunningham</i>, p. 260 supra, the court held that a statutory requirement of “malice” could be satisfied by recklessness. If a statute requiring “malice” can be met by recklessness, why should a court require more in a statute that expressly identifies no mens rea at all?

<p id="768ff567-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Responding to the problems posed by common-law mens rea terminology, the MPC proposed a fresh approach that has been extremely influential. The Code’s mens rea framework has been adopted explicitly in more than half of American jurisdictions, and it often influences judicial interpretation in the remaining jurisdictions as well. The older framework for mens rea analysis survives, however, and indeed it remains dominant in a number of jurisdictions. Common-law terms are used in many state penal codes and in the increasingly significant field of federal criminal law. The requirement of a “willful” mens rea, for example, persists in many important federal crimes. One study finds that “courts, legislatures, and scholars [continue to use] meaningless mens rea terms such as ‘willful’; to employ the simplistic but ineffective distinction between specific- and general-intent crimes; [and] to fail to see that mens rea questions are element-specific.” Michael L. Seigel, Bringing Coherence to Mens Rea Analysis for Securities-Related Offenses, 2006 Wis. L. Rev. 1563, 1564. It is therefore important to emphasize that this older approach remains very much in play and must be learned as well, despite the success of the more modern MPC framework, which we now examine.</p>
<p id="768ff568-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC attempts to mitigate the difficulties of mens rea analysis through three distinct tools—manageable categories, precise definitions, and convenient default rules. First, the Code eliminates the use of general intent, specific intent, and other ambiguous common-law terms, replacing the ten-plus <span title="273" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-273">p. 273</span>varieties of common-law mens rea with just four mental states—purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence. Second, the Code provides a relatively clear, rigorous definition for each of its four mens rea terms. Third, the Code provides rules of interpretation (default rules) to enable courts to determine the required mental state sensibly and predictably when the statutory language concerning mens rea is silent, ambiguous, or contradictory.</p>

The Code provision on rape will afford an illustration. Under Section 213.1(1), a purpose to effect the sexual relation is clearly required. But other circumstances are also made relevant by the definition of the offense. The victim[’s] consent to sexual relations would, of course, preclude the crime. Must the defendant’s purpose have encompassed the [fact that] she opposed his will? [This is an] entirely different [question]. Recklessness may be sufficient for [this circumstance] of the offense, although purpose is required with respect to the sexual result that is an element of the offense. . . . Failure to face the question of culpability separately with respect to each of these ingredients of the offense results in obvious confusion. . . .

It is meaningful to think of the actor’s attitude as different if he is simply aware that his conduct is of the required nature or that the prohibited result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.</p><p id="76901c87-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true, of course, that this distinction is inconsequential for most purposes of liability: acting knowingly is ordinarily sufficient. But there are areas where the discrimination is required and is made under traditional law, which uses the awkward concept of “specific intent.” [I]n attempts, complicity and conspiracy, [for example,] a true purpose to effect the criminal result is requisite for liability. . . . 
</p><p id="76901c88-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. <i>Recklessness.</i> An important discrimination is drawn between acting either purposely or knowingly and acting recklessly. As the Code uses the term, recklessness involves conscious risk creation. It resembles acting knowingly in that a state of awareness is involved, but the awareness is of risk, that is of a probability less than substantial certainty; the matter is contingent from the actor’s point of view. Whether the risk relates to the nature of the actor’s conduct, or to the existence of the requisite attendant circumstances, or to the result that may ensue, is immaterial; the concept is the same, and is thus defined to apply to any material element.</p><p id="76901c89-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="275" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-275">p. 275</span>The risk of which the actor is aware must of course be substantial in order for the recklessness judgment to be made. The risk must also be unjustifiable. Even substantial risks, it is clear, may be created without recklessness when the actor is seeking to serve a proper purpose, as when a surgeon performs an operation that he knows is very likely to be fatal but reasonably thinks to be necessary because the patient has no other, safer chance. Some principle must, therefore, be articulated to indicate the nature of the final judgment to be made after everything has been weighed. Describing the risk as “substantial” and “unjustifiable” is useful but not sufficient, for these are terms of degree, and the acceptability of a risk in a given case depends on a great many variables. Some standard is needed for determining <i>how</i> substantial and <i>how</i> unjustifiable the risk must be in order to warrant a finding of culpability. There is no way to state this value judgment that does not beg the question in the last analysis; the point is that the jury must evaluate the actor’s conduct and determine whether it should be condemned. . . . 
</p><p id="76901c8a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">4. <i>Negligence.</i> The fourth kind of culpability is negligence. It is distinguished from purposeful, knowing or reckless action in that it does not involve a state of awareness. A person acts negligently under this subsection when he inadvertently creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of which he ought to be aware. He is liable if given the nature and degree of the risk, his failure to perceive it is, considering the nature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the circumstances known to him, a gross deviation from the care that would be exercised by a reasonable person in his situation. As in the case of recklessness, both the substantiality of the risk and the elements of justification in the situation form the relevant standards of judgment. And again it is quite impossible to avoid tautological articulation of the final question. . . . The jury must find fault, and must find that it was substantial and unjustified; that is the heart of what can be said in legislative terms. . . .

This accepts as the basic norm what usually is regarded as the common law position. More importantly, it represents the most convenient norm for drafting purposes. When purpose or knowledge is required, it is conventional to be explicit. And since negligence is an exceptional basis of liability, it should be excluded as a basis unless explicitly prescribed. . . .

<i>1. The basic framework.</i> In order to determine the mens rea required for conviction in any situation, the MPC analysis involves two steps. First, we must determine the “material elements” of an offense. The criteria for making this determination are found in MPC §1.13(9), which defines an “element,” and in §1.13(10), which specifies when an element is “material.” Second, we must determine which type of mens rea (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence) is required with respect to each material element. This determination is governed in the first instance by the terms of the offense itself, and then, in the event those terms are ambiguous, by the default rules of MPC §2.02(3) and §2.02(4).</p>

<i>2. Exercises.</i> Four illustrative state crimes are set forth below. To become familiar with mens rea analysis, consider how the required mens rea would be identified by a court applying MPC principles. What are the “material elements” of each offense? Does the statute itself make clear the state of mind specifically required with respect to a particular material element? If not, what level of mens rea is required by the applicable MPC default rule?</p>

<i>3. Distinguishing between purpose (or intention) and motive.</i> Does an actor’s motive differ from the MPC concept of his “purpose”? Consider Glanville Williams, The Mental Element in Crime 10, 14 (1965). The author defines intention in terms of desiring a consequence: “A consequence is intended when it is desired to follow as the result of the actor’s conduct.” He then cautions:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76906ac3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he consequence need not be desired as an end in itself; it may be desired as a means to another end. . . . There may be a series of ends, each a link in a chain of purpose. Every link in the chain, when it happens, is an intended consequence of the original act. Suppose that a burglar is arrested when breaking into premises. It would obviously be no defence for him to say that his sole intention was to provide a nurse for his sick daughter, and for that purpose to take money from the premises, but that he had no desire or intention to deprive anyone of anything. Such an argument would be fatuous. He intended (1) to steal money (2) in order to help his daughter. These are two intentions, and the one does not displace the other. English lawyers call the first an “intent” and the second a “motive”; this is because the first (the intent to steal) enters into the definition of burglary and is legally relevant, while the second (the motive of helping the daughter) is legally irrelevant, except perhaps in relation to sentence. Although the verbal distinction between “intention” and “motive” is convenient, it must be realized that the remoter intention called motive is still an intention.</p>

<i>4. Distinguishing between a purpose and a wish.</i> Suppose that a person gives an airline ticket to a hated aunt, hoping that the plane will crash and kill her. If the crash occurs, causing the aunt’s death, has the nephew killed her purposely? Would the answer depend on whether:</p>

<i>5. Distinguishing recklessness from negligence.</i> The MPC distinguishes two kinds of culpable unintentional actions, those that are reckless and those that are negligent. Negligence is less culpable because the actor acts only inadvertently; the actor should have been aware of the danger, but was not. The fault is inattentiveness when a reasonable person would have been attentive. Recklessness is more culpable because the actor was subjectively aware of the danger but acted anyway. The fault is choosing to run the risk.</p>
<p id="769091da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So the crucial factor distinguishing these levels of culpability is awareness. But awareness of precisely what? The MPC requires for reckless conduct that the person “consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk” that some circumstance exists or that some result will follow from his conduct. Does this mean that the actor must be aware (1) that there is a risk, (2) that the risk is substantial, <i>and</i> (3) that the risk is unjustifiable? Or does it mean only that the actor must be aware that there is some risk, which the jury finds to be substantial and unjustifiable, even if the defendant did not know that the risk was substantial or thought it was justified? Could recklessness mean that the actor must be aware that there is a substantial risk, but that the question of whether the risk is justifiable is left to the jury?</p>
<p id="769091db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Grammatically, the MPC appears to require conscious awareness as to all three of the crucial factors. But is this interpretation tenable in practice? Most courts leave the question of whether a risk is <i>justifiable</i> to the jury and do not require the government to show that the defendant was aware of the fact that the risk was unjustifiable. What about the question whether the defendant must be aware that the risk was <i>substantial</i>? Consider State v. Muniz, 2011 WL 96320 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011). The defendant fired a .22 caliber rifle at a backyard chair in a neighbor’s yard where several children were playing. His friends urged him not to shoot because he might miss and hit one of the kids, but Muniz, confident of his marksmanship, fired anyway. He hit one of the children in the head, inflicting severe physical and cognitive injuries. He was convicted of endangerment of a minor and aggravated assault, both requiring proof of recklessness with respect to causing physical injury. The defendant was clearly negligent, but was he reckless? Consider Glanville Williams, The Unresolved Problem of Recklessness, 8 Legal Stud. 74, 77 (1988):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="769091dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The subjective] theory [of recklessness] has to deal with the awkward customer who undertook a course of conduct that he knew would involve serious risks if performed by someone not highly skilled, but thought that he himself possessed sufficient skill to eliminate danger. [T]ake <i>Shimmen</i>’s case [84 Cr. App. R. 7 (1986)]. The defendant, who held a green belt and yellow belt in the Korean art of self-defence, was demonstrating his skill to his friends. To do this, he made as if to strike a plate-glass window with his foot; however, his kick broke the window. A Divisional Court held that he was guilty of criminal damage by recklessness, since he “was aware of the kind of risk which would attend his act if he did not take adequate precautions,” even though he believed he had taken enough precautions to eliminate or minimise risk. . . .

<p id="769091dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="279" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-279">p. 279</span>On subjective principles the court was wrong in saying that a person who believes he has taken enough precautions to eliminate risk is to be held guilty of recklessness merely because he perceived a risk before taking the precautions. If Shimmen thought he had eliminated risk, he was not subjectively reckless, but the court might have remitted the case to the magistrates with an instruction to decide whether [Shimmen] thought he had eliminated or merely mitigated the risk. This was a case where the defendant needed to be cross-examined. “Would you have kicked with such force towards your girl friend’s or wife’s or your baby’s head, relying on your ability to stop within an inch of it? No? Then you knew that there was some risk of your boot travelling further than you intended.” A person may be convinced of his own skill, and yet know that on rare (perhaps very rare) occasions it may fail him. In the case at bar, the victim, the owner of the window, did not agree to the demonstration of skill. [T]he actor has no right to impose any foreseen risk on him, beyond those associated with the ordinary business of life. He could be given a hot time in the witness-box if he says that in his opinion there was literally no risk.</p>

<i>Question:</i> Would this basis for finding recklessness in the <i>Shimmen</i> case be possible under the MPC’s definition of recklessness? For careful analysis of the alternative ways of interpreting the MPC concept of recklessness, see Kenneth W. Simons, Should the Model Penal Code’s Mens Rea Provisions Be Amended?, 1 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 179 (2003); David Trieman, Recklessness and the Model Penal Code, 9 Am. J. Crim. L. 283, 361-371 (1981).</p>
<p id="769091df-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A more common problem is illustrated by a case arising from the death of Morgan Pena, a two-year-old child killed by a driver who was distracted while using his cell phone. See Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, Opaque Recklessness, 91 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 597, 600 (2001). The driver surely recognized that there was some risk involved in driving while attempting to dial a number on his phone, and he may not have considered himself exceptionally skillful. But the driver nonetheless apparently failed to appreciate the full extent of the danger his conduct created. He was cited for careless driving and running a stop sign, but he was not charged with a more serious offense because the police determined that he was not reckless. Is the outcome defensible? Conduct of this sort, which Professor Ferzan labels “opaque recklessness” (awareness of some risk but failure to appreciate how substantial it was), is probably a regular feature of dangerous behavior, and it arguably lies somewhere between the MPC notions of recklessness and negligence. Professor Ferzan argues (supra, at 627-641) that the culpability of such actors is too serious to escape criminal sanctions. But if the risk that the actor personally appreciates is trivially small, how can the actor be charged with <i>subjective</i> culpability rather than mere negligence? For discussion, see Larry Alexander, Insufficient Concern: A Unified Conception of Criminal Culpability, 88 Cal. L. Rev. 931 (2000); Kenneth W. Simons, Rethinking Mental States, 72 B.U. L. Rev. 463 (1992).</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">KENNEDY</span>, J., dissenting. . . . In light of the Model Penal Code’s definition, the “conscious purpose” jury instruction is defective in three respects. First, it fails to mention the requirement that Jewell have been aware of a high probability that a controlled substance was in the car. It is not culpable to form “a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth” unless one is aware of facts indicating a high probability of that truth. To illustrate, a child given a gift-wrapped package by his mother while on vacation in Mexico may form a conscious purpose to take it home without learning what is inside; yet his state of mind is totally innocent unless he is aware of a high probability that the package contains a controlled substance.</p>
<p id="7690b907-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Second, the instruction] did not alert the jury that Jewell could not be convicted if he “actually believed” there was no controlled substance in the car. The failure to emphasize, as does the Model Penal Code, that subjective belief is the determinative factor, may allow a jury to convict on an objective theory of knowledge—that a reasonable man should have inspected the car and would have discovered what was hidden inside. . . . Third, the jury instruction clearly states that Jewell could have been convicted even if . . . “not actually aware” that the car contained a controlled substance. [T]rue ignorance, no matter how unreasonable, cannot provide a basis for criminal liability when the statute requires knowledge. A proper jury instruction based on the Model Penal Code would be presented as a way of defining knowledge, and not as an alternative to it. . . .

<i>1. Common applications.</i> In both federal and state cases, willful blindness or “ostrich” instructions are often used to help establish “knowledge”—not only in drug prosecutions but also in cases involving mail fraud, money laundering, environmental pollution, and a variety of other common-law and regulatory offenses. See United States v. Alston-Graves, 435 F.3d 331, 338 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Williamson v. State, 685 S.E.2d 784 (Ga. Ct. App. 2009). It has also been used in insider trading cases. For example, in United States v. Goffer, 721 F.3d 113, 127 (2d Cir. 2013), a person who had inside information informed the defendant that the defendant was “better off not knowing where [his tips] were coming from” because then if the government were to investigate, he could say “I don’t freakin’ know where it came from.” The insider-trading offense required proof that the defendant knew his information came from an insider, and the court upheld a conviction after the jury had been instructed that it could find such knowledge on a conscious avoidance theory. Some have argued that prosecutors should have made greater use of willful blindness theories against high-level financial executives responsible for the financial crisis of 2008. Jed S. Rakoff, The Financial Crisis: Why Have No High-Level Executives Been Prosecuted?, N.Y. Rev. Books, Jan. 9, 2014.</p>

<i>2. The federal standard.</i> With respect to federal prosecutions, the Supreme Court addressed the problem of willful blindness in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754 (2011). This was a civil suit requiring proof of a knowing patent infringement, but the Court discussed the issue in terms that apply to civil and criminal cases generally. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for eight justices, said (id. at 768-769):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7690e01c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Given the long history of willful blindness [in criminal law], we can see no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits. . . . While the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of willful blindness in slightly different ways, all appear to agree on two basic requirements: (1) the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and (2) the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact. We think these requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence. [A] willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing. . . . By contrast, a reckless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, see ALI, Model Penal Code §2.02(2)(c) (1985), and a negligent defendant is one who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact, did not, see §2.02(2)(d).</p>

<p id="7690e01d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Justice Kennedy, dissenting, reiterated the concerns he had expressed as a court of appeals judge in <i>Jewell</i> (id. at 772-773):</p>

<p id="7690e01e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Willful blindness is not knowledge; and judges should not broaden a legislative proscription by analogy. . . . One can believe that there is a “high probability” that acts might infringe a patent but nonetheless conclude they do not infringe. The [person] who believes a device is noninfringing cannot be said to know otherwise.</p>
<p id="7690e01f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court justifies its substitution of willful blindness for the statutory knowledge requirement . . . by citing the “traditional rationale” that willfully blind defendants “are just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.” But the moral question is a difficult one. Is it true that the lawyer who knowingly suborns perjury is no more culpable than the lawyer who avoids learning that his client, a criminal defendant, lies when he testifies that he was not the shooter? See Hellman, Willfully Blind for Good Reason, 3 Crim. L. &amp; Philosophy 301, 305-308 (2009); Luban, Contrived Ignorance, 87 Geo. L.J. 957 (1999). The answer is not obvious. Perhaps the culpability of willful blindness depends on a person’s reasons for remaining blind. Or perhaps only the person’s justification for his conduct is relevant. <i>E.g.</i>, [L. Alexander &amp; K. Ferzan, Crime and Culpability: A Theory of Criminal Law (2009)] at 23-68. This is a question of morality and of policy best left to the political branches. . . .

<i>3. Civil applications.</i> <i>Global-Tech</i> was a civil patent law case, but the Supreme Court saw no reason why the criminal law concept of willful blindness should not also apply in that civil proceeding. The law in other civil contexts also borrows from criminal willful blindness law, and willful blindness theory has proved particularly fruitful for plaintiffs in civil suits against lawyers, accountants, and investment advisors where “[t]heir education, training, and experience all militate in favor of the jury’s finding that the <span title="284" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-284">p. 284</span>defendant professionals well understood what was going on.” John P.

<i>4. Recklessness plus what?</i> Exactly what is the extra element needed to convert mere recklessness into the state of mind sufficient to meet a knowledge requirement? In <i>Global-Tech</i>, the Supreme Court says a defendant “must take deliberate actions to avoid learning [the truth].” Note that this prerequisite is not expressly required under Model Penal Code §2.02(7). Should it be? Consider the following problems:</p>
<p id="7690e022-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Acts versus omissions.</i> Did Jewell “take deliberate actions” to avoid learning the truth? Note that in order to actually “know” what he was transporting, Jewell apparently would have had to dismantle the secret compartment in which the drugs were hidden. If so, his liability resulted not from “shutting his eyes” but rather from his failure to actively investigate. Under the <i>Global-Tech</i> standard, should Jewell’s conviction have been reversed? Or can “deliberate actions” include what the Seventh Circuit described as “a mental, as well as a physical, effort—a cutting off of one’s normal curiosity by an effort of will”?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11CDD_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11CDD_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">15</a></span> If so, when does a mere failure to investigate become a “cutting off of one’s normal curiosity”?</p>

Rev. 953 (1998); Robin Charlow, Willful Ignorance and Criminal Culpability, 70 Tex. L. Rev. 1351 (1992).</p>

Defendant Janis was convicted of aiding and abetting a gambling operation by renting his house to some gamblers, “knowing” that the lessees would use it for gambling. There was no direct evidence of Janis’s knowledge, but knowing that his lessees were professional gamblers, he made no inquiries about their intended use of the house. The court (per Posner, J.) reversed the conviction, holding that it was error to give an “ostrich” instruction under these circumstances (id. at 1228-1229):</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Is the decision analytically sound? If so, does the result suggest that defendants like Janis should not be convicted, or does it suggest that the statutory mens rea requirement should be relaxed?

<i>(b) Motive.</i> In United States v. Heredia, 483 F.3d 913 (9th Cir. 2007), the defendant was caught driving her mother from Nogales, Mexico, to Tucson, Arizona, with 349 pounds of marijuana in the trunk of the car, which she had borrowed from an aunt. Charged with knowing possession of a controlled substance, she admitted that she had noticed a “detergent” smell in the car and did not believe her aunt’s explanation for it (that “fabric softener” had spilled in the vehicle). She testified that she suspected there might be drugs in the car, because her mother was visibly nervous during the trip. But she claimed that her suspicions were not aroused until she had passed the last freeway exit before the checkpoint, by which time it was too dangerous to pull over and investigate. The judge instructed the jury that they could find the defendant guilty if she was aware of a high probability that drugs were in the vehicle and “deliberately avoided learning the truth.” The court of appeals upheld the conviction, stating (483 F.3d at 918-920):</p>

<i>5. Deliberate avoidance and high probability as distinct issues.</i> Consider the distinction drawn by David Luban between deliberate avoidance and the probability of a certain fact, in Contrived Ignorance, 87 Geo. L.J. 957, 962 (1999):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76910742-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The focus in a willful ignorance case is on whether the actor deliberately avoided guilty knowledge. The inquiry is about whatever steps the actor took to ward off knowledge prior to the misdeed. The focus in the Model Penal Code, by contrast, is on how certain the actor is about a fact. The inquiry is about the actor’s subjective state at the moment of the misdeed. These are completely different issues. An actor can be aware of the high probability of a fact whether or not she took steps to avoid knowing it, and an actor can screen herself from knowledge of facts regardless of whether their probability is high or low. . . . Douglas Husak and Craig Callender illustrate the latter with a nice pair of examples [Willful Ignorance, Knowledge, and the “Equal Culpability” Thesis, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 29, 37-38]. Suppose that a dope distributor tells each of his three couriers never to look in the suitcase he gives to each one, adding that it isn’t necessary for them to know what the suitcases contain. If the suitcases contain dope, the case is plainly one of willful ignorance. But now suppose that the distributor adds that two of the three suitcases contain nothing but clothing, that he is truthful, and that the distributors know he is truthful. If the couriers deliver the suitcases without looking inside and without asking any questions, the case seems indistinguishable from the first case. It is still willful ignorance. But in the second case, the courier with dope in his suitcase lacks awareness of the high probability that it <span title="287" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-287">p. 287</span>contains dope. Indeed, he knows that the probability is one-third. He may even believe that his suitcase contains nothing but clothes. Thus, in the language of the Model Penal Code §2.02(7), he not only lacks awareness of a high probability of the fact’s existence, “he actually believes that it does not exist.”</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BRAMWELL</span>, B. [Finding that to sustain the defendant’s position it would be necessary to read into the statute language requiring the prosecution to prove that the accused did not believe the girl he had taken was over the age of 16, the opinion continues:] These words are not there, and the question is, whether we are bound to construe the statute as though they were, on account of the rule that the mens rea is necessary to make an act a crime. I am of opinion that we are not, . . . and for the following reasons: The act forbidden is wrong in itself, if without lawful cause; I do not say illegal, but wrong. [W]hat the statute contemplates, and what I say is wrong, is the taking of a female of such tender years that she is properly called a <i>girl</i>, can be said to be in another’s <i>possession,</i> and in that other’s <i>care or charge.</i> No argument is necessary to prove this; it is enough to state the case. The legislature has enacted that if anyone does this wrong act, he does it at the risk of her turning out to be under sixteen. This opinion gives full scope to the doctrine of the mens rea. If the taker believed he had the father’s consent, though wrongly, he would have no mens rea; so if he did not know she was in anyone’s possession, nor in the care or charge of anyone. In those cases he would not know he was doing the <i>act</i> forbidden by the statute—an act which, if he knew she was in possession and in care or charge of anyone, he would know was a crime or not, according as she was under sixteen or not. He would not know he was doing an act wrong in itself, whatever was his intention, if done without lawful cause. The same principle applies in other cases. A man was held liable for <span title="288" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-288">p. 288</span>assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, though he did not know he was a police officer. Why? Because the act was wrong in itself. So, also, in the case of burglary, could a person charged claim an acquittal on the ground that he believed it was past six when he entered, or in housebreaking, that he did not know the place broken into was a house? It seems to me impossible to say that where a person takes a girl out of her father’s possession, not knowing whether she is or is not under sixteen, that he is not guilty; and equally impossible when he believes, but erroneously, that she is old enough for him to do a wrong act with safety. I think the conviction should be affirmed.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BRETT</span>, J., [dissenting]. [I]f the facts had been as the prisoner, according to the findings of the jury, believed them to be, and had reasonable ground for believing them to be, he would have done no act which has ever been a criminal offence in England; he would have done no act in respect of which any civil action could have ever been maintained against him; he would have done no act for which, if done in the absence of the father, and done with the continuing consent of the girl, the father could have had any legal remedy. . . . Upon all the cases I think it is proved that there can be no conviction for crime in England in the absence of a criminal mind or mens rea. Then comes the question, what is the true meaning of the phrase. I do not doubt that it exists where the prisoner knowingly does acts which would constitute a crime if the result were as he anticipated, but in which the result may not improbably end by bringing the offence within a more serious class of crime. As if a man strikes with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and kills, the result makes the crime murder. The prisoner has run the risk. So, if a prisoner do the prohibited acts, without caring to consider what the truth is as to facts—as if a prisoner were to abduct a girl under sixteen without caring to consider whether she was in truth under sixteen—he runs the risk. So if he without abduction defiles a girl who is in fact under ten years old, with a belief that she is between ten and twelve. If the facts were as he believed he would be committing the lesser crime. Then he runs the risk of his crime resulting in the greater crime. It is clear that ignorance of the law does not excuse. It seems to me to follow that the maxim as to mens rea applies whenever the facts which are present in the prisoner’s mind, and which he has reasonable ground to believe, and does believe to be the facts, would, if true, make his acts no criminal offence at all. I come to the conclusion that a mistake of facts, on reasonable grounds, to the extent that if the facts were as believed the acts of the prisoner would make him guilty of no criminal offence at all, is an excuse and that such excuse is implied in every criminal charge and every criminal enactment in England.</p>

<i>1. The rationale of</i> Prince. In <i>Prince</i>, the defendant claimed to have made a mistake in an especially sensitive area: The offense implicitly targeted sexual conduct, and the alleged mistake related to Annie Phillips’s age. We might <span title="289" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-289">p. 289</span>therefore think that the result rests on a narrow ground—that a mistake, even when reasonable, should not be a defense when it relates to the age of a minor in a sexual offense. Is the court’s opinion limited in that way, or is its analysis relevant to mistakes of fact more generally? Notice that near the end of its opinion the court states that “[t]he same principle” that precludes a defense for Prince also applies to mistakes of fact in offenses like burglary and assaulting a police officer. What is that principle?</p>
<p id="76912e61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Prince</i> has long been considered a landmark in common-law mens rea analysis. The statute in <i>Prince,</i> like many criminal statutes that courts need to address today, contained no mens rea terms, so the court was left to determine what mens rea applied and to which elements of the crime. In the framework that the <i>Prince</i> court adopts, what are the circumstances under which a mistake of fact can or cannot be raised as a defense?</p>
<p id="76912e62-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The moral-wrong principle.</i> The court in <i>Prince</i> insists that “[our] opinion gives full scope to the doctrine of mens rea.” But if the defendant made a reasonable mistake, how can it be said that he had any mens rea? Consider Peter Brett, An Inquiry into Criminal Guilt 149 (1963):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76912e63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The opinion] of Bramwell, B. is to my mind clearly in accord with principle. It reflects the view that we learn our duties, not by studying the statute book, but by living in a community. A defense of mistake rests ultimately on the defendant’s being able to say that he has observed the community ethic, and this Prince could not do.</p>

<p id="76912e64-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">But Professor Brett is an exception. Most of the academic commentary has been highly critical of <i>Prince.</i> See, e.g., George Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law 727 (1978). Consider Graham Hughes’s response to Peter Brett in Criminal Responsibility, 16 Stan. L. Rev. 470, 480-481 (1964):</p>

<p id="76912e65-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]his appears as an appallingly dangerous position which comes close to giving the jury a discretion to create new crimes. In <i>Prince</i> what the accused was doing that he knew to be wrong was presumably to take away a young girl from the possession of her parents without their consent. Let us vary the position slightly and assume that the charge is one of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under sixteen. The accused reasonably believed that the girl was over sixteen. Should he be convicted because he knew that he was fornicating and because fornication is wrong according to the community ethic? In the first place this assumes that there is a clear community judgment about the wrongfulness of fornication, which is not so. . . . The truth is that there are many community ethics. . . . Even though ethical attitudes owe much to culture and environment, there is enough room for individual divergence to make Professor Brett’s approach a slippery one.</p>
<p id="76912e66-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the more serious objection is that there seems no reason why the community ethic concerning some conduct, even though clear, should be relevant to a determination of whether other conduct is criminal. . . . If fornication is not a crime in itself, as it is not in England, why should it become one when the defendant makes a reasonable mistake about the age of his partner?</p>

<i>3. The acoustic separation approach.</i> Professor Meir Dan-Cohen offers a different interpretation of <i>Prince.</i> In Decision Rules and Conduct Rules: On Acoustic Separation in Criminal Law, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 625, 655 (1984), he uses <i>Prince</i> as an example of how sometimes the same criminal statute may be taken as speaking to two audiences: the general public, to which it directs a conduct rule, and legal officials, to whom it directs a decision rule. The age limitation in <i>Prince</i>, Professor Dan-Cohen argues, was part of the decision rule addressed to the court, a bright line to limit judicial discretion. The statute’s conduct rule was an enactment of the moral norm against taking girls from their parents. It was as though Parliament had enacted two statutes: One, addressed to the public, said don’t take young girls from their parents; the other, addressed to officials, said don’t prosecute or convict unless the girl is under 16. Professor Dan-Cohen defends the distinction between decision rules and conduct rules as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76912e68-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[C]oncerns other than reinforcement of community morality motivate decision rules. Primary among such concerns is the need to shape, control, and constrain the power wielded by decisionmakers. To attain this aim, the rules governing official decisionmaking must be characterized by a greater degree of precision and determinacy than can normally be expected of the community’s moral precepts. Accordingly, whereas a conduct rule may be fully coextensive with the relevant moral precept, the corresponding decision rule need not be. Instead, the decision rule should define, as clearly and precisely as possible, a range of punishable conduct that is unquestionably within the bounds of the community’s relevant moral norm.</p>
</div>
<p id="76912e69-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> How can we tell whether the statute’s age limitation is merely a decision rule, as Professor Dan-Cohen claims? From the distance of more than a century, it is hard to be sure what Parliament and the <i>Prince</i> court were thinking. But notice the statement of Judge Brett in dissent: “If the facts had been as [Prince] believed them to be, . . . he would have done no act which has ever been a criminal offense in England.” If Parliament had really wanted to make it a crime to take any young girl away from her parents, why wouldn’t it have said so?</p>
<p id="76912e6a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the implications of Professor Dan-Cohen’s approach for the <i>nulla poena</i> (legality) principle examined in Section B, pp. 158-202 supra. Even if he is correct about what the relevant conduct rule was in this instance, is it a good idea to give courts the authority to decide which elements of a statutory offense establish the moral norm to which citizens must adhere? Does that approach risk too much criminalization?</p>
<p id="76912e6b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The lesser-crime principle.</i> Judge Brett, while dissenting in <i>Prince</i>, nonetheless had no doubt that when a defendant knowingly commits a crime, “he runs the risk of his crime resulting in the greater crime.” In that situation, Judge Brett agreed, the defendant cannot raise a mistake of fact as a defense. This “lesser-crime” principle is narrower than the majority’s “moral-wrong” approach. But why should a mens rea for one crime justify a conviction for a different, more serious crime? Recall the <i>Cunningham</i> case, supra <span title="291" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-291">p. 291</span>p. 260, where the court held that a defendant who was guilty of stealing a gas meter could not be convicted of the more serious offense of endangering Mrs. Wade, unless it was proved that he was aware of that danger. Is Judge Brett’s approach consistent with <i>Cunningham</i>?</p>
<p id="76912e6c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider a variation on <i>Prince.</i> Suppose that the defendant had no interest in Annie Phillips but only wanted to steal her father’s horse and carriage, which he drove away without realizing that the girl was asleep in the back seat. Under the lesser-crime principle, would he be guilty of violating the statute applied in <i>Prince</i>, or should he be allowed to present a mistake-of-fact defense? If it makes sense to allow the defendant’s claim of mistake in cases like <i>Cunningham</i> and in the situation where Prince steals the horse and carriage, why shouldn’t mistake be a defense to a housebreaking charge, when the defendant reasonably believed the building he entered was not being used as a house? Does the lesser-crime principle violate the bedrock concept of proportionality? Does it give prosecutors too much power to dictate a defendant’s sentence because it gives them discretion whether to charge only the lesser offense or the one that carries higher penalties? Does it give prosecutors too much leverage in plea bargaining? See Chapter 10.</p>
<p id="76912e6d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. The Model Penal Code approach.</i> As in its approach to mens rea issues generally, the MPC sets aside much of the traditional common-law framework. In its place the Code aims for both analytic clarity and a substantive focus on subjective culpability. With respect to the first aim, the Code emphasizes that the mens rea elements of an offense and the rules governing mistake are logically connected and cannot be addressed as separate issues. Thus, claims about mistake must be resolved by determining whether the mistake negates the mens rea required for the crime in question. With respect to the second aim, we have already seen (p. 275 supra) that the Code disfavors criminal liability in the absence of subjective fault (at least recklessness). The MPC provisions dealing with mistake carry forward this preference for subjective culpability in addressing the “lesser-crime” issue considered in Note 4 above. For these situations (for example, where a person knowingly breaks into a building but is not aware of the aggravating fact that the building is a residence), the MPC presumes that, in general, aggravating circumstances should trigger more severe penalties only when the defendant was subjectively aware of a risk that the circumstances existed. The precise statutory formulation of these principles appears in §§2.02(3), 2.04(1), and 2.04(2), which should be read carefully at this point. The thinking behind these provisions is explained as follows:</p>

Thus ignorance or mistake is a defense when it negates the existence of a state of mind that is essential to the commission of an offense, or when it establishes a state of mind that constitutes a defense under a rule of law relating to defenses. In other words, ignorance or mistake has only evidential import; it is significant whenever it is logically relevant. . . . 
</p><p id="76915582-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The critical legislative decisions, therefore, relate to the establishment of the culpability for specific offenses as they are defined in the criminal code.

</p><p id="76915583-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To put the matter as this subsection does is not to say anything that would not otherwise be true, even if no provision on the subject were made. As Glanville Williams has summarized the matter, . . . “the law could be stated equally well without reference to mistake. . . . It is impossible to assert that a crime requiring intention or recklessness can be committed although the accused laboured under a mistake negating the requisite intention or recklessness. Such an assertion carries its own refutation.” This obvious point has, however, sometimes been overlooked in general formulations purporting to require that mistake be reasonable if it is to exculpate, without regard to the mode of culpability required to commit the crime. . . . There is no justification . . . for requiring that ignorance or mistake be reasonable if the crime or the element of the crime involved requires acting purposely or knowingly. . . . Generalizations about mistake of fact . . . or about honest and reasonable mistakes as relevant to general and specific intent crimes, tend to obscure rather than clarify that simple point. . . .

On the other hand, the defendant should not go free, for on either view—the facts as they occurred or as the defendant believed them to be—a criminal offense was committed. . . .

<p id="76915588-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many states, the MPC’s mistake proposals have had a major influence on legislative revision or on case law. But elsewhere, the contrasting approach to mens rea analysis reflected in the <i>Prince</i> case continues to dominate. The “moral-wrong” and “lesser-crime” principles remain especially important in <span title="293" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-293">p. 293</span>offenses involving minors, sexual behavior, and/or drugs, but they are not limited to those contexts.</p>
<p id="76915589-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In State v. Benniefield, 678 N.W.2d 42 (Minn. 2004), the defendant was convicted of possessing drugs within 300 feet of a school. The court held that the prosecution must prove the defendant knew he was in possession of drugs, but that the defendant could be convicted of the more serious school-zone offense without any proof that he knew or should have known he was near a school. Absent statutory language to the contrary, this is the prevailing approach, and the Supreme Court gave it qualified endorsement in <i>Elonis</i>, supra p. 270. <i>Elonis</i> involved a federal statute that made it a crime to transmit “any communication containing any threat . . . to injure the person of another” but made no mention of mens rea. The Court explained (135 S. Ct. at 2010) that “[w]hen interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the required mental state, we read into the statute only the <i>mens rea</i> which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from otherwise innocent conduct.” The Court gave as an example a statute that criminalizes using force to take something of value belonging to a bank. The Court said that this statute could be satisfied by showing that a defendant used force to take money from a bank, even if he thought the money was his. In contrast, the Court noted, if the statute applied to any taking of the bank’s property, without requiring a taking by force, then the statute “would need to be read to require . . . that the defendant take the money with intent to steal,” because otherwise a person could be punished for an act that was not wrongful on the facts as he believed them to be.</p>
<p id="76917c9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This approach to mens rea issues that affect grading but not criminality remains controversial. As the MPC Commentaries above make clear, MPC §2.04(2) rejects it, and some courts do as well. In United States v. Cordoba-Hincapie, 825 F. Supp. 485 (E.D.N.Y. 1993), the defendant imported heroin into the United States but claimed she thought it was cocaine. The punishment for smuggling heroin was greater than the punishment for smuggling cocaine, and the court held that denying a defense for a mistake about the seriousness of the offense committed violates the requirement that punishment be calibrated to the degree of culpability. Consider Stephen F. Smith, Proportional Mens Rea, 46 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 127, 128 (2009):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76917c9b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Creating implied mens rea requirements, where necessary to ensure proportional punishment, is not a judicial usurpation of the legislative function. Rather, it is to take seriously the role that courts play, under both constitutional and substantive criminal law, to ensure that punishment “fits” the crime. Moreover, proportional mens rea would represent a needed counterweight to prosecutorial behavior whereas current doctrine does not. [M]ens rea doctrine aimed only at protecting moral blamelessness from punishment will largely be redundant of prosecutorial discretion. Proportionality of punishment, however, is a concern that [many prosecutors] routinely ignore. Judicial mens rea selection, therefore, has a substantial contribution to make to the achievement of proportionality of punishment.</p>

The court noted that the act of furnishing marijuana is criminal regardless of the age of the recipient and that furnishing marijuana to a minor simply yields a greater punishment than when the substance is furnished to an adult. “[A] mistake of fact relating only to the gravity of an offense will not shield a deliberate offender from the full consequences of the wrong actually committed.” (Ibid.)</p><p id="7691a3c0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

 . . . I recognize . . . that our legal system includes certain “strict liability” crimes, but generally these are confined to the so-called “regulatory” or “public welfare” offenses. . . . (Morissette v.

And “with respect to traditional crimes, it is a widely accepted normative principle that conviction should not be had without proof of fault.

 . . . No doubt the standard of what is reasonable must be set relatively high in order to accomplish the legislative objective of protecting persons under 14 years of age. . . . Perhaps it is not enough that a person “looks” to be more than 14; perhaps there is a duty of reasonable inquiry besides.

<p id="7691f0ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What “moral wrongs” or “lesser crimes” did Olsen commit? In California, as in many states, the criminality of sexual behavior turns on three factors: the age of the victim, whether force was used, and whether the sexual contact included intercourse. Under the California Penal Code, <i>forcible</i> nonconsensual sexual contact is always criminal, regardless of the victim’s age and the nature of the sexual contact. For <i>consensual</i> behavior, intercourse is criminal whenever the victim is under 18, but sexual contact short of intercourse is criminal only when the victim is under 14. According to Shawn’s version of the events, of course, Olsen’s conduct clearly met the requirements for forcible rape. But the trial judge acquitted Olsen of all the charges involving the alleged use of force. The judge found beyond a reasonable doubt only the facts necessary to convict for consensual misconduct under §288(a). See p. 295 and footnote 7, supra.</p>
<p id="7691f0ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In upholding the conviction on that charge, the California Supreme Court relied on the “lesser-crime” principle, quoting from California cases like <i>People v. Lopez</i>, p. 295 supra. But was that principle really applicable on the facts of <i>Olsen</i>? According to the trial judge’s version of the events, did Olsen’s mistake relate only to the <i>gravity</i> of the offense? What was the lesser crime, if any, that Olsen <i>knew</i> (or should have known) he was committing?</p>
<p id="7691f0ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An alternative basis for upholding Olsen’s conviction might be the controversial “moral wrong” theory. But again, was that principle applicable on the facts of <i>Olsen</i>? What were the sexual acts Olsen <i>knew</i> (or should have known) he was committing?

<span class="epub-small-caps">LORD NICHOLLS</span>: . . . As habitually happens with statutory offences, . . . Parliament defined the prohibited conduct solely in terms of the proscribed physical acts. Section 1(1) says nothing about the mental element. . . . In these circumstances the starting point for a court is the established common law presumption that a mental element, traditionally labelled mens rea, is an essential ingredient unless Parliament has indicated a contrary intention either expressly or by necessary implication. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76921808-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The existence of the presumption is beyond dispute, but in one respect the traditional formulation of the presumption calls for re-examination. [T]he presumption is expressed traditionally to the effect that an honest mistake by a defendant does not avail him unless the mistake was made on reasonable grounds. . . . The “reasonable belief” school of thought held unchallenged sway for many years. But over the last quarter of a century there have been several important cases where . . . the courts have placed new, or renewed, emphasis on the subjective nature of the mental element in criminal offences. The courts have rejected the reasonable belief approach and preferred the honest belief approach. . . . [See] R. v. Williams, [1987] 3 All ER 411, 415:</p>

</div>
<p id="7692180a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Considered as a matter of principle, the honest belief approach must be preferable. . . . To the extent that an overriding objective limit (“on reasonable <span title="299" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-299">p. 299</span>grounds”) is introduced, the subjective element is displaced. . . . When that occurs the defendant’s “fault” lies exclusively in falling short of an objective standard. His crime lies in his negligence. A statute may so provide expressly or by necessary implication. But this can have no place in a common law principle, of general application, which is concerned with the need for a mental element as an essential ingredient of a criminal offence.</p>

If a man genuinely believes that the girl with whom he is committing a grossly indecent act is over 14, he is not intending to commit such an act with a girl under 14. Whether such an intention is an essential ingredient of the offence depends upon a proper construction of [the] Act. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7692180c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In §1(1) of the 1960 Act Parliament . . . created an entirely new criminal offence, in simple unadorned language. The offence so created is a serious offence. The more serious the offence, the greater is the weight to be attached to the presumption [requiring proof of mens rea], because the more severe is the punishment and the graver the stigma which accompany a conviction. Under §1 conviction originally attracted a punishment of up to two years’ imprisonment. This has since been increased to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment. . . . The conduct may be depraved by any acceptable standard, or it may be relatively innocuous behaviour in private between two young people. These factors reinforce, rather than negative, the application of the presumption in this case. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7692180d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The purpose of the section is, of course, to protect children. . . . This factor in itself does not assist greatly. . . . There is no general agreement that strict liability is necessary to the enforcement of the law protecting children in sexual matters. . . . Is there here a compellingly clear implication that Parliament should be taken to have intended that the ordinary common law requirement of a mental element should be excluded in respect of the age ingredient of this new offence? . . . I cannot find, either in the statutory context or otherwise, any indication of sufficient cogency to displace the application of the common law presumption. In my view the necessary mental element regarding the age ingredient in §1 of the 1960 Act is the absence of a genuine belief by the accused that the victim was 14 years of age or above. The burden of proof of this rests upon the prosecution in the usual way. If Parliament considers that the position should be otherwise regarding this serious social problem, Parliament must itself confront the difficulties and express its will in clear terms. I would allow this appeal.</p>
<p id="7692180e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I add a final observation. [W]ithout expressing a view on the correctness of the actual [decision in <i>R. v.

To that extent, the reasoning must be regarded as unsound. . . . 
<i>R. v. Prince</i>, and later decisions based on it, must now be read in the light of [the present decision] on the nature and weight of the common law presumption.</p>

<p id="76923f2c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think it sufficiently clear, however, that Maryland’s second degree rape statute . . . makes no allowance for a mistake-of-age defense. The plain language of §463 . . . and the legislative history of its creation lead to this conclusion. . . . This interpretation is consistent with the traditional view of statutory rape as a strict liability crime designed to protect young persons from the dangers of sexual exploitation by adults, loss of chastity, physical injury, and, in the case of girls, pregnancy. The majority of states retain statutes which impose strict liability for sexual acts with underage complainants. [E]ven among those states providing for a mistake-of-age defense in some instances, the defense often is not available where the sex partner is 14 years old or less; the complaining witness in the instant case was only 13. . . . Any new provision introducing an element of mens rea . . . should properly result from an act of the Legislature itself, rather than judicial fiat. Until then, defendants in extraordinary cases, like Raymond, will rely upon the tempering discretion of the trial court at sentencing.</p>

<p id="76926640-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In statutory rape prosecutions, the traditional insistence on imposing strict liability for mistakes about age is beginning to erode. Either by statute or judicial decision, more than 20 states now permit the defense of mistake at least under some circumstances—typically when the relevant age of consent is greater than 14 or when the two parties are close in age (commonly known as Romeo and Juliet exceptions). But even in those situations, nearly all the states that allow the defense do so only when the mistake is reasonable, and more than half the states, like Maryland, continue to deny a mistake defense under any circumstances. Thus, the <i>Prince</i> case, now repudiated in England, continues to exert a powerful influence on American law.</p>
<p id="76926641-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="302" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-302">p. 302</span>The MPC provides for strict liability when criminality in a sexual offense turns on a child’s being below the age of ten. When criminality turns on a critical age greater than ten, the MPC treats mistake as an affirmative defense on which the defendant must carry the burden of proving that the mistake was reasonable. See §213.6(1). The various American statutory rape provisions are analyzed comprehensively in Catherine Carpenter, On Statutory Rape, Strict Liability, and the Public Welfare Offense Model, 53 Am. U. L. Rev. 313, 385-391 (2003). See also Annot., 46 A.L.R.5th 499 (2005).</p>
<p id="76926642-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One American court, in accord with Judge Bell’s reasoning in <i>Garnett</i>, supra, has held strict liability in statutory rape to be unconstitutional. See State v. Guest, 583 P.2d 836 (Alaska 1978). But for the time being, that remains an isolated holding. Virtually all American courts, even when they express discomfort with strict liability in statutory rape, continue to uphold its constitutionality. See, e.g., State v. Jadowski, 680 N.W.2d 810 (Wis. 2004); Owens v. State, 724 A.2d 43 (Md. 1999). In <i>Owens</i>, the court said (id. at 53, 55) that “[t]he state’s overwhelming interest in protecting children from these risks outweighs any interest that the individual may have in engaging in sexual relations with children near the age of consent” and that “by disallowing a mistake-of-age defense, the state avoids the risk that the inevitably emotional statutory rape trial will focus unjustifiably on the child’s appearance and level of maturity.”</p>

As Professor Carpenter notes, supra at 376:</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Is it fair—or even rational—to include individuals like Olsen and Garnett on a registry of supposedly dangerous sex offenders? Sex offenders are often also categorically excluded from certain public housing and other benefits. But if statutory rape defendants who lack mens rea can be sentenced to prison, why should it be considered worse—and impermissible—to subject them to mandatory registration and notification laws?</p>

<p id="76928d5e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the treatment of mistake of fact in the preceding section we encountered cases of strict liability, that is, cases where liability was imposed without any demonstrated culpability, not even negligence, with respect to at least one of the material elements of the offense. In all such cases that we have considered so far, however, there was—and courts considered it essential that there was—at least some sort of mens rea in a general sense—that is, some sort of legal or moral fault. In this section, we consider a more extreme form of strict liability, one in which the defendant neither knew nor had any reason to know that anything about his behavior was legally or even morally wrong. We will examine the main problems posed by this form of strict liability—how and why it came to be relied on by legislators as a regulatory device; the role of courts in affecting the extent of strict liability through their authority to interpret statutes; what the virtues and vices of strict liability are; and how far it can be squared with the requirements of just punishment.</p>

It is a question of legislative intent to be construed by the court. [I]n the prohibition or punishment of particular acts, the State may in the maintenance of a public policy provide “that he who shall do them shall do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance.” Many instances of this are to be found in regulatory measures in the exercise of what is called the police power where the emphasis of the statute is evidently upon achievement of some social betterment rather than the punishment of the crimes as in cases of mala in se. . . . [The Act’s] manifest purpose is to require every person dealing in drugs to ascertain at his peril whether that which he sells comes within the inhibition of the statute, and if he sells the inhibited drug in ignorance of its character, to penalize him. Congress weighed the possible injustice of subjecting an innocent seller to a penalty against the evil of exposing innocent purchasers to danger from the drug, and concluded that the latter was the result preferably to be avoided. Doubtless considerations as to the opportunity of the seller to find out the fact and the difficulty of proof of knowledge contributed to this conclusion.</p>

The purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection.

He flattened them out and sold them at a city junk market at a profit of $84.

His defense was that he honestly believed that the casings had been abandoned by the Air Force and that he was therefore violating no one’s rights in taking them. The trial judge rejected Morissette’s defense and instructed the jury that “[t]he question on intent is whether or not he intended to take the property.” The court of appeals affirmed, ruling that the statute created several separate offenses, including stealing and knowing conversion. While the crime of stealing traditionally has required an intent to take another’s property, in violation of the owner’s rights, the court of appeals held that knowing conversion did not include an element of intent to violate the rights of another, because no such intent was expressly required by the statute. In other words, the court of appeals assumed that Congress meant the term “knowingly convert” to carry its conventional tort law meaning—simply an intentional exercise of dominion over property that is not one’s own. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the defendant must be proven to <span title="306" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-306">p. 306</span>have had knowledge of the facts that made the conversion wrongful, that is, that the property had not been abandoned by its owner.]</p>

It is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil. A relation between some mental element and punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child’s familiar exculpatory “But I didn’t mean to,” and has afforded the rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for public prosecution. . . .

The crimes there involved depend on no mental element but consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. This, while not expressed by the Court, is made clear from examination of a century-old but accelerating tendency, discernible both here and in England, to call into existence new duties and crimes which disregard any ingredient of intent. The industrial revolution multiplied the number of workmen exposed to injury from increasingly powerful and complex mechanisms, driven by freshly discovered sources of energy, requiring higher precautions by employers. Traffic of velocities, volumes and varieties unheard of, came to subject the wayfarer to intolerable casualty risks if owners and drivers were not to observe new cares and uniformities of conduct. Congestion of cities and crowding of quarters called for health and welfare regulations undreamed of in simpler times. Wide distribution of goods became an instrument of wide distribution of harm when those who dispersed food, drink, drugs, and even securities, did not comply with reasonable standards of quality, integrity, disclosure and care. Such dangers have engendered increasingly numerous and detailed regulations which heighten the duties of those in control of particular industries, trades, properties or activities that affect public health, safety or welfare.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12268_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12268_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span>

This has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on statutes or administrative regulations, for what have been aptly called “public welfare offenses.” . . .  Many of these offenses . . . are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. [T]heir occurrence impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element. The accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumed his responsibilities. Also, penalties commonly are relatively small, and conviction does no grave damage to an offender’s reputation. Under such considerations, courts have turned to construing statutes and regulations which make no mention of intent as dispensing with it and holding that the guilty act alone makes out the crime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1227A_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1227A_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">c</a></span> This has not, however, been without expressions of misgiving. . . .

Had the jury convicted on proper instructions it would be the end of the matter. But juries are not bound by what seems inescapable logic to judges. They might have concluded that the heaps of spent casings left in the hinterland to rust away presented an appearance of unwanted and abandoned junk, and that lack of any conscious deprivation of property or intentional injury was indicated by Morissette’s good character, the openness of the taking, crushing and transporting of the casings, and the candor with which it was all admitted.

The rifle found in his possession met the Act’s definition of a firearm—a weapon capable of automatically firing more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger. The rifle originally had a metal piece that precluded automatic firing, but at some time it had been filed down. Defendant testified that the rifle never fired automatically in his possession and that he didn’t know it was capable of doing so. He sought an instruction that the government had to prove that he “knew that the gun would fire fully automatically.” This was refused, and the jury convicted. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.]</p><p id="769329cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not §5861(d) requires proof that a defendant knew of the characteristics of his weapon that made it a “firearm” under the Act is a question of statutory construction. . . . Section 5861(d) is silent concerning the mens rea required for a violation. It states simply that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person . . . to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.” Nevertheless, silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest that Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mens rea element, which would require that the defendant know the facts that make his conduct illegal. . . . On <span title="310" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-310">p. 310</span>the contrary, we must construe the statute in light of the background rules of the common law, in which the requirement of some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded. . . .

 . . . The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate and restrict the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the Government’s view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning what we have termed “public welfare” or “regulatory” offenses, in which we have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal liability through statutes that do not require the defendant to know the facts that make his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we have inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require proof of mens rea to establish an offense. . . . 
</p><p id="769329d0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Typically, our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that regulate potentially harmful or injurious items. . . . In such situations, we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of a character that places him “in responsible relation to a public danger,” [United States v.] Dotterweich, [320 U.S. 277] at 281, he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation, and we have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to place the burden on the defendant to “ascertain at his peril whether [his conduct] comes within the inhibition of the statute.” [United States v.] Balint, [258 U.S. 250] at 254.</p><p id="769329d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Government argues that §5861(d) defines precisely the sort of regulatory offense described in <i>Balint.</i> In this view, all guns, whether or not they are statutory “firearms,” are dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice that they must determine at their hazard whether their weapons come within the scope of the Act.</p><p id="769329d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Government seeks support for its position from our decision in United States v.

The Court acknowledged that under “the most natural grammatical reading, . . . the term ‘knowingly’ would modify only the surrounding verbs [and] would not modify the elements of the minority of the performers, or the sexually explicit nature of the material.” But, the Court continued, “we do not think this is the end of the matter, both because of anomalies which result from this construction, and because of the [presumption] that some form of scienter is to be implied in a criminal statute even if not expressed. . . . 
<i>Morissette</i>, reinforced by <i>Staples</i>, instructs that the presumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply to each of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct.” (id. at 68-69, 72). The Court therefore held that the statute must be construed to require proof, not just that the defendant had shipped or received something he knew to be a visual depiction, but also that he knew that the depiction involved a minor engaged in sexually explicit acts.

Stat. §609.03 (1984), a defendant who commits a gross misdemeanor may be sentenced to “imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine of not more than $3,000 or both.” In addition, a defendant convicted under section 340.941 may, at the discretion of the licensing authority, have its license suspended, revoked or be unable to obtain a new license. . . .

A due process analysis of a statute involves a balancing of the public interest protected against the intrusion on personal liberty while taking into account any alternative means by which to achieve the same end. . . . Section 340.941 serves the public interest by providing additional deterrence to violation of the liquor laws. The private interests affected, however, include liberty, damage to reputation and other future disabilities arising from criminal prosecution for an act which Guminga did not commit or ratify. Not only could Guminga be given a prison sentence or a suspended sentence, but, in the more likely event that he receives only a fine, his liberty could be affected by a longer presumptive sentence in a possible future felony conviction.

<span class="epub-small-caps">KELLEY</span>, J. (dissenting): [I]mposition of vicarious liability and the threat of a short jail, not prison, sentence is reasonably related to the legislative purpose: enforcement of laws prohibiting liquor sales to minors. Without the deterrent of possible personal criminal responsibility and a sentence, the legislature could have rationally concluded that liquor establishment owners will be less likely to impress upon employees the need to require identification of age before serving liquor. Limiting punishment to a fine allows bar owners to view their liability for violations as nothing more than an expense of doing business. The gravity of the problems associated with minors who consume alcoholic beverages justifies the importance by the legislature of harsher punishment on those who help contribute to those problems. The state has the right to impose limited criminal vicarious liability on bar proprietors as a reasonable exchange for the state-granted privilege of a liquor license. . . .

<i>1. Vicarious liability of employers.</i> As we shall see in Chapter 7.C, infra, corporations and other organizations are routinely held criminally liable for <span title="316" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-316">p. 316</span>crimes committed by their employees within the scope of their employment. This type of <i>entity liability</i>, though controversial, is qualitatively different and less problematic than the attempt (illustrated by <i>Guminga</i>) to impose criminal liability on the employer <i>as an individual.</i> When possible sanctions are limited to fines, courts generally uphold convictions of individuals for the illegal conduct of their employees, even without proof of employer fault. See Annot., 89 A.L.R.3d 1256 §§15-18 (2005). But as <i>Guminga</i> indicates, there is disagreement about offenses that carry a sanction of imprisonment. Compare <i>Guminga</i> with State v. Beaudry, 365 N.W.2d 593 (Wis. 1985). The defendant and her husband were sole shareholders of a corporation with a license to sell alcohol at the Village Green Tavern. The defendant was the designated agent for the corporate licensee. One night the tavern manager violated the terms of the license by remaining open past closing time, against the instructions of the absent owners, for the sole purpose of entertaining his own friends. Nonetheless, the defendant was convicted on the basis of vicarious liability. The court upheld the conviction, even though the statute authorized a 90-day jail sentence, on the ground that the penalty imposed was solely a $200 fine.</p>

<i>2. Vicarious liability of parents.</i> A number of jurisdictions seek to hold parents vicariously liable for crimes committed by their minor children. Is vicarious criminal liability more problematic in the case of a parent than in the case of an employer? If not, should vicarious liability be permitted in both situations or in neither? State v. Akers, 400 A.2d 38 (N.H. 1979), involved a statute imposing criminal liability on parents of minor children who drive off-highway vehicles on public highways. No evidence of parental culpability was required. The court struck down the statute, stating (id. at 40):</p>

</div>
<p id="7693c64c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other parental responsibility laws have been enacted throughout the country. See Jennifer M. Collins, Ethan J. Lieb &amp; Dan Markel, Punishing Family Status, 88 B.U. L. Rev. 1327, 1338-1343 (2008). One of the broadest, in Oregon, imposes misdemeanor liability on the parents of any juvenile who violates a curfew law or commits any crime. Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. §163.577(1) (2011). The statute requires no showing that the parent knew about the violation or contributed to it. The policy justification for such statutes is ostensibly straightforward: controlling juvenile crime by giving parents a strong incentive to exercise oversight. Are there countervailing concerns? One scholar, after examining police and prosecutorial practices in Oregon, <span title="317" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-317">p. 317</span>concludes that such laws can lead to overly restrictive parenting and are likely to be “enforced disproportionately against poor, single parents.” Leslie Joan Harris, An Empirical Study of Parental Responsibility Laws, 2006 Utah L. Rev. 5, 11.</p>
<p id="7693ed5d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from policy concerns, do such statutes violate basic principles of constitutional law and just punishment? Consider City of Maple Heights v. Ephraim, 898 N.E.2d 974 (Ohio Ct. App. 2008). A juvenile was involved in “fighting” and a variety of offenses resulting from his flight to evade arrest. His mother was then charged with violating a municipal ordinance that imposes criminal penalties on the parent of any minor who commits any felony or misdemeanor. The appellate court struck down the ordinance, stating (id. at 981):</p>

Vicarious liability, however, imputes the acts of one person to another. [Such liability] “is a substantial departure from the ordinary rule that a principal is not answerable criminally for the acts of his agent without the principal’s authorization, consent or knowledge . . . ” [because] guilt must be individual. . . .

</div>
<p id="7693ed5f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most parental responsibility laws are technically less problematic because they impose liability for “contributing to delinquency” or “failure to supervise.” This framework means that the parent is not convicted for the child’s delinquent act as such but rather for the parents’ own actus reus—the omission of failing to supervise. Nonetheless, in practice these laws often treat failure to supervise as a matter that is established automatically by the child’s commission of a delinquent act. Is there a moral or constitutional problem here? See James Herbie Difonzi, Parental Responsibility for Juvenile Crime, 80 Or. L. Rev. 1 (2001).</p>

<i>2. Failure to pay child support.</i> Under Michigan law, the failure to pay child support is a strict liability felony offense. In People v. Likine, 492 Mich. 367 (2012), the defendant argued that she could not pay her court-ordered child support obligations because of a mental illness and disability. In analyzing whether the defendant could raise this defense, the Michigan Supreme Court first observed that crimes require an actus reus and a mens rea, and that even though strict liability crimes do not require proof of mens rea, they still must involve a wrongful act that is voluntary. Id. at 393. Thus, a defendant would not be liable if he or she committed the act because of a reflex, seizure, spasm, or convulsion, or while the actor was unconscious or asleep. Id. at 393-394. When liability is based on an omission—which is the case in a felony nonsupport case—the court stated that the impossibility of performance must arise from events outside the control of the defendant. Id. at 396. The court then concluded that “[f]or the payment of child support to be truly impossible, a defendant must explore and eliminate all the reasonably possible, lawful avenues of obtaining the revenue required to comply with the support order.” Id. at 402. Was the court correct to recognize the impossibility defense? Is the defense too limited when a defendant is foreclosed from raising it if he or she is any way at fault for creating the inability to pay? The dissent would have recognized a broader inability to pay defense that applies in the other 49 states and the District of Columbia and that does not preclude a defendant from raising it even if he or she is somewhat responsible for that inability to pay.

<span class="epub-small-caps">DICKSON, J.</span>
 . . . Various arguments are advanced in justification of absolute liability in public welfare offences. Two predominate. Firstly, it is argued that the protection of social interests requires a high standard of care and attention on the part of those who follow certain pursuits and such persons are more likely to be stimulated to maintain those standards if they know that ignorance or mistake will not excuse them. The removal of any possible loophole acts, it is said, as an incentive to take precautionary measures beyond what would otherwise be taken. . . . The second main argument is one based on administrative efficiency. Having regard to both the difficulty of proving mental culpability and the number of petty cases which daily come before the Courts, proof of fault is just too great a burden in time and money to place upon the prosecution. . . . In short, absolute liability, it is contended, is the most efficient and effective way of ensuring compliance with minor regulatory legislation and the social ends to be achieved are of such importance as to override the unfortunate by-product of punishing those who may be free of moral turpitude. In further justification, it is urged that slight penalties are usually imposed and that conviction for breach of a public welfare offence does not carry the stigma associated with conviction for a criminal offense.</p>
<p id="76941480-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Arguments of greater force are advanced against absolute liability. The most telling is that it violates fundamental principles of penal liability. It also rests upon assumptions which have not been, and cannot be, empirically <span title="320" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-320">p. 320</span>established. There is no evidence that a higher standard of care results from absolute liability. If a person is already taking every reasonable precautionary measure, is he likely to take additional measures, knowing that however much care he takes, it will not serve as a defence in the event of breach? If he has exercised care and skill, will conviction have a deterrent effect upon him or others? Will the injustice of conviction lead to cynicism and disrespect for the law, on his part and on the part of others? . . . The argument that no stigma attaches does not withstand analysis, for the accused will have suffered loss of time, legal costs, exposure to the processes of the criminal law at trial and, however one may downplay it, the opprobrium of conviction. It is not sufficient to say that the public interest is engaged. . . . In serious crimes, the public interest is [also] involved and [nevertheless] mens rea must be proven. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76941481-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The unfortunate tendency in many past cases has been to see the choice as between two stark alternatives: (i) full mens rea; or (ii) absolute liability. . . . There [is], however, . . . a middle position, fulfilling the goals of public welfare offences while still not punishing the entirely blameless. [This approach] holds that where an offence does not require full mens rea, it is nevertheless a good defence for the defendant to prove that he was not negligent. [That] doctrine proceeds on the assumption that the defendant could have avoided the prima facie offence through the exercise of reasonable care and he is given the opportunity of establishing, if he can, that he did in fact exercise such care. . . . This burden falls upon the defendant as he is the only one who will generally have the means of proof. This would not seem unfair as the alternative is absolute liability which denies an accused any defence whatsoever. While the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the prohibited act, the defendant must only establish on the balance of probabilities that he has a defence of reasonable care.</p>
<p id="76941482-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I conclude . . . that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of three categories of offences rather than the traditional two:</p>

<i>1. Strict liability as unconstitutional.</i> In a subsequent decision, the Canadian Supreme Court held absolute liability unconstitutional, finding that imprisonment for an absolute liability offense is a deprivation of liberty not “in accordance with the precepts of fundamental justice” guaranteed by §7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Reference Re Section 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 23 C.C.C.3d 289 (1985). Its reasons were essentially those it had given in <i>Sault Ste. Marie.</i>
</p>
<p id="76943b9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Canadian court was obliged to confront the qualification in Section 1 of the Charter that makes the protected freedoms subject to “such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” It ruled that administrative expediency could justify imprisonment for absolute liability “only in cases arising out of exceptional conditions, such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, epidemics and the like.” (Id. at 313.) The court continues to reaffirm its view that offenses involving imprisonment require the prosecution to prove mens rea, and that public welfare offenses not involving imprisonment presumptively fall into the middle category (where the accused is permitted to raise due care as an affirmative defense) unless a legislative intent to preclude such a defense is clearly expressed. City of Lévis v. Tétreault, 2006 S.C.C. 12.</p>

<i>2. Finding a middle ground.</i> The middle approach discussed in <i>Sault Ste. Marie</i> has been taken up by at least one American court. United States v. United States District Court (Kantor), 858 F.2d 534 (9th Cir. 1988). See Laurie L. Levenson, Good Faith Defenses: Reshaping Strict Liability Crimes, 78 Cornell L. Rev. 401 (1993), for a proposal to extend to all strict liability offenses an affirmative defense of absence of blameworthy conduct.</p>

<i>3. Possession.</i> In 2002, Florida amended its drug control statutes to provide that “knowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is not an element of any offense under this chapter”; lack of such knowledge was made an affirmative defense on which the defendant would bear the burden of proof. Fla. Stat. §893.101 (2002). As a result, a defendant convicted of delivering a container that proved to hold cocaine would face a maximum sentence (depending on his criminal history) of either 15 years, 30 years, or life imprisonment, regardless of whether the prosecution could prove that he knew or should have known the nature of the contents. After Shelton was convicted under this statute and sentenced to 18 years in prison, a federal court held the statute unconstitutional. Shelton v. Secy., Dept. of Corrections, 802 F. Supp. 2d 1289 (M.D. Fla. 2011). The court said (id. at 1300, 1302-1303, 1305):</p>

Hart’s argument that the defendant convicted of a strict-liability offense “could not have helped” committing the crime depends on the use of a rationally indefensible narrow time frame in focusing on the defendant’s conduct. [I]f one looks only at the precise moment at which harm is consummated, the strictly liable actor may seem powerless to avoid criminality, but it is invariably the case that the actor could have avoided liability by taking earlier steps which were hardly impossible. . . . 
</p><p id="769489d1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is . . . only by constructing the underlying material in the strict-liability situations with a very narrow time frame that the distinction between liability predicated on negligence, and strict liability, maintains its practical import in many critical situations.</p><p id="769489d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An example is the familiar problem of “reasonable” (non-negligent) mistakes as to the victim’s age in the statutory rape setting. Is one’s view of a “reasonable” belief to be ascertained solely by reference to perceptions available to the defendant during the purportedly illegal seduction (she “<i>looked</i>” sixteen or “she told me she was sixteen”), or does one require that some checks prior to seduction be taken, such as checking birth certificates or asking parents? Of course, if one is hostile to statutory rape laws in general, it is perfectly reasonable to negate them by defining negligent perceptions in terms of the girl’s physical appearance—that is, in terms of judgments which can be made at the narrow time-framed moment of the allegedly criminal incident. But it is hardly conceivable that a defendant ought to attract serious sympathy as someone unable to avoid crime when he has certainly had the opportunity to check on the legal appropriateness of his companion as an object of sexual desire.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN126E8_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N126E8_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

</div><p id="7694b0e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The objection to strict liability is not that it punishes people who are literally helpless to avoid committing the act, because it is obvious that they could have avoided any possibility of liability by not going into business in the first place. The point is that selling meat or managing a factory is a productive activity which the law means to encourage, not discourage, and we should not punish people who have taken all reasonable steps to comply with the law. Where strict liability is present in the traditional criminal law, as in the felony-murder doctrine or in the rule that mistake of age is no defense to statutory rape, the defendant’s underlying conduct (robbery or fornication) is deemed wrongful or socially undesirable in itself. Unless we regard business activity as similarly inherently wrongful, holding business managers up to strict liability is unjustifiable even though they have voluntarily assumed their positions of employment.</p></div>

The method used is not to abrogate strict liability completely, but to provide that when conviction rests upon that basis the grade of the offense is reduced to a violation, which is not a “crime” and under Sections 1.04(5) and 6.02(4) may result in no sentence other than a fine, or a fine and forfeiture or other authorized civil penalty.</p>

 . . . It has been argued, and the argument undoubtedly will be repeated, that strict liability is necessary for enforcement in a number of the areas where it obtains. But if practical enforcement precludes litigation of the culpability of alleged deviation from legal requirements, the enforcers cannot rightly demand the use of penal sanctions for the purpose. Crime does and should mean condemnation and no court should have to pass that judgment unless it can declare that the defendant’s act was culpable. This is too fundamental to be compromised. The law goes far enough if it permits the imposition of a monetary penalty in cases where strict liability has been imposed.</p>

<p id="7694ff1a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One legal doctrine that is especially familiar to non-lawyers is the rule that “ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Yet, as we shall see, this supposedly well-known “rule” turns out to be murky, misleading, and sometimes simply false. Several distinct problems are presented. First, mistakes of law sometimes arise because a person is aware of a law but misinterprets its meaning; in other instances, the individual does not know that any such law exists at all. Second, misinterpretation or complete ignorance may be relevant because the elements or scope of the criminal law with which the defendant is charged make the awareness or knowledge of some legal standard part of the offense. In this way, a mistake about the law can arise in the same way as a mistake of fact. Finally, if a mistake of law is of the type that normally does not excuse, can the defendant nonetheless claim a defense when his misinterpretation is based on an <i>official</i> document or <i>official</i> advice that turns out to be incorrect?</p>
<p id="7694ff1b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case that follows appears to present a single question, but in fact it involves most of the distinct problems just mentioned. The defendant placed his hopes primarily on the last and most limited type of argument—that his mistake (though <i>normally</i> irrelevant) should nonetheless excuse because the state penal code recognized a narrow defense for mistakes resulting from reliance on an official source. Before focusing on that issue, however, it will be worth pausing to consider whether the defendant should have a <span title="326" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-326">p. 326</span>valid excuse even in the absence of this special penal code provision. In light of the principles of culpability considered up to this point, shouldn’t the defendant’s mistake give him a mens rea defense even without this particular type of reliance? And if not, then consider whether the special statutory defense should change the result.</p>

The Appellate Division reinstated the indictment, holding, by a 3–2 vote, that the defendant was not a “peace officer” within the meaning of CPL §§1.20, 2.10. He was then convicted at a trial where the judge refused to instruct the jury to acquit if it found that Marrero reasonably believed he qualified for the statutory exemption. The defendant appealed.]</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BELLACOSA</span>, J. . . . The central issue is whether defendant’s personal misreading or misunderstanding of a statute may excuse criminal conduct in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p id="7694ff23-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common-law rule on mistake of law was clearly articulated in Gardner v. People, (62 N.Y. 299). In <i>Gardner</i>, the defendants misread a statute and mistakenly believed that their conduct was legal. The court insisted, however, that the “mistake of law” did not relieve the defendants of criminal liability. . . . This is to be contrasted with People v. Weiss, 276 N.Y. 384, 12 N.E.2d 514 [1938,] where, in a kidnapping case, the trial court precluded testimony that the defendants acted with the honest belief that seizing and confining the [victim] was done with “authority of law.” We held it was error to exclude such testimony since a good-faith belief in the legality of the conduct would negate an express and necessary element of the crime of kidnapping, i.e., <span title="327" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-327">p. 327</span>intent, without authority of law, to confine or imprison another.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN127E6_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N127E6_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span> [T]he instant case, of course, falls within the <i>Gardner</i> rationale because the weapons possession statute violated by this defendant imposes liability independent of one’s intent [to violate the law].</p>

<p id="7695253d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It was early recognized that the “official statement” mistake of law defense was a statutory protection against prosecution based on reliance on a statute that did <i>in fact</i> authorize certain conduct. . . . While providing a narrow escape hatch, the idea was simultaneously to encourage the public to read and rely on official statements of the law, not to have individuals conveniently and personally question the validity and interpretation of the law and act on that basis. If later the statute was invalidated, one who mistakenly acted in reliance on the authorizing statute would be relieved of criminal liability. That makes sense and is fair. To go further does not make sense and would create a legal chaos. . . . In the case before us, the underlying statute never <i>in fact authorized</i> the defendant’s conduct; the defendant only thought [it did].</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">HANCOCK</span>, J. (dissenting). . . . The basic difference which divides the court may be simply put. Suppose the case of a man who has committed an act which is criminal not because it is inherently wrong or immoral but solely because it violates a criminal statute. He has committed the act in complete good faith under the mistaken but entirely reasonable assumption that the act does not constitute an offense because it is permitted by the wording of the statute. Does the law require that this man be punished? The majority says that it does and holds that (1) Penal Law §15.02(2)(a) must be construed so that the man is precluded from offering a defense based on his mistake of law and (2) such construction is compelled by prevailing considerations of public policy and criminal jurisprudence. We take issue with the majority on both propositions.</p>
<p id="76952542-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There can be no question that under the view that the purpose of the criminal justice system is to punish blameworthiness or “choosing freely to do wrong”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12879_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12879_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> our supposed man who has acted innocently and without any intent to do wrong should not be punished. . . . Since he has not knowingly committed a wrong there can be no reason for society to exact retribution. Because the man is law-abiding and would not have acted but for his mistaken assumption as to the law, there is no need for punishment to deter him from further unlawful conduct. Traditionally, however, under the ancient rule of Anglo-American common law that ignorance or mistake of law is no excuse, our supposed man would be punished.</p>
<p id="76954c54-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The maxim “<i>ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>” finds its roots in Medieval law. . . . Various justifications have been offered for the rule, but all are frankly pragmatic and utilitarian—preferring the interests of society (e.g., in deterring criminal conduct, fostering orderly judicial administration, and preserving the primacy of the rule of law) to the interest of the individual in being free from punishment except for intentionally engaging in conduct which he knows is criminal.</p>
<p id="76954c55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Today there is widespread criticism of the common-law rule mandating categorical preclusion of the mistake of law defense. The utilitarian arguments for retaining the rule have been drawn into serious question but the fundamental objection is that it is simply wrong to punish someone who, in good-faith reliance on the wording of a statute, believed that what he <span title="330" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-330">p. 330</span>was doing was lawful. . . . This basic objection to the maxim “<i>ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>” may have had less force in ancient times when most crimes consisted of acts which by their very nature were recognized as evil. In modern times, however, with the profusion of legislation making otherwise lawful conduct criminal (<i>malum prohibitum</i>), the “common law fiction that every man is presumed to know the law has become indefensible in fact or logic.”</p>

Thus, he concluded erroneously that, as a corrections officer in a Federal prison, he was a “peace officer” and, as such, exempt by the express terms of Penal Law §265.20(a)(1)(a). This mistaken belief, based in good faith on the statute defining “peace officer” is, defendant contends, the precise sort of “mistaken belief . . . founded upon an official statement of the law contained in . . . a statute or other enactment” which gives rise to a mistake of law defense under Penal Law §15.20(2)(a). He points out, of course, that when he acted in reliance on his belief he had no way of foreseeing that a court would eventually resolve the question of the statute’s meaning against him and rule that his belief had been mistaken, as three of the five-member panel at the Appellate Division ultimately did in the first appeal.</p>
<p id="76954c59-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority, however, has accepted the People’s argument that to have a defense under Penal Law §15.20(2)(a) “a defendant must show that the statute <i>permitted his conduct</i>, not merely that he believed it did.” . . .

<p id="76954c5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The majority construes the statute, however, so as to rule out <i>any</i> defense based on mistake of law.

<p id="76954c5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Instead, the majority bases its decision on an analogous provision in the Model Penal Code and concludes that despite its totally different wording and meaning Penal Law §15.20(2)(a) should be read as if it were Model Penal <span title="331" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-331">p. 331</span>Code §2.04(3)(b)(i).

<i>1.

<p id="76957372-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">So in <i>Marrero</i>, is the key to the result not the kind of mistake made but simply the fact that the statute involved was treated as a strict liability offense? If so, then the result might have been different—and Marrero’s claim of mistake about qualifying as a “peace officer” would have been allowed—if the statute had prohibited “<i>knowing</i> possession of an unlicensed handgun.” Yet that conclusion is hard to reconcile with the court’s references to the “common law rule on mistake of <i>law</i>” (emphasis added) and its concern that “[i]f the defendant’s argument were accepted, the exception would swallow the rule. Mistakes about the law would be encouraged. . . . ” Those passages suggest that Marrero’s claim of mistake about the legal meaning of the term “peace officer” was not allowed as a defense, even though a mistake about the relevant facts (such as the expiration date of a permit) would be.

<i>2.

In Heien v. North Carolina, 135 S. Ct. 530 (2014), a police officer stopped a motorist who had a non-working brake light thinking that violated state law when in fact the relevant law required only one working brake light, which the car had. The Supreme Court nevertheless condoned the stop of the car because it viewed the officer’s mistake of law as reasonable. Responding to claims akin to Justice Holmes’s that the rule would discourage officers from learning the law, the Court responded that (id. at 539-540):</p>

The true symmetry is this: Just as an individual generally cannot escape criminal liability based on a mistaken understanding of the law, so too the government cannot impose criminal liability based on a mistaken understanding of the law. . . . But just because mistakes of law cannot justify either the imposition or the avoidance of criminal liability, it does not follow that they cannot justify an investigatory stop.</p>

Kahan, Ignorance of the Law <i>Is</i> an Excuse—But Only for the Virtuous, 96 Mich. L. Rev. 127 (1997). He offers a different explanation for the ignorance-of-law rule, which, he suggests, is “that individuals are and should be aware of society’s morality and that morality furnishes a better guide for action than does law itself. Thus, far from trying to maximize the incentive that presumptively bad men have to know the law, the doctrine seeks to obscure the law so that citizens are more likely to behave like good ones.” Id. at 153. Therefore, he argues, courts need to make “context-specific judgments about which actors have characters good enough to be excused for their mistakes of law,” id. at 152, in order to distinguish them from loop-holers who seek to exploit the uncertainties of the law, such as “designer drug manufacturers and other strategically inquisitive wrongdoers.” <span title="333" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-333">p. 333</span>Consider Crain v.

<i>1. Damage to property.</i> In Regina v. Smith (David), [1974] 2 Q.B. 354, the defendant, in preparing to leave his rented apartment, damaged some wall panels and floor boards in order to retrieve stereo wiring he earlier had installed, with the landlord’s permission, behind wall panels and floor boards of his own construction. He was charged with violating the Criminal Damage Act, which read: “A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged, shall be guilty of an offence.” His defense, in his own words, was: “Look, how can I be done in for smashing my own property. I put the flooring and that in, so if I want to pull it down it’s a matter for me.” He was convicted under an instruction that told the jury that “belief by the defendant . . . that he had the right to do what he did is not a lawful excuse within the meaning of the Act . . . because in law he had no right to do what he did.” On appeal, the prosecution argued that “the mental element in the <span title="334" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-334">p. 334</span>offence relates only to causing damage or to destroying property, [so] that if . . . the property damaged or destroyed is shown to be another’s property the offence is committed although the defendant did not intend or foresee damage to another person’s property.” The court of appeal reversed, finding the jury instruction erroneous:</p>

<p id="76959a90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Construing the language of section 1(1) we have no doubt that the actus reus is “destroying or damaging any property belonging to another.” It is not possible to exclude the words “belonging to another” which describes the “property.” Applying the ordinary principles of mens rea, the intention and recklessness and the absence of lawful excuse required to constitute the offence have reference to property belonging to another. It follows that in our judgment no offence is committed under this section if a person destroys or causes damage to property belonging to another if he does so in the honest though mistaken belief that the property is his own, and provided that the belief is honestly held it is irrelevant to consider whether or not it is a justifiable belief.</p>

<i>2. Theft.</i> In State v. Varszegi, 635 A.2d 816 (Conn. App. Ct. 1993), the defendant was a landlord whose commercial tenant had missed several payments for a rented office space. In the belief that he was acting pursuant to the lease’s default clause, he came to the office on a weekend, picked the lock, and removed two computers. On the following Monday, the tenant noticed that the equipment was missing and called the police, who warned the defendant that he had no right to confiscate the property and that he should return it. Nonetheless, the defendant proceeded to sell the equipment. He was convicted of theft, but the appellate court reversed, stating (id. at 818):</p>

<i>3. Awareness of the law as an offense element</i>. Compare the two preceding cases, <i>Varszegi</i> and the <i>David Smith</i> case, to <i>Marrero.</i> In <i>Marrero</i>, a seemingly reasonable mistake of law is <i>not</i> a defense, but in the first two, a mistake of law can be a defense even if it is <i>un</i>reasonable! In these two situations (and many others) ignorance of law <i>is</i> an excuse. The MPC sets forth a similar pair of rules that may at first blush appear contradictory. Section 2.04(1) provides:</p>

<p id="7695c1a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet §2.02(9) provides:</p>

Taken together, do they afford a defense for Marrero, for David Smith, for both, or for neither? Intuition cannot be a very helpful guide here; it is necessary to apply the two MPC provisions carefully, step by step, to each of the two cases. The background principle involved, and the separate domains of the two provisions, are explained in Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.02 at 250 (1985):</p>

<p id="7695c1a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he general principle that ignorance or mistake of law is no excuse is greatly overstated; it has no application, for example, when the circumstances made material by the definition of the offense include a legal element. Thus it is immaterial in theft, when claim of right is adduced in defense, that the claim involves a legal judgment as to the right of property. Claim of right is a defense because the property must belong to someone else for the theft to occur and the defendant must have culpable awareness of that [legal] fact. Insofar as this point is involved, there is no need to state a special principle; the legal element involved is simply an aspect of the attendant circumstances, with respect to which knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, is required for culpability. . . . The law involved is not the law defining the offense; it is some other legal rule that characterizes the attendant circumstances that are material to the offense.</p>
<p id="7695c1a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proper arena for the principle that ignorance or mistake of law does not afford an excuse is thus with respect to the particular law that sets forth the definition of the crime in question. It is knowledge of <i>that</i> law that is normally not a part of the crime, and it is ignorance or mistake as to <i>that</i> law that is denied defensive significance by this subsection of the Code and by the traditional common law approach to the issue.</p>

<p id="7695c1aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the foregoing analysis, how should the following cases be decided?</p>
<p id="7695c1ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> The defendant was a single woman who traveled with Leo Shuffelt from Vermont to Reno, Nevada, where Shuffelt instituted divorce proceedings against his wife, who was neither a Nevada resident nor present in Nevada. The Nevada judge entered a divorce decree, following which he married the defendant and Shuffelt. Upon return to Vermont, the defendant was prosecuted under a Vermont statute, commonly known as the <i>Blanket Act</i>, which provided: “A man with another man’s wife, or a woman with another woman’s husband, found in bed together, under circumstances affording presumption of an illicit intention, shall each be imprisoned in the state prison not more than three years or fined not more than $1,000.” The defendant requested an instruction to the jury that an honest belief in the validity of the Nevada divorce and of her subsequent marriage to Shuffelt would be a defense to the prosecution. Is she entitled to this instruction? Would she be if she had requested an instruction that a <i>reasonable</i> belief would be a defense? See State v. Woods, 179 A. 1 (Vt. 1935).</p>

<i>(b)</i> A physician, attending a patient whom he knows to be brain dead, takes steps to stop his heart, preliminary to removing it for a transplant. He believes the legislature in his jurisdiction has enacted a brain death statute. It hasn’t, and the common-law definition of death (cessation of heart functions) is in effect. Can the physician be convicted of <i>intentionally</i> killing his patient? On the one hand, ignorance of the law is no excuse. On the other hand, how can a person be found to have intentionally killed a person he believed was already dead?</p>

 . . . We deal first with the case where the issue is whether the defendant knew of the duty purportedly imposed by the provision of the statute or regulation he is accused of violating, a case in which there is no claim that the provision at issue is invalid. In such a case, if the Government proves actual knowledge of the pertinent legal duty, the prosecution, without more, has satisfied the knowledge component of the willfulness requirement. But carrying this burden requires negating a defendant’s claim of ignorance of the law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law, he had a good-faith belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax laws. . . . In the end, the issue is whether, based on all the evidence, the Government has proved that the defendant was aware of the duty at issue, which cannot be true if the jury credits a good-faith misunderstanding and belief submission, whether or not the claimed belief or misunderstanding is objectively reasonable.</p><p id="7695e8c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case, if Cheek asserted that he truly believed that the Internal Revenue Code did not purport to treat wages as income, and the jury believed him, the Government would not have carried its burden to prove willfulness, however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief. . . . Of course, the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties . . . and will find that the Government has carried its burden of providing knowledge.</p><p id="7695e8ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cheek [also asserted] that he should be acquitted because he believed in good faith that the income tax law is unconstitutional as applied to him and thus could not legally impose any duty upon him of which he should have been aware. Such a submission is unsound, not because Cheek’s constitutional arguments are . . . frivolous, which they surely are, but because . . . the willfulness requirement in the criminal provisions of the Internal Revenue Code . . . require proof of knowledge of the law. This was because in “our complex tax system, uncertainty often arises even among taxpayers who earnestly wish to follow the law” and “‘it is not the purpose of the law to penalize frank difference of opinion or innocent errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care.’” United States v. Bishop, 412 US. 346, 360-361 (1973).</p><p id="7695e8cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Claims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however <span title="338" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-338">p. 338</span>wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.</p><p id="7695e8cc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not believe that Congress contemplated that such a taxpayer . . .  could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. [I]n some years, [Cheek did not do so,] and when he did was unwilling to accept the outcome. . . . Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts, who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.</p><p id="76960fdd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[It] was therefore not error in this case for the District Judge to instruct the jury not to consider Cheek’s claims that the tax laws were unconstitutional.

<p id="76960fe1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The starting place for the analysis in <i>Cheek</i> is an essentially self-evident point—the rule, also stated in Model Penal Code §2.02(9), that a mistake about the existence or meaning of the law defining the offense is a defense if that law itself allows that defense. But how does a court decide <i>whether</i> that law allows the defense? Does the presence of mens rea language like “knowledge” or “willfulness” determine the answer? Note that in <i>Cheek</i>, the court interpreted the word “willfully” to mean the defendant must be aware of some legal conclusions (that wages are “income”) but not others (that the income tax statute is constitutionally valid). In other cases involving the interpretation of federal statutes, the Court has sometimes held that “knowledge” or “willfulness” requires either (1) awareness of the specific statute at issue, or (2) just a more general awareness that the acts committed are unlawful, or (3) even less—merely awareness of what acts were committed (i.e., awareness only of the <i>facts</i>). The statutory language itself seldom signals which of these meanings was intended. Surveying an extensive body of case law, Professor Sharon L. Davies finds that courts have construed a dozen or more federal criminal laws to require knowledge of illegality. Davies, The Jurisprudence of <span title="339" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-339">p. 339</span>Ignorance: An Evolving Theory of Excusable Ignorance, 48 Duke L.J. 341, 344-347 (1998). Nonetheless, in many instances, courts continue to interpret “knowledge” or “willfulness” as requiring only an awareness of the facts. What circumstances determine whether knowledge of the law is or should be required? Consider the following cases:</p>

Does this mean that the prosecution must prove the defendant knew of the existence and meaning of the relevant regulation, or only that he was aware of doing the acts that violated the regulation?

<i>1. The traditional view.</i> Because the reasonableness of a defendant’s mistake of penal law ordinarily is irrelevant, courts traditionally refused to consider the defense even when the mistake was based on the assurances of a public official or the decision of a court. Consider Hopkins v. State, 69 A.2d 456 (Md. 1950). The defendant was convicted of violating a statute making it unlawful to erect or maintain any sign intended to aid in the solicitation of performance of marriages. He had erected signs that read: “Rev. W.F. Hopkins” and “W.F. Hopkins, Notary Public, Information.” On appeal he argued that the trial judge erred in excluding testimony offered to show that the State’s Attorney advised him before he erected the signs that they would not violate the law. The Maryland Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76965e1e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is generally held that the advice of counsel, even though followed in good faith, furnishes no excuse to a person for violating the law and cannot be relied upon as a defense in a criminal action. . . . Moreover, advice given by a public official, even a State’s Attorney, that a contemplated act is not criminal will not excuse an offender if, as a matter of law, the act performed did amount to a violation of the law. . . . These rules are founded upon the maxim that ignorance of the law will not excuse its violation. If an accused could be exempted from punishment for crime by reason of the advice of counsel, such advice would become paramount to the law. . . .

Defendant was aware of the penal statute enacted by the Legislature. He knew what he wanted to do, and he did the thing he intended to do. He claims merely that he was given advice regarding his legal rights. . . . If the right of a person to erect a sign of a certain type and size depends upon the construction and application of a penal statute, and the right is somewhat doubtful, he erects the sign at his peril. In other words, a <span title="342" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-342">p. 342</span>person who commits an act which the law declared to be criminal cannot be excused from punishment upon the theory that he misconstrued or misapplied the law.</p>

<i>2. The MPC approach.</i> Reflecting a widespread view that decisions like <i>Hopkins</i> are unfair, and indeed pointless, the Code adopts a limited defense for situations in which a defendant reasonably relies on an official interpretation. See §2.04(3), Appendix. The Commentaries explain (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.04 at 274-275 (1985)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76968531-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">All of the categories dealt with in the formulation involve, for the most part, situations where the act charged is consistent with the entire law-abidingness of the actor, where the possibility of collusion is minimal, and where a judicial determination of the reasonableness of the belief in legality should not present substantial difficulty. It is hard, therefore, to see how any purpose can be served by a conviction. It should be added that in the area of regulatory offenses, where the defense would normally apply, penal sanctions are appropriate in general only for deliberate evasion or defiance. When less than this is involved, lesser sanctions should suffice, for these typically are situations where a single violation works no major public or private injury; it is persistent violations that must be brought to book. And obviously the defense afforded by this section would normally be available to a defendant only once; after a warning he can hardly have a reasonable basis for belief in the legality of his behavior.</p>

<p id="76968532-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC’s official reliance defense is widely accepted. See, e.g., United States v. Levin, 973 F.2d 463, 468 (6th Cir. 1992); Commonwealth v. Twitchell, 617 N.E.2d 609 (Mass. 1993); Annot., 89 A.L.R.4th 1026 (1991).</p>

<i>3. Due process limitations.</i> Under the label “entrapment by estoppel,” the Supreme Court has sometimes held it a violation of due process to convict a defendant for conduct that governmental representatives, in their official capacity, had earlier stated was lawful. The doctrine was first recognized in Raley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423 (1959). Defendants invoked their privilege against self-incrimination before an Ohio governmental commission after the commission instructed them that they were permitted to do so. This, apparently, was bad advice, however, since an Ohio statute granted automatic immunity in such situations, thereby depriving them of any privilege to refuse to answer. They were then convicted of contempt for refusing to answer the commission’s questions. The Supreme Court found this to violate due process, stating that to affirm the convictions in these circumstances “would be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by the State—convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him” (id. at 438).</p>

<i>4. The reasonableness requirement.</i> Under MPC §2.04(3)(b), the reliance defense is available only when the defendant “acts in <i>reasonable</i> reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous” (emphasis added). Why would it ever be unreasonable to rely on an official statement of the law not yet determined to be erroneous at the time when the defendant acts? Consider United States v. Albertini, 830 F.2d 985 (1987). The defendant was convicted of trespass for engaging in a protest demonstration on a naval base. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit (in <i>Albertini I</i>) set aside the conviction on the ground that his conduct was protected by the First Amendment. The government then filed a petition for certiorari, seeking review by the Supreme Court. At that point, but before the Supreme Court decided whether to review the case, Albertini engaged in a second protest demonstration. After the second demonstration, the Supreme Court granted review and reversed the Ninth Circuit, on the ground that the protest at a military installation was not protected by the First Amendment. The conviction in <i>Albertini I</i> was therefore reinstated, but the government also decided to prosecute Albertini for the second demonstration, which had occurred before the Supreme Court’s decision to review <i>Albertini I.</i> In <i>Albertini II</i>, he was convicted for participating in the second demonstration and of course no longer had a First Amendment defense. The court of appeals nonetheless reversed the conviction in <i>Albertini II</i>, this time on the ground that he had a due process right to rely on the previous Ninth Circuit decision ruling that his conduct was lawful:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76968536-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the due process clause is to mean anything, it should mean that a person who holds the latest controlling court opinion declaring his activities constitutionally protected should be able to depend on that ruling to protect like activities from criminal conviction until that opinion is reversed, or at least until the Supreme Court has granted certiorari. . . . To hold otherwise would sanction a kind of “entrapment” by the government—convicting Albertini for acts that the government has told him are protected by the first amendment. . . .

<p id="76968537-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do you agree? What if most commentators had criticized the result in <i>Albertini I</i> and predicted that the Supreme Court would reverse it? If there were contrary authority in other circuit courts, would it then become unreasonable for citizens living in the Ninth Circuit to rely on that court’s interpretation of the law? Some might argue that even in that situation, a citizen should still have the right to rely on the “latest controlling court opinion” in his jurisdiction. But the Supreme Court rejected that view. In United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 484 (1984), the Court said that “the existence of conflicting cases from other Courts of Appeals made review of that issue by this Court and against the position of the respondent reasonably foreseeable.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12BF6_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12BF6_12a19b85-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span> Accordingly, in a case presenting a similar issue concerning the foreseeability of a Supreme Court decision issued after a defendant’s alleged <span title="344" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-344">p. 344</span>offense, the Ninth Circuit overruled <i>Albertini II</i> and applied the subsequent Supreme Court decision “retroactively.” It then upheld the conviction of a person whose conduct had been declared lawful under Ninth Circuit precedent in effect at the time he acted. United States v. Qualls, 172 F.3d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir. 1999). In dissent, Judge Hawkins, describing the result as “unfortunate and unfair,” observed (id. at 1139-1140):</p>

<i>Rodgers</i> has the effect of requiring that a citizen look not to the established law of the circuit in which he resides, but to the law of the circuit taking the most expansive view of conduct prohibited by a statute, . . . until that point in time when the Supreme Court resolves any interpretative disagreement among the circuits. This can have the effect of restraining for years conduct that the Court may ultimately decide was always perfectly legal.</p>

<p id="7696ac57-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . There is wide latitude on the lawmakers to declare an offense and to exclude elements of knowledge and diligence from its definition. . . . But we deal here with conduct that is wholly passive—mere failure to register. It is unlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act under circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed. Cf. . . . United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250; United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 284. The rule that “ignorance of the law will not excuse” . . . is deep in our law, as is the principle that of all the powers of local government, the police power is “one of the least limitable.” . . . On the other hand, Due Process places some limits on its exercise. Engrained in our concept of Due Process is the requirement of notice. Notice is sometimes essential so that the citizen has the chance to defend charges. Notice is required before property interests are disturbed, before assessments are made, before penalties are assessed. Notice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty or forfeiture might be suffered for mere failure to act. Recent cases illustrating the point . . . involved only property interests in civil litigation. But the principle is equally appropriate where a person, wholly passive and unaware of any wrongdoing, is brought to the bar of justice for condemnation in a criminal case.</p>
<p id="7696ac58-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Registration laws are common and their range is wide. . . . Many such laws are akin to licensing statutes in that they pertain to the regulation of business activities. But the present ordinance is entirely different. Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking. At most the ordinance is but a law enforcement technique designed for the convenience of law enforcement agencies through which a list of the names and addresses of felons then residing in a given community is compiled. The disclosure is merely a compilation of former convictions already publicly recorded in the jurisdiction where obtained. Nevertheless, this registrant on first becoming aware of her duty to register was given no opportunity to comply with the law and avoid its penalty, even though her default was entirely innocent. She could but suffer the consequences of the ordinance, namely, conviction with the imposition of heavy criminal penalties thereunder. We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. . . . Its severity lies in the absence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it. Where <span title="346" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-346">p. 346</span>a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with Due Process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the community.</p>

<i>1. Questions.</i> What precisely, in Justice Frankfurter’s view, is the “generalization that underlies, and alone can justify” the decision in <i>Lambert</i>? <span title="347" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-347">p. 347</span>Would it invalidate all strict liability legislation, as he seems to imply? Would it invalidate the traditional rule that even a reasonable mistake of law is not a defense? Could the generalization be confined to cases of omissions? Consider, for example, an ordinance that prohibited “convicted persons” from accepting employment as babysitters in the city of Los Angeles.</p>

<i>2. Problem.</i> Bryant was convicted of a sex offense in South Carolina. At the time of his conviction, the sentencing judge informed him of South Carolina’s sex offender registration law, but the judge did not comply with a federal requirement that Bryant also be advised of his obligation to register as a sex offender in any other state to which he might move. Later, Bryant moved to North Carolina and was convicted of a crime when authorities discovered that he had failed to register there. The intermediate appellate court held that under <i>Lambert</i>, Bryant’s conviction for failure to register violated due process. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed. First, that court held, <i>Lambert</i> was distinguishable, because the Los Angeles registration statute was a general law enforcement device rather than a public safety measure. Second, the court said, because all states now have some sort of sex offender registration regime, the case was “overflowing with circumstances” that should have moved Bryant to inquire about the need to register. State v. Bryant, 614 S.E.2d 479, 488 (N.C. 2005). Is the result consistent with the reasoning of <i>Lambert</i>? If not, which is the better approach?</p>

<i>3. Entrapment by omission?</i> As we saw above, it is considered a violation of due process to convict a defendant who reasonably relies on an official assurance that his conduct is lawful. See <i>Raley v. Ohio</i>, p. 342 supra. Should a similar principle afford a defense when a defendant reasonably relies on the failure of a government official to alert him that his conduct will be unlawful?</p>
<p id="7696d374-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">State v. Leavitt, 27 P.3d 622 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001), involved a man who had been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense. The sentencing judge failed to comply with a state law requiring that defendants convicted in such cases be notified that they can no longer possess a firearm. Instead, the judge told Leavitt that he could not possess a firearm during the one-year probation imposed for the misdemeanor. That statement was not false, but it was misleading because Leavitt was also barred from possessing a firearm after the one-year period. Leavitt took his guns to his brother for safekeeping during the year, but after the expiration of his probation, Leavitt got into trouble again, police found guns in his car, and he was convicted of unlawful possession. The Washington court noted that knowledge of illegality was not an element of the firearm-possession offense. Nonetheless, the court reversed the conviction because the “combined actions and inactions of the predicate-sentencing court [in the domestic violence case] misled Leavitt reasonably to understand that his firearm possession restriction was limited to one year. [I]t would be a denial of due process to require Leavitt to speculate about additional firearm-possession restrictions beyond his one-year probation where the sentencing court did not inform him otherwise.” Id. at 628.</p>

<span title="348" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-348">p. 348</span>Is the result sound? In a similar case, the Seventh Circuit reached the opposite result. Wilson’s wife obtained an order of protection against him. In a hearing that lasted only ten minutes, Wilson and his wife discussed child support and visitation, and the state judge explained the terms of the order of protection. State law allowed the judge to require Wilson to give up his firearms as part of the order, but the judge did not do so, apparently because Wilson had not used any weapons to threaten his wife. Nonetheless, a federal statute (not mentioned by the state judge) automatically made firearms possession unlawful under such circumstances. Wilson was convicted of the federal offense and sentenced to 41 months in prison. In United States v. Wilson, 159 F.3d 280, 289 (7th Cir. 1998), the court of appeals affirmed, stating simply that “a ‘knowing’ violation of the statute only requires proof of knowledge by the defendant of the facts that constitute the offense.” In dissent, Chief Judge Richard Posner observed (id. at 293-296):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7696d376-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress created, and the Department of Justice sprang, a trap on Carlton Wilson as a result of which he will serve more than three years in federal prison for an act (actually an omission to act) that he could not have suspected was a crime or even a civil wrong. We can release him from the trap by interpreting the statute under which he was convicted to require the government to prove that the violator knew that he was committing a crime. This is the standard device by which the courts avoid having to explore the outer boundaries of the constitutional requirement of fair notice of potential criminal liability.</p>
<p id="7696d377-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[This law] is not the kind of law that a lay person would intuit existed. . . . Yet the Department of Justice took no steps to publicize the existence of the law until long after Wilson violated it. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7696d378-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal criminal code contains thousands of separate prohibitions, many ridiculously obscure, such as the one against using the coat of arms of Switzerland in advertising, or using “Johnny Horizon” as a trade name without the authorization of the Department of the Interior. The prohibition [at issue here] is one of the most obscure. A person . . . knows or should know that if he is convicted of a felony he will have to get rid of [his] gun; if he doesn’t know, the judge or the probation service will tell him. But should he be made subject to a restraining order telling him to keep away from his ex-wife, . . . it will not occur to him that he must give up the gun unless the judge issuing the order tells him. The judge didn’t tell Wilson; so far as appears, the judge was unaware of the law. Wilson’s lawyer didn’t tell him either—Wilson didn’t have a lawyer. . . . The fact that the restraining order contained no reference to guns may have lulled him into thinking that, as long as he complied with the order and stayed away from his wife, he could carry on as before. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7696fa89-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We want people to familiarize themselves with the laws bearing on their activities. But a reasonable opportunity doesn’t mean being able to go to the local law library and read Title 18. . . . If none of the conditions that make it reasonable to dispense with proof of knowledge of the law is present, then to intone “ignorance of the law is no defense” is to condone a violation of fundamental principles for the sake of a modest economy in the administration of criminal justice.</p>

The purpose of criminal laws is to bring about compliance with desired norms of behavior. . . . This purpose is ill served by keeping the law a secret, which has been the practical upshot of the Department of Justice’s failure . . . either to enforce the law vigorously or to notify the relevant state officials of the law’s existence. . . . The [Supreme] Court voided Lambert’s conviction.

<i>NOTE ON THE “CULTURAL DEFENSE”</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="7696fa8e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should the law address people who come from other countries who violate the law by actions that would be acceptable in their native cultures? An English court faced this issue in Rex v. Esop, 7 C. &amp; P. 456 (1836). A sailor who was a native of Baghdad was convicted for sodomy committed aboard an East India ship while it was docked in London harbor. The court sustained the conviction over the defendant’s objection that sodomy was not a crime in his native land. This kind of cultural defense thus becomes just another variation of a mistake of law, and it typically fails under the general precept that mistake of law does not excuse a crime.</p>
<p id="7696fa8f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But defendants raise cultural defenses in other ways as well. For example, defendants will use their cultural background to argue that a crime should be mitigated to a lesser offense. For instance, a homicide that would otherwise be murder might be mitigated to manslaughter on the basis that the defendant acted in a heat of passion that was produced because of a cultural norm that made the defendant particularly inflamed. See Aahren R. DePalma, I Couldn’t Help Myself—My Culture Made Me Do It: The Use of Cultural Evidence in the Heat of Passion Defense, 28 Chicana/o-Latina/o L. Rev. 1 (2009). For example, defendants who have killed their spouses or children after discovering infidelity by their spouse have claimed that such a betrayal would be particularly shameful in their culture and often produced violent responses against the unfaithful spouse as well as the children. Id. at 6-10.</p>
<p id="7696fa90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The argument in favor of allowing culture to be offered as a defense (either an absolute defense or a defense that mitigates charges) is that it “will advance two desirable ends consistent with the broader goals of liberal society and the criminal law: (1) the achievement of individualized justice for the defendant; and (2) a commitment to cultural pluralism.” James J. Sing, Culture as Sameness: Toward a Synthetic View of Provocation and Culture in the Criminal Law, 108 Yale L.J. 1845, 1847 (1999). Professor Coleman, however, points to a dilemma (96 Colum. L. Rev. at 1094-1096):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7696fa91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Allowing sensitivity to a defendant’s culture to inform the application of laws to that individual [furthers] the idea that the defendant should get as much individualized (subjective) justice as possible. [But what] happens to the victims—almost always minority women and children—when multiculturalism and individualized justice are advanced by dispositive cultural evidence? The answer, both in theory and in practice, is stark: They are denied the <span title="350" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-350">p. 350</span>protection of the criminal laws because their assailants generally go free, either immediately or within a relatively brief period of time. [W]hen cultural evidence is permitted to excuse otherwise criminal conduct, the system effectively is choosing to adopt a different, discriminatory standard of criminality for immigrant defendants, and hence, a different and discriminatory level of protection for victims who are members of the culture in question. . . . Thus, the use of cultural defenses is anathema to another fundamental goal of the progressive agenda, namely the expansion of legal protections for some of the least powerful members of American society: women and children.</p>
</div>
<p id="7696fa92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There has been a lively debate about these issues. Professor Elaine Chiu notes that the criminal justice system already acknowledges the relevance of culture as a mitigating or exonerating factor, but it relies almost exclusively on the discretion of judges and prosecutors to achieve justice in such situations; she condemns the arbitrariness of that approach and proposes greater reliance on a formal doctrinal defense. See Elaine M. Chiu, Culture as Justification, Not Excuse, 43 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1317 (2006). For an analysis supporting a defense, together with a comprehensive review of the contexts in which cultural issues arise, see Alison Dundes Renteln, The Cultural Defense (2004). For a contrary view, see Eliot M. Held &amp; Reid Griffith Fontaine, On the Boundaries of Culture as an Affirmative Defense, 51 Ariz. L. Rev. 237 (2009). The conflict between feminism and multiculturalism in this context is explored in Holly Maguigan, Cultural Evidence and Male Violence: Are Feminist and Multicultural Reformers on a Collision Course in Criminal Courts?, 70 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 36 (1995).</p>

But even under the plurality’s view, the dumping of fish is potentially a federal felony—just under §1512(c)(1), rather than §1519. In any event, the plurality itself acknowledges that the ordinary meaning of §1519 covers Yates’s conduct: [W]hen an ordinary citizen seeks notice of a statute’s scope, he is more likely to focus on the plain text than (as the plurality would have it) on the section number, the superfluity principle, and the <i>noscitur</i> and <i>ejusdem</i> canons.</p>

 . . . The city believes that the ordinance resulted in a significant decline in gang-related homicides. It notes that in 1995, the last year the ordinance was enforced, the gang-related homicide rate fell by 26%. In 1996, after the ordinance had been held invalid, the gang-related homicide rate rose 11%. However, gang-related homicides fell by 19% in 1997, over a year after the suspension of the ordinance. Given the myriad factors that influence levels of violence, it is difficult to evaluate the probative value of this statistical evidence, or to reach any firm conclusion about the ordinance’s efficacy. Cf. Harcourt, Reflecting on the Subject: A Critique of the Social Influence Conception of Deterrence, the Broken Windows Theory, and Order-Maintenance Policing New York Style, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 291, 296 (1998) (describing the “hotly contested debate raging among . . . experts over the causes of the decline in crime in New York City and nationally”).</p>

A facial challenge, to be successful, must demonstrate that no matter how harmful a person’s conduct may be, one can never tell whether the statute covers the situation or not. An as-applied challenge, in contrast, only needs to show that the statute does not have a clear meaning in the context of a particular case. Thus, in State v. Scruggs, 905 A.2d 24 (Conn. 2006), the defendant allegedly caused severe injury to her son’s mental health (and ultimately his suicide) by maintaining an extremely cluttered and unsanitary apartment. She was convicted under a statute making it a crime to willfully place one’s child “in such a situation that . . . the health of such child is likely to be injured.” Such a statute has a clear meaning in core situations of child abuse, such as a physical assault, and it therefore is not unconstitutional <i>on its face</i>. But the Connecticut Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutionally vague <i>as applied</i>, because it was not clear whether the statute was intended to cover what Scruggs had done.</p>
<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="7688ca13-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e">A facial challenge is more difficult to win, but when successful, it renders the statute in question entirely invalid and unenforceable. In <i>Morales</i>, the trial courts had dismissed all charges before reaching any consideration of the facts of individual cases. Thus, in order to prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court, the defendants needed to show that the meaning of the Chicago ordinance could never be clear under any circumstances, and therefore that it was unconstitutional on its face.—<span class="epub-small-caps">EDS</span>.</p>

Their apparent purpose is that they are in the park to play ball. The actual purpose is that they are waiting for drugs. Under this definition of loitering, a group of people innocently sitting in a park discussing their futures would be arrested, while the ‘basketball players’ awaiting a drug delivery would be left alone.”</p>

 . . . The logical implication of the plurality’s assertion is that the police can never issue dispersal orders. For example, in the plurality’s view, it is apparently unconstitutional for a police officer to ask a group of gawkers to move along in order to secure a crime scene.</p>

Section 1.13(10) defines the concept of “material element” to include all elements except those that relate exclusively to statutes of limitation, jurisdiction, venue, and the like. The “material elements” of offenses are thus those characteristics (conduct, circumstances, result) of the actor’s behavior that, when combined with the appropriate level of culpability, will constitute the offense.</p>

It is, at the same time, an unstable rule, because judges are apt to forget its very limited scope. A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew. He suspected the fact; he realised its probability; but he refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able to deny knowledge. This, and this alone, is wilful blindness. It requires in effect a finding that the defendant intended to cheat the administration of justice. Any wider definition would make the doctrine of wilful blindness indistinguishable from the civil doctrine of negligence in not obtaining knowledge.</p>
