<p id="7730f02f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The American Law Institute (ALI), a private nonprofit <span>association</span> founded in 1923, consists of prominent lawyers, judges, and academics committed to clarifying and simplifying the law and improving the administration of justice. Among its early products were a series of “restatements” that sought systematically to organize and summarize the law of torts, contracts, and other common-law fields, as that law had emerged from the common-law process of judicial decision making. In 1935, the Institute, acting on a suggestion from President Roosevelt, approved a project to attempt something similar in the field of criminal law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10023_12a1e9ad-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10023_12a1e9ad-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> But because of the Depression and World War II, the project was postponed, and it did not begin in earnest until 1950. The advisory committee formed for that purpose quickly concluded, however, that the “restatement” approach was ill suited to a project in the field of criminal law. Unlike the law of torts and contracts, criminal law, a complex mixture of statutory and judicial doctrines, had developed with enormous variation from state to state and little coherence or consistency in its underlying principles. An accurate restatement accordingly was neither possible nor desirable. The advisory committee decided instead to begin from first principles and attempt to draft a “model” code that could serve as a basis for comprehensive legislative reform in every American jurisdiction.</p>
<p id="7730f031-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Under the leadership of a Chief Reporter, Professor Herbert Wechsler of Columbia Law School, and an Associate Reporter, Professor Louis B. Schwartz of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, the ALI assembled teams of academics and practitioners who labored over the next ten years to produce a series of “tentative drafts,” followed by an Official Draft that was approved by the ALI in 1962.</p>
<p id="7730f032-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[This Model Penal Code achieved a success that is unprecedented for a project of its kind. ALI approval of the Official Draft triggered a wave of criminal law codification throughout the United States. Over the next 20 years, 34 states enacted codes based to some degree on the Model Penal Code.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10033_12a1e9ad-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10033_12a1e9ad-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> Many of these codes (including those of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Oregon) adhere closely to the Model Penal Code text; others, though they diverge from it, make significant use of Model Penal Code concepts and vocabulary. In addition, courts have come to rely heavily on the Model Penal Code and its accompanying commentaries, even in jurisdictions (such as California and the federal system) that have not recodified their criminal law. Thus, although the Model Penal Code is not, in itself, “law,” and is not legally binding anywhere, it exerts a powerful influence on the content and development of criminal law rules and principles throughout the United States. It has become an essential point of reference in any discussion of what the doctrines of criminal law are or should be.]</p>
