<p id="76e038d4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When only one individual commits a crime, the analysis is relatively straightforward. We ask whether that person committed all of the elements of the offense with the required mens rea. But crimes are often carried out by more than one person. In the case of a burglary, for instance, one person might break and enter a dwelling with the intent to steal something inside, while another person serves as a lookout and a third person planned the entire scheme. The law thus needs to account for those individuals who do not themselves commit the elements of the offense, but who nevertheless participate in and further the criminal activity in other ways.</p>

<b>
<i>2. From common law to statute.</i>
</b> At the common law there were distinct categories of circumstances that rendered a person a liable participant in a course of criminal conduct. These distinctions had consequences for both procedure and punishment. The following excerpts from 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, ch. 3, *34-39, broadly describe those categories.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e05fef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A man may be <i>principal</i> in an offence in two degrees. A principal, in the first degree, is he that is the actor, or absolute perpetrator of the crime; and, in the second degree, he is who is present, aiding, and abetting the fact to be done. Which presence need not always be an actual immediate standing by, within sight or hearing of the fact; but there may be also a constructive presence, as when one commits a robbery or murder, and another keeps watch or guard at some convenient distance. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e05ff0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An <i>accessory</i> is he who is not the chief actor in the offence, nor present at its performance, but is some way concerned therein, either before or after the fact committed. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e05ff1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As to . . . who may be an accessory <i>before</i> the fact, Sir Matthew Hale defines him to be one, who being absent at the time of the crime committed, doth yet procure, counsel, or command another to commit a crime. Herein absence is necessary to make him an accessory; for if such procurer, or the like, be present, he is guilty of the crime as principal. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e05ff2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An accessory <i>after</i> the fact may be, where a person, knowing a felony to have been committed, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76e05ff3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Modern statutes have largely eliminated the significance of these discrete modes of criminal participation. (1) Apart from the accessory after the fact, who is still generally subject to a lesser punishment, the punishment is the same for principals and accessories. (2) It is no longer the case that accessories cannot be convicted until their principal is convicted (although, of course, it must be proved that a crime was committed). (3) It is no longer necessary in most states for a defendant to be charged <i>as an accomplice</i>; the defendant may simply be charged with the substantive crime committed by the person he or she allegedly aided or encouraged.</p>
<p id="76e05ff4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="693" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-693">p. 693</span>These changes are the result of statutes antedating the MPC. These older statutes abolish all distinctions between principals and accessories before the fact and require that all be treated as principals.</p>
<p id="76e05ff5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">See, for example, the federal complicity statute, 18 U.S.C. §2:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e05ff6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.</p>
<p id="76e05ff7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e05ff8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statutes of more recent vintage, influenced by the MPC (see §2.06, Appendix), typically make people who are accomplices of another person accountable for that person’s conduct and define people as accomplices if they solicit that person to commit an offense or aid that person in planning or committing it. See, e.g., N.J. Stat. Ann. tit. 2C, §2C:2-6 (2016).</p>
<p id="76e05ff9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that under these statutory abrogations of the common law, complicity (variously termed “aiding and abetting” or “being an accomplice” or “being an accessory”) is <i>not</i> a separate offense with its own penalty. Rather, complicity is one of the means of committing a substantive offense like murder or rape. The accessory or aider and abetter is charged with whatever substantive crime he or she facilitated, not some separate crime of being an accomplice. In contrast, the offense of accessory after the fact is maintained in many current codes as a separate offense with its own penalty, regardless of what substantive offense is committed by the principal.</p>
<p id="76e05ffa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>
<i>3. Conspiracy as a doctrine of complicity.</i>
</b> An additional basis for holding one person liable for the crimes of another derives from the doctrine of conspiracy. In general terms, a criminal conspiracy is an agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime. Conspiracy is both a separate offense in its own right and a means by which individuals can be held responsible for the substantive crimes committed by others. In some jurisdictions, the individuals in a conspiracy, known as co-conspirators, can be held responsible for the criminal acts of fellow conspirators committed in furtherance of the criminal enterprise, whether or not those particular criminal acts were planned, so long as they were reasonably foreseeable. A co-conspirator, therefore, may be liable in some jurisdictions for the criminal acts of fellow conspirators even though he did not intend those crimes and might not be responsible under the principles of accomplice liability. This problem is explored in the Conspiracy section, in connection with <i>Pinkerton v. United States</i>, p. 766 infra, and the materials following.</p>
<p id="76e05ffb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>
<i>4. Punishment.</i>
</b> Under American law, accomplices and principals are guilty of the same crime and thus subject to the same range of penalties. Of course, degrees of <i>culpability</i> are not always equal between principals and accomplices. Often, accomplices play a minor role in the offense. But sometimes it is the principal who plays the less important role. For example, <span title="694" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-694">p. 694</span>in the distribution of illegal drugs, the actual seller of the drugs is the principal, even though the seller usually is a much lower-level participant than the accomplice who runs the distribution ring. American law deals with such differences in culpability through sentencing discretion or, in jurisdictions with sentencing guidelines, through specified reductions in punishment for those who played only a minor role in the offense. See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§3B1.1-3B1.3 (2016).</p>
<p id="76e05ffc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In statutes with mandatory sentencing provisions, however, there is no room to differentiate between principals and accomplices who play a minor role. Judge Posner criticized this approach in United States v. Ambrose, 740 F.2d 505, 508-509 (7th Cir. 1985), in the course of explaining why a judge should not be bound by the harsh mandatory minimum penalty provisions of the federal “drug kingpin” statute in sentencing a kingpin’s aider and abettor:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0870d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Although the language of] 18 U.S.C. §2(a) [supra] makes clear that an aider and abettor can be punished as severely as the principal, it does not make clear that he must always be punished so severely. History is against such an interpretation. The distinction between “principal” and “aider and abettor” goes back to the time when all felonies carried the same sanction—death. By enabling the courts to punish a class of less culpable offenders—aiders and abettors as distinct from principals—less severely, the distinction introduced a welcome element of gradation into the sentencing of felons. But as judges acquired more and more sentencing discretion, the need to distinguish between principals and aiders and abettors diminished, and since it was sometimes a difficult decision to make there was a movement to abolish it with regard to determining criminal liability. This movement culminated in 18 U.S.C. §2(a). But the purpose was not to make sure that aiders and abettors were always punished as severely as principals. Indeed, in passing the statute Congress must have realized that judges would use their sentencing discretion to proportion the severity of the sentence to the aider and abettor’s fault. The history suggests that, rather than being intended to limit sentencing discretion, the abolition of the distinction between principals and aiders and abettors presupposed such discretion.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e0870e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, eventually overturned its decision in <i>Ambrose</i> and held that an aider and abettor of a drug kingpin <i>is</i> subject to the statutory mandatory minimum penalty faced by the kingpin himself. United States v. Pino-Perez, 870 F.2d 1230 (7th Cir. 1989). Judge Posner again wrote the majority opinion, noting that “[t]he historic purpose of aiding and abetting liability coexists uneasily with criminal offenses that carry mandatory minimum penalties, such as the kingpin statute. . . . But simply lopping off a minimum statutory penalty for one class of violators (aiders and abettors) now strikes us . . . as exceeding the prudent bounds of judicial creativity.” Id. at 1237.</p>
<p id="76e0870f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Academics likewise have criticized the American approach of treating all accomplices as guilty of the same offense as their principals. The proposals for drawing lines, however, vary. For example, Joshua Dressler argues that the law should distinguish between three types of offenders: (1) those accomplices <span title="695" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-695">p. 695</span>who causally contribute to the crime and play a substantial role in the offense; (2) those accomplices who causally contribute to the crime and play a minor role; and (3) those who play no causal role and provide minor assistance. He would have the first two types of offenders be treated as principals, but give the second category of offender a lesser punishment than the principal. Dressler argues those in the third category should be charged with some lesser crime, but not the same crime as the principal. Dressler, Reforming Complicity Law: Trivial Assistance as a Lesser Offense?, 5 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 427, 447 (2008). Is Dressler correct that causation should be a factor? How does that square with Kadish’s argument, supra p. 692, that causation cannot be considered “without doing violence to our concept of a human action as freely chosen”?</p>
<p id="76e08710-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other legal systems draw different lines. For example, the German Penal Code (§25) provides different punishment for the perpetrator, the instigator, and the aider, and the law is rich in doctrine for distinguishing among these classifications of participants. See C. Roxin, Täterschaft und Tatherrschaft (1984).</p>

<p id="76e08715-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The problem of mens rea for complicity is complicated by the presence of two levels of mens rea: that required of the accomplice (the helper or encourager) and that required of the principal (the actual perpetrator). We have already explored in Chapter 3 the way in which mens rea is analyzed for the actual perpetrator. But the mens rea of the accomplice is distinct. A true purpose, often called a specific intent, is generally required to hold a person liable as an accomplice; that is, he must actually intend his action to further the criminal <i>action or conduct</i> of the principal. We explore the meaning of this requirement and qualifications to it in Section A.1.a. We address whether this true purpose must extend to the <i>results</i> and <i>attendant circumstances</i> of the offense in Section A.1.b.</p>

<p id="76e0871d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">John Hicks, an Indian, was jointly indicted with Stand Rowe, also an Indian, for the murder of Andrew J. Colvard, a white man, by shooting him with a gun on the 13th of February, 1892. Rowe was killed by the officers in the attempt to arrest him, and Hicks was tried separately and found guilty in March, 1893. We adopt the statement of the facts in the case made in the brief for the government as correct and as sufficient for our purposes:</p>

<span title="696" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-696">p. 696</span>It appears that on the night of the 12th of February, 1892, there was a dance at the house of Jim Rowe, in the Cherokee Nation; that Jim Rowe was a brother to Stand Rowe, who was indicted jointly with the defendant; . . . that Stand Rowe and the defendant were . . . eluding the United States marshals who were in search of them with warrants for their arrest, and were armed for the purpose of resisting arrest; they appeared at the dance, each armed with a Winchester rifle; they were both Cherokee Indians. The deceased, Andrew J. Colvard, was a white man who had married a Cherokee woman; he [was also at] the dance. . . . A good deal of whiskey was drank [sic] during the night by the persons present, and Colvard appears to have been drunk at some time during the night. Colvard spoke Cherokee fluently, and appears to have been very friendly with Stand Rowe and the defendant Hicks. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e0871f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some time after sunrise on the morning of the 13th [four witnesses] saw Stand Rowe, coming on horseback in a moderate walk, with his Winchester rifle lying down in front of him. . . . Stand Rowe halted within five or six feet of the main road, and the men on the porch saw Mr. Colvard and the defendant Hicks riding together down the main road from the direction of Jim Rowe’s house.</p>
<p id="76e08720-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Colvard and Hicks approached . . . where Stand Rowe was sitting on his horse, Stand Rowe rode out into the road and halted. Colvard then rode up to him in a lope or canter, leaving Hicks, the defendant, some 30 or 40 feet in his rear. The point where the three men were together on their horses was about 100 yards from where the four witnesses stood on the porch. The conversation between the three men on horseback was not fully heard by the four men on the porch, and all that was heard was not understood, because part of it was carried on in the Cherokee tongue; but some part of this conversation was distinctly heard and clearly understood by these witnesses; they saw Stand Rowe twice raise his rifle and aim it at Colvard, and twice he lowered it; they heard Colvard say, “I am a friend to both of you”; they saw and heard the defendant Hicks laugh aloud when Rowe directed his rifle toward Colvard; they saw Hicks take off his hat and hit his horse on the neck or shoulder with it; they heard Hicks say to Colvard, “Take off your hat and die like a man”; they saw Stand Rowe raise his rifle for the third time, point it at Colvard, fire it; . . . they saw Colvard fall from his horse; they went to where he was lying in the road and found him dead; they saw Stand Rowe and John Hicks ride off together after the shooting.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e08721-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Hicks testified [and denied] that he had encouraged Rowe to shoot Colvard, and alleging that he had endeavored to persuade Rowe not to shoot. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e08722-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The language attributed to Hicks, and which he denied having used, cannot be said to have been entirely free from ambiguity. It was addressed not to Rowe, but to Colvard. Hicks testified that Rowe was in a dangerous mood, and that he did not know whether he would shoot Colvard or Hicks. The remark made—if made—accompanied with the gesture of taking off his own hat, may have been an utterance of desperation, occasioned by his belief that Rowe would shoot one or both of them. That Hicks and Rowe rode off together after seeing Colvard fall was used as a fact against Hicks, pointing to a conspiracy between them. Hicks testified that he did it in fear of his life; that Rowe had demanded that he should show him the road which he wished to travel. Hicks <span title="697" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-697">p. 697</span>further testified, and in this he was not contradicted, that he separated from Rowe a few minutes afterwards, on the first opportunity, and that he never afterwards had any intercourse with him, nor had he been in the company of Rowe for several weeks before the night of the fatal occurrence.</p>
<p id="76e0ad33-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Hicks challenged the jury instruction on two grounds. First, it failed to state] that the acts or words of encouragement and abetting must have been used by the accused with the intention of encouraging and abetting Rowe. So far as the instruction goes, the words may have been used for a different purpose, and yet have had the actual effect of inciting Rowe to commit the murderous act. Hicks, indeed, testified that the expressions used by him were intended to dissuade Rowe from shooting. But the jury were left to find Hicks guilty as a principal because the effect of his words may have had the result of encouraging Rowe to shoot, regardless of Hicks’ intention. In another part of the charge the learned judge did make an observation as to the question of intention in the use of the words, saying:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0ad34-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If the deliberate and intentional use of words has the effect to encourage one man to kill another, he who uttered these words is presumed by the law to have intended that effect, and is responsible therefor.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e0ad35-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">This statement is itself defective in confounding the intentional use of the words with the intention as respects the effect to be produced. Hicks no doubt, <i>intended</i> to use the words he did use, but did he thereby <i>intend</i> that they were to be understood by Rowe as an encouragement to act? However this may be, we do not think this expression of the learned judge availed to cure the defect already noticed in his charge, that the mere use of certain words would suffice to warrant the jury in finding Hicks guilty, regardless of the intention with which they were used.</p>
<p id="76e0ad36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Second, Hicks challenged the following] statement:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0ad37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">that if Hicks was actually present at that place at the time of the firing by Stand Rowe, and he was there for the purpose of either aiding, abetting, advising, or encouraging the shooting of Andrew J. Colvard by Stand Rowe, and that, as a matter of fact, he did not do it, but was present for the purpose of aiding or abetting or advising or encouraging his shooting, but he did not do it because it was not necessary, it was done without his assistance, the law says there is a third condition where guilt is fastened to his act in that regard.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e0ad38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We understand this language to mean that where an accomplice is present for the purpose of aiding and abetting in a murder, but refrains from so aiding and abetting because it turned out not to be necessary for the accomplishment of the common purpose, he is equally guilty as if he had actively participated by words or acts of encouragement. Thus understood, the statement might, in some instances, be a correct instruction. Thus, if there had been evidence sufficient to show that there had been a previous conspiracy between Rowe and Hicks to waylay and kill Colvard, Hicks, if present at the time of the killing, would be guilty, even if it was found unnecessary for him to act. But the error of such an instruction, in the present case, is in the fact that <span title="698" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-698">p. 698</span>there was no evidence on which to base it. The evidence . . . shows no facts from which the jury could have properly found that the encounter was the result of any previous conspiracy or arrangement. The jury might well, therefore, have thought that they were following the court’s instructions, in finding the accused guilty because he was present at the time and place of the murder, although he contributed neither by word or action to the crime, and although there was no substantial evidence of any conspiracy or prior arrangement between him and Rowe. . . . The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to set aside the verdict and award a new trial.</p>

The record contains no evidence whatever that Gladstone had any communication by word, gesture or sign, before or after he drew the map, from which it could be inferred that he counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to sell marijuana to Douglas Thompson as charged, or took any steps to further the commission of the crime charged.

<i>1. Aiding and abetting the purchase?</i> The court emphasizes that the defendant was “not charged with aiding and abetting Thompson in the purchase of marijuana, but with Kent’s sale of it.” Could Gladstone have been convicted of aiding and abetting Thompson’s purchase? One problem is that Thompson, the principal, might not be guilty of an offense because of his role as an agent of the police. This problem is treated infra at pp. 733-744. (Note this would not be a problem in a jurisdiction that follows the MPC because the MPC provides for liability for <i>attempt</i> when someone aids and abets or attempts to aid and abet another who does not actually commit the crime. See MPC §2.06(3) &amp; §5.01(3).) But suppose that the student who sought Gladstone’s help was not a police agent. Could Gladstone then be charged with aiding and abetting the student’s purchase? Would Gladstone’s state of mind as to the purchase by the student be any different from his state of mind as to the sale by Kent? In the case of the student purchaser, there would be a “nexus” between Gladstone and the student. If so, would his mens rea then be sufficient to establish accomplice liability?</p>
<p id="76e0fb70-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Aiding and abetting the sale?</i> What kinds of actions by Gladstone might have satisfied the court that the evidence was sufficient to infer that he had the mens rea required for accomplice liability? What if, in an alternative scenario, Gladstone lived with Kent and, observing Thompson hesitate over the price Kent quoted for the sale of marijuana, had commented that it was good stuff and well worth the money? In State v. Wilson, 631 P.2d 362, 364 (Wash. 1981), the court found intent to encourage the sale under similar facts. Or, in another alternative scenario, what if Gladstone had called Kent to see if he was home and had marijuana to sell, and then remained present during the transaction? In a later case, a Washington court of appeals found accomplice liability on similar facts and distinguished <i>Gladstone.</i> The court observed that in <i>Gladstone</i>, there was “no evidence . . . from which it could be inferred that [Gladstone] counseled, encouraged, hired, commanded, induced or procured Kent to sell marijuana,” whereas in the facts before it, the defendant “was present at the scene of the sale, after having personally contacted the seller.” State v. McKeown, 596 P.2d 1100, 1105 (Wash. Ct. App. 1979). Are these decisions proper applications of the <i>Gladstone</i> standard? Is physical presence at the sale by itself enough to distinguish these cases from <i>Gladstone</i>, or are the critical facts the ones that suggest the association with the venture in the form of touting the product or arranging the buy personally ahead of time?</p>

<i>3. The Model Penal Code’s struggle with the mens rea for complicity.</i> Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.06 at 315-316 (1985), states the issue as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0fb72-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Should] knowingly facilitating the commission of a crime . . . be sufficient for complicity, absent a true purpose to advance the criminal end[?] The problem, to be sure, is narrow in its focus: often, if not usually, aid rendered with guilty knowledge implies purpose since it has no other motivation. But there are many and important cases where this is the central question in determining liability. A lessor rents with knowledge that the premises will be used to establish a bordello. A vendor sells with knowledge that the subject of the sale will be used in the commission of a crime. . . . An employee puts through a shipment in the course of his employment though he knows the shipment is illegal. . . . Such cases can be multiplied indefinitely; they have given courts much difficulty when they have been brought, whether as prosecutions for conspiracy or for the substantive offense involved.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e0fb73-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The solution originally proposed by the MPC was contained in §2.04(3)(b) (Tent. Draft No. 1 1953):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0fb74-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if . . . acting with knowledge that such other person was committing or had the purpose of committing the crime, he knowingly, substantially facilitated its commission.</p>

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e0fb76-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The draft, it is submitted, should not embrace the <i>Peoni</i> limitation [referring to Judge Hand’s dictum in <i>United States v. Peoni</i>, quoted in <i>Gladstone</i>, supra]. Conduct which knowingly facilitates the commission of crimes is by hypothesis a proper object of preventive effort by the penal law, unless, of course, it is affirmatively justifiable. It is important in that effort to safeguard the innocent but the requirement of guilty knowledge adequately serves this end—knowledge both that there is a purpose to commit a crime and that one’s own behavior renders aid. There are, however, infinite degrees of aid to be considered. This is the point, we think, at which distinctions should be drawn. Accordingly, when a true purpose to further the crime is lacking, the draft requires that the accessorial behavior substantially facilitate commission of the crime and that it do so to the knowledge of the actor. This qualification provides a basis for discrimination that should satisfy the common sense of justice. A vendor who supplies materials readily available upon the market arguably does not make substantial contribution to commission of the crime since the materials could have as easily been gotten elsewhere.</p>

On the one side are the policy of repressing crime, and the difficulty of distinguishing between the merchant who knowingly assists a crime and the ordinary accessory before the fact. On the other side stand the undesirability of giving too great an extension to the criminal law, and the inconvenience to legitimate trade of requiring a merchant to concern himself with the affairs of his customers. The difficulty is increased by the number of different modes in which the question may arise. The merchant may desire the crime, or he may foresee it as certain if he sells the commodity, or he may foresee it as belonging to one of many degrees of probability. The sale may be completely in the ordinary course of business, or the order may in some way be a special one—as when a tailor makes a suit with secret pockets for poaching or smuggling. The merchant may charge the usual price or an extra price on account of the legal risk. The commodity may be appropriate only to a single crime (as with poison that is consumed only once), or may enable the purchaser to engage in a life of crime. The crime in contemplation may be a serious or a trivial one.</p>

That question of duty corresponds to the problem of the motorist who must decide whether to stop his car and render aid to an accident victim.

<i>4. The seriousness of the substantive offense.</i> Some courts have questioned the assumption that there should be only a single mens rea standard that applies to liability for aiding and abetting. Instead, they propose that the seriousness of the offense should be considered in determining the mens rea required for complicity. In United States v. Fountain, 768 F.2d 790 (7th Cir. 1985), a prison inmate (Gometz) was convicted of aiding and abetting another inmate (Silverstein) in murdering a guard. The evidence disclosed that Silverstein, in handcuffs, was being led down the corridor by some guards. When he reached Gometz’s cell he thrust his manacled hands through the bars. Gometz came close and pulled up his shirt to reveal a knife in his waistband. Somehow Silverstein got free of the handcuffs, seized the knife, and stabbed the guard with it. Judge Posner held that to convict Gometz it was not necessary to prove that it was Gometz’s purpose that Silverstein should kill the guard; it was enough that he knew when he helped Silverstein obtain the knife that Silverstein would use it to attack the guards. In holding that knowledge was enough, the court borrowed the approach of a California conspiracy case (<i>People v. Lauria</i>, reported at p. 756 infra) that held that <i>purpose</i> was required to convict of lesser offenses, but that <i>knowledge</i> sufficed to convict of major crimes. Judge Posner stated (id. at 798):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e12290-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>People v. Lauria</i>—not a federal case, but illustrative of the general point—the court, en route to holding that knowledge of the principal’s purpose would not suffice for aiding and abetting of just any crime, said it would suffice for “the seller of gasoline who knew the buyer was using his product to make Molotov cocktails for terroristic use.” Compare the following hypothetical cases. In the first, a shopkeeper sells dresses to a woman whom he knows to be a prostitute. . . . Little would be gained by imposing criminal liability in such a case. Prostitution, anyway a minor crime, would be but trivially deterred, since the prostitute could easily get her clothes from a shopkeeper ignorant of her occupation. In the second case, a man buys a gun from a gun dealer after telling the dealer that he wants it in order to kill his mother-in-law, and he does kill her. The dealer would be guilty of aiding and abetting the murder. This liability would help to deter—and perhaps not trivially given public regulation of the sale of guns—a most serious crime. We hold that aiding and abetting murder is established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the supplier of the murder weapon knew the purpose for which it would be used.</p>

Section 924(c) provides that “any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime[,]  . . . uses or carries a firearm,” shall receive a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence, with seven- and ten-year minimums applicable, respectively, if the firearm is also brandished or discharged. 18 U.S.C. §924(c)(1)(A).</p>

 . . . The Government prosecuted the §924(c) charge on two alternative theories. The Government’s primary contention was that Rosemond himself used the firearm during the aborted drug transaction. But recognizing that the identity of the shooter was disputed, the Government also offered a back-up argument: Even if it was Joseph who fired the gun as the drug deal fell apart, Rosemond aided and abetted the §924(c) violation.</p>
<p id="76e149aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The district judge instructed the jury] that it could convict if “(1) the defendant knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) the defendant knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking crime.” . . . The jury convicted Rosemond of violating §924(c). . . . The Tenth Circuit affirmed. . . . We granted certiorari . . . to resolve the Circuit conflict over what it takes to aid and abet a §924(c) offense. . . . We find that the trial court erred in instructing the jury. We therefore vacate the judgment below.</p>
<p id="76e149ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The federal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. §2, states that a person who furthers—more specifically, who “aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures”—the commission of a federal offense “is punishable as a principal.” That provision derives from (though simplifies) common-law standards for accomplice liability. . . . And in so doing, §2 reflects a centuries-old view of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out if he helps another to complete its commission. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e149ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As at common law, a person is liable under §2 for aiding and abetting a crime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in furtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facilitating the offense’s commission. . . . The questions that the parties dispute . . . concern how those two requirements . . . apply in a prosecution for aiding and abetting a §924 (c) offense. . . . The prosecutor must show the use or carriage of a gun; so too he must prove the commission of a predicate (violent or drug trafficking) offense. . . . Rosemond therefore could assist in §924(c)’s violation by facilitating either the drug transaction or the firearm use. . . . It is inconsequential . . . that his acts did not advance each element of the offense; all that matters is that they facilitated one component. . . .

<span title="705" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-705">p. 705</span>[A]n aiding and abetting conviction requires not just an act facilitating one or another element, but also a state of mind extending to the entire crime. [U]nder that rule, a defendant may be convicted of abetting a §924(c) violation only if his intent reaches beyond a simple drug sale, to an armed one. . . . And the canonical formulation of that needed state of mind—later appropriated by this Court and oft-quoted in both parties’ briefs—is Judge Learned Hand’s: To aid and abet a crime, a defendant must not just “in some sort associate himself with the venture,” but also “participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about” and “seek by his action to make it succeed.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e149ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have previously found that intent requirement satisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense. . . . So for purposes of aiding and abetting law, a person who actively participates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and character intends that scheme’s commission.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10376_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10376_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> The same principle holds true here: An active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a §924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. In such a case, the accomplice has decided to join in the criminal venture, and share in its benefits, with full awareness of its scope—that the plan calls not just for a drug sale, but for an armed one.</p>
<p id="76e149b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For all that to be true, though, the §924(c) defendant’s knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge—or otherwise said, knowledge that enables him to make the relevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice. When an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate’s design to carry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan, or, if unsuccessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows his intent to aid an armed offense. But when an accomplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene, he may already have completed his acts of assistance; or even if not, he may at that late point have no realistic opportunity to quit the crime. And when that is so, the defendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a crime involving a gun.</p>
<p id="76e149b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both parties here find something to dislike in our view of this issue. Rosemond argues that a participant in a drug deal intends to assist a §924(c) violation only if he affirmatively desires one of his confederates to use a gun. [A]ccording to Rosemond, the instructions must [permit the jury to find] that although the defendant participated in a drug deal knowing a gun would be involved, he did not specifically want its carriage or use. That higher standard, Rosemond claims, is necessary to avoid subjecting persons of different culpability to the same punishment. Rosemond offers as an example an unarmed driver assisting in the heist of a store: If that person spent the <span title="706" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-706">p. 706</span>drive “trying to persuade [his confederate] to leave [the] gun behind,” then he should be convicted of abetting shoplifting, but not armed robbery.</p>
<p id="76e149b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We think not. What matters for purposes of gauging intent, and so what jury instructions should convey, is that the defendant has chosen, with full knowledge, to participate in the illegal scheme—not that, if all had been left to him, he would have planned the identical crime. Consider a variant of Rosemond’s example: The driver of a getaway car wants to help rob a convenience store (and argues passionately for that plan), but eventually accedes when his confederates decide instead to hold up a national bank. Whatever his original misgivings, he has the requisite intent to aid and abet bank robbery . . . . The same is true of an accomplice who knowingly joins in an armed drug transaction—regardless whether he was formerly indifferent or even resistant to using firearms. The law does not, nor should it, care whether he participates with a happy heart or a sense of foreboding. Either way, he has the same culpability, because either way he has knowingly elected to aid in the commission of a peculiarly risky form of offense. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e170c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Government, for its part, thinks . . . the jury should convict such a defendant even if he became aware of the gun only after he realistically could have opted out of the crime.</p>
<p id="76e170c4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But that approach, we think, would diminish too far the requirement that a defendant in a §924(c) prosecution must intend to further an armed drug deal. Assume, for example, that an accomplice agrees to participate in a drug sale on the express condition that no one brings a gun to the place of exchange. But just as the parties are making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of his confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket. The Government would convict the accomplice of aiding and abetting a §924(c) offense if he assists in completing the deal without incident, rather than running away or otherwise aborting the sale. But behaving as the Government suggests might increase the risk of gun violence—to the accomplice himself, other participants, or bystanders; and conversely, finishing the sale might be the best or only way to avoid that danger. In such a circumstance, a jury is entitled to find that the defendant intended only a drug sale—that he never intended to facilitate, and so does not bear responsibility for, a drug deal carried out with a gun. A defendant manifests that greater intent, and incurs the greater liability of §924(c), when he chooses to participate in a drug transaction knowing it will involve a firearm; but he makes no such choice when that knowledge comes too late for him to be reasonably able to act upon it. . . .

<p id="76e170cd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court confuses two fundamentally distinct concepts: intent and motive.

But the intent to undertake some act is of course perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse consequences which would otherwise occur . . . . People wake up, go to work, balance their checkbooks, shop for groceries—and yes, commit crimes—because they believe something bad will happen if they do not do these things, not because the deepest desire of their heart is to do them. A person may only go to work in the morning to keep his or her family from destitution; that does not mean he or she does not intend to put in a full day’s work. In the same way, the fact that a defendant carries out a crime because he feels he must do so on pain of terrible consequences does not mean he does not intend to carry out the crime.

<i>1. Knowledge versus purpose.</i> The Court in <i>Rosemond</i> says that it is a “basic[]” principle of aiding and abetting liability that the defendant must intend to facilitate the offense’s commission. But then the Court says that the intent requirement is “satisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense.” Does that mean knowledge is the relevant standard after all? Is the Court effectively adopting the rejected MPC rule by insisting on knowledge plus active participation? Is the line between active participation and incidental facilitation that the Court references in a footnote a clear one?</p>

<i>2.

The dissent argues that the defendant should be liable as long as he is aware of the gun and persists with the drug deal with that knowledge. Are these competing views based on different assumptions about how easy it would be for a defendant to cease participation in a drug deal without causing additional harm? Or do the majority and dissent have a more fundamental disagreement about the proper scope of accomplice liability that transcends its application to §924(c)?</p>

Criminal facilitation as a stand-alone crime.</i> One response to the debate over the appropriate mens rea for accomplice liability to attach is to compromise: Make aid without a true purpose a separate crime with a lesser penalty than the crime aided. New York has pioneered this approach with a crime called “criminal facilitation.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1042A_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1042A_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> N.Y.

<i>NOTE ON SUBSTANTIVE CRIMES OF FACILITATION</i>

<p id="76e197eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Traditional accomplice liability and liability for some lesser crime of facilitation are not the only options for responding to conduct that aids another to commit an offense. Some legislatures have passed statutes aimed at particular kinds of assistance. There is wide variation in how statutes of this type define the offenses that must be facilitated and the conduct that constitutes unlawful facilitation. In considering the following three examples, weigh the gap-filling potential of each statute against the risks that such statutes may pose, such as the risk of imposing punishment disproportionate to wrongdoing, of chilling speech and association, and of burdening legitimate business.</p>

<b>
<i>1. Juvenile gun possession.</i>
</b> When two teenagers purchased an assault weapon and then murdered 13 people before taking their own lives at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, attention focused on Mark Manes, the 22-year-old computer programmer who sold the boys a TEK-DC9 assault pistol, and later sold them 100 rounds of ammunition the night before the killings. The teenage killers had made a videotape before the crime in which they thanked Manes by name: “[T]hank you to Mark. . . .  Very cool. You helped us do what we needed to.” But the videotape also absolved Manes and others of knowledge of the killers’ plans. One boy said, “Let me tell you this much, they have no clue. So don’t blame them and arrest them for what we did.” The other boy added, “Yeah, you know it’s not their fault. . . . We would have found someone else.” Michael Janofsky, Columbine Killers, on Tape, Thanked 2 for Gun, N.Y. Times, Nov. 13, 1999, at A1.</p>
<p id="76e1befd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What punishment should Manes have received? For what offense? Law enforcement officials had no reason to think that Manes knew, much less intended, that the Columbine shootings would occur. Thus, liability for the murders as an accomplice of the two boys was not an option. Yet, liability under a misdemeanor facilitation statute, such as New York’s, would have resulted in only minor penalties. The statute under which Manes was convicted and sentenced to a six-year prison term (from a maximum penalty of 18 years) lies somewhere between these two options; it specifically targeted the selling of handguns to juveniles: “Any person who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly provides a handgun with or without remuneration to any person <span title="710" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-710">p. 710</span>under the age of eighteen years . . . commits [a] crime. . . . ” Colo. Rev. Stat. §18-12-108.7. This statute obviated the difficulty of an accomplice prosecution by eliminating any mens rea requirement with respect to injuries the juvenile might inflict, and by requiring only recklessness as to the age of the handgun recipient. The statute also avoided the leniency of a general facilitation statute by providing for stiff felony penalties.</p>
<p id="76e1befe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Does the Colorado statute provide a satisfactory solution for defendants like Manes? In cases where the defendant provides a handgun knowing that it will be used in a violent assault, is the statutory penalty severe enough? Conversely, in cases where the defendant only recklessly allows a juvenile access to an unloaded gun and no one is injured, are the statute’s felony sanctions too severe?</p>

<i>2. Material support to terrorism.</i>
</b> Federal legislation punishes the “knowing” provision of “material support” to “terrorists” or to “designated foreign terrorist organizations” (FTOs). 18 U.S.C. §2339A and §2339B. The legislation defines “material support” as broadly including “any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or . . . financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance . . . communications equipment,  . . . lethal substances, . . . personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself), and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.” §2339A(b). The material support is to “terrorists” if the actor knows or intends that it will be used in carrying out one of a long list of specified federal offenses, such as damage to property, illegal use of explosives, the killing of government officials, and the destruction of aircraft. See §2339A(a). The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 increased the maximum term of imprisonment from 10 to 15 years and provided for life imprisonment if the death of any person results from a violation.</p>
<p id="76e1bf00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One commentator has described this statutory scheme as follows (Norman Abrams, The Material Support Terrorism Offenses: Perspectives Derived from the (Early) Model Penal Code, 1 J.

Thus, the statutes require that the contribution of the actor be material, and they put content into the concept of material support by defining it in terms of substantial forms of aid through the specification of listed categories. By thus “hardening up” the actus reus, the drafters made more acceptable a diluted mens rea of knowledge. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76e1bf02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is Abrams right that the material support provisions “harden up” the actus reus of the offense?</p>
<p id="76e1bf03-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project</i>, challengers to the law hoped to convince the Court to read into the statute a heightened mens rea standard based on their view that the actus reus required by the statute was not, in fact, sufficiently stringent. The challengers were citizens and humanitarian organizations that wanted to train members of designated terrorist groups in “how <span title="711" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-711">p. 711</span>to use humanitarian and international law to peacefully resolve disputes” and “how to petition various representative bodies such as the United Nations for relief.” 561 U.S. 1, 14-15 (2010). The Court concluded that these activities fit within the statutory definitions of “training” and “expert advice or assistance” because the statute defined those terms to include imparting a “specific skill” and passing on “specialized knowledge,” which the Court thought covered these activities. Id. at 21-22. The Court rejected the argument that the material support statute should be read to require a specific intent to further the illegal ends of an FTO in order to satisfy due process. Id. at 16-17. The Court concluded that Congress clearly selected knowledge of the organization’s connection to terrorism as the relevant mens rea standard. That reading posed no constitutional vagueness problems, according to the Court, even when it applied to the kinds of acts at issue in the case. Id. Is the Court’s reading consistent with Abrams’s claim that the actus reus is sufficiently limited to justify the “diluted mens rea of knowledge”?</p>
<p id="76e1bf04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also rejected the argument that Congress could not, consistent with the First Amendment, ban support to the legitimate activities of an FTO: “At bottom, plaintiffs simply disagree with the considered judgment of Congress and the Executive that providing material support to a designated [FTO]—even seemingly benign support—bolsters the terrorist activities of that organization. That judgment, however, is entitled to significant weight. . . . ” Id. at 36.</p>
<p id="76e1bf05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the Court’s decision, should the “material support” provisions be amended to require that the support be “substantial” or that it actually facilitate a completed terrorism offense? Without such amendments, is the statute vulnerable to the same criticism leveled at the original MPC proposal with regard to accomplice liability?</p>
<p id="76e1bf06-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another concern about possible statutory overbreadth arises in the context of social media. Individuals (including a 17-year-old) who have used social media to promote and encourage ISIS, for example, have been charged under the material support laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104BE_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N104BE_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span> Should the material support laws reach such conduct? Did the Court’s decision do enough to avoid chilling constitutionally protected speech and association (especially of those who support religious or cultural organizations that may be designated as FTOs)? Some scholars have argued that the material support law chills charitable giving to Muslim organizations. See Sam Adelsberg et al., The Chilling Effect of the “Material Support” Law on Humanitarian Aid: Causes, Consequences, and Proposed Reforms, 4 Harv. Nat’l Sec. J. 282 (2013). Or are these concerns mitigated by the seriousness of the crimes that must be supported and the national security context in which they occur?</p>

<b>
<i>3. Money laundering.</i>
</b> The broadest and most widely used substantive crime of facilitation is the federal legislation against money laundering. The <span title="712" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-712">p. 712</span>two main federal statutes—18 U.S.C. §1956 and §1957—were, like many state statutes against money laundering, passed as part of the war on drugs. People v. Mays, 55 Cal. Rptr. 3d 356, 363 (Ct. App. 2007). Section 1956, the most frequently used money laundering statute, makes it a crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment “to conduct [any] financial transaction . . .  knowing that the transaction is designed . . . to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.” The government is not required to prove the defendant knew the particular offense from which the proceeds were derived; it must prove only that the defendant knew they came from illegal activity of some sort.</p>
<p id="76e1e619-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 1956 shares with other targeted facilitation statutes a lowered mens rea of knowledge. What is distinctive about money laundering—and crucial to its wide use by prosecutors—is the broad range of crimes covered by the term “specified unlawful activity”; the statutory list includes all of the most common crimes and many truly obscure ones. In this way, the offenses facilitated through money laundering are not “targeted” at all. Rather, the mode of facilitation—the “financial transaction”—is targeted. Yet financial transactions are hardly a narrow category; they are defined to include any transaction involving cash or checks. Thus, §1956 potentially reaches any acceptance of ill-gotten gains by a merchant or service provider with whom a wrongdoer deals.</p>
<p id="76e1e61a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second major federal money laundering statute, §1957, is in some ways even broader. It applies only to transactions involving more than $10,000, while §1956 has no minimum dollar threshold.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN104E2_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N104E2_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> But §1957 requires knowledge only of the fact that the transaction involves money from some illegal source, without §1956’s additional requirement of knowledge that the transaction is designed to “conceal or disguise” the tainted nature of the money. The less stringent mens rea of §1957 heightens the risk that ordinary citizens will face prosecution if they deal with someone who has illegal income.</p>
<p id="76e1e61c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a conviction under §1956 or §1957 requires proof that the defendant <i>knew</i> the transaction involved illegal proceeds, this requirement narrows the statute less than might appear. Consider United States v. Campbell, 977 F.2d 854 (4th Cir. 1992). Campbell, a real estate agent, arranged for a client, Lawing, to purchase a vacation home. She sensed that Lawing might be involved with illegal activity because he wanted to pay in cash and seemed somewhat secretive. The Fourth Circuit upheld her conviction under §1957, finding sufficient evidence of the required mens rea because, under the doctrine of “willful blindness” (see pp. 280-287 supra), she had deliberately avoided learning where Lawing’s money <span title="713" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-713">p. 713</span>came from. (Some of the most troublesome convictions under a knowledge mens rea involve a willful blindness theory.) Although Campbell made no unusual profit on the transaction, all that mattered for the §1957 conviction was that she was deemed to know that Lawing was paying with money from some illegal source.</p>
<p id="76e1e61d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Campbell</i> illustrates how modern legislation undercuts the traditional reluctance to impose law enforcement duties on law-abiding citizens: People carrying on normal businesses can be convicted of money laundering if they become aware of the criminal activities of their clients, or if they make a deliberate effort to look the other way. If they aren’t cautious enough, they face prosecution for a serious federal felony. Samuel Buell notes the odd evolution of the money laundering statute from one designed “to deal with the elusive international heroin boss” to one that covers a situation like Campbell’s where “the actor . . . gave no thought to, indeed had no interest in, structuring her activities or otherwise investing resources to evade sanctioning.” As Buell notes, “[o]nly prosecutorial discretion is left to sort the heroin boss from the realtor.” Samuel W. Buell, The Upside of Overbreadth, 83 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1491, 1537 (2008). What makes legislative drafters think there should be liability in these situations that are so far afield from the “elusive international heroin boss” scenario? Is it a retributive impulse, or is it based on utilitarian needs of law enforcement? Some combination of the two?</p>
<p id="76e345ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is a converse problem if people seeking to avoid liability under the money laundering statutes become overly cautious. Consider John K. Villa, A Critical View of Bank Secrecy Act Enforcement and the Money Laundering Statutes, 37 Cath. U. L. Rev. 489, 500-501 (1988):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e36cbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One who suspects a person of offering stolen goods for sale may protect himself by merely declining to purchase the suspect goods. . . . If, on the other hand, it is a crime to do any business at all with one who deals in the proceeds of illegal activity, then those who are merely suspected of crimes will find that . . . no one will risk dealing with them. The impact on the suspected individual can be severe . . . , yet there may be no means by which the suspected individual can clear himself. The social cost of imposing such a stigma on individuals—especially those who have not been convicted of, let alone charged with, any crime—should present grave civil liberties concerns even for the most ardent law-and-order legislator. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">BARROWS</span>, J. Heard on a certification of a question of law before trial. Three indictments for manslaughter, each containing four counts, were brought against the captain and engineer of the steamer <i>Mackinac</i>, as principals, and against Kelley, as accessory before the fact. The steamer carried several hundred passengers from Pawtucket to Newport via Narragansett Bay. The boiler producing the steam by which the vessel was propelled burst near Newport and many lives were lost. The present indictments are for causing the deaths of three persons killed by escaping steam after the explosion of the boiler. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e36cc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same question is raised upon each indictment . . . :</p>

 . . . The charge against Kelley as accessory is that “before said felony and manslaughter was committed,” he did, at Pawtucket, “feloniously and maliciously aid, assist, abet, counsel, hire, command and procure the said George W. McVay and John A. Grant [the captain and engineer, respectively], the said felony and manslaughter in manner and form aforesaid to do and commit.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e393db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because the manslaughter charge is “without malice” and “involuntary,” Kelley contends that he cannot be indicted legally as an accessory before the fact. The argument is that manslaughter, being a sudden and unpremeditated crime, inadvertent and unintentional by its very nature, cannot be “maliciously” incited before the crime is committed. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e393dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While every one must agree that there can be no accessory before the fact when a killing results from a sudden and unpremeditated blow, we do not think it can be broadly stated that premeditation is inconsistent with every charge of manslaughter. Manslaughter may consist, among other things, of doing an unlawful act resulting in unintentional killing, such as violation of motor vehicle laws or administration of drugs to procure an abortion. Manslaughter is likewise committed if an unintentional killing is occasioned by gross negligence in the doing of an act lawful in itself. There is no inherent reason why, prior to the commission of such a crime, one may not aid, abet, counsel, command, or procure the doing of the unlawful act or of the lawful act in a negligent manner. A premeditated act may be involved in such unlawful homicides.</p>
<p id="76e393dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he present indictment for involuntary manslaughter is not self-contradictory when it charges Kelley to be an accessory before the fact. It was possible for him at Pawtucket to intentionally direct and counsel the grossly negligent act which the indictment charges resulted in the crime. Involuntary manslaughter . . . means that defendants exercised no conscious volition to take life, but their negligence was of such a character that criminal intention can be presumed. The crime was consummated when the explosion <span title="715" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-715">p. 715</span>occurred. The volition of the principals was exercised when they chose negligently to create steam which the boiler could not carry. The doing of the act charged or failure to perform the duty charged was voluntary and intentional in the sense that defendants exercised a choice among courses of conduct. It is obvious that Kelley could participate and is charged with participating in procuring defendants to act in a grossly negligent manner prior to the explosion. . . . Specific duties are stated to have been laid upon the captain and engineer. Defendant is charged with full knowledge of those duties and of the fact that the boiler was unsafe. He is charged with counseling and procuring the principals at Pawtucket to disregard their duties and negligently create steam. . . . [A] jury might find that defendant Kelley, with full knowledge of the possible danger to human life, recklessly and willfully advised, counseled, and commanded the captain and engineer to take a chance by negligent action or failure to act. . . .

Indeed, an accomplice to third degree murder does not intend to aid an unintentional murder; he intends to aid a malicious act which results in a killing. Suppose an accomplice hands a gun to the principal and says “shoot that victim—I don’t care if he dies or not, but shoot him.” The principal shoots the victim in the leg, but the victim dies—it is classic third degree murder, there being no proof of specific intent to kill, but a clearly malicious act regardless of the consequences. The same logic that enables a murder charge against the principal binds the accomplice as well—both committed an intentional malicious act that resulted in the death of another, and both are guilty of the murder charge that follows. . . .

<i>1. Accomplice liability based on the same mental state as the substantive offense.</i> We have already seen the debate over specific intent versus knowledge, supra pp. 695-709, and the general rule that accomplice liability requires specific intent. But specific intent with respect to which offense elements? <i>McVay</i> and <i>Roebuck</i> make clear that there is a distinction between conduct elements and result elements. These cases recognize that for accomplice liability, the accomplice must have specific intent to further the underlying <i>conduct</i> committed by the principal, but for the <i>result</i>, he need only have the mens rea required for the result element of the substantive offense.</p>

<i>2. The Model Penal Code on the mens rea required for results.</i> As <i>Roebuck</i> makes clear, the MPC is in accord with the analysis in <i>McVay.</i> Is the MPC’s approach with respect to results consistent with its rejection of knowledge as a sufficient mens rea for accomplice liability? Why might the drafters have drawn a distinction between the mens rea one needs with respect to conduct and the mens rea one needs with respect to results?</p>

<i>3. Problems.</i> Consider the following problems: <b>

</b> Passenger is in a hurry to catch a flight and asks Taxi Driver to get him to the airport on time and “do whatever it takes.” Taxi Driver drives over the speed limit and generally drives aggressively. Taxi Driver hits and kills the driver of another car after speeding through a stop sign.

Does Walt have the mens rea with respect to the result? Does Walt have the requisite mens rea with respect to the conduct element? What if before giving Jesse his keys, Walt asked Jesse to pick him up some pretzels at a convenience store on the way home? See People v. Childress, 363 P.3d 155, 166 (Colo. 2015).</p>

How should the question of the proper mens rea for attendant circumstances in cases of accomplice liability be resolved? Consider the following problems.</p>
<p id="76e3e219-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) A</i> is a convicted felon in a jurisdiction where it is a crime for convicted felons to possess firearms. <i>B</i> provides <i>A</i> with a firearm without knowing of <i>A</i>’s felony conviction. Should <i>B</i> be liable as an accomplice to <i>A</i>’s offense of possession? Hasn’t <i>B</i> helped <i>A</i> to violate the statute? On the other hand, has <i>B</i> intended to help <i>A</i> commit a crime? One federal court has held liability improper, absent proof that <i>B</i> knew or should have known of <i>A</i>’s status as a convicted felon. United States v. Gardner, 488 F.3d 700, 714 (6th Cir. 2007). Another federal court, in contrast, holds that because <i>A</i> is strictly liable for knowing his felon status, no greater mens rea should be required for <i>B.</i> United States v. Canon, 993 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1993). Are the justifications for strict liability in the case of <i>A</i> equally strong with respect to <i>B</i>? If not, is the <i>Gardner</i> court right to permit liability on the basis of negligence? If Gladstone’s <i>knowing</i> assistance was insufficient for liability in the absence of purpose to aid, why should mere negligence be sufficient in the case of <i>B</i>?</p>
<p id="76e3e21a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) B</i> encourages <i>A</i> to have sexual relations with a female <i>F. F</i> is under the age of consent, but <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> both reasonably believe that she is an adult. If the crime of statutory rape imposes strict liability, <i>A</i> is guilty of rape. Should <i>B</i> be liable as an accomplice? <i>B</i> did, after all, assist <i>A</i> in committing the rape. But did <i>B</i> intend to aid a crime? A court in Massachusetts concluded that it was appropriate to hold <i>B</i> liable without instructing the jury that it had to find that <i>B</i> had knowledge of the victim’s age, at least where <i>B</i> was present at the scene and had the opportunity to make judgments about the child’s age. Commonwealth v. Harris, 904 N.E.2d 478, 485 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009). But a contrary decision from North Carolina requires the jury to find that <i>B</i> had knowledge of the victim’s age. State v. Bowman, 656 S.E.2d 638, 648-650 (N.C. Ct. App. 2008). Which is the better view? Are the arguments for and against strict liability for the principal perpetrator in the context of statutory rape equally relevant for the accomplice or is the case for strict liability less powerful for the latter?</p>

<i>5. Reconsidering</i> Rosemond. Recall that the Supreme Court in <i>Rosemond</i>, supra p. 704, concluded that a defendant need not intend that a gun be used to be guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. §924(c) under an accomplice theory. Some scholars suggest that the only way in which <i>Rosemond</i> is consistent with precedent is to consider the gun element an attendant circumstance and not a conduct element. See Kit Kinsport, <i>Rosemond</i>, Mens Rea, and the Elements of Complicity, 52 San Diego L. Rev. 133, 156 (2015). Compare Stephen P. Garvey, Reading <i>Rosemond</i>, Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 233, 243 (2014) (arguing that to characterize the firearm aspect of §924(c) as an attendant <span title="719" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-719">p. 719</span>circumstance is not convincing given the conduct involved in “us[ing] and carry[ing]” a firearm).</p>

<i>6. Comparison to liability for attempt.</i> With respect to the <i>result</i> element of crimes, we have seen that the MPC, along with the common law and most American statutes, is more demanding in prosecutions for attempt than in prosecutions for complicity. When a defendant is charged with attempt, the MPC requires that the defendant have the purpose to produce the proscribed result or the belief that his conduct will cause the result, even when recklessness or some lesser mens rea would suffice for conviction of the completed offense. Recall the <i>Smallwood</i> case, supra p. 644. But when a defendant is charged with complicity in an offense, the required mens rea for resulting harm is not purpose, but only the mens rea required for the commission of the charged offense. What difference between aiding and abetting a completed crime and the offense of attempt might explain the different mens rea provisions for results? Is it that the retaliatory impulse is stronger when there is resulting harm?</p>
<p id="76e4092d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When it comes to <i>attendant circumstances</i>, in contrast, the MPC is <i>less</i> demanding in cases of attempt than in cases of complicity, holding that the mens rea for attendant circumstances in cases of attempt is not purpose, but only the mens rea required for the completed crime. So in a statutory rape hypothetical like the one in Note 4(b), a person who tries but is prevented from having sex when the female is underage would be guilty of attempted statutory rape, even if he had no grounds to suspect that she was underage. Why does the MPC refuse to impose a similar, lower mens rea for attendant circumstances in cases of complicity but instead leave this decision to the courts? What might have led to the greater caution about mens rea for attendant circumstances in the context of complicity than in the context of attempt? Do the examples in Note 4 offer guidance? Consider the sweep of this approach if the MPC adopted the same mens rea for attendant circumstances in strict liability cases. In the <i>Dotterweich</i> case (supra p. 304), would it mean that the defendant’s wife could be held liable if she wakes him in the morning so he can get to work on time, and therefore aids him in selling what turns out to be contaminated aspirin?</p>

During the course of the battle, Patrick Daly, a public school principal looking for a child who had left school, was fatally wounded by a single stray bullet. Defendants were all charged with second-degree murder. Although ballistics tests were inconclusive in determining which defendant fired the bullet that killed Daly, the theory of the prosecution was that each of them “intentionally aided” the <span title="720" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-720">p. 720</span>defendant who fired the fatal shot (Penal Law §20.00).

Defendants urge, however, that the evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding that they—as adversaries in a deadly gun battle—shared the “community of purpose” necessary for accomplice liability. We disagree.

Both defendants were convicted of criminally negligent homicide, but Moon asserted that he was not responsible for Abbott’s actions and that his conviction should be set aside. Rejecting this argument, the court found that, although Moon did not strike the victim’s car and was Abbott’s adversary in a competitive race, he intentionally participated with Abbott in an inherently dangerous and unlawful activity and therefore shared Abbott’s culpability. Moon’s “conduct made the race possible” in the first place, as there would not have been a race had Moon not “accepted Abbott’s challenge.”</p><p id="76e40936-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, the jurors were instructed: “If you find that the People have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants took up each other’s challenge, shared in the venture and unjustifiably, voluntarily and jointly created a zone of danger, then each is responsible for his own acts and the acts of the others . . . [and] it makes no difference [whose bullet] penetrated Mr. Daly and caused his death.”</p><p id="76e40937-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]here was adequate proof to justify the finding that the three defendants tacitly agreed to engage in the gun battle that placed the life of any innocent bystander at grave risk and ultimately killed Daly.

<span class="epub-small-caps">KREMER</span>, J. [Defendant Luparello wanted to locate Terri, his former lover who had deserted him to marry another. He thought he could discover her whereabouts from Mark Martin, a good friend of her current husband. To that end he enlisted the help of several friends, telling them that he wanted the information at any cost. His friends visited Martin but failed to get the information they sought. They returned the next evening armed with gun and <span title="722" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-722">p. 722</span>sword, but without Luparello apparently, and lured Martin outside. Thereupon one of their group, waiting in a car, shot and killed Martin. Luparello was convicted of murder.]</p>
<p id="76e43056-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court charged the jury with several different theories by which Luparello’s guilt for first degree murder could be affixed; among these were  . . . aiding and abetting. On appeal . . . Luparello . . . attacks the theoretical underpinnings of . . . aiding-and-abetting liability, and specifically argues the murder here was the unplanned and unintended act of a coconspirator and therefore not chargeable to Luparello under complicity theory.</p>
<p id="76e43057-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Luparello first faults [the] theor[y] for “imposing” the mens rea of the perpetrator upon him. As Luparello views it, [the] theor[y] work[s] to presume conclusively the accomplice shares the perpetrator’s intent. . . .  Luparello errs when he concludes the perpetrator and accomplice must “share” an identical intent to be found criminally responsible for the same crime. Technically, only the perpetrator can (and must) manifest the mens rea of the crime committed. Accomplice liability is premised on a different or, more appropriately, an equivalent mens rea. This equivalence is found in intentionally encouraging or assisting or influencing the nefarious act. . . . Thus, to be a principal to a crime . . . the aider and abettor must intend to commit the offense or to encourage or facilitate its commission. Liability is extended to reach the actual crime committed, rather than the planned or “intended” crime, on the policy [that] aiders and abettors should be responsible for the criminal harms they have naturally, probably and foreseeably put in motion. And it is precisely this policy which Luparello next challenges. . . .

 . . . The major fallacy I see in the “foreseeable consequence” doctrine is not so much that it attributes an unintended act to the accomplice/co-conspirator but rather that it assesses the degree of his culpability for that act not by his own mental state but rather by the mental state of the perpetrator and/or the circumstances of the crime. . . . The assault on Mark Martin contemplated by the conspiracy involved a foreseeable risk of death or serious injury. We can assume (although there was no jury finding on the issue) that Luparello was criminally negligent in failing to appreciate the degree of risk. Under usual circumstances, a person negligently causing the death of another is guilty, at most, of involuntary manslaughter. Here, however, Luparello’s liability is not based on his individual mental state but instead turns on the jury’s finding that the unidentified shooter intentionally killed Martin while lying in wait. Thus, Luparello is guilty of first degree murder. If the circumstances of Luparello’s participation were exactly the same but the shooter did not “lie in wait,” Luparello could only be convicted of second degree murder. I am intrigued by the notion that if unknown to Luparello, the shooter ingested drugs and/or alcohol to the point where he did not in fact harbor the requisite malice, Luparello would presumably be guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. . . .  I find such fortuity of result irrational. So too, apparently, do Professors LaFave and Scott in their treatise [Handbook on Criminal Law (1972) p. 516]:</p>

<p id="76e4576f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “natural and probable consequence” rule of accomplice liability, if viewed as a broad generalization, is inconsistent with more fundamental principles of our system of criminal law. It would permit liability to be predicated upon negligence even when the crime involved requires a different state of mind. Such is not possible as to one who has personally committed a crime, and should likewise not be the case as to those who have given aid or counsel.</p>

To Miller’s request for an explanation, he replied that he was avenging Miller’s earlier stickup of one of his own group. Roy was convicted as an accomplice to Ross’s armed robbery. The trial court included an instruction that it would suffice to find defendant liable if the robbery was the natural and probable consequence of the illegal attempt to sell a handgun, even if he did not intend Ross to rob Miller.

Without inserting additional phrases or adjectives into the calculus, we think that our precedents require the government to prove a good deal more than that.

If we were to accept the government’s position, then the robbery of any buyer or seller in a drug or unlicensed pistol sale would be viewed as the “natural and probable consequence” of that transaction, for a participant in any illegal project may well be reluctant to invoke the aid of the constabulary. . . .

<i>1. State of the law.</i> A substantial number of jurisdictions have embraced the natural and probable consequences test used in the <i>Luparello</i> case. See John F. Decker, The Mental State Requirement for Accomplice Liability in American Criminal Law, 60 S.C. L. Rev. 237 (2008). But the natural and probable consequences test remains controversial, and only 20 states clearly <span title="726" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-726">p. 726</span>endorse it. Id. at 312. For a recent example of a court rejecting the test, see Commonwealth v. Knox, 105 A.3d 1194 (Pa. 2014). Even the California Supreme Court has limited the reach of <i>Luparello</i>. In People v. Chiu, 59 Cal. 4th 155 (2014), the court reaffirmed the general validity of the natural and probable consequences doctrine applied in <i>Luparello</i>, including in the context of second-degree murder prosecutions, but held that an aider and abettor could not be convicted of <i>first-degree</i> premeditated murder under that doctrine. The court reasoned:</p>

It requires more than a showing of intent to kill; the killer must act deliberately, carefully weighing the considerations for and against a choice to kill before he or she completes the acts that caused the death.

<i>2. Comparison to</i> Pinkerton <i>doctrine.</i> The natural and probable consequences doctrine is similar, though not identical, to the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine developed in conspiracy law. Under <i>Pinkerton</i>, a defendant who is guilty of conspiring to commit one offense may be convicted of other offenses that his co-conspirators commit if those additional offenses further the conspiratorial objective and are reasonably foreseeable consequences of the conspiratorial agreement. In a jurisdiction that embraces the natural and probable consequences doctrine, the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine does not add much because any case that could be brought under <i>Pinkerton</i> could already be brought under the natural and probable consequence theory of accomplice liability. But in the majority of jurisdictions that reject the natural and probable consequences doctrine, <i>Pinkerton</i> provides an avenue for going beyond the limits of traditional accomplice liability. Note, however, that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability is a more limited expansion of traditional accomplice liability than the natural and probable consequences doctrine because <i>Pinkerton</i> requires an agreement and imposes the additional requirement that, to charge any crimes beyond the crime the conspirators conspire to commit, the prosecution must show that those additional crimes were committed to further the conspiracy. See the discussion of the <i>Pinkerton</i> case infra at pp. 766-779.</p>

One who solicits an end, or aids or agrees to aid in its achievement, is an accomplice in whatever means may be employed, insofar as they constitute an offense fairly envisaged in the purposes of the association.

<span class="epub-small-caps">LORD GODDARD</span>, C.J. This is a Case stated by the metropolitan magistrate at Bow Street Magistrate’s Court before whom the appellant, Herbert William Wilcox, the proprietor of a periodical called “Jazz Illustrated,” was charged on an information that</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e4a5ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">on Dec. 11, 1949, he did unlawfully aid and abet one Coleman Hawkins in contravening art. 1(4) of the Aliens Order, 1920, by failing to comply with a condition attached to a grant of leave to land, to wit, that the said Coleman Hawkins should take no employment paid or unpaid while in the United Kingdom, contrary to art. 18(2) of the Aliens Order, 1920. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76e4a5ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case is concerned with the visit of a celebrated professor of the saxophone, a gentleman by the name of Hawkins who was a citizen of the United States. He came here at the invitation of two gentlemen of the name of Curtis and Hughes, connected with a jazz club which enlivens the neighborhood of Willesden. . . . Mr. Hawkins . . . arrived with four French musicians. When they came to the airport, among the people who were there to greet them was the appellant. He had not arranged their visit, but he knew they were coming and he was there to report the arrival of these important musicians for his magazine. So, evidently, he was regarding the visit of Mr. Hawkins as a matter which would be of interest to himself and the magazine which he was editing and selling for profit. Messrs. Curtis and Hughes arranged a concert at the Princes Theatre, London. The appellant attended that concert as a spectator. He paid for his ticket. Mr. Hawkins went on the stage and delighted the audience by playing the saxophone. The appellant did not get up and protest <span title="728" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-728">p. 728</span>in the name of the musicians of England that Mr. Hawkins ought not to be here competing with them and taking the bread out of their mouths or the wind out of their instruments. It is not found that he actually applauded, but he was there having paid to go in, and, no doubt, enjoying the performance, and then, lo and behold out comes his magazine with a most laudatory description, fully illustrated, of this concert. On those facts the magistrate has found that he aided and abetted.</p>
<p id="76e4a5af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reliance is placed by the prosecution on R. v. Coney ((1882), 8 Q.B.D. 534) which dealt with a prize fight. This case relates to a jazz band concert, but the particular nature of the entertainment provided, whether by fighting with bare fists or playing on saxophones, does not seem to me to make any difference to the question which we have to decide. The fact is that a man is charged with aiding and abetting an illegal act, and I can find no authority for saying that it matters what that illegal act is, provided that the aider and abettor knows the facts sufficiently well to know that they would constitute an offence in the principal. In <i>R. v. Coney</i> the prize fight took place in the neighborhood of Ascot, and four or five men were convicted of aiding and abetting the fight. The conviction was quashed on the ground that the chairman had not given a correct direction to the jury when he told them that, as the prisoners were physically present at the fight, they must be held to have aided and abetted. That direction, the court held, was wrong, it being too wide. The matter was very concisely put by Cave, J., whose judgment was fully concurred in by that great master of the criminal law, Stephen, J. Cave, J., said (8 Q.B.D. 540): “Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury.”</p>
<p id="76e4a5b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There was not accidental presence in this case. The appellant paid to go to the concert and he went there because he wanted to report it. He must, therefore, be held to have been present, taking part, concurring, or encouraging, whichever word you like to use for expressing this conception. It was an illegal act on the part of Hawkins to play the saxophone or any other instrument at this concert. The appellant clearly knew that it was an unlawful act for him to play. He had gone there to hear him, and his presence and his payment to go there was an encouragement. He went there to make use of the performance, because he went there, as the magistrate finds and was justified in finding, to get “copy” for his newspaper. It might have been entirely different, as I say, if he had gone there and protested, saying: “The musicians’ union do not like you foreigners coming here and playing and you ought to get off the stage.” If he had booed, it might have been some evidence that he was not aiding and abetting. If he had gone as a member of a claque to try to drown the noise of the saxophone, he might very likely be found not guilty of aiding and abetting. In this case it seems clear that he was there, not only to approve and encourage what was done, but to take advantage of it by getting “copy” for his paper. In those circumstances there was evidence on which the magistrate could find that the appellant aided and abetted, and for these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal fails. . . .

<i>1. Onlookers.</i> Would the finding of accomplice liability for Wilcox apply equally to any member of the audience who, knowing that it was illegal for Coleman Hawkins to perform in the United Kingdom, clapped politely? Does that act seem too minimal under the circumstances? Does it seem equally troubling to hold liable as accomplices those who clap, cheer, or yell encouragement during a violent assault, like a rape? In a famous Massachusetts case, on which the film <i>The Accused</i> was loosely based, six men were charged with raping a young woman on a pool table in a New Bedford tavern. Four were convicted, based on evidence that they had each committed forced sex acts on the woman, but two were acquitted in the absence of any evidence of direct participation in the assaults, despite evidence that they had verbally encouraged the sex acts, including one man’s admission that he had yelled, “Go for it! Go for it!” while the others were raping the victim. See Two Convicted, Two Acquitted in Barroom Gang Rape, U.P.I., Mar. 23, 1984. Should the two men who were acquitted have been convicted as accomplices to the rapes? Should mere presence, without clapping or cheering, be sufficient for crimes like gang rape, dog fighting, and drag racing, that are, in many respects, motivated by a desire to perform for an audience? Although mere presence is not enough for accomplice liability, 48 states have outlawed the knowing and intentional presence at a dog fight, as has the federal government with passage of the Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act in 2014. Other states have done the same for being present at drag races. Some argue this approach should apply to those who witness gang rapes. Kimberley K. Allen, Note, Guilt by (More Than) Association: The Case for Spectator Liability in Gang Rapes, 99 Geo. L.J. 837 (2011). What is (or should be) the liability of a person who turns the corner of a side street and sees two men raping a third person? Does the bystander have a duty to intervene or summon help? If he does not summon help but stays to watch, does he become an accomplice to the rape?</p>

<i>2. Speech.</i> Because the actus reus for accomplice liability can consist entirely of speech, it arguably raises First Amendment concerns, which the <i>Wilcox</i> case highlights. (Recall that Wilcox was covering the concert as a reporter.) Does the requirement that the accomplice intend to facilitate criminal conduct act as a sufficient check against prosecutors who might threaten First Amendment interests? Eugene Volokh argues that this heightened standard does not do much work: “[M]ost speakers of crime-facilitating speech will know that the speech may facilitate crime, but relatively few will clearly intend this. For many speakers, their true mental state will be hard to determine, because their words may be equally consistent with intention to facilitate crime and with mere knowledge. This means that any conclusion about the speaker’s purpose will usually just be a guess.” Volokh, Crime-Facilitating Speech, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 1095, 1185-1186 (2005). What limits, if any, should be placed on accomplice liability to account for this concern? <i>Wilcox</i> remains good law, but should accomplice liability be modified to require more of an actus reus? Should accomplice liability require a showing <span title="730" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-730">p. 730</span>of <i>significant</i> or <i>substantial</i> aid or encouragement?

<p id="76e4ccca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On an impeachment proceeding against Judge Tally, it was established as follows: Ross had seduced Judge Tally’s sister-in-law. Her brothers, the Skeltons, followed Ross to the nearby town of Stevenson, in order to kill him. Judge Tally went to the local telegraph office at Scottsboro and while there learned that one of Ross’s relatives had sent Ross a telegram warning, “Four men on horseback with guns following. Look out.” Judge Tally then sent his own telegram to the telegraph operator at Stevenson (whom he knew), telling him not to deliver the warning telegram to Ross. The operator received both telegrams and failed to deliver the message to Ross. The Skelton brothers caught up with Ross and killed him. On these facts, the court held that the judge was an accomplice of the Skelton brothers in the killing:]</p>
<p id="76e4cccb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We are therefore clear to the conclusion that before Judge Tally can be found guilty of aiding and abetting the Skeltons to kill Ross, it must appear that his vigil at Scottsboro to prevent Ross from being warned of his danger was by preconcert with them, or at least known to them, whereby they would naturally be incited, encouraged and emboldened, “given confidence” to the deed, or that he aided them to kill Ross, contributed to Ross’s death in point of physical fact by means of the telegram he sent to Huddleston [the telegraph operator]. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e4cccc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The assistance given, however, need not contribute to the criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it. It is quite enough if the aid merely renders it easier for the principal actor to accomplish the end intended by him and the aider and abettor, though in all human probability the end would have been attained without it. If the aid in homicide can be shown to have put the deceased at a disadvantage, to have deprived him of a single chance of life, which but for it he would have had, he who furnishes such aid is guilty though it can not be known or shown that the dead man, in the absence thereof, would have availed himself of that chance. As where one counsels murder he is guilty as an accessory before the fact, though it appears to be probable that murder would have been done without his counsel, and as where one being present by concert to aid if necessary is guilty as a principal in the second degree, though had he been absent murder would have been committed, so where he who facilitates murder, even by so much as destroying a single chance of life the assailed might otherwise have had, he thereby supplements the efforts of the perpetrator, and he is guilty as principal in the second degree at common law, and is principal in the first degree under our statute, notwithstanding it may be found that in all human probability the chance would not have been availed of, and death would have resulted anyway.</p>

<p id="76e4cccf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Causation and complicity.</i> As <i>Tally</i> and <i>Wilcox</i> make clear, it is not necessary to establish a but-for relation between the defendant’s action and the criminal conduct of another to establish accomplice liability. What is the justification for holding someone liable for a crime if it would have occurred anyway? Is it based on retributive concerns? Utilitarian arguments? Both? Consider in this respect the New Bedford gang rape case. The spectators certainly seem morally blameworthy. And even if encouragement or aid may not be a but-for cause of criminal conduct, it makes crime more likely to occur.</p>
<p id="76e4f2e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Attempted complicity?</i> We just noted that even a minimal possibility of actual aid or encouragement suffices for accessorial liability.</p>

</ol>
<p id="76e4f2e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>Hicks</i> and the first <i>Tally</i> hypothetical, there is attempted encouragement or aid to the person who commits the crime, but none is in fact rendered. What should be the liability of the defendants? Under the law before the MPC, there would be no liability. See J.C. Smith, Aid, Abet, Counsel or Procure, in Reshaping the Criminal Law 132-133 (P.R. Glazebrook ed., 1978): “An attempt to counsel . . . does not amount to counselling. Advice or encouragement proffered at the scene of the crime but not communicated to the mind of the principal offender does not amount to aiding and abetting.”</p>
<p id="76e4f2e8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These difficulties are avoided by the MPC, §2.06(3), and the jurisdictions that follow its lead.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109FE_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109FE_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span> Defendants in the first <i>Tally</i> hypothetical would be accomplices because a person acting with the required mens rea is an accomplice whether the person aids or “attempts to aid” another person in planning or committing the offense. Moreover, §2.06(3)(a)(i) makes solicitation the <span title="732" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-732">p. 732</span>basis for accomplice liability, and §5.02(2) provides that solicitation is established even if the actor fails to communicate with the person he solicits to commit the crime. (Note that in the third <i>Tally</i> hypothetical, the defendants are accomplices at common law and under the MPC to an attempted homicide because the pursuers passed the line of mere preparation by getting close enough to the intended victim.) In support of its position, the Comment to the MPC observes (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.06 at 314 (1985)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e4f2ea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The inclusion of attempts to aid may go in part beyond present law, but attempted complicity ought to be criminal, and to distinguish it from effective complicity appears unnecessary where the crime has been committed. Where complicity is based upon agreement or solicitation, one does not ask for evidence that they were actually operative psychologically on the person who committed the offense; there ought to be no difference in the case of aid.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e4f2eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note the difficulty introduced in the second <i>Tally</i> hypothetical. Here the crime the defendant tried to aid is not committed. Section 2.06(3) does not cover the situation. Do you see why? How should it be dealt with? The MPC solution to this problem is sketched in the Comment to §2.06 supra, at 314 n.46:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e4f2ec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 2.06(3) of the Model Code is predicated . . . on the actual commission of an offense by the person aided. Assuming the requisite culpability, one who aids, or attempts to aid, or agrees to aid, is thus liable under this section only if the principal actor actually commits an offense. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e4f2ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Where the principal actor commits neither the completed offense nor an attempt, however, a different situation is presented. The purported accomplice in that situation would not be liable under Section 2.06 because he did not aid in the commission of a crime. His conduct designed to render aid may be criminal, however, either as an attempt (Section 5.01(3)) or, in the case of preconcert, as criminal conspiracy (Section 5.03(1)(b)). In both situations liability for the abortive effort plainly seems appropriate.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e519fe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Complicity by omission.</i> Can a person become an accomplice by failing to act to prevent another from committing a crime? Consistent with the general approach to determining criminal liability for omissions, the MPC provides that a person can be an accomplice if he has a legal duty to prevent the offense and he fails to do so with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime. §2.06(3)(a)(iii). In support of its position, the Commentary states (p. 320):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e519ff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The policeman or the watchman who closes his eyes to a burglary fails to present an obstacle to its commission that he is obliged to interpose. If his purpose is to promote or facilitate its perpetration, a fact that normally can be proved only by preconcert with the criminals, no reason can be offered for denying his complicity. But if the dereliction is not purposeful in that respect, as when it rests upon timidity or inefficiency, it is unduly harsh to view it as participation in the crime.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e51a00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Can complicity by omission be found even in the absence of preconcert? Consider People v. Stanciel, 606 N.E.2d 1201 (Ill. 1992). Violetta Burgos was <span title="733" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-733">p. 733</span>charged as an accomplice to murder when her boyfriend, Stanciel, beat her three-year-old daughter to death. Burgos had violated a court order to keep Stanciel away from the child and had authorized Stanciel to discipline the child despite his past and ongoing abusive behavior. Though Burgos did not perform any of the acts that led to her daughter’s death, the court ruled that her failure to protect her child from Stanciel rendered Burgos an accomplice to her daughter’s murder. Most courts agree with <i>Stanciel</i> that parents can be liable under an aiding and abetting theory for a crime committed by a third party when they fail to protect their children from the abuse. People v. Rolon, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 358, 366 (Ct. App. 2008). See generally Dorothy E. Roberts, Motherhood and Crime, 79 Iowa L. Rev. 95 (1993). Parents are not the only ones who have been found liable for failing to protect a child. In Staples v. Commonwealth, 454 S.W.3d 803 (Ky. 2014), the defendant was the live-in boyfriend of a mother whose child abuse killed her five-month-old baby. The court found that the jury could hold the boyfriend responsible for manslaughter under a breach-of-duty theory of complicity because the boyfriend resided indefinitely with the child in a parent-like role and had assumed a substantial responsibility for necessities such as food, shelter, and protection.</p>
<p id="76e51a01-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Omissions and mens rea.</i> Would the result in <i>Stanciel</i> be the same under the MPC? Plainly the mother was under a legal duty, but is there enough evidence to support a finding that she acted with the purpose that Stanciel should beat the child to death? Suppose she had not authorized him to discipline the child and had stood by out of fear?</p>
<p id="76e51a02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should the law address workers at child welfare agencies who fail to protect children from abusive parents? Can the worker’s failure to act be the basis of criminal charges on an aiding and abetting theory? New York prosecutors believed the answer is yes because they brought the city’s first-ever cases of negligent criminal homicide against child services caseworkers for failing to prevent the death of a child at the hands of her abusive mother. Jennifer Gonnerman, The Knock at the Door, N.Y. Mag., Sept. 11, 2011. The workers ultimately pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child, and the other criminal charges were dropped. Should social workers be given immunity from these kinds of charges? Is this an example of criminal law reaching too far into issues of regulatory incompetence, or is criminal law necessary to ensure that government workers do their jobs?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">THOMAS</span>, J. The defendant appeals from a sentence of five years’ imprisonment in the penitentiary for burglary and larceny. [Defendant proposed to one Hill <span title="734" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-734">p. 734</span>that he join him in the burglary of a general store. Hill, actually a relative of the store owners, feigned acquiescence in order to obtain the arrest of defendant and advised the store owners of the plan. On the night of the planned burglary, defendant and Hill arrived at the store together. Defendant raised the window and assisted Hill in climbing through into the building. Hill handed out a side of bacon. Shortly thereafter they were apprehended.] It will be seen the trial court told the jury in [its] instruction that defendant was guilty of burglary if he, with a felonious intent, assisted and aided Hill to enter the building, notwithstanding Hill himself may have had no such intent. In this we think the court erred. One cannot read this record without being convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Hill did not enter the warehouse with intent to steal. . . . We may assume, then, for the sake of the argument, that Hill committed no crime in entering the wareroom. The act of Hill, however, was by the instruction of the court imputed to defendant. This act, according to the theory of the instructions, so far as Hill was concerned, was not a criminal act, but when it was imputed to defendant it became criminal because of the latter’s felonious intent. This would probably be true if Hill had acted under the control and compulsion of defendant, and as his passive and submissive agent. But he was not a passive agent in this transaction. He was an active one. He acted of his own volition. He did not raise the window and enter the building with intent to commit crime, but simply to entrap defendant in the commission of crime, and have him captured.</p><p id="76e51a0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Judge Brewer sets this idea in a very clear light in State v. Jansen, 22 Kan. 498. He says: “The act of a detective may perhaps be not imputable to the defendant, as there is a want of community of motive. The one has a criminal intent, while the other is seeking the discovery and punishment of crime.” Where the owner learns that his property is to be stolen, he may employ detectives and decoys to catch the thief. And we can do no better than to quote again from Judge Brewer in the case above cited, as to the relation of the acts of detectives and the thief when a crime is alleged to have been committed by the two. He says: “Where each of the overt acts going to make up the crime charged is personally done by the defendant, and with criminal intent, his guilt is complete, no matter what motives may prompt or what acts be done by the party who is with him, and apparently assisting him. Counsel have cited and commented upon several cases in which detectives figured, and in which defendants were adjudged guiltless of the crimes charged. But this feature distinguishes them: that some act essential to the crime charged was in fact done by the detective, and not by the defendant, and, this act not being imputable to the defendant, the latter’s guilt was not made out. The intent and act must combine, and all the elements of the act must exist and be imputable to the defendant.”</p><p id="76e51a0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Applying the principle here announced to the case at bar, we find that defendant did not commit every overt act that went to make up the crime. He did not enter the warehouse, either actually or constructively, and hence he did not commit the crime of burglary, no matter what his intent was, it clearly appearing that Hill was guilty of no crime. To make defendant <span title="735" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-735">p. 735</span>responsible for the acts of Hill, they must have had a common motive and common design. The design and the motives of the two men were not only distinct, but dissimilar, even antagonistic. . . . The court should instruct the jury that if Hill broke into and entered the wareroom with a felonious intent, and defendant was present, aiding him with the same intent, then he is guilty; but if Hill entered the room with no design to steal, but simply to entrap defendant, and capture him in the commission of crime, and defendant did not enter the room himself, then he is not guilty of burglary and larceny as charged. He may be found guilty, however, of petit larceny, in taking and removing the bacon after it was handed to him. This overt act he did in fact commit. . . . The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for new trial.</p></div>

Vaden was convicted, as Snell’s accomplice, of hunting in violation of Alaskan law. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed the convictions, rejecting Vaden’s argument that because Snell’s action was justified in light of the needs of law enforcement (the “public authority justification defense”), no criminal action occurred for which he could be convicted of being an accomplice. The court reasoned that the action of Snell was not justified, but that even if it were, it would not avail Vaden, because the justification would be personal to the agent.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AA0_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10AA0_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> The majority also found that no entrapment had been shown and that the actions of Snell, while unlawful, were not so outrageous as to constitute a denial of due process.]</p>
<p id="76e54120-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The dissenting opinion reasoned:] The accomplice liability charges should fail on [the] ground [of] the long-standing common law rule that the act of a feigned accomplice may never be imputed to the targeted defendant for purposes of obtaining a conviction. In State v. Neely, 300 P. 561 (Mont. 1931), the Montana Supreme Court applied this principle under circumstances akin to those in the case at bar. In <i>Neely</i>, a cattle owner employed a detective, Harrington, to “get in” with suspected cattle thieves during an act of cattle rustling. Harrington associated himself with the criminal enterprise, and the crime was carried out. Harrington himself, however, committed the principal offense of purloining the cattle, while the targeted suspect merely stood watch outside the premises and offered various other forms of assistance before and <span title="736" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-736">p. 736</span>after commission of the offense.

It is the general rule that one who aids and abets another in criminal activity is liable for all of the “natural and probable consequences” of his accomplice’s criminal acts. Thus, the potential for abuse inherent in law enforcement methods such as those employed in the case at bar is substantial. Once an agent has succeeded in persuading an individual to take some substantial act in furtherance of his general criminal scheme, the ultimate liability of the targeted defendant, if any, will depend upon which foreseeable crimes the agent chooses to commit in order to secure convictions against his criminal “accomplice.” In this case, Officer Snell shot four foxes. Vaden, as pilot of the plane from which they were shot, was charged with four separate criminal counts of taking foxes from the air out of season. Had Snell opted to shoot a fifth fox, one more count could have been added to Vaden’s indictment. In my view, it is clearly inconsistent with due process principles, and manifestly unjust, that the ultimate criminal liability of a defendant should be made to depend upon the good aim and/or the good intentions of the police officer charged with securing his arrest.</p>

<i>1. Distinguishing</i> Hayes <i>from</i> Vaden. The dissent in <i>Vaden</i> invokes the rule that acts of a feigned principal may not be imputed to the targeted defendant for the purpose of convicting him as an accomplice. This appears to be what underlay the decision to reverse the conviction of the <i>Hayes</i> case. But is the situation in the <i>Vaden</i> case distinguishable? Snell did shoot the foxes in violation of law, and Vaden did help him do so. How can it be that Snell’s motive in violating the hunting laws (to secure a conviction against Vaden) could render Vaden not guilty? In the <i>Vaden</i> case there are plausible answers, turning on the public policy of discouraging unacceptable law enforcement practices. But the dissent in <i>Vaden</i> relies on a principle that is not confined to law enforcement personnel. If Snell were a private individual with a grudge against Vaden, would the dissent’s argument hold up? Was Snell a “feigned” principal at all?</p>

<i>2. Role reversal and the importance of shared intent.</i> Could Hill, the feigned principal, have been charged as an accomplice to Hayes if their roles in the burglary had been reversed but Hill still lacked the intent to steal the bacon? In Wilson v. People, 87 P.2d 5 (Colo. 1939), Wilson, angry at Pierce for allegedly stealing his watch, helped Pierce break into a drug store <span title="737" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-737">p. 737</span>by boosting him through a transom. While Pierce was inside the store, Wilson left briefly to telephone the police and returned to receive bottles of whiskey that Pierce handed to him through the transom. When the police arrived, Wilson helped the police capture Pierce and identified Pierce as the burglar. Wilson later admitted to the police his connection to the burglary but explained that he helped Pierce only in the hopes of framing Pierce, not because Wilson had the specific intent that they commit larceny. Larceny requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property, so Wilson’s defense is that he never had the intent to deprive the drugstore of the whiskey bottles permanently. And if Wilson lacked the intent for larceny, he lacked the intent for burglary as well, because he did not break and enter with the intent to commit a felony. Wilson was charged and convicted of aiding in the commission of the burglary. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed Wilson’s conviction holding, quoting 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §271 (12th ed. 1932):</p>

And it is only the formal, and not the substantive, part of the crime that they provoke. They provoke, for instance, in larceny, the asportation of the goods, but not the ultimate loss by the owner. They may be actuated by the most unworthy of motives, but the animus furandi in larceny is not imputable to them. . . .

<p id="76e54127-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Wilson</i> thus serves as a reminder of the importance of the accomplice’s mens rea in those jurisdictions that follow the traditional rule that the accomplice must have the specific intent that the crime be committed. See supra pp. 695-709. What if the facts in <i>Wilson</i> were different and Wilson’s goal had been to help Pierce kill the owner of the drug store in order to see Pierce do time for murder. In that situation, is it clear that Wilson could not be charged with the killing under a theory of accomplice liability?</p>
<p id="76e54128-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Entrapment.</i> In some cases involving feigned <i>accomplices</i>, the defendant may have a defense of “entrapment”—which most American jurisdictions define as government inducement of a defendant who is not “predisposed” to commit the offense—but only when the accomplice is a government agent who improperly induces the defendant’s criminal activity. Routine undercover drug purchases and other “sting” operations generally do not trigger such a defense. In contrast, in Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540 (1992), the court reversed a defendant’s conviction for receiving child pornography through the mail because no inference of predisposition was warranted when government agents subjected defendant to 26 months of fictitious mailings promoting child pornography, and there was no evidence that the defendant had otherwise sought or received illegal child pornography from nongovernmental sources. Why should the entrapment defense rest on whether the feigned accomplice is a government actor versus a private one?</p>
<p id="76e54129-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="738" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-738">p. 738</span>Even if a suspect is predisposed to commit the offense (thereby negating the entrapment defense), why should a defendant’s sentence depend on attendant circumstances manipulated by the government? As the dissenting opinion in <i>Vaden</i> observed, accepting law enforcement agents as principals gives them the discretion to determine the charges an accomplice faces and often the sentence as well. Law enforcement officers can engage in “sentencing entrapment”—where the government creates or induces a far greater crime than the suspect originally intends, for example, by having defendants cook powder cocaine into crack or engage in a drug transaction in a school zone, thereby exposing the defendant to a much higher sentence.

<i>NOTES AND PROBLEMS ON THE DERIVATIVE NATURE OF ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76e5412c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The derivative nature of accomplice liability is an axiom in the doctrine of complicity: “It is hornbook law that a defendant charged with aiding and abetting the commission of a crime by another cannot be convicted in the absence of proof that the crime was actually committed.” United States v. Ruffin, 613 F.2d 408, 412 (2d Cir. 1979); “There must be a guilty principal before there can be an aider and abettor.” United States v. Jones, 425 F.2d 1048, 1056 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>
<p id="76e5683d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important, however, not to confuse derivative liability with vicarious liability. Accomplice liability does not involve imposing liability on one party for the wrongs of another solely because of the relationship between the parties. Liability requires <i>culpability</i> and <i>conduct</i> by the secondary actor—intentional conduct designed to encourage or help—that makes it appropriate to blame him for what the primary actor does. The term “derivative” merely means that his liability is dependent on the principal’s violating the law. What is at issue is the responsibility of the secondary party for the principal actor’s violation of law. Unless the latter occurs, there can be no accomplice liability.</p>
<p id="76e5683e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This axiom of accessorial liability gives rise to many problems. To a large extent these problems can be solved by making an attempt to aid a sufficient basis to convict the secondary actor for the crime of attempt <i>as a principal.</i> See Model Penal Code §5.01(3). But traditionally (and under the present law of many jurisdictions) this option has not been available, so the problems persist.</p>
<p id="76e5683f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The nonculpable principal as innocent agent.</i> Suppose a factual situation similar to that in <i>State v. Hayes</i>, supra p. 733, but with Hayes asking <span title="739" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-739">p. 739</span>a six-year-old child named Hill to go through the window and take the bacon. In this case, Hayes would be held guilty of burglary through the use of Hill, his innocent agent. This standard doctrine, the so-called innocent agent doctrine, is expressed in §2.06(2)(a) of the MPC as follows: “A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when . . . acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct.” The drafter’s comment states (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.06 at 300 (1985)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e56840-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Subsection (2)(a) is based upon the universally acknowledged principle that one is no less guilty of the commission of a crime because he uses the overt conduct of an innocent or irresponsible agent. He is accountable in such cases as if the conduct were his own. At common law, he was considered a principal for such behavior.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e56841-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Limits of the innocent agent doctrine.</i> There may be difficulties in employing an innocent agent doctrine even where the mens rea of the defendant and the innocence of the agent are established.</p>
<p id="76e56842-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) One such case is where the statute defines the crime so that it can only be committed by designated classes of persons of which the defendant is not a member.</i> For example, if a statute prohibits an officer or employee of a bank from entering false records of transactions, then one who is not an officer or an employee cannot commit the offense. If the outsider helps or encourages an officer who intentionally does so, the outsider can be held as an accomplice; his liability is derived from that of the culpable officer. If, however, the outsider dupes an innocent officer into doing so unknowingly, the outsider cannot be held liable as an accomplice to a crime committed by the officer, because the officer committed no crime. The usual recourse is to apply the innocent agent concept to treat the instigator as a <i>principal</i> who has done the prohibited act himself, using the officer or employee as his instrument. But because the instigator is not an officer or employee, he cannot violate the statute. Thus, in this case, the innocent agent doctrine would not make him liable.</p>
<p id="76e56843-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Federal courts have solved the difficulty by interpreting the federal aiding and abetting statute to mean that one is criminally liable as a principal for causing another to commit criminal acts where the other, even though innocent, has the capacity to commit the criminal acts and the defendant does not. See United States v. Ruffin, 613 F.2d 408 (2d Cir. 1979). The federal statute, 18 U.S.C. §2(b), reads: “Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him <i>or another</i> would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p id="76e56844-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) A second situation where this difficulty can arise is rarer:</i> It is where the nature of the action prohibited is such that it can be done only by the body of the person him- or herself and not through the instrumentality of another. For example, a sober defendant may cause an insensate and disorderly drunk to appear in a public place by physically depositing him there. But we could <span title="740" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-740">p. 740</span>hardly say that the sober person has, through the instrumentality of the drunk, himself committed the criminal action of being drunk and disorderly in a public place.</p>
<p id="76e56845-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> How would 18 U.S.C. §2(b) handle this case? How should it be handled? For a discussion of these situations, see Sanford H. Kadish, Blame and Punishment 172 (1987).</p>
<p id="76e56846-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The culpable-but-unconvictable principal.</i> Another class of cases raising questions for the traditional derivative liability doctrine is where the principal would be guilty except for a policy-based defense that makes him unconvictable. Consider, for example, Farnsworth v. Zerbst, 98 F.2d 541 (5th Cir. 1938), where the defendant conspired with and aided another in the commission of espionage, but the latter could not be convicted because of diplomatic immunity; or United States v. Azadian, 436 F.2d 81 (9th Cir. 1971), where the defendant aided a principal who had been acquitted on grounds of entrapment. As the courts held in these cases, there is no reason to grant the accomplice a defense simply because the principal has a defense—the grounds of granting the principal a defense are reasons of policy that are inapplicable to the accomplice. Yet how can convicting the accomplice be squared with the rule that makes the liability of the accomplice turn on the liability of the principal?</p>
<p id="76e56847-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The acquitted principal.</i> We have seen that in general there can be no guilty aider and abettor without a guilty principal; the situations in the above notes are distinguishable or are exceptions to that rule. What happens when the principal has been acquitted? May the accomplice who is subsequently tried raise that acquittal as a defense? In a situation of this kind where the principal had been acquitted of federal bribery charges, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a conviction of the accomplice, stating in United States v. Standefer, 447 U.S. 10, 25-26 (1980), as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e56848-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case does no more than manifest the simple, if discomforting, reality that “different juries may reach different results under any criminal statute. That is one of the consequences we accept under our jury system.” Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 492 (1957). While symmetry of results may be intellectually satisfying, it is not required. Here, [defendant] received a fair trial at which the Government bore the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that [the principal] violated 26 U.S.C. §7214(a)(2) and that petitioner aided and abetted him in that venture. He was entitled to no less—and to no more.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e56849-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC is in accord with this position. See Model Penal Code §2.06(7).</p>
<p id="76e5684a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. When the accomplice is a victim.</i> May an accomplice have a defense even though she acts with the required mens rea? Consider the following.</p>
<p id="76e5684b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> In The Queen v. Tyrell, [1894] 1 Q.B. 710, the court reversed a conviction of a minor for aiding, abetting, and encouraging statutory rape upon herself by an adult, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e58f5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

</div>
<p id="76e58f5d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same reasoning has been applied to victims charged with conspiracy to commit an offense. See <i>Gebardi v. United States</i>, p. 796 infra. For further discussion of the victim rule, see Glanville Williams, Victims and Other Exempt Parties in Crime, 10 Legal Stud. 245 (1990). Do these decisions suggest that juveniles who voluntarily take sexual images of themselves and send them to adults or other juveniles should not be prosecuted under laws that prohibit the distribution of child pornography? Prosecutors have brought charges in such cases, but some argue these prosecutions are inappropriate given the purpose of these laws. See Amy F. Kimpel, Using Laws Designed to Protect as a Weapon: Prosecuting Minors Under Child Pornography Laws, 34 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 299 (2010). For a broader historical analysis of prosecutions involving teenage sexual activity, see Mae C. Quinn, From Turkey Trot to Twitter: Policing Puberty, Purity, and Sex-Positivity, 38 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 51 (2014).</p>
<p id="76e58f5e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> The Model Penal Code contains a provision, followed in a number of states, that a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by another either if he is a victim of that offense or if the offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission. §2.06(6)(a), (b). The Comment on this provision states (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.06 at 324-325 (1985)):</p>

No one can draft a prohibition of [bigamy] without awareness that two parties to the conduct necessarily will be involved.

<i>1. Lesser culpability of principal actor.</i> Does it follow from the derivative nature of accomplice liability that the secondary party cannot be convicted of a more serious crime than that committed by the principal actor? Consider the following situations.</p>
<p id="76e58f63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> <i>Regina v. Richards, [1974] Q.B. 776.</i> The defendant, Isabelle Richards, hired two men to beat up her husband.

Mrs. Richards and the two men were tried together on charges of felonious assault, requiring proof of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and misdemeanor assault, requiring proof of intent to cause harm, but not necessarily serious harm. The two men were acquitted on the felony charges and convicted on the misdemeanor count. Mrs. Richards, tried as their accomplice, was convicted of felonious assault. On appeal, the court reversed her felony conviction, stating:</p>

<i>Question:</i> Was the decision correct? Commentators have disagreed. See Sanford H. Kadish, Blame and Punishment 181-186 (1987). The argument against the decision is that the blows struck by Mrs. Richards’s hirelings should be treated as her own actions on the ground that she “caused” them. Therefore, she struck the blows and had the specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm when she did so. The contrary argument is that this would be true only if the hirelings were innocent agents, her unwitting instrument not knowing fully what they were doing. But since that apparently was not the case, their actions are their own and could not be said to be “caused” by Mrs. Richards, any more than any accomplice “causes” the actions of the principal. In that case, she can probably be convicted only of whatever crime they committed, or of soliciting the felonious assault. See Sanford H.

<i>(b)</i> <i>People v. McCoy, 24 P.3d 1210 (Cal. 2001).</i> McCoy and Lakey participated in a drive-by shooting, with McCoy firing the fatal shots. Both were convicted of murder—McCoy as a principal and Lakey as an aider and abettor. McCoy testified at trial that he had been shot at earlier the same day at the same intersection where the fatal shooting took place and that he armed himself and shot only in self-defense. McCoy’s conviction was overturned because the jury was not instructed properly on McCoy’s defense—that he had an unreasonable but good-faith belief in the need to use self-defense—which, if believed by the jury, would have negated the element of malice in murder and reduced McCoy’s murder conviction to voluntary manslaughter.</p>

<p id="76e5b67d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An alternative argument is that the actions of the principal perpetrator (Othello in the court’s example) are not fully volitional. As a result, those actions cannot pose a barrier to our treating the actions of an instigator (such as Iago) as the <i>cause</i> of the resulting death. See the material on Causation, supra pp. 603-641. When that is so, there is no difficulty in making the crime each party commits dependent on his own mens rea, because each is treated as a principal who has caused the death.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C40_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C40_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span> This rests on the premise that volition does not have the nature of an on/off switch, but rather exists along a spectrum. That is, the action of an intervening actor (like Othello) can be insufficiently volitional to break the causal chain, but sufficiently volitional to hold him responsible for his actions.</p>

<i>2. Greater culpability of principal actor.</i> Does it follow from the theory of derivative liability that the instigator can be held for no lesser crime than that committed by the perpetrator? For example, suppose that an enraged Othello <span title="744" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-744">p. 744</span>had hired someone else to kill Desdemona. The hired killer, presumably, would be guilty of murder. Does it follow that Othello is also guilty of murder? In Moore v. Lowe, 180 S.E. 1, 2 (W. Va. 1935), a hired killer murdered the defendant’s husband at her instigation. The court held that, as an accessory to the murder, the defendant could be convicted of manslaughter. In support of its position, the court quoted 1 Wharton, Criminal Law 363-364 (12th ed. 1932):</p>

<i>INTRODUCTORY NOTES</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76e5b685-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The two meanings of conspiracy.</i> Conspiracy has two key aspects. First, like attempt and solicitation, it is an inchoate crime that aims at preparatory conduct—the agreement to commit a crime—before it matures into the actual commission of the substantive offense. This is the stand-alone crime of conspiracy. Second, conspiracy is a form of accessory liability. It is a means by which individuals who agree to commit a crime are held liable for the actions of others in the group.</p>
<p id="76e5b686-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Conspiracy as an inchoate offense.</i> Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes offered a one-sentence summary of the stand-alone crime of conspiracy: “A conspiracy is a partnership in criminal purposes.” United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 608 (1910). Generally, conspiracy is defined as the crime of agreeing with another to commit a criminal offense. It is an inchoate offense because the conspiratorial agreement is punishable whether or not the agreed-upon offense ever occurs. But unlike attempt, the crime of conspiracy does not “merge” into the completed offense. Rather, conspiracy is generally punishable separately and in addition to the completed offense—a recognition that the law of conspiracy is designed to not only punish preparatory activity, but also to address the “special danger” posed by group criminal activity.</p>
<p id="76e5b687-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The traditional approach to grading is to treat the inchoate crime of conspiracy as a generic offense and to prescribe a punishment range that is unrelated to the sentence associated with whatever crime is the target of the conspiracy. For example, 18 U.S.C. §371 provides that the punishment for conspiracy is up to five years’ imprisonment, regardless of the seriousness of the object offense. Under §371, an agreement to commit murder carries the same five-year maximum sentence as an agreement to commit a minor theft or embezzlement, and an agreement to commit a felony carrying a two-year maximum subjects the conspirators to a five-year sentence, while an individual who commits the object offense by himself faces only the two-year <span title="745" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-745">p. 745</span>maximum. In other words, the sentence for conspiracy could be greater than the sentence for the crime that is the object of the conspiracy.</p>
<p id="76e5b688-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Maryland offers an example of one solution to this problem: Its code provides that “[t]he punishment of a person who is convicted of conspiracy may not exceed the maximum punishment for the crime that the person conspired to commit.” Rudder v. State, 956 A.2d 791, 794 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2008). The current federal statute addresses this issue only with respect to misdemeanors, specifying that when the object crime is a misdemeanor, punishment for the conspiracy shall not exceed the punishment authorized for the misdemeanor. Some jurisdictions have failed to take even this step, and still accept the common-law doctrine that made it a felony to conspire to commit a misdemeanor. Under Cal. Penal Code §182 (2011), a conspiracy to commit a crime against certain federal or state officials is a felony punishable by imprisonment for five, seven, or nine years; an agreement to throw a tomato at such an official would call for a <i>minimum</i> sentence of five years, though actually throwing the tomato, without a prior agreement, would be a misdemeanor assault carrying a <i>maximum</i> sentence of one year.</p>
<p id="76e5b689-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Though this generic approach—grading conspiracy without regard to the sentence for the object of the conspiracy—survives in a number of jurisdictions, the majority of states now reject it. Most fix the punishment for conspiracy at some term that is tied to but less than the sentence provided for the object crime. See Note, Conspiracy: Statutory Reform Since the Model Penal Code, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 1122, 1183-1188 (1975). Roughly a third of the states, following the lead of the MPC, make the punishment for conspiracy the same as that authorized for the object crime, except in the case of the most serious felonies. See Model Penal Code §5.05(1), Appendix. Recall that this is the same approach that the MPC uses in the case of attempts. But are conspiracy and attempt really comparable for grading purposes? Note that an attempt is not punishable under the Code until the defendant has taken a “substantial step” that is “strongly corroborative” of the criminal purpose. In such a case, punishment is permitted up to the level authorized for the object crime. But a conspiracy may be punishable from the moment that an agreement is made. When defendants have not taken significant steps to put their plan into action, is it appropriate to impose the same punishment authorized for successful commission of the object crime?</p>
<p id="76e5b68a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Conspiracy as a form of accessory liability.</i> When individuals join conspiracies, they may be charged not only with the separate crime of conspiracy and the target offense that they conspired to commit (if it is completed); they may also find themselves charged with additional crimes committed by other members of the conspiracy. This is the most controversial aspect of conspiracy law; it is discussed on pp. 766-779 infra.</p>
<p id="76e5b68b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Other significant consequences of a conspiracy charge.</i> There are additional features of conspiracy charges that make conspiracy the “darling of the modern prosecutor’s nursery,” Harrison v. United States, 7 F.2d 259, 263 (2d Cir. 1925). These features prompted Clarence Darrow to remark that “any <span title="746" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-746">p. 746</span>citizens interested in protecting human liberty” should “study the conspiracy laws of the United States.” Clarence Darrow, The Story of My Life 64 (1932).</p>
<p id="76e5b68c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Procedural consequences.</i> Consider the following procedural advantages a conspiracy case offers the government, as discussed in Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e5dd9d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An accused, under the Sixth Amendment, has the right to trial “by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.” The leverage of a conspiracy charge lifts this limitation from the prosecution and reduces its protection to a phantom, for the crime is considered so vagrant as to have been committed in any district where any one of the conspirators did any one of the acts, however innocent, intended to accomplish its object. The Government may, and often does, compel one to defend at a great distance from any place he ever did any act because some accused confederate did some trivial and by itself innocent act in the chosen district. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e5dd9e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the trial starts, the accused feels the full impact of the conspiracy strategy. Strictly, the prosecution should first establish prima facie the conspiracy and identify the conspirators, after which evidence of acts and declarations of each in the course of its execution are admissible against all. But the order of proof of so sprawling a charge is difficult for a judge to control. As a practical matter, the accused often is confronted with a hodgepodge of acts and statements by others which he may never have authorized or intended or even known about, but which help to persuade the jury of existence of the conspiracy itself. . . . The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.</p>
<p id="76e5dd9f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial of a conspiracy charge doubtless imposes a heavy burden on the prosecution, but it is an especially difficult situation for the defendant. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e5dda0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A co-defendant in a conspiracy trial occupies an uneasy seat. There generally will be evidence of wrongdoing by somebody. It is difficult for the individual to make his own case stand on its own merits in the minds of jurors who are ready to believe that birds of a feather are flocked together. If he is silent, he is taken to admit it and if, as often happens, co-defendants can be prodded into accusing or contradicting each other, they convict each other. . . .

<p id="76e5dda1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Spillover effects.</i> The larger the conspiracy, the more significant are the procedural consequences and the greater is the potential for accessory liability. Conspiracy prosecutions in recent decades have grown increasingly complex. A single case involving almost two dozen defendants in a drug conspiracy with a trial lasting for more than a year is far from unusual. See, e.g., United States v. Simpson, 2008 WL 4758588 (D. Kan. 2008). Consider Paul Marcus, Criminal Conspiracy Law: Time to Turn Back from an Ever Expanding, Ever More Troubling Area, 1 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 1, 8-11 (1992):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e5dda2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[An] enormous number of cases involv[e] many defendants, complex evidentiary issues, and dozens and dozens of complicated charges. . . . It is difficult to imagine how a jury goes about sorting the testimony of hundreds of witnesses, <span title="747" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-747">p. 747</span>or considering evidence it heard more than a year earlier. Indeed, how does a jury begin to apply the reasonable doubt standard when there are more than fifty counts charging more than a dozen different individuals? In today’s world of conspiracy prosecution, however, such a situation—while perhaps not the norm—occurs with great frequency.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e5dda3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In these large conspiracy trials, defendants’ primary protection against the spillover effect of evidence unrelated to their guilt is the limiting instruction given by the trial judge. These instructions generally take the form of admonitions to the jury to consider certain pieces of evidence only against some defendants and not against others. Judges typically assume that limiting instructions can cure any prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Defreitas, 701 F. Supp. 2d 309, 316-317 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). Yet in <i>Krulewitch</i>, Justice Jackson called faith in the efficacy of such instructions “unmitigated fiction.” His skepticism was echoed by the Ninth Circuit in its review of a 16-month drug conspiracy trial involving dozens of defendants, some of whom were charged with major crimes, including murder, and others of whom were charged only with relatively minor offenses (United States v. Baker, 10 F.3d 1374, 1391 (9th Cir. 1993)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e5dda4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he human limitations of the jury system and the consequent risk of spillover prejudice cannot be ignored. This risk is particularly acute for comparatively peripheral defendants. . . . At oral argument in this case, the Assistant United States Attorney averred that his multiple violations of the district court’s limiting instructions during closing argument were the inadvertent result of confusion. When a seasoned prosecutor is unable to keep track of nearly 200 limiting instructions given over the course of 16-month trial, our faith in a lay jury’s ability to do so is stretched to the limit. Our presumption that a jury is able to follow the trial court’s instructions is “rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than in the belief that it represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the state and the defendant in the criminal justice process.”</p>
</div>
<p id="76e5dda5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Sentencing consequences.</i> In some jurisdictions, most notably the federal system, sentences are tied in part to the amounts of drugs or money involved in a criminal offense. As a result, individuals charged with drug conspiracies can be sentenced on the basis of larger quantities of drugs than the ones they personally deal because they are held responsible for the drugs being sold by the entire conspiracy. Similarly, individuals in fraud conspiracies can be held responsible for greater dollar losses than those they directly cause because they are criminally liable for the total loss amounts involved in the conspiracy.</p>
<p id="76e5dda6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Holding every member of the conspiracy equally liable for the total damage can have the perverse effect that individuals who rank low in the conspiracy will receive longer sentences than those higher up. That is because individuals with greater roles in the conspiracy often have more information to offer the government, and thus can get a bigger sentence reduction for cooperating and providing substantial assistance, while lower ranking participants often have <span title="748" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-748">p. 748</span>little information to offer.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10CF8_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10CF8_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">9</a></span> Judge Bright highlights the irony of this system (United States v.

In fact, when Perry and Mary Perry were interviewed by investigators . . . they gave identical false statements on more than one occasion where they both denied to investigators that Young was sleeping in the same bed as E.P.; rather, they both insisted that Young had been sleeping on the couch.

The Perrys were unemployed and Young paid for their utilities, cell phone, Internet access, and furniture. The jury also heard testimony about the long-term and close friendship between Young and the Perrys. The jury heard about the sexual relationships between Perry, Mary Perry, and Young. Thus, there was ample evidence before the jury to suggest why Perry and Mary Perry might conspire to conceal the abuse of their daughter by Young.</p><p id="76e604d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the State, these collective actions provide strong evidence of a tacit agreement between Perry and Mary Perry to allow Young to have unrestricted access to their eight-year-old daughter and to actively conceal Young’s abuse of E.P. Moreover, the lies to the child protection investigators by Perry and Mary Perry were overt acts in furtherance of the charged conspiracy. . . . Under these facts, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count because the jury could infer from the above-described circumstances that Perry and Mary engaged in a conspiracy to commit the offense of capital sexual battery of E.P. For these reasons, I would affirm the trial court’s judgment on all counts.</p></div>

<i>1. Conspiracy versus accomplice liability.</i> The majority in <i>Perry</i> did not find sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy count, but it upheld Perry’s convictions based on an accomplice theory of liability. What accounts for the difference? Recall that the actus reus required for accomplice liability is satisfied when the accomplice facilitates the crime, whether or not the accomplice and the principal have a prior agreement that such facilitation will be provided. A conspiracy, in contrast, requires that there be an agreement between the co-conspirators. The majority offers little elaboration for its decision that there was no agreement. Why might the majority have found the evidence to be lacking? Were the facts detailed in the dissent consistent with each actor acting independently rather than mutually cooperating in a common plan? Could the same outcome (taking no steps to protect E.P., lying to investigators) have occurred if they did not have an agreement? The dissent points to circumstantial evidence suggesting agreement. Which details seem incriminating in that regard? If the Perrys did not lie to the investigators, would the evidence of a conspiracy have been as strong? What if Young had not been providing financial support to the family?</p>

<i>2. Parallel action or common action?</i> As the <i>Perry</i> case demonstrates, a key inquiry in cases involving multiple parties to crimes is to determine whether the parties are acting together based on an agreement or whether they are acting independently, albeit in parallel with one another. Because evidence of an express agreement will be rare, courts are typically looking for <span title="752" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-752">p. 752</span>evidence that points to a tacit or implied agreement. Courts face a similar inquiry in antitrust cases, where a conspiracy in restraint of trade must be found to establish civil or criminal liability under §1 of the Sherman Act, and thus the “crucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stem[s] from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.” Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553 (2007). In the antitrust context, courts have made clear that parallel conduct is insufficient to establish an agreement and that plaintiffs or government prosecutors “must include evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.” Id. at 554. Courts have found sufficient evidence of a tacit agreement among companies when the companies’ actions would be against their interests were they acting independently. See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 222 (1939) (“without substantially unanimous action with respect to [restrictions on the pricing of tickets for films] there was a risk of a substantial loss of the business . . . but with it there was the prospect of increased profits”); United States v. Apple, 791 F.3d 290, 315 (2d Cir. 2015) (noting that “parallel action is not, by itself, sufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy” but certain “plus factors” in addition to the parallel action that can raise the inference of a conspiracy include “evidence that shows that the parallel acts were against the apparent individual economic self-interest of the alleged conspirators” and “complex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors, and made for no other discernible reason”).</p>

<i>3. Problems. (a)</i> During an urban riot, one teenager shouts to three of his friends, “There’s great stuff in that store, and the owner’s a cheat. Let’s go get it!” All four run into the store and start grabbing goods. Seeing the looting, two passersby, strangers to each other, enter the store and join in the looting. Are the four teenagers guilty of conspiracy? Are the two passersby guilty of conspiracy with each other? Are they guilty of conspiracy with the four teenagers? Note that the answers to these questions can be important for several reasons. For example, a conspiracy charge could permit a substantial increase in punishment. In addition, as we shall see, in some jurisdictions, conspirators can be held liable for additional crimes committed by their co-conspirators that are committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>

<i>(c)</i> During a party attended by members of the rival Crips and Bloods gangs, Garcia, one of the Bloods, began “talking smack” to Crips members who were present, and several of his fellow Bloods did likewise.

And the fact that more than one member of the Bloods was shooting at rival[s] does not prove a prearrangement—the Crips, too, were able to pull out their guns almost immediately, suggesting that readiness for a gunfight requires no prior agreement. Such readiness may be a sad commentary on the state of mind of many of the nation’s youth, but it is not indicative of a criminal conspiracy. [Otherwise, any] gang member could be held liable for any other gang member’s act at any time so long as the act was predicated on “the common purpose of ‘fighting the enemy.’ ” [A] general practice of supporting one another in fights . . . does not constitute the type of illegal objective that can form the predicate for a conspiracy charge.</p>

<i>NOTES ON THE OVERT ACT REQUIREMENT</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76e62bf5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Both at common law and under statutory formulations, conduct can be punishable as a conspiracy at points much further back in the stages of preparation than the point where liability begins to attach for attempt. In some jurisdictions, the agreement alone is sufficient, without any requirement that a member of the conspiracy commit an overt act in furtherance of it. In other <span title="754" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-754">p. 754</span>situations an overt act must be proved, but the act may fall well short of the kind of conduct sufficient to constitute an attempt.</p>

<i>1. Liability without an overt act.</i> At common law, no “overt act” was required. Does this mean that the offense becomes purely mental? Consider Mulcahy v. The Queen, L.R. 3 E. &amp; I. App. 306, 316-317 (H.L. Ire. 1868). Defendants were indicted for conspiracy to foment the Irish rebellion. They argued that the indictment was defective for failing to charge some overt act, such as publishing writings or procuring arms. The court rejected the argument, stating:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e62bf7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means. And so far as proof goes, conspiracy . . . is generally a matter of inference deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. The number and the compact give weight and cause danger, and this is more especially the case in a conspiracy like those charged in this indictment. Indeed, it seems a reduction to absurdity, that procuring a single stand of arms should be a sufficient overt act to make the disloyal design indictable, and that conspiring with a thousand men to enlist should not.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e62bf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Statutes requiring an overt act.</i> American conspiracy statutes have typically added an overt-act requirement. Note, for example, the wording of 18 U.S.C. §371: “If one or more persons conspire . . . to commit any offense . . .  and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy. . . . ” But it is not unusual for statutes to dispense with this overt-act requirement in the case of conspiracies to commit the most serious offenses. See, e.g., Model Penal Code §5.03(5), Appendix. Many statutes are silent on the subject. In Whitfield v. United States, 543 U.S. 209, 213-214 (2005), the Supreme Court considered whether the federal money laundering law, 18 U.S.C. §1956, required an overt act despite the statute’s silence. The Court held that when a federal statute’s text is silent, no overt-act requirement should be read into the statute, in light of the settled principle of statutory construction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common-law definition of statutory terms.</p>
<p id="76e62bf9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When an overt act is a required element, the usual reason for requiring it is explained in Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 334 (1957): “The function of the overt act in a conspiracy prosecution is simply to manifest ‘that the conspiracy is at work’ . . . and is neither a project still resting solely in the minds of the conspirators nor a fully completed operation no longer in existence.” Thus, even when an overt-act requirement applies, it generally can be satisfied by acts that would be considered equivocal or <span title="755" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-755">p. 755</span>merely preparatory in the law of attempts. Consider, for example, United States v. Bertling, 510 F.3d 804, 810 (8th Cir. 2007), in which the court concluded that the same telephone conversation established both the agreement and the overt act, because in the first part of the conversation two brothers discussed the need to murder a potential witness, and in the remaining part of the conversation, they discussed how to find the witness: “We see no reason why these plans and arrangements cannot constitute overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy simply because they were contained in the same phone conversation in which the conspiracy was also established.” Does the latter part of the conversation establish “that the conspiracy is at work”?</p>
<p id="76e62bfa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By contrast, some states have required a more substantial overt act. Ohio, for example, provides that an overt act must be “substantial,” defined as “of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. tit. 29, §2923.01(B) (2016). Maine goes even further with its overt-act requirement and uses a standard similar to what is required for attempt: The statute requires a “substantial step,” which it defines as “conduct which, under the circumstances in which it occurs, is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor’s intent to complete commission of the crime”; it further provides that “speech alone may not constitute a substantial step.” Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, §151(4) (2016).</p>

<i>3. Justifications for the traditional approach.</i> Unlike the Maine and Ohio statutes just mentioned, the traditional view is that any “overt act” (or sometimes merely the act of agreement alone) suffices to render conduct punishable as a conspiracy. But what is there about an agreement to commit a crime that justifies dispensing with the requirement of substantial preparatory conduct we use for attempts? Consider Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §5.03 at 388 (1985):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e62bfc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>First:</i> The act of agreeing with another to commit a crime, like the act of soliciting, is concrete and unambiguous; it does not present the infinite degrees and variations possible in the general category of attempts. The danger that truly equivocal behavior may be misinterpreted as preparation to commit a crime is minimized; purpose must be relatively firm before the commitment involved in agreement is assumed.</p>
<p id="76e62bfd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Second:</i> If the agreement was to aid another to commit a crime or if it otherwise encouraged the crime’s commission, complicity would be established in the commission of the substantive offense. It would be anomalous to hold that conduct that would suffice to establish criminality, if something else is done by someone else, is insufficient if the crime is never consummated. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e62bfe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Third:</i> [T]he act of combining with another is significant both psychologically and practically, the former because it crosses a clear threshold in arousing expectations, the latter because it increases the likelihood that the offense will be committed.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">FLEMING</span>, J. In an investigation of call-girl activity the police focused their attention on three prostitutes actively plying their trade on call, each of whom was using Lauria’s telephone answering service, presumably for business purposes.</p><p id="76e65316-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On January 8, 1965, Stella Weeks, a policewoman, signed up for telephone service with Lauria’s answering service. Mrs. Weeks, in the course of her conversation with Lauria’s officer manager, hinted broadly that she was a prostitute concerned with the secrecy of her activities and their concealment from the police. She was assured that the operation of the service was discreet and “about as safe as you can get.”</p><p id="76e65317-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 11, Mrs. Weeks talked to Lauria on the telephone and told him her business was modeling and she had been referred to the answering service by Terry, one of the three prostitutes under investigation. She complained that because of the operation of the service she had lost two valuable customers, referred to as tricks. Lauria defended his service and said that her friends had probably lied to her about having left calls for her. But he did not respond to Mrs. Weeks’ hints that she needed customers in order to make money, other than to invite her to his house for a personal visit in order to get better acquainted. In the course of his talk he said “his business was taking messages.”</p><p id="76e65318-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On February 15, Mrs. Weeks talked on the telephone to Lauria’s office manager and again complained of two lost calls, which she described as a $50 and a $100 trick. On investigation the office manager could find nothing wrong, but she said she would alert the switchboard operators about slip-ups on calls.</p><p id="76e65319-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On April 1, Lauria and the three prostitutes were arrested. Lauria complained to the police that this attention was undeserved, stating that Hollywood Call Board had 60 to 70 prostitutes on its board while his own service had only 9 or 10, that he kept separate records for known or suspected prostitutes for the convenience of himself and the police. When asked if his records were available to police who might come to the office to investigate call girls, Lauria replied that they were whenever the police had a specific name. However, his service didn’t “arbitrarily tell the police about prostitutes on our board. As long as they pay their bills we tolerate them.” In a subsequent voluntary appearance before the Grand Jury Lauria testified he had always cooperated with the police. But he admitted he knew some of his customers were prostitutes, and he knew Terry was a prostitute because he had personally used her services, and he knew she was paying for 500 calls a month. . . .

<span title="757" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-757">p. 757</span>To establish agreement, the People need show no more than a tacit, mutual understanding between co-conspirators to accomplish an unlawful act. . . . Here the People attempted to establish a conspiracy by showing that Lauria, well aware that his codefendants were prostitutes who received business calls from customers through his telephone answering service, continued to furnish them with such service. This approach attempts to equate knowledge of another’s criminal activity with conspiracy to further such criminal activity, and poses the question of the criminal responsibility of a furnisher of goods or services who knows his product is being used to assist the operation of an illegal business. Under what circumstances does a supplier become a part of a conspiracy to further an illegal enterprise by furnishing goods or services which he knows are to be used by the buyer for criminal purposes?</p><p id="76e6531b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The two leading cases on this point face in opposite directions. In United States v. Falcone, 311 U.S. 205, the sellers of large quantities of sugar, yeast, and cans were absolved from participation in a moonshining conspiracy among distillers who bought from them, while in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, a wholesaler of drugs was convicted of conspiracy to violate the federal narcotic laws by selling drugs in quantity to a codefendant physician who was supplying them to addicts. The distinction between these two cases appears primarily based on the proposition that distributors of such dangerous products as drugs are required to exercise greater discrimination in the conduct of their business than are distributors of innocuous substances like sugar and yeast.</p><p id="76e6531c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the earlier case, <i>Falcone</i>, the sellers’ knowledge of the illegal use of the goods was insufficient by itself to make the sellers participants in a conspiracy with the distillers who bought from them. Such knowledge fell short of proof of a conspiracy, and evidence on the volume of sales was too vague to support a jury finding that respondents knew of the conspiracy [with others] from the size of the sales alone.</p><p id="76e6531d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the later case of <i>Direct Sales</i>, the conviction of a drug wholesaler for conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws was affirmed on a showing that it had actively promoted the sale of morphine sulphate in quantity and had sold codefendant physician, who practiced in a small town in South Carolina, more than 300 times his normal requirements of the drug, even though it had been repeatedly warned of the dangers of unrestricted sales of the drug. The court contrasted the restricted goods involved in <i>Direct Sales</i> with the articles of free commerce involved in <i>Falcone</i>: “All articles of commerce may be put to illegal ends,” said the court. “But all do not have inherently the same susceptibility to harmful and illegal use. . . . This difference is important for two purposes. One is for making certain that the seller knows the buyer’s intended illegal use. The other is to show that by the sale he intends to further, promote and cooperate in it. This intent, when given effect by overt act, is the gist of conspiracy. While it is not identical with mere knowledge that another proposes unlawful action, it is not unrelated to such knowledge. . . . The step from knowledge to intent and agreement may be taken. There is more than suspicion, more than knowledge, acquiescence, carelessness, indifference, lack of concern. There is <span title="758" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-758">p. 758</span>informed and interested cooperation, stimulation, instigation. And there is also a ‘stake in the venture’ which, even if it may not be essential, is not irrelevant to the question of conspiracy.” (319 U.S. at 710-713.)</p><p id="76e67a2e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While <i>Falcone</i> and <i>Direct Sales</i> may not be entirely consistent with each other in their full implications, they do provide us with a framework for the criminal liability of a supplier of lawful goods or services put to unlawful use. Both the element of <i>knowledge</i> of the illegal use of the goods or services and the element of <i>intent</i> to further that use must be present in order to make the supplier a participant in a criminal conspiracy.</p><p id="76e67a2f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Proof of <i>knowledge</i> is ordinarily a question of fact and requires no extended discussion in the present case. . . . Because Lauria knew in fact that some of his customers were prostitutes, it is a legitimate inference he knew they were subscribing to his answering service for illegal business purposes and were using his service to make assignations for prostitution. . . . 
</p><p id="76e67a30-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The more perplexing issue in the case is the sufficiency of proof of <i>intent</i> to further the criminal enterprise. . . . Direct evidence of participation, such as advice from the supplier of legal goods or services to the user of those goods or services on their use for illegal purpose, such evidence as appeared in a companion case we decide today, People v. Roy, 59 Cal. Rptr. 636, provides the simplest case.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F41_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F41_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>
 . . . But in cases where direct proof of complicity is lacking, intent to further the conspiracy must be derived from the sale itself and its surrounding circumstances in order to establish the supplier’s express or tacit agreement to join the conspiracy.</p><p id="76e6a142-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case at bench the prosecution argues that since Lauria knew his customers were using his service for illegal purposes but nevertheless continued to furnish it to them, he must have intended to assist them in carrying out their illegal activities. . . . 
</p><p id="76e6a143-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">1. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the purveyor of legal goods for illegal use has acquired a stake in the venture. (United States v. Falcone, 2d Cir. 109 F.2d 579, 581.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F58_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F58_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>) For example, in Regina v. Thomas, (1957), 2 All E.R. 181, 342, a prosecution for living off the earnings of prostitution, the evidence showed that the accused, knowing the woman to be a convicted prostitute, agreed to let her have the use of his room between the hours of 9 <span class="epub-small-caps">P.M</span>. and 2 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M</span>. for a charge of £3 a night. The Court of Criminal Appeal refused an appeal from the conviction, holding that when the accused rented a room at a grossly inflated rent to a prostitute for the purpose of carrying on her trade, a jury could find he was living on the earnings of prostitution.</p><p id="76e6a145-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, no proof was offered of inflated charges for the telephone answering services furnished the codefendants.</p><p id="76e6a146-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="759" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-759">p. 759</span>2. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when no legitimate use for the goods or services exists. The leading California case is People v. McLaughlin, 245 P.2d 1076 (Cal. App. 1952), in which the court upheld a conviction of the suppliers of horse-racing information by wire for conspiracy to promote bookmaking, when it had been established that wire service information had no other use than to supply information needed by bookmakers to conduct illegal gambling operations. . . . 
</p><p id="76e6a147-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1962] A.C. 220, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to corrupt public morals and of living on the earnings of prostitution, when he published a directory consisting almost entirely of advertisements of the names, addresses, and specialized talents of prostitutes. Publication of such a directory, said the court, could have no legitimate use and serve no other purpose than to advertise the professional services of the prostitutes whose advertisements appeared in the directory. The publisher could be deemed a participant in the profits from the business activities of his principal advertisers. . . . 
</p><p id="76e6a148-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, there is nothing in the furnishing of telephone answering service which would necessarily imply assistance in the performance of illegal activities. Nor is any inference to be derived from the use of an answering service by women, either in any particular volume of calls, or outside normal working hours. Nightclub entertainers, registered nurses, faith healers, public stenographers, photographic models, and free lance substitute employees, provide examples of women in legitimate occupations whose employment might cause them to receive a volume of telephone calls at irregular hours.</p><p id="76e6a149-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">3. Intent may be inferred from knowledge, when the volume of business with the buyer is grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, or when sales for illegal use amount to a high proportion of the seller’s total business. In such cases an intent to participate in the illegal enterprise may be inferred from the quantity of the business done. For example, in <i>Direct Sales</i>, supra, the sale of narcotics to a rural physician in quantities 300 times greater than he would have normal use for provided potent evidence of an intent to further the illegal activity.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F89_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F89_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">c</a></span> In the same case the court also found significant the fact that the wholesaler had attracted as customers a disproportionately large group of physicians who had been convicted of violating the Harrison Act. In Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1962] A.C. 220, almost the entire business of the directory came from prostitutes.</p><p id="76e6a14b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No evidence of any unusual volume of business with prostitutes was presented by the prosecution against Lauria.</p><p id="76e6a14c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inflated charges, the sale of goods with no legitimate use, sales in inflated amounts, each may provide a fact of sufficient moment from which the intent of the seller to participate in the criminal enterprise may be inferred . . .  because in one way or another the supplier has acquired a special interest <span title="760" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-760">p. 760</span>in the operation of the illegal enterprise. His intent to participate in the crime of which he has knowledge may be inferred from the existence of his special interest.</p><p id="76e6a14d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet there are cases in which it cannot reasonably be said that the supplier has a stake in the venture or has acquired a special interest in the enterprise, but in which he has been held liable as a participant on the basis of knowledge alone. . . . In Regina v. Bainbridge (1959), 3 W.L.R. 656 (CCA 6), a supplier of oxygen-cutting equipment to one known to intend to use it to break into a bank was convicted as an accessory to the crime. . . . It seems apparent from these cases that a supplier who furnishes equipment which he <i>knows</i> will be used to commit a serious crime may be deemed from that knowledge alone to have intended to produce the result. . . . For instance, we think the operator of a telephone answering service with positive knowledge that his service was being used to facilitate the extortion of ransom, the distribution of heroin, or the passing of counterfeit money who continued to furnish the service with knowledge of its use, might be chargeable on knowledge alone with participation in a scheme to extort money, to distribute narcotics, or to pass counterfeit money. The same result would follow the seller of gasoline who knew the buyer was using his product to make Molotov cocktails for terroristic use.</p><p id="76e6c85e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Logically, the same reasoning could be extended to crimes of every description. Yet we do not believe an inference of intent drawn from knowledge of criminal use properly applies to the less serious crimes classified as misdemeanors. The duty to take positive action to dissociate oneself from activities helpful to violations of the criminal law is far stronger and more compelling for felonies than it is for misdemeanors or petty offenses. . . . We believe the distinction between the obligations arising from knowledge of a felony and those arising from knowledge of a misdemeanor continues to reflect basic human feelings about the duties owed by individuals to society. Heinous crime must be stamped out, and its suppression is the responsibility of all. Venial crime and crime not evil in itself present less of a danger to society, and perhaps the benefits of their suppression through the modern equivalent of the posse, the hue and cry, the informant, and the citizen’s arrest, are outweighed by the disruption to everyday life brought about by amateur law enforcement and private officiousness in relatively inconsequential delicts which do not threaten our basic security. . . . 
</p><p id="76e6c85f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to misdemeanors, we conclude that positive knowledge of the supplier that his products or services are being used for criminal purposes does not, without more, establish an intent of the supplier to participate in the misdemeanors. With respect to felonies, we do not decide the converse, viz. that in all cases of felony knowledge of criminal use alone may justify an inference of the supplier’s intent to participate in the crime. The implications of <i>Falcone</i> make the matter uncertain with respect to those felonies which are merely prohibited wrongs. . . . But decision on this point is not compelled, and we leave the matter open.</p><p id="76e6c860-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="761" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-761">p. 761</span>From this analysis of precedent we deduce the following rule: the intent of a supplier who knows of the criminal use to which his supplies are put to participate in the criminal activity connected with the use of his supplies may be established by (1) direct evidence that he intends to participate, or (2) through an inference that he intends to participate based on, (a) his special interest in the activity, or (b) the aggravated nature of the crime itself.</p><p id="76e6c861-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When we review Lauria’s activities in the light of this analysis, we find no proof that Lauria took any direct action to further, encourage, or direct the call-girl activities of his codefendants and we find an absence of circumstances from which his special interest in their activities could be inferred. Neither excessive charges for standardized services, nor the furnishing of services without a legitimate use, nor an unusual quantity of business with call girls, are present. The offense which he is charged with furthering is a misdemeanor, a category of crime which has never been made a required subject of positive disclosure to public authority. Under these circumstances, although proof of Lauria’s knowledge of the criminal activities of his patrons was sufficient to charge him with that fact, there was insufficient evidence that he intended to further their criminal activities, and hence insufficient proof of his participation in a criminal conspiracy with his codefendants to further prostitution. Since the conspiracy centered around the activities of Lauria’s telephone answering service, the charges against his codefendants likewise fail for want of proof.</p><p id="76e6c862-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In absolving Lauria of complicity in a criminal conspiracy we do not wish to imply that the public authorities are without remedies to combat modern manifestations of the world’s oldest profession. Licensing of telephone answering services under the police power, together with the revocation of licenses for the toleration of prostitution, is a possible civil remedy. The furnishing of telephone answering service in aid of prostitution could be made a crime. (Cf. Pen. Code, §316, which makes it a misdemeanor to let an apartment with knowledge of its use for prostitution.) Other solutions will doubtless occur to vigilant public authorities if the problem of call-girl activity needs further suppression.</p><p id="76e6c863-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The order is affirmed.</p></div>

<i>1. Purpose or knowledge in felony cases.</i> Does the <i>Lauria</i> court’s analysis imply that knowledge alone <i>is</i> a sufficient mens rea for conspiracy when the object crime is a felony? What <i>should be</i> the result when the object offense is a very serious crime? Recall that in <i>United States v. Fountain</i>, p. 703 supra, the court held (relying on <i>Lauria</i>) that Gometz, who supplied a knife knowing that it would be used to kill, could be an accomplice in the murder. Should the same facts be sufficient to hold Gometz responsible for <i>conspiracy</i> to commit murder? Even if knowledge alone is considered sufficient for aiding and abetting liability, might it make sense to require more to make the supplier and his <span title="762" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-762">p. 762</span>customer “partners in crime”? In this regard, recall, as we have pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, that conspiracy, unlike accomplice liability, is an inchoate offense and that it carries many broad procedural and other consequences.</p>
<p id="76e6c867-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC solution to these problems is to require purpose for <i>both</i> conspiracy and accomplice liability. See §§2.06(3)(a), 5.03(1). For the commentary relevant to these provisions, see the MPC discussion of accomplice mens rea, set out at pp. 701-702 supra. Most states likewise require purpose in conspiracy cases, even when the object crime is a serious felony. Thus, in Commonwealth v. Camerano, 677 N.E.2d 678 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997), the defendant rented land to Howell and permitted him to erect a garden enclosure in which, as Camerano surely knew, Howell was growing a large amount of marijuana. Though Camerano could have evicted Howell at any time, he allowed Howell to remain and collected $200 per month in rent, money that Howell allegedly could not have obtained from any legal source. Camerano’s conviction for conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana was nonetheless reversed, with the court noting (id. at 681) that “[i]ntent is a requisite mental state for conspiracy, not mere knowledge or acquiescence.” In United States v. Scotti, 47 F.3d 1237 (2d Cir. 1995), Scotti threatened to “break Egnat’s legs and burn down [his] house” unless he came up with $50,000 to pay an extortionate debt. Scotti then asked Rodriguez, a mortgage broker, to help Egnat arrange a mortgage to obtain the cash. Rodriguez did so, knowing that Egnat had been threatened and had only agreed to the transaction reluctantly. But Rodriguez’s assistance, with full knowledge of the circumstances, was held insufficient to make him guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion. Was the decision correct?</p>

<i>2. Problems. (a)</i> Zahm wanted to use Lawrence’s house trailer as a site for manufacturing methamphetamine. The chemicals used to “cook” methamphetamine can soil or damage the work area, and there is a risk of explosion when the volatile ingredients are heated to high temperatures. Lawrence agreed to accept $1,000 for leasing the trailer to Zahm for one day. The “cook” was never carried out, but prosecutors want to charge Zahm and Lawrence with conspiracy. Is Lawrence guilty of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine? United States v. Blankenship, 970 F.2d 283 (7th Cir. 1992), holds that he is not. Do you agree?

<span title="763" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-763">p. 763</span>The circumstantial evidence in this case adequately supports Morse’s conspiracy convictions. First, the plane in Florida that Morse sold to Colding was particularly suited for smuggling: there were no passenger seats in the plane, leaving more room for hauling marijuana; one witness—a customs agent—testified that “a Beechcraft Queen Aire happens to be one of the profile aircraft that is involved in narcotic smuggling.” Second, Morse sold the plane for $115,000, almost twice its market value; he had raised the price from $80,000 after meeting with Cauthen and Colding. Third, all payments were made in cash of low denominations. Fourth, Morse sold the plane to Colding, a twenty-three-year old, without any contract or receipt to evidence the transaction. Fifth, Morse, who never had registered <i>his</i> purchase of the plane with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), sold the plane without providing the FAA with an aircraft registration application or bill of sale as required by law. Sixth, Morse was informed that the plane had been used to smuggle marijuana; yet he made no attempt to contact law enforcement officials. Seventh, when Colding failed to pay the balance of the agreed purchase price, Morse did not threaten to file suit to recover the money.</p>

<i>(c)</i> Heras drove Correa, whom Heras knew to be a drug dealer, to a hotel near the airport, knowing that the purpose of the trip was for Correa to take possession of a large quantity of drugs. Is that knowledge alone sufficient to infer Heras’s intent to facilitate drug distribution? While the district court thought this evidence was insufficient to infer purpose, the Second Circuit disagreed. United States v. Heras, 609 F.3d 101 (2d Cir. 2010). Which court was correct?</p>

<i>(d)</i> Sanchez and others imported large quantities of methamphetamine (about two pounds per month) from Mexico to Idaho, where they then sold it to a number of regular buyers, including Loveland. Loveland purchased two ounces of methamphetamine at a time every month, a quantity that is too large for self-consumption. Sanchez was aware that the size of the quantity meant that Loveland was reselling the drugs. Loveland was charged with conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine. He argued that, while he was guilty of possessing with intent to distribute methamphetamine, he is not guilty of a conspiracy to do so because Sanchez had no stake in Loveland’s distribution of the goods. The Ninth Circuit agreed, finding that “the quantities and repeated sales to Loveland would support an inference that the Sanchez group knew that it was probably selling drugs to a reseller” but that was insufficient. The Court reasoned that Sanchez’s stake in Loveland’s enterprise “was no different from a big-box store’s stake in a convenience store’s financial success from the resale of individually packaged peanuts purchased from the carton from the big-box store.” The Ninth Circuit thus agreed with the Seventh Circuit that “regular purchase on standard terms” does not <span title="764" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-764">p. 764</span>“transform a customer into a co-conspirator.” United States v. Loveland, 825 F.3d 555, 563 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations omitted). What kind of additional evidence would point to conspiracy? The Ninth Circuit mentioned that evidence that the seller fronted drugs to the buyer on credit, to be repaid after the drugs were resold, would be evidence of an agreement. It also thought evidence that the seller and buyer had a more involved relationship—such as frequent texts and calls—might also establish an agreement. Id. at 561. Are these facts more persuasive than the large quantities involved? Why? Should it matter for purposes of the analysis that Loveland faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment if found guilty of the conspiracy because of the larger quantities of drugs involved?</p>

<i>3. Corrupt motive.</i> In a leading common-law precedent, People v. Powell, 63 N.Y. 88 (1875), the court held that to be criminal, a conspiracy must be animated by a “corrupt” motive or an intention to engage in conduct known to be wrongful. To understand the operation of the <i>Powell</i> doctrine, consider the following factual scenario: Suppose an election officer and a clerk agree to enter votes on the official tally sheets before the time set by law, but do so in good faith (there is no opposition candidate) and without knowing that such action is criminal. Under the <i>Powell</i> doctrine, they could not be convicted of conspiracy to enter false figures on the tally sheets. Cf. Commonwealth v. Gormley, 77 Pa. Super. 298 (1921) (citing <i>Powell</i> to require the admission of evidence of good faith and ignorance of the criminality of the act under such circumstances).</p>

<i>Question:</i> Doesn’t this approach in effect make mistake of law a defense in a conspiracy prosecution? The <i>Powell</i> doctrine has been widely criticized. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §503 at 417-418 (1985):</p>

This should, however, be the function of the statutes defining such offenses. Section 2.04(3) specifies the limited situations when ignorance of the criminality of one’s conduct is a defense in general.

<i>4. Attendant circumstances.</i> How should the law treat a situation where the defendant claims a mistake of fact as to some attendant circumstance? That is, should mistake of fact be a defense to a conspiracy charge even if it would not be a defense in a prosecution for the substantive offense? Consider the following situations:</p>

<i>(a) Facts that increase the gravity of the offense.</i> Suppose that Supplier and Dealer meet with Buyer and negotiate terms for a large purchase of drugs. At Buyer’s request, they agree to deliver the drugs to him at Seedy’s Bar. Before the delivery is made, Supplier and Dealer are arrested. Buyer turns out to be an undercover agent, and (unknown to Dealer and Supplier) Seedy’s Bar turns out to be directly across the street from a public school. State law imposes much higher penalties for drug sales that occur within 1,000 feet of a school. Can Dealer and Supplier be convicted of conspiracy to distribute drugs within 1,000 feet of a school? Consider United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601 (1971), supra p. 310. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld an indictment charging both possession and conspiracy to possess unregistered hand grenades, despite its failure to allege that the defendant knew the grenades were unregistered. The Court treated the substantive offense of possessing unregistered hand grenades as imposing strict liability so far as the attendant circumstance of registration was concerned. The Court disposed of the challenge to the conspiracy charge as follows (id. at n.14):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e6ef84-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We need not decide whether a criminal conspiracy to do an act “innocent in itself” and not known by the alleged conspirators to be prohibited must be actuated by some corrupt motive other than the intention to do the act which is prohibited and which is the object of the conspiracy. An agreement to acquire hand grenades is hardly an agreement innocent in itself. Therefore what we have said of the substantive offense satisfies on these special facts the requirements for a conspiracy.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e6ef85-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is this holding sound? So far as the conspiracy count was concerned, was the defendant arguing only that he did not know it was a crime to possess grenades or that he did not agree to possess <i>unregistered</i> grenades? Did the Court confuse two separate defenses, namely, the defense of ignorance of the criminality of the agreement and the defense of lack of agreement to do the prohibited act?</p>

<i>(b) Facts essential to criminality.</i> Suppose that, in contrast to <i>United States v. Freed</i>, supra, the alleged conspiracy involves an act “innocent in itself.” For example, suppose that Alan and Mary, after spending an evening together, decide to go to a motel where they intend to have consensual sexual relations. Bill agrees to drive them there, knowing their intentions, but just before they leave, Mary’s parents arrive on the scene and foil the plan. Though neither Alan nor Bill could have known it, Mary is underage. Can Alan and Bill be convicted of conspiracy to commit statutory rape?</p>
<p id="76e71697-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We considered variations on this hypothetical at two earlier points above. With respect to <i>attempt</i> liability, the MPC Commentary states that a person in Alan’s position would be guilty of attempted statutory rape. See pp. 650-651 supra. With respect to Bill’s liability as an <i>accomplice</i>, the Commentary argues that the Code is ambiguous and states that the issue was left for the courts to decide. See p. 717 supra. With respect to the mens rea for <i>conspiracy</i>, the Commentary likewise states that the Code is ambiguous and that the issue <span title="766" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-766">p. 766</span>was left to the courts. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §5.03 at 413 (1985). Yet the text of §5.03(1) provides that a person is guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime only if he acts “with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its commission.” How can it be said that either Alan or Bill has “the purpose of promoting or facilitating [the] commission” of the crime of statutory rape?</p>
<p id="76e71698-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Apart from the question of textual interpretation, what is the sensible way to resolve this problem? Some would argue that the policies that determine the mens rea for the object crime logically govern the matter on the conspiracy charge as well. Under this view, then, if the attendant circumstance is a strict liability element, a defendant can be guilty of conspiracy no matter what his or her mens rea is with respect to that attendant circumstance. Alan and Bill would thus be guilty of conspiracy under this view. But, given the very early point at which conspiracy liability can attach, is it important to require subjective culpability with respect to the crucial attendant circumstance even if the substantive offense does not require it? Whatever may be the right solution to this problem for complicity and attempts, how can a mens rea that is less than purpose or knowledge ever suffice for conspiracy, which—by definition—consists of an <i>agreement</i> to engage in the prohibited conduct?</p>
<p id="76e71699-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The English approach acknowledges these concerns. The English Criminal Law Act, 1977, ch. 45, §1(2) states:</p>

That case held that participation in the conspiracy was not itself enough to sustain a conviction for the substantive offense even though it was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The court held that, in addition to evidence that the offense was in fact committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, evidence of direct participation in the commission of the substantive offense or other evidence from which participation might fairly be inferred was necessary.</p><p id="76e73db7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We take a different view. We have here a continuous conspiracy. There is here no evidence of the affirmative action on the part of Daniel which is necessary to establish his withdrawal from it. Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 369. As stated in that case, “Having joined in an unlawful scheme, having constituted agents for its performance, scheme and agency to be continuous until full fruition be secured, until he does some act to disavow or defeat the purpose he is in no situation to claim the delay of the law. As the offense has not been terminated or accomplished, he is still offending. And we think, consciously offending, offending as certainly, as we have said, as at the first moment of his confederation, and consciously through every moment of its existence.” And so long as the partnership in crime continues the partners act for each other in carrying it forward. It is settled that “an overt act of one partner may be the act of all without any new agreement specifically directed to that act.” Motive or intent may be proved by the acts or declarations of some of the conspirators in furtherance of the common objective. The governing principle is the same when the substantive offense is committed by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the unlawful project. The criminal intent to do the act is established by the formation of the conspiracy. Each conspirator instigated the commission of the crime. The unlawful agreement contemplated precisely what was done. It was formed for the purpose. The act <span title="768" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-768">p. 768</span>done was in execution of the enterprise. The rule which holds responsible one who counsels, procures, or commands another to commit a crime is founded on the same principle. That principle is recognized in the law of conspiracy when the overt act of one partner in crime is attributable to all. An overt act is an essential ingredient of the crime of conspiracy under §37 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. §88 [now §371]. If that can be supplied by the act of one conspirator, we fail to see why the same or other acts in furtherance of the conspiracy are likewise not attributable to the others for the purpose of holding them responsible for the substantive offense.</p><p id="76e73db8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different case would arise if the substantive offense committed by one of the conspirators was not in fact done in furtherance of the conspiracy, did not fall within the scope of the unlawful project, or was merely a part of the ramifications of the plan which could not be reasonably foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.

<p id="76e764d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That understanding of <i>Pinkerton</i> is also widely accepted by commentators and treatises, whether they are critical of its rule, or only expounding the existing law. . . .

Although conspirator liability is circumscribed by the requirement of a close causal connection between the conspiracy and the substantive crime, that standard concededly is less strict than that defining accomplice accountability. It is, however, evident that the Legislature chose to address the special dangers inherent in group activity and therefore intended to include the crime of conspiracy as a distinctive basis for vicarious criminal liability.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11184_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11184_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

<p id="76e764de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From that evidence a jury could conclude that a reasonably foreseeable risk and a probable and natural consequence of carrying out a plan to intimidate the crowd by using loaded guns would be that one of the gunslingers would intentionally fire at somebody, and, under the circumstances, that act would be sufficiently connected to the original conspirational plan to provide a just basis for a determination of guilt for that substantive crime.</p>

A person is guilty of a conspiracy to commit an offense only if “<i>with the purpose</i> of promoting or facilitating its commission he” or she agrees with another person that they will “engage in conduct which constitutes such crime” or agrees to aid such person “in the planning or commission of such crime.” N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2a (emphasis added).</p>

<i>1. In favor of</i> Pinkerton. Consider the statement of Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kenney to a Senate subcommittee considering this issue in the context of a revision of the federal criminal law (quoted in Note, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 1122, 1152 (1975)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e78af9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The ever-increasing sophistication of organized crime presents a compelling reason against abandonment of <i>Pinkerton.</i> Complicated and highly refined stock frauds . . . and narcotics conspiracies represent a substantial and ever-increasing threat to society justifying retention of the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine. Empirical evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that those who form and <span title="772" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-772">p. 772</span>control illegal enterprises are generally well insulated from prosecutions, with the exception of prosecutions predicated upon the theory of conspiracy. To preclude uniformly their exposure to additional sanctions, regardless of the circumstances, for the very crimes which sustain their illegal ventures, would have the most unfortunate and inequitable consequences.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e78afa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is Kenney correct that overruling <i>Pinkerton</i> would preclude liability for those who “form and control illegal enterprises”? Wouldn’t they be liable under traditional accomplice liability?</p>
<p id="76e78afb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Scholarly commentators have echoed Kenney’s suggestion that the functional justification for <i>Pinkerton</i> derives from the same source as the functional justification for conspiracy law more generally—the need to counteract the special advantages (to criminals) of group organization:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e7b20c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thinking of conspiracy and related doctrines as a collective sanction regime casts light on several functional advantages they might bring to law enforcement. . . . First, where individual members of conspiracies are difficult to apprehend, conspiracy law makes it possible to inflict costs on them indirectly by punishing other members who are more accessible. For example, if high-level managers of a drug organization are difficult to identify or reach, conspiracy law allows the government to punish lower-level drug dealers, who will in turn demand higher compensation from the managers in exchange for bearing greater liability risks. Second, like other forms of collective sanctions, conspiracy liability can serve as an information-forcing tool. Conspiracy law makes it possible for prosecutors to threaten low-level conspirators with severe sentences and then offer them reductions in exchange for inculpatory evidence about higher-level conspirators. . . . Third, conspiracy law, along with other accomplice liability doctrines, gives criminal groups an incentive to monitor and control excessively harmful activity. Under <i>Pinkerton</i>, every member of a drug organization is liable for every [foreseeable] murder committed by another member of the organization [in furtherance of the drug conspiracy] and therefore has an incentive to police unnecessary violence.</p>

<p id="76e7b20e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is it realistic to expect low-level drug dealers “to monitor and control” “unnecessary violence” by those higher up in the organization? Even if so, is it legitimate to uphold <i>Pinkerton</i> for functional reasons such as these, if doing so will mean that some individuals in a conspiracy will face criminal sanctions beyond their personal fault? Are there any limits to using the criminal law in this way? For example, should parents be liable for the crimes of their children, if there is a functional reason for believing that they can to some degree control the behavior of their children? Or is individual fault too important a principle to abandon in the name of utilitarian goals?</p>
<p id="76e7b20f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another argument in favor of <i>Pinkerton</i> rests on the notion of a “group will.” Consider Jens David Ohlin, Group Think: The Law of Conspiracy and Collective Reason, 98 J.

<p id="76e7b214-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not offensive to permit a conviction of conspiracy to stand on the overt act committed by another, for the act merely provides corroboration of the existence of the agreement and indicates that the agreement has reached a point where it poses a sufficient threat to society to impose sanctions. . . . But it is repugnant to our system of jurisprudence, where guilt is generally personal to the defendant, . . . to impose punishment, not for the socially harmful agreement to which the defendant is a party, but for substantive offenses in which he did not participate. . . .

The MPC also rejects <i>Pinkerton</i>, imposing accomplice liability on conspirators for the substantive crimes of their co-conspirators only when the strict conditions for accomplice liability are met.

<i>3. Continuing controversy over</i> Pinkerton. Although the federal courts and some states continue to permit vicarious liability for the substantive offenses of co-conspirators, the doctrine is far from settled. State supreme courts continue to reconsider their acceptance or rejection of the <i>Pinkerton</i> rule. For example, the Connecticut Supreme Court reaffirmed its embrace of <i>Pinkerton</i>, rejecting a defendant’s constitutional challenge to the doctrine under the Due Process Clause. State v. Coltherst, 620 A.2d 1024 (Conn. 2003). The court stated, “When the defendant has ‘played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of criminal conduct,’ he cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine, for the natural and probable result of . . . conduct that, although he did not intend, he should have foreseen.” Id. at 1039-1040. In contrast, the Washington Supreme Court rejected the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine as inconsistent with the mens rea requirements of Washington’s statutory provisions on accomplice liability. State v. Stein, 27 P.3d 184 (Wash. 2001). And, in a Solomonic decision, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the defendant’s convictions under <i>Pinkerton</i> for a co-conspirator’s “specific intent” offenses (burglary and kidnapping), while upholding the defendant’s convictions for “general intent” offenses (such as home invasion). The court reasoned that permitting <i>Pinkerton</i> liability for specific intent crimes would allow the state to “sidestep” the statutory mens rea requirement for those offenses. Bolden v. State, 124 P.3d 191 (Nev. 2005).</p>

<i>1. Liability of a new conspirator for prior acts of co-conspirators.</i> It is often said that upon joining an ongoing conspiracy, a person becomes liable for all acts committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy, including acts committed prior to his joining. See, e.g., 16 Am. Jur. 2d Conspiracy §20 (1979). Such statements are sometimes misinterpreted to suggest that a defendant is liable under <i>Pinkerton</i> for <i>substantive crimes</i> that co-conspirators committed before he joined the conspiracy. But <i>Pinkerton</i> liability is <span title="775" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-775">p. 775</span>not retroactive.

<p id="76e7b21c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The confusion here is that with regard to liability for <i>conspiracy,</i> a defendant may be legally responsible for acts of co-conspirators prior to that defendant’s entry into the conspiracy [in the sense that such acts may be used as evidence against him in the prosecution for the stand-alone crime of conspiracy], whereas, with regard to <i>substantive offenses</i>, a defendant cannot be retroactively liable for offenses committed prior to his joining the conspiracy.</p>

<i>2. </i>Pinkerton <i>and</i> Luparello <i>liability compared.</i> Under the traditional view of accomplice liability, as discussed in the <i>Bridges</i> case, liability as an <i>accomplice</i> requires proof that the accomplice intended to promote or facilitate the specific offense for which the prosecution seeks to hold him accountable. In jurisdictions adhering to this view, liability as a co-conspirator under a <i>Pinkerton</i> theory represents a considerable expansion of the liability that the co-conspirator would face under the normal rules of accomplice liability. See, e.g., United States v. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 49-51 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p id="76e7d92e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But, as we saw in the section on Complicity, pp. 721-727 supra, some jurisdictions now use an objective foreseeability test to determine the liability of an accomplice for originally unintended crimes committed by the principal in the course of the criminal endeavor. In these jurisdictions, the objective theory of accomplice liability often produces results similar to those produced by <i>Pinkerton.</i> Indeed, in such jurisdictions, accomplice liability may reach even further than <i>Pinkerton</i> liability. Consider the <i>Luparello</i> case, supra p. 721. Recall that the defendant, who was attempting to locate his former girlfriend, Terri, agreed with several friends to beat up a man named Martin, in order to force Martin to disclose Terri’s whereabouts. When one of the conspirators lured Martin out of his house, another conspirator, who was waiting in a parked car, fired six shots at Martin and killed him. Luparello, who was not present at the scene, was convicted of first-degree murder. The <i>Luparello</i> court found murder liability under its expansive doctrine of accomplice liability because the killing of Martin was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Luparello’s conceded offense of assault. But could liability be sustained under <i>Pinkerton</i> in such a situation? Was the shooter’s action “in furtherance” of the conspiratorial agreement?</p>
<p id="76e7d92f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Expansive applications of</i> Pinkerton. In People v. Brigham, 265 Cal. Rptr. 486 (Ct. App. 1989), the defendant and Bluitt set out to kill a man named “Chuckie.” They saw a teenager on the street, the defendant said, “That is Chuckie,” and the two men walked toward the teenager, carrying their weapons. When they got closer, the defendant said to Bluitt, “[T]hat is not Chuckie. . . . Don’t do it. . . . That’s not the dude.” Bluitt rejected the defendant’s advice, saying that he wanted to let people “know we [are] serious.” Bluitt fired twice, killing the teenager. Because of Bluitt’s “hardheaded and erratic nature,” the prosecution argued and the jury found that the defendant could “reasonably foresee” that Bluitt, once set in motion, might knowingly <span title="776" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-776">p. 776</span>kill someone other than his assigned target. On this basis, the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Is the conviction proper under the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine? Under any other doctrine?</p>
<p id="76e7d930-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In United States v. Wall, 225 F.3d 858 (7th Cir. 2000), the defendant, who had a prior felony conviction, was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1), which made it a felony for a person with a previous felony conviction to possess a gun that had traveled in interstate commerce. The government sought to establish possession under a vicarious liability theory premised on <i>Pinkerton.</i> It argued that since the defendant’s co-conspirator possessed a gun, its possession could also be attributed to the defendant, even though the co-conspirator’s possession of the gun was not a crime. Is this a legitimate application of <i>Pinkerton</i>? The court thought not, concluding:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e7d931-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he government uses a cut-and-paste approach, taking the firearm possession by one conspirator, adding it to the felon status of another conspirator, and thereby creating a substantive offense for that second conspirator. It is a significant expansion of the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine that appears to be difficult to limit.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e7d932-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do you agree? The Seventh Circuit seems to be having second thoughts. In United States v. Newman, 755 F.3d 543 (7th Cir. 2014), the court upheld Newman’s conviction for being a felon in possession, even though he never actually possessed the gun, because his co-conspirator possessed the gun. But Newman’s co-conspirator was himself a felon, so the case was distinguishable from <i>Wall</i> where the defendant’s co-conspirator did not have a felony conviction and therefore could lawfully possess the weapon. Nevertheless, in dicta, the Seventh Circuit questioned the result even under the facts in <i>Wall</i>, arguing that <i>Pinkerton</i> concluded that the <i>acts</i> of one conspirator can be attributed to a co-conspirator and not simply the <i>crimes</i> of one conspirator to another. Id. at 546-547. But the court left for another day the definitive resolution of the issue and whether <i>Wall</i> was wrongly decided.</p>

All the dealers were convicted of conspiracy to commit and commission of various drug offenses. Two of them, Alvarez and Simon, who shot the agents, were also convicted of first-degree murder of a federal agent. Three of the dealers, Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez, were convicted of second-degree murder, though they played no part in the shooting.] Appellants Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez contend that their murder convictions . . . were based on an unprecedented and improper <span title="777" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-777">p. 777</span>extension of Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). . . . The[y] argue that murder is not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of a drug conspiracy, and that their murder convictions therefore should be reversed. We conclude that, although the murder convictions of the three appellants may represent an unprecedented application of Pinkerton, such an application is not improper. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e7d936-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Upon reviewing the record, we find ample evidence to support the jury’s conclusion that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment. In making this determination, we rely on two critical factors. First, the evidence clearly established that the drug conspiracy was designed to effectuate the sale of a large quantity of cocaine. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e7d937-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, based on the amount of drugs and money involved, the jury was entitled to infer that, at the time the cocaine sale was arranged, the conspirators must have been aware of the likelihood (1) that at least some of their number would be carrying weapons, and (2) that deadly force would be used, if necessary, to protect the conspirators’ interests. . . . In our opinion, these two critical factors provided ample support for the jury’s conclusion that the murder was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e7d938-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The three appellants also contend that, even if the murder was reasonably foreseeable, their murder convictions nevertheless should be reversed. The appellants argue that the murder was sufficiently distinct from the intended purposes of the drug conspiracy, and that their individual roles in the conspiracy were sufficiently minor, that they should not be held responsible for the murder. We are not persuaded. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e7d939-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We acknowledge that the instant case is not a typical <i>Pinkerton</i> case. Here, the murder of Agent Rios was not within the originally intended scope of the conspiracy, but instead occurred as a result of an unintended turn of events. We have not found, nor has the government cited, any authority for the proposition that all conspirators, regardless of individual culpability, may be held responsible under <i>Pinkerton</i> for reasonably foreseeable but originally unintended substantive crimes.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11385_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11385_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span>

<p id="76e7d93d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Nevertheless, these considerations do not require us to reverse the murder convictions of Portal, Concepcion, and Hernandez. . . . All three were more than “minor” participants in the drug conspiracy. Portal served as a lookout in front of the Hurricane Motel during part of the negotiations that led to the shoot-out, and the evidence indicated that he was armed. Concepcion introduced the agents to Alvarez, the apparent leader of the conspiracy, and was present when the shoot-out started. Finally, Hernandez, the manager of the motel, allowed the drug transactions to take place on the premises and acted as a translator during part of the negotiations that led to the shoot-out.</p>
<p id="76e8004e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition, all three appellants had actual knowledge of at least some of the circumstances and events leading up to the murder. The evidence that Portal was carrying a weapon demonstrated that he anticipated the possible use of deadly force to protect the conspirators’ interests. Moreover, both Concepcion and Hernandez were present when Alvarez stated that he would rather be dead than go back to prison, indicating that they, too, were aware that deadly force might be used to prevent apprehension by Federal agents.</p>
<p id="76e8004f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . We therefore hold that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability for the murder of Agent Rios properly was imposed on the three appellants. . . .

<p id="76e80053-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The limitation suggested by the <i>Alvarez</i> court in its footnote 27—that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability might be negated by a defendant’s minor role in a conspiracy or lack of knowledge about the unintended substantive offense—has been developed by other courts as a possible restraint on the reach of the <i>Pinkerton</i> doctrine. For example, when the Connecticut Supreme Court first explicitly adopted the <i>Pinkerton</i> rule, it suggested that the rule might apply only when the defendant was a “leader” of the conspiracy. State v. Walton, 630 A.2d 990 (Conn. 1993). In a later case, a defendant sought to avoid substantive liability under this limitation. He argued that although he was one of several men who ambushed a truck and fired multiple shots into it, killing an eight-year-old boy, he was neither the actual shooter of the boy nor the leader of the conspiracy to ambush and thus should not be held liable under Connecticut’s version of <i>Pinkerton</i> for the boy’s murder. The Connecticut Supreme Court rejected this argument, but in doing so cautioned:</p>

<p id="76e8276b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Particularly in jurisdictions where a defendant is liable for crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy by co-conspirators under a <i>Pinkerton</i> theory, questions of a conspiracy’s scope and duration become critically important.</p>
<p id="76e8276c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Duration of a conspiracy.</i> Conspiracy traditionally has been viewed as a continuing offense. The basic rule is that once formed, a conspiracy remains in effect until its objectives have either been achieved or abandoned. See United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601 (1910). Thus, unlike most criminal offenses, the statute of limitations for conspiracy begins to run not when the offense is committed (that is, when the agreement is made), but when the conspiracy terminates. One effect of this concept is that a conspiracy often can remain subject to prosecution long after the initial agreement was made and long after some of its members have ceased any active participation in the activities. In addition, because the various collateral consequences of conspiracy come into play only with respect to the period when the conspiracy is in existence, it may be crucial for defendants to try to shorten that period or for prosecutors to try to extend it.</p>
<p id="76e8276d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The breadth of the conspiratorial objectives and concealment.</i> In Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949), the government argued that defendants who conspired to violate the Mann Act, a statute prohibiting interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, continued their conspiracy long after the transportation itself was completed. The government urged that conspirators always implicitly agree with each other to conceal facts in order to prevent detection and prosecution for the principal offense. The Supreme Court rejected the government’s theory. In Grunewald v. United <span title="780" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-780">p. 780</span>States, 353 U.S. 391, 404 (1957), the Court held that a conspiracy cannot be treated as including a cover-up agreement unless there is “direct evidence [of] an express original agreement among the conspirators to continue to act in concert in order to cover up . . . traces of the crime. . . . ” Thus, the Court explained (id. at 402):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e8276e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] subsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime. . . . Acts of covering up, even though done in the context of a mutually understood need for secrecy, cannot themselves constitute proof that concealment of the crime after its commission was part of the initial agreement. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76e8276f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In accord with <i>Krulewitch</i> and <i>Grunewald</i>, most courts today refuse to infer that an implicit agreement to cover up the crime is inherent in every conspiracy. See United States v. Turner, 548 F.3d 1094, 1097-1098 (D.C. Cir. 2008). If co-conspirators do agree to help each other cover up the crime, when would the objective of such a conspiracy be achieved? When would the statute of limitations begin to run?</p>
<p id="76e82770-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that agreements to conceal are not the only way for conspiracies to continue beyond the commission of the object crime. The conspirators may engage in further activities in pursuit of the conspiratorial scheme—such as the distribution of proceeds, the pawning or fencing of stolen goods, or the dismantling of a stolen car for parts—even after the object crime has been committed. For example, in United States v. Franklin, 415 F.3d 537 (6th Cir. 2005), one Stinson, a former employee of an armored car company, conspired with Franklin and Clarke to rob an armored truck. Stinson provided the others with keys to the truck and recommended where to rob it so as to reap the most cash and avoid capture. The day after Franklin and Clarke committed the robbery, Stinson went to Franklin’s apartment to pick up his share of the proceeds. Franklin then recounted details of the crime and cautioned Stinson not to get caught. The court held that Franklin’s statements, uttered “only hours after the robbery and in the context of dispersing the ill-gotten proceeds,” were made “during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.” Id. at 552.</p>
<p id="76e82771-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Criminalizing non-criminal objectives.</i> At common law, an agreement became punishable as a conspiracy if the objectives were criminal or “unlawful.” See Commonwealth v. Hunt, 45 Mass. 111 (1842). “Unlawful” objectives could include acts deemed offensive to “public morals” and acts that violate civil law regulations or precedents. As Justice Jackson noted in his concurrence in <i>Krulewitch</i>, this means that “at common law and under some statutes a combination may be a criminal conspiracy even if it contemplates only acts which are not crimes at all when perpetrated by an individual.” Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. at 449.</p>
<p id="76e82772-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Public morals.</i> In Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1962] A.C. 220, the House of Lords upheld a conviction for “conspiracy to corrupt <span title="781" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-781">p. 781</span>public morals,” on the basis of a defendant’s agreement to publish a directory listing prostitutes and their services. In the United States, most states reject this doctrine and confine criminal conspiracy to those agreements whose objectives are themselves criminal. See Note, Conspiracy: Statutory Reform Since the Model Penal Code, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 1122, 1129 (1975). But in some states an agreement to pursue non-criminal objectives can be a criminal conspiracy. For example, Cal. Penal Code §182(a)(5) (2016) makes it a punishable conspiracy for two or more persons to agree “[t]o commit any act injurious to the public health, to public morals, or to pervert or obstruct justice, or the due administration of the laws. . . . ”</p>

<i>Question:</i> Can a prosecution under §182(a)(5) survive a challenge for unconstitutional vagueness? Reconsider <i>City of Chicago v. Morales</i>, p. 185 supra.</p>
<p id="76e82774-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Other non-criminal objectives.</i> Even where the “public morals” doctrine is not invoked, statutes may use the conspiracy concept to punish those who agree to pursue objectives that are unlawful because they violate the civil code but not the criminal law. Consider Cal. Penal Code §182(a)(3) (2016), which makes it a punishable conspiracy “[t]o falsely move or maintain any suit, action or proceeding.”</p>
<p id="76e82775-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Impossibility.</i> What if the government intervenes to frustrate the success of a conspiracy, without alerting all of the conspirators? Should a conspiracy be considered terminated whenever its object becomes impossible to achieve? In United States v. Jimenez Recio, 537 U.S. 270 (2003), the police stopped a truck carrying illegal drugs, seized the drugs, and with the assistance of the truck’s drivers, set up a sting. The drivers paged two other men who arrived and drove away with the truckload of drugs. When these two other men were prosecuted for conspiracy to possess and distribute the drugs, the Ninth Circuit held that their convictions could not be sustained absent evidence that they had joined the conspiracy before the drug seizure. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this rule of automatic termination as “inconsistent with . . . basic conspiracy law.” Id. at 274-275.</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e82776-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The crime of conspiracy “poses a threat to the public” over and above the threat of the commission of the relevant substantive crime—both because the “combination in crime makes more likely the commission of [other] crimes” and because it “decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality.” Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593-594 (1961). . . . Where police have frustrated a conspiracy’s specific objective but conspirators (unaware of that fact) have neither abandoned the conspiracy nor withdrawn, these special conspiracy-related dangers remain. . . . So too remains the essence of the conspiracy—the agreement to commit the crime.</p>
</div>
<p id="76e82777-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">The Court also noted that the Ninth Circuit’s rule would threaten the viability of properly run sting operations. It reasoned that the potential for abuse in such sting operations could be addressed by the defense of entrapment, see <span title="782" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-782">p. 782</span>supra p. 737, rather than by limiting the appropriate scope of conspiracy doctrine. Does the entrapment defense really provide an adequate check? Are the concerns with government overreach greater in the conspiracy context because of the sweep of <i>Pinkerton</i>?</p>
<p id="76e84e88-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Abandonment and withdrawal.</i> A conspiracy is generally considered to be abandoned when none of the conspirators is engaging in any action to further the conspiratorial objectives. If such inactivity continues for a period equal to the statute of limitations, prosecution will be barred. See Model Penal Code §5.03(7)(b). But what if a particular defendant “wants out” of an ongoing conspiracy? Can a conspirator cut off his own responsibility for <i>later</i> acts and statements of his co-conspirators by terminating his own participation? When should withdrawal by a particular defendant start the statute of limitations running as to him? A defendant’s “[a]ffirmative acts inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy and communicated in a manner reasonably calculated to reach co-conspirators have generally been regarded as sufficient to establish withdrawal or abandonment.” United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 464-465 (1978). See also Model Penal Code §5.03(7)(c), Appendix; United States v. Carrazana, 362 Fed. Appx. 973, 976 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>
<p id="76e84e89-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts typically require a defendant to disclose the scheme to law enforcement authorities or communicate his withdrawal to his co-conspirators. But the communication must be direct. The Tenth Circuit, for example, rejected a defendant’s argument that withdrawal from a criminal gang could be established by a long period of activities inconsistent with gang membership. The court explained (United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291 (10th Cir. 2011)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e84e8a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Withdrawal] requires more than implied dissociation. It must be sufficiently clear and delivered to those with authority in the conspiracy such that a jury could conclude that it was reasonably calculated to make the dissociation known to the organization. Simply not spending time with coconspirators is not enough to satisfy this standard.</p>
<p id="76e84e8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Randall argues that [gang] members could withdraw from the gang not “so much by words as by actions.” Randall relies on the testimony of a gang expert who explained at trial that gang members could leave by “maturing out,” or in other words “getting a good job, having children, or just getting more involved in other activities in life.” Thus, Randall argues that he did not need to communicate his withdrawal to other Crips members because he matured out of the gang.</p>
<p id="76e84e8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Randall’s argument is unavailing. . . . “Maturing out” of a gang, without more, does not meet the legal definition of withdrawal from a conspiracy. If Randall matured out of the gang and explicitly communicated to the [gang] members that he no longer would be involved with the gang in any way, then this would be a different case. . . . Merely hoping that the Crips organization would infer his withdrawal from his absence is not enough. The communication must be unambiguous and effective.</p>

<span title="783" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-783">p. 783</span>The Supreme Court unanimously held in Smith v.

<i>6. Renunciation as a complete defense.</i> While a successful withdrawal might shield a conspirator from punishment for acts and statements of co-conspirators that take place after the withdrawal, should it also afford a defense to the conspiracy charge itself? As in the case of abandoned attempts, the common-law answer was no. See pp. 655-657 supra. The theory was that once the crime was committed, it could not be “uncommitted.” Post-offense conduct was considered relevant only to sentencing. Today, most states, following the lead of the MPC, allow a complete defense for renunciation under some circumstances. See Evan Tsen Lee, Cancelling Crime, 30 Conn. L. Rev. 117, 121 (1997). The Code allows the defense only if the circumstances manifest renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose <i>and</i> the actor succeeds in preventing commission of the criminal objectives. Model Penal Code §5.03(6). Some states consider this latter requirement too severe and therefore require only that the actor make a substantial effort to prevent the crime. See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. §5-3-405(2)(B) (2016).</p>

<i>7. Scope of punishment.</i> What should be the appropriate level of punishment when the conspirators have committed the object crimes? The traditional view permits separate punishments, with consecutive sentences, for the object crime and the conspiracy to commit it. In Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587 (1961), the defendant was convicted of obstructing interstate commerce by extortion and of conspiring to obstruct commerce by that same extortion. The maximum punishment for obstructing commerce was 20 years. The trial court imposed a sentence of 12 years on the obstruction count and another 12 years to run consecutively on the conspiracy count. The defendant alleged that Congress did not intend to authorize punishment for both the conspiracy and the obstruction itself. The Court rejected the claim, stating (id. at 593-594):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e84e91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Concerted action both increases the likelihood that the criminal object will be successfully attained and decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality. Group association for criminal purposes often, if not normally, makes possible the attainment of ends more complex than those which one criminal could accomplish. Nor is the danger of a conspiratorial group limited to the particular end toward which it has embarked. Combination in crime makes more likely the commission of crimes unrelated to the original purpose for which the group was formed.

Section 1.07(1)(b) provides that a defendant may not be convicted of more than one offense if “one offense consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other.” But when an agreement is to achieve various criminal objectives and is not limited to a specific crime, the MPC allows for cumulative sentences.

On the other hand, the combination may and often does have criminal objectives that transcend any particular offenses that have been committed in pursuance of its goals. In the latter case, cumulative sentences for conspiracy and substantive offenses ought to be permissible, subject to the general limits on cumulation that the Code prescribes. In the former case, when the preliminary agreement does not go beyond the consummation, double conviction and sentence are barred.</p>

<p id="76e84e94-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Developments in federal sentencing law reflect the continuing controversy over the imposition of separate punishments for conspiracy and the object offense. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect rejected separate punishments for conspiracy and the object offense. Some have lauded this aspect of the Guidelines for limiting the unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. Jacqueline E. Ross, Damned Under Many Headings: The Problem of Multiple Punishment, 29 Am. J. Crim. L. 245, 257 (2002). Despite the Guidelines, however, the proliferation of conspiracy-like statutory offenses—such as RICO (see infra p. 805) and the crime of operating a “continuing criminal enterprise” (CCE)—continue to allow prosecutors to impose separate punishments by “stacking” charges for substantive offenses on top of charges for these conspiracy-like enterprise crimes, resulting in “compound liability” in which a single act can sustain liability for multiple offenses. See Susan W. Brenner, RICO, CCE, and Other Complex Crimes: The Transformation of American Criminal Law, 2 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 239 (1993).</p>

<p id="76e875af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only question is whether petitioners have suffered substantial prejudice from being convicted of a single general conspiracy by evidence which the Government admits proved not one conspiracy but some eight or more different ones of the same sort executed through a common key figure, Simon Brown. Petitioners were convicted under the general conspiracy section of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. §88 [now §371], of conspiring to violate the provisions of the National Housing Act. The judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e875b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The indictment named thirty-two defendants, including the petitioners. The gist of the conspiracy, as alleged, was that the defendants had sought to induce various financial institutions to grant credit, with the intent that the loans for advances would then be offered to the Federal Housing Administration for insurance upon applications containing false and fraudulent information.</p>
<p id="76e875b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of the thirty-two persons named in the indictment nineteen were brought to trial and the names of thirteen were submitted to the jury. Two were acquitted; the jury disagreed as to four; and the remaining seven, including petitioners, were found guilty.</p>
<p id="76e875b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government’s evidence may be summarized briefly, for the petitioners have not contended that it was insufficient, if considered apart from the alleged errors relating to the proof and the instructions at the trial.</p>
<p id="76e875b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Simon Brown, who pleaded guilty, was the common and key figure in all of the transactions proven. He was president of the Brownie Lumber Company. Having had experience in obtaining loans under the National Housing Act, he undertook to act as broker in placing for others loans for modernization and renovation, charging a five per cent commission for his services. Brown knew, when he obtained the loans, that the proceeds were not to be used for the purposes stated in the applications. [The Court then summarized the evidence against several defendants.]</p>
<p id="76e89cc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence against the other defendants whose cases were submitted to the jury was similar in character. They too had transacted business with Brown relating to National Housing Act loans. But no connection was shown between them and petitioners, other than that Brown had been the instrument in each instance for obtaining the loans. In many cases the other defendants did not have any relationship with one another, other than Brown’s connection with each transaction. As the Circuit Court of Appeals <span title="786" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-786">p. 786</span>said, there were “at least eight, and perhaps more, separate and independent groups, none of which had any connection with any other, though all dealt independently with Brown as their agent.” As the Government puts it, the pattern was “that of separate spokes meeting at a common center,” though we may add without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes.</p>
<p id="76e89cc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The proof therefore admittedly made out a case, not of a single conspiracy, but of several, notwithstanding only one was charged in the indictment. The Court of Appeals aptly drew analogy in the comment, “Thieves who dispose of their loot to a single receiver—a single ‘fence’—do not by that fact alone become confederates; they may, but it takes more than knowledge that he is a ‘fence’ to make them such.” It stated that the trial judge “was plainly wrong in supposing that upon the evidence there could be a single conspiracy; and in the view which he took of the law, he should have dismissed the indictment.” Nevertheless the appellate court held the error not prejudicial, saying among other things that “especially since guilt was so manifest, it was ‘proper’ to join the conspiracies,” and “to reverse the conviction would be a miscarriage of justice.” This is indeed the Government’s entire position. . . .

<p id="76e89cc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On its face, as the Court of Appeals said, this portion of the charge was plainly wrong in application to the proof made; and the error pervaded the entire charge, not merely the portion quoted. The jury could not possibly have found, upon the evidence, that there was only one conspiracy. The trial court was of the view that one conspiracy was made out by showing that each defendant was linked to Brown in one or more transactions, and that it was possible on the evidence for the jury to conclude that all were in a common adventure because of this fact and the similarity of purpose presented in the various applications for loans.</p>
<p id="76e89cc9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The view . . . confuses the common purpose of a single enterprise with the several, though similar purposes of numerous separate adventures of like character. It may be that, notwithstanding the misdirection, the jury actually understood correctly the purport of the evidence, as the Government now concedes it to have been, and came to the conclusion that the petitioners were guilty only of the separate conspiracies in which the proof shows they respectively participated. But, in the face of the misdirection and in the circumstances of this case, we cannot assume that the lay triers of fact were so well informed upon the law or that they disregarded the permission expressly given to ignore that vital difference.</p>

This required the cooperation of four groups of persons: the smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the smugglers and distributed to retailers; and two groups of retailers—one in New York and one in Texas and Louisiana—who supplied the addicts. The defendants assert that there were, therefore, at least three separate conspiracies: one between the smugglers and the middlemen, and one between the middlemen and each group of retailers. The evidence did not disclose any cooperation or communication between the smugglers and either group of retailers, or between the two groups of retailers themselves; however, the smugglers knew that the middlemen must sell to retailers, and the retailers knew that the middlemen must buy from importers of one sort or another. Thus the conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the unlawful business would not, and could not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew that it had not begun with their sellers. That being true, a jury might have found that all the accused were embarked upon a venture, in all parts of which each was a participant, and an abettor in the sense that the success of that part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole. . . . It might still be argued that there were two conspiracies; one including the smugglers, the middlemen and the New York group, and the other, the smugglers, the middlemen and the Texas &amp; Louisiana group, for there was apparently no privity between the two groups of retailers. That too would be fallacious. Clearly, quoad the smugglers, there was but one conspiracy, for it was of no moment to them whether the middlemen sold to one or more groups of retailers, provided they had a market somewhere. So too of any retailer; he knew that he was a necessary link in a scheme of distribution, and the others, whom he knew to be convenient to its execution, were as much parts of a single undertaking or enterprise as two salesmen in the same shop. We think therefore that there was only one conspiracy.</p></div>

<p id="76e8eaff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The basic difficulty arises in applying the seventeenth century notion of conspiracy, where the gravamen of the offense was the making of an <i>agreement</i> to commit a readily identifiable crime or series of crimes, such as murder or robbery, to what in substance is the conduct of an illegal business over a period of years. . . . Although it is usual and often necessary in conspiracy cases for the agreement to be proved by inference from acts, the gist of the offense remains the agreement, and it is therefore essential to determine what kind of agreement or understanding existed as to each defendant. It is a great deal harder to tell just <i>what</i> agreement can reasonably be inferred from the purchase, even the repeated purchase, of contraband, than from the furnishing of dynamite to prospective bank robbers or the exchange of worthless property for securities to be subsequently distributed. . . . A seller of narcotics in bulk surely knows that the purchasers will undertake to resell the goods over an uncertain period of time, and the circumstances may also warrant the inference that a supplier or a purchaser indicated a willingness to repeat. But a sale or a purchase scarcely constitutes a sufficient basis for inferring agreement to cooperate with the opposite parties for whatever period they continue to deal in this type of contraband, unless some such understanding is evidenced by other conduct. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">OAKES</span>, Senior Circuit Judge. Defendant James J. McDermott appeals from a judgment . . . convicting him of conspiracy to commit insider trading in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 [among other counts]. . . . On appeal, McDermott contends principally that . . . the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support his convictions. . . . We agree that there is insufficient evidence to support the conspiracy count. . . . 
</p><p id="76e91220-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present prosecution arose out of a triangulated love affair involving the president of a prominent investment bank, a pornographic film star and a New Jersey businessman.</p><p id="76e91221-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until May 1999, McDermott was the president, CEO and Chairman of Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods (“KBW”), an investment bank headquartered in New York City. . . . Around 1996, McDermott began having an extramarital affair with Kathryn Gannon[,] an adult film star and an alleged prostitute. . . . During the course of their affair, McDermott made numerous stock recommendations to Gannon. Unbeknownst to McDermott, Gannon was simultaneously having an affair with Anthony Pomponio and passing these recommendations to him. Although neither Gannon nor Pomponio had extensive training or expertise in securities trading, together they earned around $170,000 in profits during the period relevant to this case.</p><p id="76e91222-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The government indicted McDermott, Gannon and Pomponio for conspiracy to commit insider trading. . . . McDermott and Pomponio were tried together, but Gannon was not present. . . . The Government built its case against McDermott almost entirely on circumstantial evidence linking records of telephone conversations between McDermott and Gannon with records of Gannon’s and Pomponio’s trading activities. Telephone records revealed that McDermott and Gannon engaged in approximately 800 telephone calls during the charged period, including up to 29 calls in one day. Trading records revealed correlations between the telephone calls and stock trades. In addition to these records, the sensational highlight of the government’s evidence . . .  consisted of audiotape recordings of Pomponio’s SEC deposition. These tapes <span title="792" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-792">p. 792</span>undermined Pomponio’s defense and credibility, as they recorded him poorly telling lies, evading questions and affecting incredulous reactions. . . .

According to the government, therefore, McDermott was part of the conspiracy even though he did not agree to pass information to both Gannon and Pomponio.</p><p id="76e93935-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">United States v. Carpenter, 791 F.2d 1024 (2d Cir. 1986), <i>aff’d</i>, 484 U.S. 19 (1987), forecloses the government’s argument. In <i>Carpenter</i>, we reversed the conspiracy conviction of defendant Winans, a Wall Street Journal reporter who participated in a scheme with his friends Felis and Brant to misappropriate insider information and to use it for personal gain. . . . Felis then passed the insider information to Spratt. . . . We reversed Winans’ conspiracy conviction to the extent that it involved Spratt’s trades. . . . Because Winans’ original trading agreement with Felis and Brant was narrowly limited to specific persons not including Spratt, about whom Winans had no knowledge, we found that by passing the information to Spratt, Felis had “used the information obtained from Winans beyond the scope of the original agreement.” . . . 
</p><p id="76e93936-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Carpenter</i>, we left open three hypothetical avenues of liability against Winans. First, we emphasized that Winans “might have been liable for the Spratt trades had the scope of the trading agreement been broader, to include trading by or for persons other than the small group of conspirators herein.” . . . Second, we noted that Winans might have been liable for the Spratt trades had the trades been “part of the ramifications of the plan which could . . . be reasonably forseen [sic] as a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.” . . . Third, we suggested that Winans might have been liable had he “at least known of the Felis-Spratt relationship.” . . . Because none of these avenues of liability is applicable to this case, we find that McDermott is not liable for the trades made by Pomponio. [A]s a matter of law, no rational jury could find McDermott guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a single conspiracy with Pomponio to commit insider trading. The government has failed to show the most basic element of a single conspiracy, namely, an agreement to pass insider information to Gannon and possibly to another person, even if unknown. . . .

<i>1. Nonreciprocal conspiracy?</i> Could Pomponio be charged with conspiring with McDermott, even though McDermott could not be charged with conspiring with him? On the one hand, Pomponio knew that McDermott was the source of the tips. On the other hand, a conspiracy requires an <span title="793" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-793">p. 793</span>agreement, and McDermott certainly never <i>agreed</i> to tip Pomponio. Without much discussion, Judge Oakes resolved Pomponio’s appeal on the conspiracy issue in the same way he had resolved McDermott’s, noting only that “the government failed to prove a single conspiracy amongst all three co-defendants.” United States v. McDermott, 277 F.3d 240, 242 (2d Cir. 2002). Compare the doctrine of “unilateral” conspiracy, pp. 800-803 infra.</p>
<p id="76e9393a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Insider trading and drug conspiracies compared.</i> The hypothetical avenues of liability generated by the Second Circuit in its insider trading cases seem very broad. This doctrine would hold a tipster liable whenever it is reasonably foreseeable that the information would be passed along. Should these broad avenues of liability be applicable in other chain conspiracies? For example, in a drug distribution case, should a drug supplier be guilty of conspiring with a remote purchaser whenever that purchase could be “reasonably foreseen” as the natural consequence of selling to a middleman? Or do the differences between the two contexts call for different liability requirements? Note that an insider trading defendant is unlikely to want the information passed along to others, because further use of the information makes it more likely that he will get caught. Thus, when the tipster knows of the likelihood of further use, one can infer that the agreed relationship has a broader scope than the ordinary tipster-tipee transaction. In contrast, drug suppliers always expect a buyer of large quantities to resell to others, and these further sales are always, directly or indirectly, in the original supplier’s interest. Should every drug supplier therefore be considered a party to an “agreement” with all remote purchasers?</p>

In United States v. Braverman, 317 U.S. 49 (1942), the positions were reversed: The Government indicted a group of defendants on seven counts, each charging a conspiracy to violate a separate provision of the internal revenue laws. The applicable statute carried a maximum penalty of two years on each count. Defendants were convicted on all seven counts and each defendant was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. The Supreme Court reversed:</p>

He was convicted on two counts, one charging conspiracy to import and the other conspiracy to distribute. Accepting the premise that there was only a single agreement, the Court nonetheless upheld the two convictions, emphasizing that, unlike cases involving only the general conspiracy statute, here separate statutes proscribed conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute. The Court held that by enacting two statutes, each with its own penalties, Congress had manifested its intention to authorize separate convictions and punishments. The Court distinguished <i>Braverman</i> on the ground that “the conspiratorial agreement in <i>Braverman</i>, although it had many objectives, violated but a single statute.” Id. at 339.</p>

 . . . Subsections (1) and (2) limit the scope of his conspiracy both in terms of its criminal objectives, to those crimes that he had the purpose of promoting or facilitating, and in terms of parties, to those with whom he agreed, except when the same crime that he conspired to commit is, to his knowledge, also the object of a conspiracy between one of his co-conspirators and another person or persons. Subsection (3) provides that his conspiracy is a single one despite a multiplicity of criminal objectives, as long as such crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship. . . .

<p id="76e96057-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Model Code provision would require a different approach to a case such as <i>Bruno</i> and might produce different results. Since the overall operation involved the separate crimes of importing by the smugglers and possession and sale by each group [smugglers, distributors, and retailers], the question as to each defendant would be whether and with whom he conspired to commit <i>each</i> of these crimes, under the criteria set forth in Subsections (1) and (2). The conspiratorial objective for the purpose of this inquiry could not be characterized in the manner of the <i>Bruno</i> court, as “to smuggle narcotics into the Port of New York and distribute them to addicts both in [New York] and in Texas and Louisiana.” This is indeed the overall objective of the entire operation. It also may be true that <i>some</i> of the participants conspired to commit all of the crimes involved in the operation; under Subsection (3), as under <span title="795" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-795">p. 795</span>prevailing law, they would be guilty of only one conspiracy if all these crimes were the object of the same agreement or continuing conspiratorial relationship, and the objective of <i>that</i> conspiracy or relationship could fairly be phrased in terms of the overall operation. But this multiplicity of criminal objectives affords a poor referent for testing the culpability of each individual who is in any manner involved in the operation.</p>
<p id="76e96058-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With the conspiratorial objectives characterized as the particular crimes and the culpability of each participant tested separately, it would be possible to find . . . that the smugglers conspired to commit the illegal sales of the retailers, but that the retailers did not conspire to commit the importing of the smugglers. Factual situations warranting such a finding may easily be conceived. For example, the smugglers might depend upon and seek to foster their retail markets, while the retailers might have many suppliers and be indifferent to the success of any single source. The court’s approach in <i>Bruno</i> does not admit of such a finding, for treating the conspiratorial objective as the entire series of crimes involved in smuggling, distributing, and retailing requires a finding either of no conspiracy or of a single conspiracy in which all three links in the chain conspired to commit all of each other’s crimes.</p>
<p id="76e96059-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It also would be possible to find, with the inquiry focused on each individual’s culpability as to each criminal objective, that some of the parties in a chain conspired to commit the entire series of crimes while others conspired to commit only some of these crimes. Thus the smugglers and the middlemen in <i>Bruno</i> may have conspired to commit, promote, or facilitate the importing and the possession and sales of all of the parties down to the final retail sale; the retailers might have conspired with them as to their own possession and sales, but might be indifferent to all the steps prior to their receipt of the narcotics. In this situation, a smuggler or a middleman might have conspired with all three groups to commit the entire series of crimes, while a retailer might have conspired with the same parties but to achieve fewer criminal objectives. Such results are conceptually difficult to reach under existing doctrine not only because of the frequent failure to focus separately on the different criminal objectives, but also because of the traditional view of the agreement as a bilateral relationship between each of the parties, congruent in scope both as to its party and its objective dimensions.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">JUSTICE STONE</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p><p id="76e98774-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This case is here on certiorari to review a judgment of conviction for conspiracy to violate the Mann Act. [At the time this case was decided, the Mann Act read as follows: “Whoever knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any woman or girl to go from one place to another in interstate or foreign commerce . . . for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose . . . whether with or without her consent, and thereby knowingly causes such woman or girl to go and to be carried or transported as a passenger . . . in interstate or foreign commerce . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”] Petitioners, a man and a woman, not then husband and wife, were indicted in the District Court for Northern Illinois, for conspiring together, and with others not named, to transport the woman from one state to another for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse with the man. At the trial without a jury there was evidence from which the court could have found that the petitioners had engaged in illicit sexual relations in the course of each of the journeys alleged; that the man purchased the railway tickets for both petitioners for at least one journey, and that in each instance the woman, in advance of the purchase of the tickets, consented to go on the journey and did go on it voluntarily for the specified immoral purpose. There was no evidence supporting the allegation that any other person had conspired. The trial court . . . gave judgment of conviction, which the Court of Appeals . . . affirmed.</p><p id="76e98775-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress set out in the Mann Act to deal with cases which frequently, if not normally, involve consent and agreement on the part of the woman to the forbidden transportation. In every case in which she is not intimidated or forced into the transportation, the statute necessarily contemplates her acquiescence. Yet this acquiescence, though an incident of a type of transportation specifically dealt with by the statute, was not made a crime under the Mann Act itself. Of this class of cases we say that the substantive offense contemplated by the statute itself involves the same combination or community of purpose of two persons only which is prosecuted here as conspiracy. If this were the only case covered by the Act, it would be within those decisions which hold, consistently with the theory upon which conspiracies are punished, that where it is impossible under any circumstances to commit the substantive offense without cooperative action, the preliminary agreement between the same parties to commit the offense is not an indictable conspiracy either at common law or under the federal statute. . . . But criminal transportation under the Mann Act may be effected without the woman’s consent as in cases of intimidation or force (with which we are not now concerned). We assume, therefore, . . . that the decisions last mentioned do not in all strictness apply. We do not rest our decision upon the theory of those cases. . . . We place it rather upon the ground that we perceive in the failure of <span title="797" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-797">p. 797</span>the Mann Act to condemn the woman’s participation in those transportations which are effected with her mere consent, evidence of an affirmative legislative policy to leave her acquiescence unpunished. . . . It would contravene that policy to hold that the very passage of the Mann Act effected a withdrawal by the conspiracy statute of that immunity which the Mann Act itself confers.</p><p id="76e98776-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not to be supposed that the consent of an unmarried person to adultery with a married person, where the latter alone is guilty of the substantive offense, would render the former an abettor or a conspirator, or that the acquiescence of a woman under the age of consent would make her a co-conspirator with the man to commit statutory rape upon herself. The principle, determinative of this case, is the same.</p><p id="76e98777-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the evidence before us the woman petitioner has not violated the Mann Act and, we hold, is not guilty of a conspiracy to do so. . . .

<i>1. The</i> Gebardi <i>rule.</i> The general principle reflected in <i>Gebardi</i> is widely accepted. See Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part 673 (2d ed. 1961): “One may submit with some confidence that a person cannot be convicted of conspiracy when there is a recognized rule of justice or policy exempting him from prosecution from the substantive crime.” For a statutory statement of a similar principle, see Model Penal Code §5.04(2), Appendix. The Supreme Court relied on <i>Gebardi</i>’s analysis in rejecting the government’s claim that a defendant who uses a cell phone to buy drugs can be guilty of “facilitating” drug distribution. The Court noted that “where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the calibration of punishment set by the legislature.” Abuelhawa v. United States, 556 U.S. 816, 820 (2009).</p>

<i>2. The acquitted co-conspirator.</i> A related question is what to do when all the co-conspirators but one are acquitted. The general trend is to reject a rule of consistency and allow a co-conspirator to be convicted even if all others have been acquitted. Commonwealth v. Campbell, 539 Pa. 212, 217-221 (1994).</p>

<i>3. Wharton’s rule.</i> Justice Stone notes that the <i>Gebardi</i> case was not governed by the line of precedent holding that “where it is impossible under any circumstances to commit the substantive offense without cooperative action, the preliminary agreement between the same parties to commit the offense is not an indictable conspiracy.” That line of precedent exemplifies what has become known as “Wharton’s rule.” It was explained as follows (2 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §1604 at 1862 (12th ed. 1932)):</p>

<p id="76e9ae90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The classic Wharton’s rule cases involve crimes such as dueling, bigamy, adultery, and incest, but it has also been said to apply to gambling, the giving and receiving of bribes, and the buying and selling of contraband goods. The rule has been unevenly applied and has been subject to a number of exceptions and limitations.</p>
<p id="76e9ae91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It seems clear that Wharton’s rule . . . completely overlooks the functions of conspiracy as an inchoate crime. That an offense inevitably requires concert is no reason to immunize criminal preparation to commit it. Further, the rule operates to immunize from a conspiracy prosecution <i>both</i> parties to <i>any</i> offense that inevitably requires concert, thus disregarding the legislative judgment that at least one should be punishable and taking no account of the varying policies that ought to determine whether the other should be. The rule is supportable only insofar as it avoids cumulative punishment for conspiracy and the completed substantive crime, for it is clear that the legislature would have taken the factor of concert into account in grading a crime that inevitably requires concert. This consideration is of course irrelevant under the Model Code, which precludes cumulative punishment in any case for a conspiracy with a single criminal objective and the completed substantive crime.</p>

<p id="76e9ae92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the MPC Commentary describes bribery as an instance where Wharton’s rule may apply, many courts have disagreed.

How much should the answer depend on whether a jurisdiction adopts a rule like the MPC’s, which precludes cumulative punishment?</p>

The Sixth Circuit concluded that the sale alone is insufficient to establish a conspiracy because conspiracy requires “not just the presence of any agreement, but an agreement with the same joint criminal objective—here the joint objective of distributing drugs.” United States v. Delgado, 631 F.3d 685, 695 (5th Cir. 2011). According to the court, the seller’s objective was distribution, whereas the buyer’s was possession. The dissenting opinion disagreed on the facts of the case because the drugs involved were of such a large quantity that the jury could infer the buyer was also involved in distribution.

<i>4. Problems.</i> <b>
<i>(a)</i>
</b> 21 U.S.C. §861 makes it a crime “for any person at least 18 years of age to knowingly and intentionally [employ] a person under 18 <span title="799" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-799">p. 799</span>years of age” to sell or distribute drugs. Palmer and Harris organized a group of juveniles to sell cocaine. They both knew that the youngsters working for them were under 18. The prosecution proved that Palmer was over 18, and he was therefore liable under §861. But because the prosecution did not prove Harris’s age, Harris could not be convicted of violating §861 personally. Can Harris be convicted of conspiring with Palmer to violate §861? Cf. United States v. Harris, 959 F.2d 246, 262-264 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>

<i>(b)</i> The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) makes it a crime for any U.S. citizen to bribe a foreign government official, but it does not make it an offense for such an official to accept the bribe. Can Canadian officials who took bribes from U.S. citizens be convicted of conspiracy to violate the FCPA? See United States v. Castle, 925 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>

<i>(c)</i> Arizona criminalizes human smuggling, which it defines as “the transportation [of] persons [who] are not United States citizens [or] permanent resident aliens.” Ariz. Rev. Code §13-2319(F)(3). Should Wharton’s rule bar a prosecution against the person being smuggled for conspiracy to commit human smuggling? See State v. Barragan-Sierra, 196 P.3d 879 (Ariz. Ct.

<i>(d)</i> Ocasio, a Baltimore police officer, participated in a scheme with owners of an auto repair shop, whereby the owners of the shop would give the officer kickbacks for referring stranded motorists to their shop. The officer and owners of the shop were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion under the Hobbs Act, which defines extortion as “the obtaining of property of another, with his consent, under color of official right.” 18 U.S.C. §1951. In a prior decision, Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255 (1992), the Supreme Court interpreted extortion under the Hobbs Act to include bribery. Ocasio argued for a jury instruction stating that the government had to prove that the conspiracy was to obtain money or property from some person who was not a member of the conspiracy. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ocasio v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1423 (2016). In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas argued that “it is illogical and wrong to say that two people conspired to extort one of themselves.” Id. at 1438. He further noted that the majority’s reading would allow the government to “prosecute bribe-payors with sweeping conspiracy charges,” making it “easier to induce those payors to plead out and testify against state and local officials.” Id. at 1439. Justice Sotomayor (joined by Chief Justice Roberts) believed the majority’s opinion was inconsistent with the statute’s requirement that the property be “from another.” Her dissent argued “that ‘from another’ is best understood as relating the conspiratorial enterprise to another person outside the conspiracy. A conspiracy to obtain property ‘from another,’ then, is the group agreement that at least one member of the group will obtain property from someone who is not a part of their endeavor.” Id. at 1442. Putting aside the question of which interpretation of the statute is more persuasive, which approach makes more sense as a matter of policy? Justice Thomas thought the majority’s view would give <span title="800" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-800">p. 800</span>the federal government too much control over state officials and that local corruption should be a matter for state control.

<span class="epub-small-caps">PRENTICE</span>, J. Defendant was convicted in a trial by jury of conspiracy to commit murder. . . . On appeal she raises the . . . issue . . . whether the defendant can be convicted of conspiracy when the only person with whom the defendant conspired was a police informant who only feigned his acquiescence in the scheme. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e9d5ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The evidence introduced at trial consisted of the following: On September 30, 1977, State’s witness, Allen Young, was first contacted by the defendant with regard to certain marital problems that she was having. She stated that her husband constantly beat her and her children and . . . that she wanted her husband killed. [After several subsequent conversations with defendant,] Young went to the [police] and discussed the matter with two detectives. He offered to call the defendant and let them listen and record the conversation, which they did. During the conversation, Young again asked the defendant if she wanted him to help her find someone to kill her husband, and she responded affirmatively. Young replied that he would try to find someone. Several more conversations took place. . . . At their final meeting, Young, accompanied by a plain-clothed detective, introduced the defendant to the detective, stating that here was a man who might be willing to do the job. The defendant then produced $200, a picture of her husband, and a record of his daily habits and gave them to the detective. She agreed to pay the balance of the contract price when the “job” was completed. Defendant was subsequently arrested. At trial, Young testified that he only feigned his acquiescence in the plan and at no time did he intend to actually carry it out.</p>
<p id="76e9d5ae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The issue is whether the conspiracy section of our new penal code adopts the Model Penal Code’s “unilateral” concept or whether it retains the traditional “bilateral” concept.</p>
<p id="76e9d5af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The bilateral concept is the traditional view of conspiracy as derived from common law. It is formulated in terms of two or more persons agreeing to commit a crime, each with intent to do so. In cases where the person or persons with whom the defendant conspired only feigned his acquiescence in the plan, the courts have generally held that neither person could be convicted of conspiracy because there was no “conspiratorial agreement.” . . .

<p id="76e9d5b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reacting to criticism of this viewpoint, the drafters of the Model Penal Code, though not without internal disagreement, adopted a “unilateral” <span title="801" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-801">p. 801</span>concept, as follows: [The court then quoted Model Penal Code §§5.03(1) and 5.04(1).

 . . . The definition of the Draft departs from the traditional view of conspiracy as an entirely bilateral or multilateral relationship. . . . Attention is directed instead to each individual’s culpability by framing the definition in terms of the conduct which suffices to establish the liability of any given actor, rather than the conduct of a group of which he is charged to be a part—an approach which in this comment we have designated “unilateral.”</p>
<p id="76e9d5b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One consequence of this approach is to make it immaterial to the guilt of a conspirator whose culpability has been established that the person or all of the persons with whom he conspired have not been or cannot be convicted. . . . Under the unilateral approach of the Draft, the culpable party’s guilt would not be affected by the fact that the other party’s agreement was feigned. . . . True enough, the project’s chances of success have not been increased by the agreement; indeed, its doom may have been sealed by this turn of events. But the major basis of conspiratorial liability—the unequivocal evidence of a firm purpose to commit a crime—remains the same. . . .

 . . . [I]t is clear upon the face of the act that defenses available under the multilateral concept were to be eliminated. The inclusion of the “catch-all” sub-proviso (5) can leave no doubt. Clearly “any reason,” as recited therein, includes the absence of criminal culpability on the part of a co-conspirator—including a sole co-conspirator. The words “agrees” and “agreement” have not been used as words of art denoting a “meeting of the minds” and “contract.” Rather, the former is descriptive of the defendant’s state of mind at the time he communicated with another in furtherance of the felony; and the latter refers to the defendant’s understanding.</p>
<p id="76e9fccf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant has cited us . . . numerous cases supporting the bilateral concept requiring “concurrence of sentiment and cooperative conduct in the <span title="802" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-802">p. 802</span>unlawful and criminal enterprise”; however, those cases were not decided under statutes remotely similar to our own. . . . Her argument that, by definition, an agreement requires the concurrence of sentiment of at least two individuals . . . is not persuasive in the light of the express wording of the entire enactment. . . .

<i>1. The traditional offense of conspiracy.</i> In jurisdictions that have not reformulated their definition of conspiracy, the requirement of bilateral agreement remains, and conspiracy charges will not lie when the defendant’s only collaborators are undercover informants or other feigned participants. See, e.g., United States v. Delgado, 631 F.3d 685 (5th Cir. 2011); Longley v. State, 32 So. 3d 736 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010).</p>
<p id="76e9fcd4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Modern conspiracy statutes.</i> In jurisdictions that have adopted definitions of conspiracy similar to that proposed by the MPC, many courts have held, in accord with <i>Garcia</i>, that a defendant can be guilty of conspiracy if he agrees to commit a crime with a feigned accomplice or with a person who otherwise lacks the requisite intent for conspiracy. E.g., State v. Roldan, 714 A.2d 351, 355 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1998); Suding v. State, 945 N.E.2d 731 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011). But in Connecticut and Illinois, two states with conspiracy statutes patterned on the MPC, courts have held that the requirement of bilateral agreement survives. See State v. Grullon, 562 A.2d 481 (Conn. 1989); People v. Foster, 457 N.E.2d 405, 407 (Ill. 1983). The Illinois statute states that a “person commits the offense of conspiracy when, with intent that an offense be committed, he or she agrees with another to the commission of that offense.” Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 720, 5/8-2(a) (2016). In <i>Foster</i>, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the required “agree[ment]” could not exist unless at least two parties genuinely intended to carry out the plan. Rejecting the reasoning of the <i>Garcia</i> case, the court said (457 N.E.2d at 407): “We doubt . . . that the drafters could have intended what represents a rather profound change in the law of conspiracy without mentioning it. . . . ” The court noted, however, that the Illinois solicitation statute would (like the corresponding MPC provision) “embrace virtually every situation in which one could be convicted of conspiracy under the unilateral theory.” Id. at 408.</p>

<i>3. Rationale for the traditional approach.</i> The case in favor of the traditional view is stated as follows in United States v. Escobar De Bright, 742 F.2d 1196, 1198-1200 (9th Cir. 1984):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e9fcd6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Criminal conspiracy is an offense separate from the actual criminal act because of the perception “that collective action toward an antisocial end involves a greater risk to society than individual action toward the same end.” In part, this view is based on the perception that group activity increases the likelihood of success of the criminal act and of future criminal activity by members of the group, and is difficult for law enforcement officers to detect. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76e9fcd7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="803" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-803">p. 803</span>Such dangers, however, are non-existent when a person “conspires” only with a government agent. There is no continuing criminal enterprise and ordinarily no inculcation of criminal knowledge and practices. Preventive intervention by law enforcement officers also is not a significant problem in such circumstances. The agent, as part of the “conspiracy,” is quite capable of monitoring the situation in order to prevent the completion of the contemplated criminal plan; in short, no cloak of secrecy surrounds any agreement to commit the criminal acts.</p>
<p id="76e9fcd8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the [traditional] rule responds to the same concern that underlies the entrapment defense: the legitimate law enforcement function of crime prevention “does not include the manufacturing of crime.” Allowing a government agent to form a conspiracy with only one other party would create the potential for law enforcement officers to “manufacture” conspiracies when none would exist absent the government’s presence.</p>

<i>4. Attempted conspiracy?</i> In states that adhere to the bilateral approach, can a defendant who “agrees” to commit a crime with an undercover agent be convicted of <i>attempting</i> to conspire? In State v. Kihnel, 488 So. 2d 1238, 1241 (La. Ct. App. 1986), the court held in the negative:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76e9fcda-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Attempt and conspiracy are both inchoate crimes. Just as there can be no attempt to commit an attempt, such as “attempted assault” . . . we conclude that under the bilateral formulation of conspiracy there can be no “attempted conspiracy.”</p>
<p id="76e9fcdb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As part of the very foundation of criminal law, crimes include both a criminal act (or omission) and a criminal intent. “Attempted conspiracy” suggests a crime formed only of criminal intent, as it is the agreement which constitutes the act. We are not prepared to judicially legislate such a crime.</p>

State, 53 Ga. 205, 206 (1874), where the court rejected liability for attempted assault as “absurd.” But some courts and commentators have found nothing wrong with liability for attempted assault, even though assault (like conspiracy) is an inchoate offense in the nature of an attempt. One scholar noted that “[a]lthough no jurisdiction recognizes the crime of attempted simple assault, an increasing number of state courts have convicted defendants of attempted aggravated assaults.” Robbins, supra, at 39. Are there good reasons to permit attempt liability in such cases? Should courts also permit liability for an attempt to conspire, if the crime intended is a serious one? Note that, while it is uncommon, some jurisdictions accept the crime of attempted conspiracy. See, e.g., People v. Hackett, 939 N.Y.S.2d 886 (2012).</p>

It should be abolished, not reformed.</p><p id="76e9fce4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The central fault of conspiracy law and the reason why any limited reform is bound to be inadequate can be briefly stated. What conspiracy adds to the law is simply confusion, and the confusion is inherent in the nature of the doctrine. The confusion stems from the fact that conspiracy is not only a substantive inchoate crime in itself, but the touchstone for invoking several independent procedural and substantive doctrines. We ask whether a defendant agreed with another person to commit a crime initially for the purpose of determining whether he may be convicted of the offense of conspiracy even when the crime itself has not yet been committed. If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, however, we find that we have also answered a number of other questions that would otherwise have to be considered independently. Where there is evidence of conspiracy, the defendant may be tried jointly with his criminal partners and possibly with many other persons whom he has never met or seen, the joint trial may be held in a place he may never have visited, and hearsay statements of other alleged members of the conspiracy may be used to prove his guilt. Furthermore, a defendant who is found guilty of conspiracy is subject to enhanced punishment and may also be found guilty of any crime committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, whether or not he knew about the crime or aided in its commission.</p><p id="76ea23f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Each of these issues involves a separate substantive or procedural area of the criminal law of considerable importance and complexity. The essential vice of conspiracy is that it inevitably distracts the courts from the policy questions or balancing of interests that ought to govern the decision of specific legal issues and leads them instead to decide those issues by reference to the conceptual framework of conspiracy. Instead of asking whether public policy or the interests of the parties require a particular holding, the courts are led instead to consider whether the theory of conspiracy is broad enough to permit it. What is wrong with conspiracy, in other words, is much more basic than the overbreadth of a few rules. The problem is not with particular results, but with the use of a single abstract concept to decide numerous questions that deserve separate consideration in light of the various interests and policies they involve.</p></div>

Federal law itself has come to recognize [the advantages of this dual approach], although scholars have not, and this can explain the function of doctrines such as Pinkerton liability and the exclusion from merger [resulting in the separate punishment for conspiracy and the object offense]. These doctrines not only further information extraction, they also make conspiracies more difficult to create and maintain by forcing them to adopt inefficient practices. The possibility of defection forces the syndicate to use expensive monitoring of its employees for evidence of possible collusion with the government. Mechanisms for defection also erode trust within the group and lead members to think that others are acting out of self-interest.

<p id="76ea2400-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In response to a growing concern over organized crime in America and the perception that traditional conspiracy law provided inadequate tools for combating sophisticated criminal enterprises, Congress in 1970 passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, popularly known as RICO. But RICO’s substantive reach goes well beyond the initial target of organized crime. RICO is now used to prosecute everything from business fraud to street gangs. Indeed, an analysis of RICO decisions from 2005 to 2011 found that criminal RICO cases were mostly based on gang and drug activity (61% of cases), and a much smaller proportion involved organized crime (11% of cases). (Fraud (12% of cases) and public corruption (11% of cases) accounted for most of the rest.) Pamela Bucy Pierson, Rico Trends: From Gangsters to Class Actions, 65 S.C. L. Rev. 213, 221 (2013). The growing body of RICO law and its importance in modern law enforcement have made RICO a distinctive branch of conspiracy law that is worth careful study in its own right.</p>
<p id="76ea2401-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The RICO statute has become one of the most controversial provisions in the federal criminal code. RICO bases criminal liability on new, potentially elastic concepts such as “enterprise.” The penalties imposed for a violation of RICO can be far higher than those that would apply when the underlying criminal acts are not part of a “pattern” of “racketeering activity,” and the <span title="806" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-806">p. 806</span>statute provides powerful prosecutorial tools to compel forfeiture of assets derived from racketeering. In addition, RICO permits individuals harmed by racketeering to bring civil suits, and it awards treble damages for injuries resulting from RICO violations. By including a provision for treble damage lawsuits, the statute creates a fertile field for civil litigation. In addition, Congress instructed the courts to give RICO a broad reading: “The provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.” Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-452, §904(a), 84 Stat. 922, 947. And the courts have followed that command. See Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009).</p>
<p id="76ea2402-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In examining the RICO statute, reprinted below, consider to what extent its provisions reach activities that could not be punished under traditional conspiracy doctrines, and to what extent its provisions change the treatment of activities that remain punishable under the traditional doctrines. Do the changes wrought by RICO raise problems of disproportionality by imposing overly severe sanctions on conduct that ordinarily is subject to much lower penalties? In the same vein, to what extent does RICO apply to small-scale criminal conspiracies that lack the special dangers of “organized crime”? Finally, note the broad list of criminal conduct that qualifies as “racketeering activity” within the meaning of RICO (and how it covers a host of traditional state crimes), as well as the tendency for that list to expand over time. Crimes that have been added to the definition of “racketeering activity” since 1988, as well as the date that each crime was added, are shown in italics in §1961(1)(B) below. In many cases, RICO provides a way for federal prosecutors to seek longer federal sentences for crimes already recognized by states but subject to lesser penalties. This raises the question whether RICO legitimately targets crimes where the federal government can play a unique role because of the interstate nature of the activity or the complexity of the investigations, or whether RICO federalizes too much local criminal activity in the name of longer sentences.</p>

<i>1. The criminal enterprise.</i> The principal type of criminal organization legislators had in mind in drafting RICO was the Mafia. Thus, Congress passed RICO thinking about the bread-and-butter mob activities of “infiltrating unions and their pension funds, investing in and skimming profits from casinos, muscling in on trash collection companies, and actually committing crimes like distributing drugs or running prostitution rings.” Randy D. Gordon, Clarity and Confusion: RICO’s Recent Trips to the United States Supreme Court, 85 Tul. L. Rev. 677 (2011). The term “enterprise” in RICO reflects this image and includes both legal organizations like corrupted unions and illegal “associat[ions] in fact” like the Mafia. Because much of RICO’s original focus was on preventing organized crime from infiltrating and capturing control of legitimate businesses, some courts held that the “enterprise” must be an organization engaged in some legal activities. These courts reasoned that an ordinary criminal conspiracy, in which individuals associate for the sole and specific purpose of committing criminal acts, could not by itself constitute the kind of “enterprise” with which RICO was concerned. But in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), the Supreme Court held that an “enterprise” for RICO purposes can include an exclusively criminal organization.</p>
<p id="76ea7139-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants in the Problem are undoubtedly a “group of individuals,” but are they “associated in fact” based on a shared intention to make money through illegal activities? In an early RICO case with similar facts, United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978), the court concluded that defendants like <i>A</i> through <i>E</i> were in a single “enterprise”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ea713a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This enterprise can best be analogized to a large business conglomerate. Metaphorically speaking, [<i>A</i>] was the chairman of the board, . . . overseeing the operations of many separate branches of the corporation. An executive committee in charge of the “Counterfeit Title, Stolen Car, and Amphetamine Sales Department” was comprised of [<i>A, D</i>, and <i>E</i>], who supervised the operations of lower employees. . . . Another executive committee, comprised of [<i>A, B</i>, and <i>C</i>], controlled the “Thefts From Interstate Commerce Department,” arranging the purchase, concealment and distribution of [various stolen goods]. An offshoot of this department handled subsidiary activities, such as murder and obstruction of justice, intended to facilitate the smooth operation of its primary activities. . . . The thread tying all of these departments, activities, and individuals together was the desire to make money.

<i>Questions:</i> Did the “business conglomerate” described by the court involve any specific organizational arrangements, or was it simply inferred from the defendants’ general intention to make money? If the latter, should a more specific enterprise structure be required? If a common purpose to make money is enough, couldn’t such an intention be considered sufficient to create a “rim” and thus a single conspiracy under pre-RICO law as well?</p>

<i>2. Distinguishing the enterprise requirement from the pattern requirement.</i> In response to the argument that the holding in <i>Turkette</i> would make the required “enterprise” synonymous with the required “pattern of racketeering activity,” the Supreme Court said (452 U.S. at 583):</p>

The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise. While the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not necessarily establish the other. The “enterprise” is not the “pattern of racketeering activity”; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.

<i>3. The requisite structure.</i> <i>Turkette</i> left unresolved the question of whether the association-in-fact enterprise (as opposed to formal business organizations like partnerships or corporations) must have “continuity of both structure and personality” and “an ‘ascertainable structure’ distinct from that inherent in the conduct of a pattern of racketeering activity.” In <i>Boyle v. United States</i>, the Supreme Court held that an association-in-fact enterprise must have a “structure,” but the Court required very little to establish it. It held that “an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise’s purpose.” 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009). The Court made clear that an association-in-fact enterprise need not have a hierarchical structure, fixed roles for members, sophisticated organization, or “a name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies.” Id. at 948. The ascertainable structure is established as long as the group “function[s] as a continuing unit and remain[s] in existence long enough to pursue a course of conduct.” Id. “[P]eriods of quiescence” do not negate a finding of an enterprise. “Nor is the statute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated, diverse, complex, or unique.” Id.

<i>1. Identifying a pattern.</i> Should an ongoing desire to make money create a “pattern” out of discrete criminal acts? The <i>Elliott</i> court found that the racketeering crimes of defendants like <i>A</i> through <i>E</i> constituted a “pattern” (571 F.2d at 899):</p>

<i>2. Continuity and relationship.</i> In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), phone company customers sued for treble damages, alleging that Northwestern and several of its employees had violated RICO by bribing members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) to approve excessive rates. The court of appeals upheld the dismissal of the case, on the ground that the acts of alleged bribery did not constitute a “pattern” because they were all part of a “single scheme” to influence the MPUC. The Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that a RICO “pattern” must involve something more than just two predicate acts, but that a pattern need not involve separate illegal schemes and need not involve conduct indicative of organized crime activity in the traditional sense. Drawing on RICO’s legislative history, the Court interpreted the “pattern” element to <span title="812" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-812">p. 812</span>require proof “that the racketeering predicates are related, <i>and</i> that they . . .  pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” 492 U.S. at 239 (“It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.”). The Court also held that Congress intended courts to define “relatedness” by referring to 18 U.S.C. §3575(e), which specifies that criminal conduct is related “if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.” Id. at 240.</p>

<p id="76ea9856-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Elevating to the level of statutory text a phrase taken from the legislative history, the Court counsels the lower courts: “continuity plus relationship.” This seems to me about as helpful to the conduct of their affairs as “life is a fountain.” . . . It hardly closes in on the target to know that “relatedness” refers to acts that are related by “purposes, results, participants, victims, . . .  methods of commission, <i>or</i> [just in case that is not vague enough] <i>otherwise.</i>” Is the fact that the victims of both predicate acts were women enough? Or that both acts had the purpose of enriching the defendant? Or that the different coparticipants of the defendant in both acts were his co-employees? I doubt that the lower courts will find the Court’s instructions much more helpful than telling them to look for a “pattern”—which is what the statute already says.</p>
<p id="76ea9857-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court finds “continuity” more difficult to define precisely. “Continuity,” it says, “is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.” I have no idea what this concept of a “closed period of repeated conduct” means. Virtually all allegations of racketeering activity, in both civil and criminal suits, will relate to past periods that are “closed” (unless one expects plaintiff or the prosecutor to establish that the defendant not only committed the crimes he did, but is still committing them), and all of them <i>must</i> relate to conduct that is “repeated,” because of RICO’s multiple-act requirement. . . .

As I have suggested, it is also beyond the Court. Today’s opinion has added nothing to improve our prior guidance, which has created a kaleidoscope of circuit positions, except to clarify that RICO may in addition be violated when there is a “threat of continuity.” It seems to me this increases rather than removes the vagueness. . . .

<i>2. The operation or management test.</i> Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993), involved a civil suit growing out of the insolvency of an Arkansas farmers’ cooperative. In auditing the co-op’s books, the Arthur Young accounting firm (which later merged into Ernst &amp; Young) permitted one of the co-op’s major assets to be carried at its original cost of $4.5 million rather than its market value of $1.5 million, and failed to disclose the problematic nature of the $4.5 million valuation. When the co-op became insolvent in 1984, the trustee in bankruptcy sued Arthur Young and several individual accountants, alleging that the co-op’s noteholders had been defrauded by misrepresentations that violated various securities laws and RICO. The Supreme Court held that Arthur Young and its accountants had not violated §1962(c) because, in order to “conduct or participate directly or indirectly in the conduct of [an] enterprise’s affairs,” an individual must have some role in directing or managing the enterprise’s affairs (which in this case was the co-op). Justice Blackmun wrote for the Court (507 U.S. at 179, 184):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ea985f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In order to “participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs,” one must have some part in directing those affairs. Of course, the word “participate” makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise’s affairs, just as the phrase “directly or indirectly” makes clear that RICO liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise, but <i>some</i> part in directing the enterprise’s affairs is required. The “operation or management” test expresses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to apply.</p>

 . . . We agree that liability under §1962(c) is not limited to upper management, but we disagree that the “operation or management” test is inconsistent with this proposition. An enterprise is “operated” not just by upper management but also by lower-rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.

<i>Question:</i> Does the “operation or management” test protect low-level employees and outside professionals from conviction of racketeering offenses under RICO? Consider Daniel R. Fischel &amp; Alan O. Sykes, Civil RICO After <i>Reves:</i> An Economic Commentary, 1993 Sup. Ct. Rev. 157, 190-194:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ea9862-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On first reading, the [<i>Reves</i>] opinion provides considerable comfort to professionals. . . . Only those who have “some part in directing the enterprise’s affairs” can be liable. . . . [But] there is sufficient contradictory language in <i>Reves</i> to make the issue murky at best. . . . The Court [stated] that: “An enterprise is ‘operated’ not just by upper management but also by lower-rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.” With this one sentence, the Court undercut much of its earlier emphasis on the importance of “directing” an enterprise’s affairs. Now the “direction” requirement includes both those who direct, as well as those who take direction. For a Court that prides itself on the importance of the plain language of [statutes], this contorted interpretation of the words “operated” and “direction” is, at the very least, paradoxical. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ea9863-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why was it “clear” that Arthur Young was not acting “under the direction” of the Co-op’s management? Presumably the Court was referring to the absence of any direct evidence [that] Co-op management instruct[ed] Arthur Young to use fraudulent numbers. For Arthur Young’s liability to turn on this point, however, is to exalt form over substance. The sale of the Co-op notes at inflated prices benefited the Co-op, not Arthur Young. Why else would Arthur Young knowingly participate and assist in the Co-op’s fraud except at the behest of management? And even if Arthur Young somehow decided to participate in the fraud independently as opposed to being directed to do so by management, why should this be exonerating? The more the fraud can be attributed to Arthur Young and management as opposed to just management, the stronger the case for imposing liability on both. . . .

<p id="76ea9865-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such an allegation might be sufficient if the plaintiff could demonstrate that the alleged association in fact was, as <i>Turkette</i> requires, “ongoing” and functioned “as a continuing unit.” . . . In future cases, courts’ attitude toward association in fact enterprises will be critical in light of the obvious incentives of plaintiffs to allege such associations in fact to satisfy <i>Reves</i>’s “operation or management” test.</p>

They challenged their conviction for racketeering under §1962(c) by arguing that the government failed to prove that they directed the affairs of the CSD or otherwise engaged in its operation or management. The Third Circuit rejected their challenge, stating that the participation requirement is satisfied where there is a “nexus between the person and the conduct in the affairs of an enterprise.” Id. at 770 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>

<i>1. Conspiracies to conspire?</i> Section 1962(c) can be viewed as a kind of conspiracy statute: By imposing criminal liability on those who “participate . . . in the conduct of [an] enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,” §1962(c) reaches what is inherently a type of group crime. But the RICO statute also includes a provision, §1962(d), that expressly punishes conspiracies. Specifically, §1962(d) covers conspiracies to violate §1962(a), (b), or (c). See p. 808 supra. As it relates to §1962(c), does §1962(d) in effect prohibit conspiring to engage in a conspiracy?</p>
<p id="76eabf7b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Comparing RICO conspiracy with ordinary conspiracy.</i> What are the effects of §1962(d), and how does it change the traditional law of conspiracy? One basic difference is that RICO conspiracies do not require proof of any overt act. Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 64 (1997). The <i>Elliott</i> case, see Problem, supra p. 808, shows a more profound distinction. The Fifth Circuit in that case found that the RICO statute transformed what would have been multiple conspiracies under traditional law into a single conspiracy under §1962(d), the conspiracy provision of the RICO statute. But how is such alchemy possible? If under pre-RICO law there would be insufficient proof to tie <i>A, B, C, D</i>, and <i>E</i> together in a single agreement, how does passage of the RICO statute create a single agreement between them? Conversely, if—as the <i>Elliott</i> court held—these conspirators agreed “to associate for the purpose of making money from repeated criminal activity,” then why would pre-RICO law pose any barrier to finding a single agreement? Consider Michael Goldsmith, RICO and Enterprise Criminality: A Response to Gerard E. Lynch, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 774, 798 (1988):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eabf7c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer [to this question] is that the enterprise itself is an important link in the evidentiary chain: a defendant’s knowledge of the enterprise’s existence is probative of a central purpose. Thus, upon proof that such an enterprise exists, the enterprise itself provides the basis for inferring one large conspiracy instead of many smaller ones. The objective of this conspiracy, which potentially encompasses many crimes, is to conduct enterprise affairs through a <span title="816" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-816">p. 816</span>pattern of racketeering activity. In contrast, because ordinary conspiracy cases do not involve proof of enterprise, this unifying function is absent.</p>
</div>
<p id="76eabf7d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Goldsmith’s defense of RICO’s expansive notion of what qualifies as a single conspiracy under §1962(d) rests on the notion that the “enterprise” is well defined. If Goldsmith is correct that the existence of the “enterprise” is critical to RICO conspiracies, should the Court demand more than it currently does of the government to prove there is an enterprise with an “ascertainable structure”? See supra pp. 810-811.</p>
<p id="76eabf7e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. RICO conspiracies and predicate offenses.</i> In <i>Salinas</i>, the Court also addressed whether a defendant must personally commit or agree to commit “the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under §1962(c)” in order to be guilty of conspiracy under §1962(d). 552 U.S. at 61. Salinas was convicted under §1962(d) for conspiring to accept bribes from a federal prisoner, even though the jury had acquitted him of the underlying substantive offense of violating §1962(c). The bribery scheme was run by the county sheriff; Salinas was the chief deputy responsible for managing the jail. The Court noted that conspiracy in “its conventional sense” may be charged “even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense.” Id. at 63. Applying this conventional understanding of conspiracy law, the Court explained (id. at 66):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eabf7f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the case before us, even if Salinas did not accept or agree to accept two bribes, there was ample evidence that he conspired to violate subsection (c). The evidence showed that [the county sheriff] committed at least two acts of racketeering activity when he accepted numerous bribes and that Salinas knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme. This is sufficient to support a conviction under §1962(d). . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76eabf80-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does <i>Salinas</i> create a way to avoid the “operation or management” requirement announced in <i>Reves</i>, supra pp. 813-814? Can a peripheral actor be convicted of a RICO conspiracy under §1962(d), even if he isn’t guilty of conducting or participating in conducting an enterprise within the meaning of <i>Reves</i>? Consider the following scenario: The Mexican Mafia (known as La Eme) was running a large-scale drug-smuggling ring in California prisons. The wife of an imprisoned Eme member smuggled drugs and money to him during her visits to him in prison. Though she had no role in organizing La Eme’s affairs, she did collect money on behalf of her husband from those outside of prison and passed messages to her husband and other Eme members. Could the wife be convicted of a substantive RICO offense under §1962(c)? Of a RICO conspiracy under §1962(d)? In United States v. Fernandez, 388 F.3d 1199, 1228 (9th Cir. 2004), the Ninth Circuit upheld the wife’s conviction under §1962(d) because she “knowingly agree[d] to facilitate a scheme which include[d] the operation or management of a RICO enterprise,” even if she did not operate or manage the enterprise herself. See also United States v. Wilson, 605 F.3d 985, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Following <i>Salinas</i>, every court of appeals to consider the question has held that the <i>Reves</i> operation or management test <span title="817" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-817">p. 817</span>does not apply to conspiracy under §1962(d). The Tenth Circuit has gone so far as to “hold that the existence of an enterprise is not an element of §1962(d) conspiracy to commit a substantive RICO violation.” United States v. Harris, 695 F.3d 1125, 1131 (10th Cir. 2012). For an argument that the <i>Reves</i> operation or management test should extend to §1962(d), thereby requiring proof that the defendant conspired “<i>to</i> operate or manage an enterprise” and not simply conspired “<i>with</i> someone who is operating or managing an enterprise,” see Sarah Baumgartel, The Crime of Associating with Criminals? An Argument for Extending the <i>Reves</i> “Operation or Management” Test to RICO Conspiracy, 97 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1, 24-31 (2006).</p>

<i>4. Scope of RICO conspiracies.</i> Some commentators have worried that RICO might create single conspiracies whenever multiple, unrelated crimes involve the same RICO “enterprise,” which might be an otherwise legitimate business or governmental entity. See, e.g., Barry Tarlow, RICO: The New Darling of the Prosecutor’s Nursery, 49 Fordham L. Rev. 165, 243, 251-252 (1980). Consider United States v. Sutherland, 656 F.2d 1181 (5th Cir. 1981). Sutherland was a traffic court judge who allegedly conspired with two others (Walker and Maynard) in a scheme to fix traffic tickets. The government conceded that neither Walker nor Maynard knew of the other’s activities; under pre-RICO law there would have been two separate conspiracies—spokes of a wheel without a “rim.” But the government claimed that the affairs of the traffic court constituted the RICO “enterprise” and that the three defendants could be charged with a single “enterprise conspiracy” under RICO. The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that some of its language in <i>Elliott</i> might appear to support this argument, but it went on to clarify its earlier holding (id. at 1192-1194):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eabf82-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Elliott</i> does indeed hold that on the facts of that case a series of agreements that under pre-RICO law would constitute multiple conspiracies could under RICO be tried as a single “enterprise” conspiracy. But the language of <i>Elliott</i> explains that what ties these conspiracies together is not the mere fact that they involve the same enterprise, but is instead—as in any other conspiracy—an “agreement on an overall objective.” What RICO does is to provide a new criminal objective by defining a new substantive crime. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eabf83-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In this case the government has not attempted to prove that Walker and Maynard agreed with each other to participate in a bribery scheme with Sutherland, nor has it contended that the nature of each defendant’s agreement with Sutherland was such that he or she must necessarily have known that others were also conspiring to commit racketeering offenses in the conduct of the Municipal Court. We must conclude, therefore, that the multiple conspiracy doctrine precluded the joint trial of the two multiple conspiracies involved in this case on a single RICO conspiracy count.</p>
</div>
<p id="76eabf84-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Other circuits, however, have been willing to find a single RICO conspiracy on similar facts. In United States v. Castro, 89 F.3d 1443 (11th Cir. 1996), another judicial bribery case, three lawyers were charged with paying kickbacks to judges in exchange for receiving appointments as public defenders in a Florida circuit court. Despite the absence of evidence that the lawyers <span title="818" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-818">p. 818</span>cooperated or benefited from appointments obtained by each other, the court held that the lawyers and judges were properly convicted of engaging in a single RICO conspiracy involving a single enterprise (the Circuit Court). Disagreeing on this point, Judge Barkett noted (id. at 1458-1459):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eabf85-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To prove the existence of a single overarching conspiracy, rather than multiple independent conspiracies, it is not enough that the defendants were simply participating in the conduct of the same enterprise or had knowledge of other criminal activity; the gravamen of a RICO conspiracy, like any other conspiracy, is that the defendant not only knows about the conspiracy, but also <i>agrees to participate</i> in it to accomplish an overall objective.</p>
<p id="76eabf86-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The evidence,] while possibly establishing knowledge [by some lawyers] of other criminal activity within the Circuit Court, [is] insufficient to establish . . . that [they] agreed to accomplish anything more than the receipt of court appointments for their own monetary gain. Nothing suggests . . . that they would be interested in or benefit from the similar activities of others.</p>

<i>Question:</i> Given the dangers posed by organized crime, should the existence of a criminal “enterprise” replace the traditional requirement of conspiracy doctrine that defendants agree to a mutually advantageous course of criminal conduct? Or does doing so risk disproportionate punishment and “guilt by association”?</p>

<p id="76eabf8a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The RICO statute has remained controversial. Some of the principal issues concern its potential for distorting civil litigation; also prominent in the debate are concerns about RICO’s provisions for pretrial seizure of a defendant’s assets, forfeiture of assets connected to the “enterprise,” and related procedural matters. These strands in the RICO debate cannot be pursued in depth here. But many of the most important themes in the debate raise problems of substantive criminal law—the breadth and potential vagueness of the RICO offense, the risk of guilt by association, and the possibility for criminal liability greatly disproportionate to personal fault. These issues are central to conspiracy law in general and to other topics that pervade the subject of criminal law. Compare the Fifth Circuit’s defense of RICO’s constitutionality in the next excerpt with the criticisms offered by Judges David Sentelle and Gerard Lynch in the excerpts that follow.</p>

 . . . The “enterprise conspiracy” is a legislative innovation in the realm of individual liability for group crime. We need to consider whether this innovation comports with the fundamental demand of due process that guilt remain “individual and personal.” <i>Kotteakos</i>, supra, 328 U.S. at 772. . . . 
</p><p id="76eae6a1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The substantive proscriptions of the RICO statute apply to insiders <i>and outsiders</i>—those merely “associated with” an enterprise—who participate directly <i>and indirectly</i> in the enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Thus, the RICO net is woven tightly to trap even the smallest fish, those peripherally involved with the enterprise. This effect is enhanced by principles of conspiracy law also developed to facilitate prosecution of conspirators at all levels. Direct evidence of agreement is unnecessary: “proof of such an agreement may rest upon inferences drawn from relevant and competent circumstantial evidence—ordinarily the acts and conduct of the alleged conspirators themselves.” United States v. Morado, 454 F.2d at 174. . . . 
</p><p id="76eae6a2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Undeniably, then, under the RICO conspiracy provision, remote associates of an enterprise may be convicted as conspirators on the basis of purely circumstantial evidence. We cannot say, however, that this section of the statute . . . offends the rule that guilt be individual and personal. The Act does not authorize that individuals “be tried en masse for the conglomeration of distinct and separate offenses committed by others.” <i>Kotteakos</i>, supra. Nor does it punish mere association with conspirators or knowledge of illegal activity; its proscriptions are directed against conduct, not status. . . . 
</p><p id="76eae6a3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our society disdains mass prosecutions because we abhor the totalitarian doctrine of mass guilt. We nevertheless punish conspiracy as a distinct offense because we recognize that collective action toward an illegal end involves a greater risk to society than individual action toward the same end. That risk is greatly compounded when the conspirators contemplate not a single crime but a career of crime. “There are times when of necessity, because of the nature and scope of the particular federation, large numbers of persons taking part must be tried together or perhaps not at all. . . . When many conspire, they invite mass trial by their conduct.” <i>Kotteakos</i>, supra, 328 U.S. at 773.</p><p id="76eae6a4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not lightly dismiss the fact that under this statute four defendants who did not commit murder have been forced to stand trial jointly with, and as confederates of, two others who did. Prejudice inheres in such a trial. . . . But the Constitution does not guarantee a trial free from the prejudice that inevitably accompanies any charge of heinous group crime; it demands only that the potential for transference of guilt be minimized to the extent possible under the circumstances. . . . The RICO statute does not offend this principle. Congress, in a proper exercise of its legislative power, has decided that murder, like thefts from interstate commerce and the counterfeiting of securities, qualifies as racketeering activity. This, of course, ups the ante for RICO violators who personally would not contemplate taking a human life. Whether there is a moral imbalance in the equation of thieves and counterfeiters with murderers is a question whose answer lies in the halls of Congress, not in the judicial conscience.</p></div>

But we are not given angels in the form of men to make prosecutorial decisions.

[T]he core of any definition of crime is a particular act or omission. That act or omission is conceived as taking place in an instant of time so precise that it can be associated with a particular mental state of intention, awareness of risk, or neglect of due care. . . . Even the crime of conspiracy, which in practice may permit an examination of an extended course of conduct by one or more individuals, does so in the guise of using that course of conduct as evidence from which to infer that a particular act of “agreement” occurred. . . . 
</p><p id="76eb0dc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirement that criminal punishment be based on a specific act has deep roots. The very nature of criminal punishment, as distinct from other uses of the compulsive power of the state (such as mandatory treatment for physical or mental illness), requires that a person not be punished for bad character, tendency to commit crime, or even a specifically formulated intention to commit some particular prohibited act. . . . Even for those accused of committing what is unquestionably a concrete, particular offense, we are careful to guard against the possibility that a defendant may be convicted and punished for bad character rather than for the particular act charged. The insistence on incident-based liability thus has important consequences for our rules of procedure and evidence. . . . 
</p><p id="76eb0dc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">RICO prosecutions of criminal enterprises present a serious challenge to . . .  this transaction-based model of crime. . . . Suppose, for example, the authorities develop evidence that the same defendant from whom they have recently made an undercover purchase of narcotics is a member of an organized crime family who committed a contract killing three years earlier. . . . In a trial on the narcotics charge alone . . . the evidence of a prior homicide committed by the defendant would likely be excluded as irrelevant and highly prejudicial. . . . If the case could be indicted and tried under RICO, however, all of the evidence regarding this defendant’s activities could easily be presented in the same trial.

<p id="76eb0dcc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At least 33 states have enacted anti-racketeering statutes closely tracking the structure and terminology of the federal RICO statute. See Susan W. Brenner, RICO, CCE, and Other Complex Crimes: The Transformation of American Criminal Law?, 2 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 239, 273 (1992). Because these statutes are similar to the federal model, state courts often look to federal RICO precedent in interpreting them. For example, in State v. Rodriguez-Roman, 297 Conn. 66, 81-83 (2010), the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in interpreting the state’s racketeering law, followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s analysis in <i>Boyle</i> that an enterprise does not require a “structure separate from that inherent in the pattern of criminal activity.” In some jurisdictions, however, state statutes have been interpreted to reach even more broadly than federal RICO. The Ohio Supreme Court, for example, has held that the “pattern of racketeering activity” required under that state’s version of RICO can be satisfied by conviction on several misdemeanor counts involving strict liability violations of a state regulatory statute. State v. Schlosser, 681 N.E.2d 911 (Ohio 1997). In accepting the prosecution’s argument that these no-fault misdemeanors could be used to establish a felony RICO violation, the court reasoned that whatever the defendant’s mental state might be, “the effect of his activities on the local and national economy is the same. Requiring the finding of a specific culpable mental state for a RICO violation obstructs the purpose of the statute. . . . ” Id. at 914.</p>
<p id="76eb0dcd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, the analogous New York provisions are more cautious. The New York offense of “enterprise corruption” requires proof of a “pattern” consisting of at least three predicate felonies, and each defendant must personally participate in three predicate crimes. N.Y. Penal Law §460.10(4) (2016). The New York statute includes a statement of “[l]egislative findings” that “more rigorous definitions” were adopted, in order to place “reasonable <span title="823" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-823">p. 823</span>limitations on the law’s applicability, and [ensure] due regard for the rights of innocent persons.” Id. §460.00.

<span class="epub-small-caps">JUSTICE DAY</span> delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="76eb34ec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The federal Elkins Act, passed in 1903, required common carriers such as railroads to post rates and forbade them from charging less than their posted <span title="824" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-824">p. 824</span>rates.

<p id="76eb34ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principal attack in this court is upon the constitutional validity of certain features of the Elkins act. 32 Stat. 847. That act, among other things, provides:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eb34ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) That anything done or omitted to be done by a corporation common carrier subject to the act to regulate commerce, and the acts amendatory thereof, which, if done or omitted to be done by any director or officer thereof, or any receiver, trustee, lessee, agent or person acting for or employed by such corporation, would constitute a misdemeanor under said acts, or under this act, shall also be held to be a misdemeanor committed by such corporation, and upon conviction thereof it shall be subject to like penalties as are prescribed in said acts, or by this act, with reference to such persons, except as such penalties are herein changed. . . . In construing and enforcing the provisions of this section, the act, omission or failure of any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any common carrier, acting within the scope of his employment, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission or failure of such carrier, as well as of that person.</p>
</div>
<p id="76eb34ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is contended that these provisions of the law are unconstitutional because Congress has no authority to impute to a corporation the commission of criminal offenses, or to subject a corporation to a criminal prosecution by reason of the things charged. The argument is that to thus punish the corporation is in reality to punish the innocent stockholders, and to deprive them of their property without opportunity to be heard, consequently without due process of law. . . . As no action of the board of directors could legally authorize a crime, and as indeed the stockholders could not do so, the arguments come to this: that owing to the nature and character of its organization and the extent of its power and authority, a corporation cannot commit a crime of the nature charged in this case.</p>
<p id="76eb34f0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some of the earlier writers on common law held the law to be that a corporation could not commit a crime. . . . In Blackstone’s Commentaries, chapter 18, §12, we find it stated: “A corporation cannot commit treason, or felony, or other crime in its corporate capacity, though its members may in their distinct individual capacities.” The modern authority, universally, so far as we know, is the other way. In considering the subject, Bishop’s New Criminal Law, §417, devotes a chapter to the capacity of corporations to commit crime, and states the law to be: “Since a corporation acts by its officers and agents their purposes, motives, and intent are just as much those of the corporation as are the things done. If, for example, the invisible, intangible essence of air, which we term a corporation, can level mountains, fill up valleys, lay down iron tracks, and run railroad cars on them, it can intend to do it, and can act therein as well viciously as virtuously.” . . .

<span title="825" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-825">p. 825</span>It is now well established that in actions for tort the corporation may be held responsible for damages for the acts of its agent within the scope of his employment. And this is the rule when the act is done by the agent in the course of his employment, although done wantonly or recklessly or against the express orders of the principal. In such cases the liability is not imputed because the principal actually participates in the malice or fraud, but because the act is done for the benefit of the principal, while the agent is acting within the scope of his employment in the business of the principal, and justice requires that the latter shall be held responsible for damages to the individual who has suffered by such conduct. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb34f2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is true that there are some crimes, which in their nature cannot be committed by corporations. But there is a large class of offenses, of which rebating under the Federal statutes is one, wherein the crime consists in purposely doing the things prohibited by statute. In that class of crimes we see no good reason why corporations may not be held responsible for and charged with the knowledge and purposes of their agents, acting within the authority conferred upon them. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb34f3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is a part of the public history of the times that statutes against rebates could not be effectually enforced so long as individuals only were subject to punishment for violation of the law, when the giving of rebates or concessions inured to the benefit of the corporations of which the individuals were but the instruments. This situation, developed in more than one report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, was no doubt influential in bringing about the enactment of the Elkins Law, making corporations criminally liable. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb34f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We see no valid objection in law, and every reason in public policy, why the corporation, which profits by the transaction, and can only act through its agents and officers, shall be held punishable by fine because of the knowledge and intent of its agents to whom it has intrusted authority to act in the subject-matter of making and fixing rates of transportation, and whose knowledge and purposes may well be attributed to the corporation for which the agents act. [T]he law . . . cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the great majority of business transactions in modern times are conducted through [corporations], and particularly that interstate commerce is almost entirely in their hands, and to give them immunity from all punishment because of the old and exploded doctrine that a corporation cannot commit a crime would virtually take away the only means of effectually controlling the subject-matter and correcting the abuses aimed at. . . .

<i>1. Corporate liability in tort versus crime.</i> As the Court in <i>New York Central</i> notes, corporations must pay damages to tort victims for the acts of corporate agents within the scope of their employment. Are the considerations that support criminal liability for corporations the same or different from those that support tort liability? In <i>New York Central</i>, which victims would be in a position to sue the defendant for damages? How would damages be <span title="826" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-826">p. 826</span>measured?

<i>2. Corporate criminal liability for which crimes?</i> The Court states: “It is true there are some crimes, which in their nature cannot be committed by corporations.” But as the Court acknowledges, a corporation can act only through its agents, so in theory, a corporation could commit any act that an individual agent could commit, as long as the agent acts within the scope of his or her employment and with the intent to benefit the corporation. To be sure, some crimes (such as murder and rape) are far less likely than others (such as financial crimes) to be committed with an intent to benefit corporate entities, but that does not mean that they cannot be committed by corporations in some situations.</p>

<p id="76eb5c0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">BROWNING</span>, J. This is an appeal from a conviction under an indictment charging a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1.</p>
<p id="76eb5c0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Operators of hotels, restaurants, hotel and restaurant supply companies, and other businesses in Portland, Oregon, organized an association to attract conventions to their city. To finance the association, members were asked to make contributions in predetermined amounts. Companies selling supplies to hotels were asked to contribute an amount equal to one per cent of their sales to hotel members. To aid collections, hotel members, including appellant [Hilton Hotels], agreed to give preferential treatment to suppliers who paid their assessments, and to curtail purchases from those who did not. [The Sherman Antitrust Act, passed by Congress in 1890, prohibits all combinations in restraint of trade. In this case, the court of appeals noted that the alleged boycott by the hotel members of suppliers who refused to pay their assessments, if proved, would constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. The court then went on to address the separate claim that the hotel could not be liable because it had not authorized the acts of the hotel’s purchasing agent who participated in the boycott.]</p>
<p id="76eb5c0f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The president of Hilton Hotels] testified that it would be contrary to the policy of the corporation for the manager of one of its hotels to condition purchases upon payment of a contribution to a local association by the supplier. The manager of appellant’s Portland hotel and his assistant testified that it was the hotel’s policy to purchase supplies solely on the basis of price, quality, and service. They also testified that on two occasions they told the hotel’s purchasing agent that he was to take no part in the boycott. The purchasing agent confirmed the receipt of these instructions, but admitted that, despite them, he had threatened a supplier with loss of the hotel’s business <span title="827" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-827">p. 827</span>unless the supplier paid the association assessment. He testified that he violated his instructions because of anger and personal pique toward the individual representing the supplier.</p>
<p id="76eb5c10-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Based upon this testimony, appellant requested certain instructions bearing upon the criminal liability of a corporation for the unauthorized acts of its agents. These requests were rejected by the trial court. The court instructed the jury that a corporation is liable for the acts and statements of its agents “within the scope of their employment,” defined to mean “in the corporation’s behalf in performance of the agent’s general line of work,” including “not only that which has been authorized by the corporation, but also that which outsiders could reasonably assume the agent would have authority to do.” The court added:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eb5c11-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A corporation is responsible for acts and statements of its agents, done or made within the scope of their employment, even though their conduct may be contrary to their actual instructions or contrary to the corporation’s stated policies.</p>
</div>
<p id="76eb5c12-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Appellant objects only to the court’s concluding statement.</p>
<p id="76eb5c13-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Congress may constitutionally impose criminal liability upon a business entity for acts or omissions of its agents within the scope of their employment. Such liability may attach without proof that the conduct was within the agent’s actual authority, and even though it may have been contrary to express instructions.</p>
<p id="76eb5c14-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The intention to impose such liability is sometimes express, New York Central &amp; Hudson R.R. Co. v. United States, 212 U.S. 481, but it may also be implied. The text of the Sherman Act does not expressly resolve the issue. For the reasons that follow, however, we think the construction of the Act that best achieves its purpose is that a corporation is liable for acts of its agents within the scope of their authority even when done against company orders. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb5c15-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legal commentators have argued forcefully that it is inappropriate and ineffective to impose criminal liability upon a corporation, as distinguished from the human agents who actually perform the unlawful acts. . . . But it is the legislative judgment that controls, and “the great mass of legislation calling for corporate criminal liability suggests a widespread belief on the part of legislators that such liability is necessary to effectuate regulatory policy.” ALI Model Penal Code, Comment on §2.07, Tentative Draft No. 4, p. 149 (1956). Moreover, the strenuous efforts of corporate defendants to avoid conviction, particularly under the Sherman Act, strongly suggest that Congress is justified in its judgment that exposure of the corporate entity to potential conviction may provide a substantial spur to corporate action to prevent violations by employees.</p>
<p id="76eb5c16-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because of the nature of Sherman Act offenses and the context in which they normally occur, the factors that militate against allowing a corporation to disown the criminal acts of its agents apply with special force to Sherman Act violations.</p>
<p id="76eb5c17-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="828" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-828">p. 828</span>Sherman Act violations are commercial offenses. They are usually motivated by a desire to enhance profits.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11F87_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11F87_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> They commonly involve large, complex, and highly decentralized corporate business enterprises, and intricate business processes, practices, and arrangements. More often than not they also involve basic policy decisions, and must be implemented over an extended period of time.</p>
<p id="76eb5c19-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Complex business structures, characterized by decentralization and delegation of authority, commonly adopted by corporations for business purposes, make it difficult to identify the particular corporate agents responsible for Sherman Act violations. At the same time, it is generally true that high management officials, for whose conduct the corporate directors and stockholders are the most clearly responsible, are likely to have participated in the policy decisions underlying Sherman Act violations, or at least to have become aware of them.</p>
<p id="76eb5c1a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Violations of the Sherman Act are a likely consequence of the pressure to maximize profits that is commonly imposed by corporate owners upon managing agents and, in turn, upon lesser employees. In the face of that pressure, generalized directions to obey the Sherman Act, with the probable effect of foregoing profits, are the least likely to be taken seriously. And if a violation of the Sherman Act occurs, the corporation, and not the individual agents, will have realized the profits from the illegal activity.</p>
<p id="76eb5c1b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In sum, identification of the particular agents responsible for a Sherman Act violation is especially difficult, and their conviction and punishment is peculiarly ineffective as a deterrent. At the same time, conviction and punishment of the business entity itself is likely to be both appropriate and effective.</p>
<p id="76eb5c1c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For these reasons we conclude that as a general rule a corporation is liable under the Sherman Act for the acts of its agents in the scope of their employment, even though contrary to general corporate policy and express instructions to the agent.</p>
<p id="76eb5c1d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Thus the general policy statements of appellant’s president were no defense. Nor was it enough that appellant’s manager told the purchasing agent that he was not to participate in the boycott. The purchasing agent was authorized to buy all of appellant’s supplies. Purchases were made on the basis of specifications, but the purchasing agent exercised complete authority as to source. He was in a unique position to add the corporation’s buying power to the force of the boycott. Appellant could not gain exculpation by issuing general instructions without undertaking to enforce those instructions by means commensurate with the obvious risks. . . . Affirmed.</p>

<i>1. The case for corporate liability.</i> Proponents of corporate criminal liability embrace it for expressive and instrumental reasons. David M. <span title="829" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-829">p. 829</span>Uhlmann explains the expressive function of corporate criminal liability, arguing:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eb5c21-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The criminal law is our most powerful tool for expressing what conduct is outside the bounds of acceptable corporate behavior . . . [and] for expressing how we expect corporations to conduct their affairs. . . . [W]hen we do not impose criminal liability upon corporations that commit egregious violations of the law, we blur the lines that the criminal law establishes between conduct that is acceptable and conduct that will not be tolerated. We express to the companies that break the law that their conduct is not so egregious that it warrants criminal prosecutions. We tell companies that are diligent about meeting legal obligations that their efforts are valued less by society. In the process, we weaken adherence to the rule of law and our ability to send societal messages about what corporate behavior is unacceptable and what corporate behavior we want to promote.</p>
</div>
<p id="76eb5c22-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Uhlmann, The Pendulum Swings: Reconsidering Corporate Criminal Prosecution, 49 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1235, 1263-1264 (2016). Samuel W. Buell argues that, in order to more fully exploit criminal law’s expressive power, the blameworthiness of the corporate entity should play a larger role in shaping the prerequisites for corporate criminal liability, as well as the manner in which prosecutorial discretion is exercised. Buell, The Blaming Function of Entity Criminal Liability, 81 Ind. L.J. 473 (2006).</p>
<p id="76eb5c23-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instrumental view emphasizes that corporate criminal liability provides incentives for managers to patrol lower ranking officers and employers and to create a law-abiding corporate culture. This view is reflected in the Department of Justice Manual for United States Attorneys, which states that “[i]ndicting corporations for wrongdoing enables the government to be a force for positive change of corporate culture, and a force to prevent, discover, and punish serious crimes.” Dept. of Justice, U.S. Attorneys’ Manual, §9-28.200(A).</p>
<p id="76eb5c24-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010—the largest marine oil spill in history, which resulted in the deaths of 11 workers—Uhlmann argued that “criminal prosecution of the Gulf oil spill is appropriate under a deterrence theory of criminal law and because it expresses societal condemnation of the spill,” see David M. Uhlmann, After the Spill Is Gone: The Gulf of Mexico, Environmental Crime, and the Criminal Law, 109 Mich. L. Rev. 1413, 1420 (2011). BP ultimately pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges, including felony manslaughter. As part of its plea deal with the Department of Justice, BP also agreed to pay more than $4 billion in criminal fines and penalties. In addition, DOJ required BP to retain an ethics monitor, a safety and risk management monitor, and an independent auditor.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FD7_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11FD7_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">10</a></span> BP later agreed <span title="830" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-830">p. 830</span>to pay $20 billion as part of a civil settlement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11FE5_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11FE5_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">11</a></span> Did the criminal charges against BP more effectively express condemnation of the spill than the civil penalties? If the civil penalties were $24 billion instead, thus equaling BP’s payout in criminal and civil penalties combined, would there have been a separate need for criminal penalties? For what purpose?</p>
<p id="76eb8337-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The case against corporate liability.</i> Critics of corporate criminal liability question both the expressive and instrumental lines of analysis. Albert W. Alschuler condemns the expressive view, arguing that “attributing blame to a corporation is no more sensible than attributing blame to a dagger, a fountain pen, a Chevrolet, or any other instrumentality of crime.” Alschuler, Two Ways to Think About the Punishment of Corporations, 46 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1359, 1392 (2009). Is Alschuler correct that corporations are mere instrumentalities? The Supreme Court has recognized constitutional rights for corporations, including free speech rights, most prominently in Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). If corporations enjoy constitutional protections as entities, why shouldn’t they be subject to criminal penalties as well? Sara Sun Beale argues that accepting corporations as separate legal entities dictates that shareholders take the bad with the good. Beale, A Response to Critics of Corporate Criminal Liability, 46 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1481, 1485 (2009). Is there a meaningful difference between the criteria for conferring privileges and the criteria for importing blame? If so, what is it?</p>
<p id="76eb8338-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instrumental view of corporate criminal liability has also come under attack, with critics questioning whether punishment of the corporation deters crime. Some commentators argue that corporate criminal liability spurs excessive monitoring and litigation costs. Daniel R. Fischel &amp; Alan O. Sykes, Corporate Crime, 25 J. Legal Stud. 319 (1996). They argue for a scheme of government-imposed civil penalties based on a claim that civil sanctions will deter wrongdoing more cost effectively, due to lower procedural hurdles and sanctioning costs. Jennifer Arlen, Corporate Crime and Its Control, in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law 492-497 (Peter Newman ed., 1998). Jennifer Arlen makes an even stronger claim that criminal liability may increase rather than decrease corporate crime because it may lead corporations to relax their monitoring efforts in order to prevent information from coming to the attention of government prosecutors.

<i>3. Collateral consequences.</i> While the imposition of criminal liability in other contexts is debated along similar lines, some view corporate criminal liability as raising unique issues because the corporate entity itself, as well as its shareholders, employees, customers, and suppliers, may be a victim of the criminal wrongdoing of corporate agents. Criminal prosecution and <span title="831" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-831">p. 831</span>punishment of the corporation, which is designed to deter such wrongdoing, will also harm the corporation and these additional (and often wholly innocent) individuals and entities. The case of Arthur Andersen provides one of the most notable examples of these collateral consequences. The criminal conviction of Arthur Andersen, a limited liability partnership that had been one of the largest global accounting firms, for its shredding of audit documents during the Enron scandal, destroyed that firm by ruining its reputation, even though the actual sentence that it received was relatively minor and even though its conviction was later reversed by the Supreme Court. See United States v. Arthur Andersen LLP, 544 U.S. 696 (2005).</p>

<i>4. The respondeat superior approach.</i> The use of the tort doctrine of respondeat superior to define the prerequisites of corporate criminal liability, as developed in the <i>New York Central</i> and <i>Hilton Hotels</i> cases, is one of the two main approaches to corporate liability in the United States. (The other is the more restrictive doctrine of the MPC, which is discussed infra p. 842.) The requirements of liability under the respondeat superior approach are summarized in Note, Developments in the Law—Corporate Crime: Regulating <span title="832" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-832">p. 832</span>Corporate Behavior Through Criminal Sanctions, 92 Harv.

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eb8340-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, a corporation may be held criminally liable for the acts of any of its agents if an agent (1) commits a crime (2) within the scope of employment (3) with the intent to benefit the corporation.</p>
<p id="76eb8341-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it must be proved that an illegal act was committed by an agent of the corporation, and that the agent acted with the specific intent required by the governing statute. [I]t is not necessary to prove that a specific person acted illegally, only that <i>some</i> agent of the corporation committed the crime. Thus, proving that a corporate defendant committed the illegal act is in practice substantially easier than an individual prosecution. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb8342-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, to establish corporate liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the prosecution must show that the illegal act was committed within the agent’s scope of employment. The traditional agency definition limits scope of employment to conduct that is authorized, explicitly or implicitly, by the principal or that is similar or incidental to authorized conduct. However, courts generally find conduct to fall within the scope of employment even if it was specifically forbidden by a superior and occurred despite good faith efforts on the part of the corporation to prevent the crime. Thus, scope of employment in practice means little more than that the act occurred while the offending employee was carrying out a job-related activity. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76eb8343-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Third, it must be proved that the agent committed the crime with the intent to benefit the corporation. The corporation may be held criminally liable even if it received no actual benefit from the offense, although the existence or absence of benefit is relevant as evidence of an intent to benefit.</p>
<p id="76eb8344-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The requirements of scope of employment and intent to benefit the corporation can also be met through ratification. When an employee commits a crime with no intent to benefit the corporation, or while acting outside the scope of his employment, subsequent approval of the act by his supervisor will be sufficient to hold the corporation liable for the employee’s criminal act. In a sense, under the doctrine of ratification, a corporation is culpable for approving the criminal act, rather than committing it.</p>

<i>5. Intent to benefit the corporation.</i> The reach of the respondeat superior doctrine is exhibited in United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, 138 F.3d 961 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Defendant Sun-Diamond (an agricultural cooperative entity) was charged with wire fraud and illegal campaign contributions. Douglas, an officer of the defendant with some responsibility for lobbying, devised a fraudulent scheme to conceal his misappropriation of the defendant’s funds to support the congressional campaign of the brother of the secretary of agriculture, Mike Espy. The court upheld a conviction of Douglas’s employer, stating at 970:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76eb8346-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sun-Diamond says Douglas’s scheme was designed to—and did in fact—defraud his employer, not benefit it. In this circumstance, it strenuously argues, there can be no imputation: “[T]o establish precedent holding a principal criminally liable for the acts of an agent who defrauds and deceives the principal while pursuing matters within his self-interest merely because the <span title="833" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-833">p. 833</span>agent’s conduct may provide some incidental benefit to the principal serves to punish innocent principals with no countervailing policy justifications.”</p>
<p id="76eb8347-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This argument has considerable intuitive appeal—Sun-Diamond does look more like a victim than a perpetrator, at least on the fraud charges. The facts in the record, however—that Douglas hid the illegal contribution scheme from others at the company and used company funds to accomplish it—do not preclude a valid finding that he undertook the scheme to benefit Sun-Diamond. Part of Douglas’s job was to cultivate his, and Sun-Diamond’s, relationship with Secretary Espy. By responding to the Secretary’s request to help his brother, Douglas may have been acting out of pure friendship, but the jury was entitled to conclude that he was instead, or also, with an intent (however befuddled) to further the interests of his employer. The scheme came at some cost to Sun-Diamond but it also promised some benefit. . . . Where there is adequate evidence for imputation (as here), the only thing that keeps deceived corporations from being indicted for the acts of their employee-deceivers is not some fixed rule of law or logic but simply the sound exercise of prosecutorial discretion.</p>
<p id="76eb8348-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">And the answer to Sun-Diamond’s claim of the absence of any “countervailing policy justification” is simply the justification usually offered in support of holding corporate principals liable for the illegal acts of their agents: to increase incentives for corporations to monitor and prevent illegal employee conduct.</p>

<i>6. The exercise of prosecutorial discretion.</i> Despite the potential breadth of the doctrine of respondeat superior, prosecutors can and do use their charging discretion to forgo corporate prosecution in some cases. For example, prosecutors may choose not to prosecute the company when they believe the corporation itself is the primary victim of the offense, as was clear in the stunning collapse of Enron Corporation in the wake of massive fraud committed by several of its chief officers. In the prosecution of Andrew Fastow, Enron’s chief financial officer, the indictment listed Enron as the first “victim” of the offense. Though several of Fastow’s alleged actions could be viewed as benefiting the company by defrauding investors, many of them also defrauded Enron itself. As a result, the government declined to prosecute Enron. See Alan C. Michaels, Fastow and Arthur Andersen: Some Reflections on Corporate Criminality, Victim Status, and Retribution, 1 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 551 (2004). Reconsider, supra pp. 740-741, the decision of the MPC and many jurisdictions to adopt a formal rule of law exempting victims of crime from criminal liability as accomplices, regardless of their technical eligibility under ordinary accomplice liability principles. Should the same rule apply in the context of corporate criminal liability?</p>
<p id="76ebaa5a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The status of the corporation as “victim” is not the only consideration relevant to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Because the doctrine of respondeat superior is so broad that it allows criminal prosecution of corporations in vastly more cases than the government could possibly wish to pursue, prosecutors consider other factors as well. A Justice Department memo authored by then-Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., offering <span title="834" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-834">p. 834</span>line prosecutors guidance on “Bringing Charges Against Corporations,” stated that among the factors to be considered are the “pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation, including the complicity in, or condonation of, the wrongdoing by corporate management” and any “collateral consequences, including disproportionate harm to shareholders and employees not proven personally culpable,” as well as the “adequacy of non-criminal remedies, such as civil or regulatory enforcement actions.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12077_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12077_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">12</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76ebaa5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the wake of the Enron scandal and other large-scale corporate wrongdoing, the Justice Department in 2002 created the Corporate Fraud Task Force with a mission to strengthen the efforts to investigate and prosecute corporate crime. The Department also released a follow-up memo to the Holder Memo on corporate charging considerations. Authored by then-Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson, the “Thompson Memo” reaffirmed factors from the Holder Memo and also asked prosecutors to consider “whether the corporation, while purporting to cooperate, has engaged in conduct that impedes the investigation (whether or not rising to the level of criminal obstruction).”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12083_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12083_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> The Thompson Memo thus focused on the corporation’s cooperation as a key factor in deciding whether or not to prosecute. See generally Harry First, Branch Office of the Prosecutor: The New Role of the Corporation in Business Crime Prosecutions, 89 N.C. L. Rev. 23 (2010); Lisa Kern Griffin, Compelled Cooperation and the New Corporate Criminal Procedure, 82 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 311, 332 (2007).</p>
<p id="76ebaa5e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should corporate cooperation be assessed? The Thompson Memo allowed prosecutors to consider the corporation’s “willingness to cooperate in the investigation of its agents, including, if necessary, the waiver of corporate attorney-client and work product protection.” Corporations responded by waiving attorney-client privilege and limiting payments for employees’ legal fees. The Justice Department, in turn, used such corporate assistance to secure more than 1,000 indictments and convictions against individuals since the creation of the Corporate Fraud Task Force. But subsequent developments established that there are lines federal prosecutors cannot cross in these negotiations. In 2005, the accounting firm KPMG entered into an agreement with the federal government in which it admitted to using fraudulent tax shelters and resolved to “clean house” by refusing to pay its employees’ legal fees and by threatening to fire them unless they cooperated with the government’s investigation. The Second Circuit held that the company’s refusal to pay legal fees deprived the employees of their right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. United States v. Stein, 541 F.3d 130, 137, 151 (2d Cir. 2008). In 2006, Senator Arlen Specter proposed legislation that would prohibit the Department of Justice from insisting on the waiver of attorney-client privilege.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1208F_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1208F_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span> <span title="835" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-835">p. 835</span>To ward off the legislation and answer its critics, the Department of Justice updated its corporate charging policy to discourage prosecutors from requesting that corporations withhold employee legal fees or from seeking waivers of attorney-client privilege. The Department now emphasizes that the question of corporate cooperation should turn on the “disclosure of relevant <i>facts</i>,” regardless of whether the corporation waived attorney-client privilege.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1209C_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1209C_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">15</a></span> In a 2015 memo, issued by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, the Department further clarified that, for corporations to receive cooperation credit, they must “provide to the Department all relevant facts relating to the individuals responsible for the misconduct.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN120A8_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N120A8_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">16</a></span> The Yates Memo emphasized that federal prosecutors needed to “fully leverage [their] resources to identify culpable individuals at all levels in corporate cases” because the prosecution of individuals is critical for deterrence and accountability.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN120B4_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N120B4_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">17</a></span> The Yates Memo thus clarifies that a corporation’s fate rests in significant part on whether it provides the facts prosecutors need to prosecute responsible individuals.</p>

<i>7. DPAs and NPAs.</i> Prosecutorial discretion with respect to corporations is not limited to the binary decision of either charging or not charging the company with a crime. In the past two decades, the Department of Justice has increasingly pursued a third option. It has reached deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) or non-prosecution agreements (NPAs) with corporations. Pursuant to these agreements, the government agrees not to prosecute the company in exchange for corporate concessions and cooperation. With NPAs, the government does not file charges in court but retains the right to prosecute later if the company does not meet the terms of the agreement. With DPAs, charges are filed, but once the company fulfills the terms of the agreement, the government dismisses the charges. Brandon L. Garrett found that, during the period from 2001 to 2012, there were 2,008 federal organizational convictions and 255 DPAs or NPAs. Garrett, Too Big to Jail: How Prosecutors Compromise with Corporations 298-299 (2014). For an empirical study of DPAs and NPAs over the past 20 years, see Wulf A. Kaal &amp; Timothy A. Lacine, The Effect of Deferred and Non-Prosecution Agreements on Corporate Governance: Evidence from 1993-2013, 70 Bus. Law. 61 120 (2014-2015). The Yates Memo indicates it may be harder for corporations to obtain DPAs or NPAs without individual charges also being brought, but it is too soon to assess whether the memo will bring about significant changes. One study of DPAs and NPAs before the Yates Memo was issued found that in two-thirds of cases with DPAs and NPAs, no individual officers or employees <span title="836" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-836">p. 836</span>were prosecuted. Brandon L. Garrett, The Corporate Criminal as Scapegoat, 101 Va. L. Rev. 1789, 1796 (2015).</p>
<p id="76ebaa64-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some applaud the increased use of DPAs and NPAs because they allow the government to obtain fines and concessions without subjecting the company to collateral consequences that follow from convictions, such as losing a license that is necessary to stay in business. Court E. Golumbic &amp; Albert D. Lichy, The “Too Big to Jail” Effect and the Impact on the Justice Department’s Corporate Charging Policy, 65 Hastings L.J. 1293, 1343-1344 (2014). Others condemn the use of these agreements. Julie O’Sullivan, for example, argues that these agreements</p>

<p id="76ebaa65-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">have the sole advantage of permitting the government to avoid blame for whatever collateral consequences may flow from a corporate guilty plea—be it debarment from government contracting, the de-licensing of the firm, or losses in revenue, jobs, or shareholder value. This singular focus on collateral consequences, while understandable and even compassionate, undermines both the policies underlying the collateral penalties and the fair and even-handed administration of criminal justice.</p>

<i>8.

In Corporate Culpability Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 34 Ariz. L. Rev. 743 (1992), Jennifer Moore criticizes the doctrine of respondeat superior in part for being underinclusive in some circumstances:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ebd178-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are some situations in which corporate policies or procedures do cause a crime, yet the doctrine of respondeat superior is unable to find the corporation culpable because there is no individual culpability to impute.</p>
<p id="76ebd179-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A . . . way in which courts have coped with the problem of underinclusiveness is the development of the “collective knowledge” doctrine. This doctrine enables courts to find liability in cases in which the corporation seems “justly to blame” for the crime, but no single individual has the required mens rea. It permits a finding of corporate mens rea to be derived from the collective knowledge of the corporation’s members. In United States v. Bank of New England, N.A., for example, the bank was found guilty of “willfully” violating the Currency Transaction Reporting Act even though no one of its agents was found to have had the required “willfulness.” . . . The fact that some employees were aware of the Act’s reporting requirements, while other employees were aware of the transactions, was enough to constitute willfulness on the part of the Bank.</p>

<p id="76ebd17d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A nursing home patient, McCauley, suffered from dementia and had attempted to leave through the facility’s front doors on numerous occasions. A doctor concluded that McCauley was at risk of leaving the nursing home again if left unattended, so he ordered that she wear a security bracelet at all times that would have set off an alarm and locked the front doors when she approached them. An employee of the nursing home mistakenly removed the physician’s order from McCauley’s treatment sheet, and the omission of the order was not discovered during the monthly editing process of the patients’ charts. One spring evening, a nurse from a unit other than McCauley’s was on duty and did not realize McCauley was supposed to be wearing a bracelet because it was not in her chart. When McCauley was placed in her wheelchair near the front doors, no nurse stood guard. McCauley went through the front doors, fell down the stairs, and died from the injuries she sustained. Could the nursing home, as a corporation, be charged under the theory of involuntary manslaughter discussed in <i>Welansky</i>, supra p. 490, based upon a theory of collective knowledge, even in the absence of a specific employee with the requisite mens rea under <i>Welansky</i>? The court in Commonwealth v. Life Care Centers of America, 926 N.E.2d 206, 212 (Mass. 2010), rejected the collective knowledge theory, holding that “a corporation acts with a given mental state in a criminal context only if at least one employee who acts (or fails to act) possesses the requisite mental state at the time of the act (or failure to act).” The breadth of respondeat superior liability is premised on the idea that the entity generally bears responsibility for the acts of its agents. If no individual agent is responsible, how can the entity be responsible?</p>

The defendants argue that a corporation should not be held criminally liable <span title="838" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-838">p. 838</span>for the conduct of its servants or agents unless such conduct was performed, authorized, ratified, adopted or tolerated by the corporations’ directors, officers or other “high managerial agents” who are sufficiently high in the corporate hierarchy to warrant the assumption that their acts in some substantial sense reflect corporate policy. This standard is that adopted by [the MPC]. . . . Section 2.07 of the Code provides that, except in the case of regulatory offences and offences consisting of the omission of a duty imposed on corporations by law, a corporation may be convicted of a crime if “the commission of the offence was authorized, requested, commanded, performed or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting in behalf of the corporation within the scope of his office or employment.” The section proceeds to define “high managerial agent” as “an officer of a corporation . . . or any other agent . . . having duties of such responsibility that his conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the policy of the corporation.”</p>
<p id="76ebf894-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that the standard applied by the judge in his instructions to the jury was correct. These instructions, which prescribe a somewhat more flexible standard than that delineated in the Model Penal Code, state in part, as follows:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ebf895-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Commonwealth does not have to prove that the individual who acted criminally was expressly requested or authorized in advance by the corporation to do so, nor must the Commonwealth prove that the corporation expressly ratified or adopted that criminal conduct on the part of that individual or those individuals. [Nor must the Commonwealth prove] that the individual who acted criminally was a member of the corporation’s board of directors, or that he was a high officer in the corporation, or that he held any office at all. [Rather, the jury] should consider what the authority of that person was as such officer in relation to the corporation. The mere fact that he has a title is not enough to make the corporation liable for his criminal conduct. The Commonwealth must prove that the individual for whose conduct it seeks to charge the corporation criminally was placed in a position by the corporation where he had enough power, duty, responsibility and authority to act for and in behalf of the corporation to handle the particular business . . . of the corporation in which he was engaged at the time that he committed the criminal act, with power of decision as to what he would or would not do while acting for the corporation, and that he was acting for and in behalf of the corporation in the accomplishment of that particular business. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76ebf896-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The difference between the judge’s instructions to the jury and the Model Penal Code lies largely in the latter’s reference to a “high managerial agent” and in the Code requirement that to impose corporate criminal liability, it at least must appear that its directors or high managerial agent “authorized . . . or recklessly tolerated” the allegedly criminal acts. The judge’s instructions focus on the authority of the corporate agent in relation to the particular corporate business in which the agent was engaged. The Code seems to require that there be authorization or reckless inaction by a corporate <span title="839" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-839">p. 839</span>representative having some relation to framing corporate policy, or one “having duties of such responsibility that his conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the policy of the corporation.” Close examination of the judge’s instructions reveals that they preserve the underlying “corporate policy” rationale of the Code by allowing the jury to infer “corporate policy” from the position in which the corporation placed the agent in commissioning him to handle the particular corporate affairs in which he was engaged at the time of the criminal act.</p>

<p id="76ebf898-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he very nature of a corporation as a “person” before the law renders it impossible to equate the imposition of vicarious liability on a human principal with the imposition of vicarious liability on a corporate principal. . . . Thus, the issue is not whether vicarious liability should be imposed on a corporation under the “direct participation and assent rule” of the master-servant cases cited above, but rather, whether the acts and intent of natural persons . . . can be treated as the acts and intent of the corporation itself. For the foregoing reasons, despite the strenuous urging of the defendants, we are unconvinced that the standard for imposing criminal responsibility on a human principal adequately deals with the evidentiary problems which are inherent in ascribing the acts of individuals to a corporate entity. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ebf899-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court then addressed one defendant’s objection that applying a rule of corporate responsibility for the acts of low-level employees imposes criminal liability based upon a civil law standard.]</p>
<p id="76ebf89a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It may be that the theoretical principles underlying this standard are, in general, the same as embodied in the rule of respondeat superior. Nevertheless, as we observed at the outset, the judge’s instructions, as a whole and in context, required a greater quantum of proof in the practical application of this standard than is required in a civil case. In focusing on the “kinship” between the authority of an individual and the act he committed, the judge emphasized that the jury must be satisfied “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the act of the individual “<i>constituted</i>” the act of the corporation. Juxtaposition of the traditional criminal law requirement of ascertaining guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (as opposed to the civil law standard of the preponderance of the evidence), with the rule of respondeat superior, fully justifies application of the standard enunciated by the judge to a criminal prosecution against a corporation for a crime requiring specific intent.</p>
<p id="76ebf89b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The foregoing is especially true in view of the particular circumstances of this case. In order to commit the crimes charged in these indictments, the defendant corporations either had to offer to pay money to a public official or conspire to do so. The disbursal of funds is an act peculiarly within the <span title="840" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-840">p. 840</span>ambit of corporate activity. These corporations by the very nature of their business are constantly dealing with the expenditure and collection of moneys. It could hardly be expected that any of the individual defendants would conspire to pay, or would pay, the substantial amount of money here involved, namely $25,000, out of his own pocket. The jury would be warranted in finding that the disbursal of such an amount of money would come from the corporate treasury. A reasonable inference could therefore be drawn that the payment of such money by the corporations was done as a matter of corporate policy and as a reflection of corporate intent, thus comporting with the underlying rationale of the Model Penal Code, and probably with its specific requirements.</p>
<p id="76ebf89c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Moreover, we do not think that the Model Penal Code standard really purports to deal with the evidentiary problems which are inherent in establishing the quantum of proof necessary to show that the directors or officers of a corporation authorize, ratify, tolerate, or participate in the criminal acts of an agent when such acts are apparently performed on behalf of the corporation. Evidence of such authorization or ratification is too easily susceptible of concealment. As is so trenchantly stated by the judge: “Criminal acts are not usually made the subject of votes of authorization or ratification by corporate Boards of Directors; and the lack of such votes does not prevent the act from being the act of the corporation.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ebf89d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Additional factors of importance are the size and complexity of many large modern corporations which necessitate the delegation of more authority to lesser corporate agents and employees. As the judge pointed out: “There are not enough seats on the Board of Directors, nor enough offices in a corporation, to permit the corporation engaged in widespread operations to give such a title or office to every person in whom it places the power, authority, and responsibility for decision and action.” This latter consideration lends credence to the view that the title or position of an individual in a corporation should not be conclusively determinative in ascribing criminal responsibility. In a large corporation, with many numerous and distinct departments, a high ranking corporate officer or agent may have no authority or involvement in a particular sphere of corporate activity, whereas a lower ranking corporate executive might have much broader power in dealing with a matter peculiarly within the scope of his authority. Employees who are in the lower echelon of the corporate hierarchy often exercise more responsibility in the <i>everyday operations</i> of the corporation than the directors or officers. Assuredly, the title or office that the person holds may be considered, but it should not be the decisive criterion upon which to predicate corporate responsibility. . . .

<p id="76ec1fb3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The court upheld the conviction of a corporation that operated a group home facility for resident neglect after a resident of the home died as a result of medical complications from untreated bed sores. Resident neglect is a crime in Missouri defined in relevant part as knowingly failing to provide reasonable and necessary medical care. The defendant corporation operated more than 30 group homes, which were divided among three major divisions in the company (North, Central, and South). Turtle Creek, the group home facility where the resident died, was in the South division, which was run by an executive director and an associate director who oversaw the 13 different homes in that division. Mary Collura was the lead staff person at Turtle Creek, and her responsibilities included managing residents’ medical care and supervising the staff at both Turtle Creek and a second group home. The issue in the case was whether the corporation’s criminal liability could be based on the fact that Collura knowingly tolerated the lack of medical treatment for the resident. In order to uphold liability against the corporation under state law, Collura had to be a “high managerial agent,” which was defined as “an officer of a corporation or any other agent in a position of comparable authority with respect to . . . the supervision in a managerial capacity of subordinate employees.” The corporation argued that Collura was not a high managerial agent because she was a low-level employee in the overall structure of the sprawling company. The court rejected this argument:] In this case, defendant operated many facilities, or business units, under a single corporate ownership. Each business unit had personnel responsible for the care of the residents at its facility. This court does not perceive the legislative intent . . . to have been to treat large corporations with numerous operating units different from those that operate a single or a few business units. . . . Mary Collura managed and supervised the employees responsible for providing patient care. She determined what medical care would be afforded [the victim] pursuant to the business structure prescribed by the defendant. She was defendant’s “lead staff person” at Turtle Creek. . . . [She] gave job evaluations, disciplined support staff through written reprimands, and made recommendations regarding hiring and firing of support staff. . . . Collura was the only manager who was regularly present at Turtle Creek.</p>

[Judge Scott then explained his research, which included looking at the MPC provision defining a HMA as one whose “conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the policy of the corporation.” Judge Scott noted that Missouri, like other states, has opted for a broader definition of HMA that includes “persons who manage and supervise employees.”] [C]orporations range from one-man shows to multinational enterprises with thousands of branch locations. Even in the latter scenario, the flexibility of modern corporate laws and structures could enable “branch managers” to exercise authority comparable to that of a corporate officer, at least within their sphere of influence and with respect to their subordinate employees.

<i>1. The Model Penal Code approach.</i> The MPC provisions, like the Missouri approach, represent an attempt to cut back on the traditional scope of corporate liability based on respondeat superior. Their influence may be seen in a number of state revisions. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.07 at 340, n.18 (1985). Professor Brickey summarizes the Model Penal Code proposals as follows (Kathleen F. Brickey, Rethinking Corporate Liability Under the Model Penal Code, 19 Rutgers L.J. 593, 596-598 (1988)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec1fb9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Code adopts a trifurcated scheme of corporate liability that draws intersecting lines between acts and omissions, between true crimes and regulatory offenses, and between the operatives who are the “hands” of the corporation and the policy makers who constitute its “mind.”</p>
<p id="76ec1fba-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Among the most expansive of the three rules is section 2.07(1)(a), which adopts a broad respondeat superior theory of liability. Under this rule, a corporation may incur liability for minor infractions and for non-Code penal offenses when a legislative purpose to impose liability on corporations “plainly appears,” provided that the conduct constituting the offense is performed by a corporate agent acting within the scope of his employment and on behalf of the corporation.</p>
<p id="76ec1fbb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The potential reach of the (1)(a) liability rule is limited, however, by the availability of a due diligence defense. Proof that “the high managerial agent <span title="843" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-843">p. 843</span>having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense employed due diligence to prevent its commission” exonerates the corporation from criminal liability.</p>
<p id="76ec1fbc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second rule of corporate liability pertains to omissions as opposed to acts. Subsection (1)(b) provides that a corporation is accountable for failure to discharge specific duties imposed on corporations by law. Neither the text of this provision nor the comments address the question of whose omission may lead to liability.</p>
<p id="76ec1fbd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third rule of liability is by far the most restrictive. Under subsection (1)(c), a corporation will incur liability for true crimes—that is, for an offense defined in the Penal Code—only if the conduct constituting the offense is authorized, commanded, solicited, performed, or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors or a “high managerial agent” whose acquiescence to the wrongdoing—by virtue of his position of authority—may fairly be regarded as reflecting corporate policy.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ec1fbe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The MPC proposals have been criticized for providing both too much and too little criminal liability for corporations. As for providing too much liability, some argue that the broad respondeat superior liability proposed for certain minor offenses under §2.07(1)(a) inappropriately extends corporate liability for acts of those outside the “inner circle” of management who make up the “mens” or mind of the corporation. Gerhard O.W. Mueller, Mens Rea and the Corporation: A Study of the Model Penal Code Position on Corporate Criminal Liability, 19 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 21, 41 (1957). As for providing too little liability, some contend that, because of insurmountable difficulties of proof, “a liability rule requiring proof that a high managerial agent ratified a subordinate’s misconduct is apt to be, in practice, a rule of no liability at all.” Brickey, supra, at 626.</p>
<p id="76ec1fbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions: (a)</i> Reconsider the <i>Hilton Hotels</i> case, supra. Would criminal liability be imposed on the corporation under the MPC approach? <i>(b)</i> Assuming that corporate liability should be limited to those acts by high-level officials, what is the best way to define those officials? Is the MPC approach too restrictive? Does the broadening to individuals with supervisory authority make sense, or does defining a high managerial agent as anyone with supervisory responsibility sweep too far?</p>

<i>2. Other alternatives.</i> Missouri, along with other states, relies on the high managerial agent approach of the MPC, but defines those agents more expansively. Commentators have floated a number of other alternatives to the MPC and respondeat superior approaches for dealing with corporate criminality. One alternative involves strategies to influence the internal functioning of the corporation. For instance, to encourage compliance programs, some commentators argue that, “where it seeks to charge a corporation as a defendant, the government should bear the burden of establishing as an additional element that the corporation failed to have reasonably effective policies and procedures to prevent the conduct.” Andrew Weissmann &amp; David Newman, Rethinking Criminal Corporate Liability, 82 Ind. L.J. 411, 414 (2007). A related proposal would replace entity-based criminal liability with “compliance insurance,” in <span title="844" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-844">p. 844</span>which “insurance carriers would encourage organizations to monitor and police their employees through privately negotiated insurance policies.” Under this scheme, insurance carriers would set their premiums to reflect the risk that a corporation’s employees would commit a crime. The higher the risk, the higher the premiums, thus encouraging companies to monitor and deter misconduct through compliance programs. In return, the insurance companies would cover any civil penalties that resulted from employee misconduct. Miriam Hechler Baer, Insuring Corporate Crime, 83 Ind. L.J. 1035, 1041 (2008).</p>
<p id="76ec1fc1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The recognition that the internal functioning of a corporation plays a significant role in promoting or preventing the criminal behavior of individual corporate agents has led some theorists to generate yet another model of corporate criminal liability that is not derivative of an agent’s individual liability, but rather based on a conception of the corporation itself as the culpable entity, as “a true, independent player in the system, with powers and identity of its own . . . a living cell, possessing an identity that is separate from the molecules forming it.” Eli Lederman, Models for Imposing Corporate Criminal Liability: From Adaptation and Imitation Toward Aggregation and the Search for Self-Identity, 4 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 641, 646 (2000). Consider the following proposal to base corporate liability on systemic conditions of corporate operation:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec1fc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[E]ach corporate entity has a distinct and identifiable personality or “ethos.” The government can convict a corporation under this standard only if it proves that the corporate ethos encouraged agents of the corporation to commit the criminal act. Central to this approach is the assumption that organizations possess an identity that is independent of specific individuals who control or work for the organization.</p>
<p id="76ec1fc3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In determining] whether there existed a corporate ethos that encouraged the criminal conduct . . . factfinders should examine the corporation’s internal structure. . . . Beginning with the corporate hierarchy, the factfinders should determine whether the directors’ supervision of officers, or management’s supervision of employees was dilatory. Next, factfinders should examine the corporate goals, as communicated to the employees, to determine whether these goals could be achieved only by disregarding the law. The third and fourth factors focus on the corporation’s affirmative steps to educate and monitor employees and are more relevant in some fields than others. . . . The factfinders should [also] assess . . . how the corporation has reacted to past violations, to further evaluate whether the corporation encourages or discourages illegal behavior. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec1fc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The . . . corporate ethos standard . . . rewards those corporations that make efforts to educate and motivate their employees to follow the letter and spirit of the law. This encourages responsible corporate behavior. This advantage is in sharp contrast to the Model Penal Code’s standard of liability that discourages higher echelon employees from properly supervising lower echelon employees. This advantage also contrasts with the minimal deterrence achieved by imposing criminal liability on individuals within the corporation. Convicting individual agents and employees of a corporation does not stop <span title="845" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-845">p. 845</span>other corporate employees from committing future criminal acts if sufficient internal corporate pressure to violate the law continues to exist. In such an environment, the agents are cogs in a wheel. Those convicted are simply replaced by others whose original propensity to obey the law is similarly overcome by a corporate ethos that encourages illegal acts. Unless inside or outside forces change the lawless ethos, it will corrupt each generation of corporate agents. The proposed standard of liability addresses this problem by punishing any corporation that establishes a lawless ethos which overcomes its employees’ propensity to obey the law.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">FRANK</span>, J. On April 5, 2010, Guidant, LLC (“Guidant”) entered pleas of guilty on two misdemeanor counts charged by the Government in the Information. [F]or the reasons set forth below, the Court declines to accept the Plea Agreement as currently drafted.</p>
<p id="76ec46e0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Guidant developed, manufactured, and sold implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which are medical devices implanted in a patient to treat abnormally fast heart rhythms that could result in sudden cardiac death. Two of Guidant’s ICD models had a defect that could cause short-circuiting, rendering the device nonfunctional. Guidant discovered and later fixed the defects, but did not notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the <span title="846" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-846">p. 846</span>time and manner required by law. Guidant agreed to a plea agreement with the Government whereby it would plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts: (1) making materially false and misleading statements on reports required to be filed with the FDA, and (2) failing to promptly notify the FDA of a medical device correction.]</p>
<p id="76ec46e1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In addition to the guilty pleas, the] Plea Agreement further provides that the parties “recommend jointly that the Court impose a sentence requiring Guidant to pay the United States a criminal fine of $253,962,251 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3571(d).” The Plea Agreement also provides that Guidant will agree to a “criminal forfeiture to the United States in the amount of $42,079,675” and a special assessment of $250 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3013. In the Plea Agreement, the parties jointly agreed not to include a provision that ordered restitution or probation. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec46e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to the alleged victims, Drs. Hauser and Maron urge the Court to reject any plea agreement that does not contain a probation provision:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec46e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Also at issue in this case is the safety of future generations of patients who receive medical devices. Manufacturers control the quality of their products. Manufacturers are the first to know when a medical device is dangerous or underperforming. Thus, it is in the best interest of patients, and society in general, for manufacturers to be liable for the safety and effectiveness of their products. To allow a repeat offender, like Guidant, to escape with a fine (that is entirely borne by the shareholders of Boston Scientific [which acquired Guidant]) does not hold the guilty parties fully accountable and inevitably undermines patient safety.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ec46e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is no dispute concerning the validity, in general, of placing a corporation on probation. The Court respectfully disagrees with the Government’s view that probation would be a waste of the taxpayers’ money, especially given that Guidant could be required, as a condition of probation, to reimburse the Government for any costs associated with its probation. The Court also disagrees with the Government’s position that Guidant’s current corporate structure renders any probation meaningless. . . . The interests of justice are not served by allowing a company to avoid probation simply by changing their corporate form. At a minimum, the public’s interest in accountability would be served by Guidant and Boston Scientific being placed on probation, regardless of the fact that Boston Scientific acquired Guidant after the events in question. And, the Court believes that a period of probation would likely benefit, rather than harm, Guidant’s and Boston Scientific’s public image. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec46e5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court believes that a term of probation would be appropriate in this case and could be fashioned in a manner to serve the public’s interest and address the accountability concerns raised by Drs. Hauser and Maron and likely shared by many others. For instance, as a condition of probation, Guidant, through Boston Scientific, could be ordered to perform community service designed to repair the harm caused by its offenses, namely to help build the public’s confidence in the FDA regulation process, the medical device manufacturers’ quality control efforts, and the cardiac healthcare <span title="847" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-847">p. 847</span>industry in general. Indeed, Boston Scientific could be ordered, as a condition of probation and in addition to a criminal fine, to dedicate a certain amount of its resources to some of its already-established charitable programs. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec46e6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Guidant, through Boston Scientific, could also be required to establish a compliance and ethics program, or if one is already established, to dedicate additional resources to that program to address the specific crimes in this case. Such a program could be overseen by a compliance officer skilled in the regulatory area and who perhaps could work in coordination with either the FDA or the Heart Rhythm Society, or both. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec46e7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As Guidant alluded to at the plea hearing, sophisticated medical devices, such as the ones at issue in this case, generally have a very high rate of reliability and provide life-saving benefits to many people. Advances in medical technology have, unfortunately, inflated the public’s expectations so much so that when any device fails, many assume that there must have been a crime committed or that someone is at fault. This is not necessarily always the case. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ec46e8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">IT IS ORDERED that . . . [t]he Court declines to accept the Plea Agreement.</p>

<i>1. Fines.</i> The most obvious possible sanction for a corporation, and one at issue in <i>Guidant</i>, is a criminal fine. Fines, however, present the dilemma of their spillover effects on innocent shareholders, creditors, employees, and consumers, which can lead sentencing judges to refuse to impose substantial fines even in cases of serious corporate wrongdoing. Coffee, supra, at 400-402, 405-407. Weak fines, however, do not provide sufficient deterrence; when the anticipated fine is less than the expected benefit to the corporation from criminal wrongdoing, it will be cheaper to pay the fine than to refrain from crime. Ilene H. Nagel &amp; Winthrop M. Swenson, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Corporations: Their Development, Theoretical Underpinnings, and Some Thoughts About Their Future, 71 Wash. U. L.Q. 205, 215 (1993). Moreover, even when substantial fines are in fact imposed, they will not sufficiently deter employees whose personal interests do not align with the organization’s interests. Thus, such individuals may commit crimes even though the crimes will prove extremely costly to the organization. See Richard Gruner, To Let the Punishment Fit the Organization: Sanctioning Corporate Offenders Through Corporate Probation, 16 Am. J. Crim. L. 1, 5 (1988).</p>
<p id="76ec46ec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Compliance programs.</i> Because of the shortcomings of fines, the government has sought to change corporation behavior through other means. A central approach has been the creation of carrots and sticks for corporations to adopt compliance and ethics programs, another option discussed in <i>Guidant.</i>
</p>
<p id="76ec46ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Federal Sentencing Guidelines take the carrot approach, offering sentencing reductions for companies that have such programs. The commentary to Chapter Eight of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (“Sentencing of Organizations”) explains:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec6cfe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="848" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-848">p. 848</span>These guidelines offer incentives to organizations to reduce and ultimately eliminate criminal conduct by providing a structural foundation from which an organization may self-police its own conduct through an effective compliance and ethics program. The prevention and detection of criminal conduct, as facilitated by an effective compliance and ethics program, will assist an organization in encouraging ethical conduct and in complying fully with all applicable laws.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ec6cff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More specifically, under the Guidelines, a convicted corporation is entitled to a significant deduction from its culpability score, “if the offense occurred even though the organization had in place at the time of the offense an effective compliance and ethics program,” provided that the organization reported all detected violations within a reasonable time after becoming aware of them. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §8.C2.5(f) (2005). Moreover, the Guidelines provide for “probation” for corporations in certain cases, and one condition of probation may be that the organization “develop and submit to the court an effective compliance and ethics program.” Id. §8.D1.4(c). The Guidelines explain that an effective program should demonstrate “the exercise of due diligence to prevent and detect criminal conduct” and “promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and commitment to compliance with the law.” Id. §8.B2.l. The Guidelines further specify that these general exhortations entail establishing standards and procedures to prevent and detect crime; educating the board of directors, employees, and agents about the compliance and ethics program; assigning specific high-level individuals responsibility for the programs; evaluating the program periodically; and creating a well-publicized, confidential mechanism for internal reporting of potential criminal conduct. If criminal conduct is detected, the organization should respond appropriately and take steps to prevent further criminal conduct. Id.</p>
<p id="76ec6d00-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Department of Justice seeks to encourage compliance programs by using the stick of a threatened indictment. The Department takes into account whether an organization has a compliance program in deciding whether to file criminal charges. U.S. Attorneys’ Manual §9-28.300(A). In 2015, the Department of Justice created the position of Compliance Counsel to help prosecutors determine whether company compliance programs are effective or “mere window dressing.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN122EB_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N122EB_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">18</a></span> Thus, although the “corporate ethos” model of corporate criminal liability has not been formally adopted as a matter of substantive law, it has made substantial inroads in sentencing law and prosecutorial practice.</p>
<p id="76ec6d02-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The increasing reliance on corporate compliance programs in federal sentencing has received mixed reviews. For a theoretical defense of “composite liability regimes” such as the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (which base liability on the doctrine of respondeat superior, but allow mitigation of punishment for compliance efforts), see Jennifer Arlen &amp; Reinier Kraakman, <span title="849" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-849">p. 849</span>Controlling Corporate Misconduct: An Analysis of Corporate Liability Regimes, 72 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 687 (1997). Jennifer Arlen has gone on to criticize the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as they currently operate for failing to provide sufficient mitigation to entice companies to adopt compliance programs, to self-report, and to cooperate. Arlen, The Failure of the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines, 66 U. Miami L. Rev. 321 (2012). For another skeptical view, see Frank O. Bowman, III, Drifting Down the Dnieper with Prince Potemkin: Some Skeptical Reflections About the Place of Compliance Programs in Federal Criminal Sentencing, 39 Wake Forest L. Rev. 671 (2004). For a defense of these Sentencing Guidelines provisions, see Diana E. Murphy, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations: A Decade of Promoting Compliance and Ethics, 87 Iowa L. Rev. 697 (2002).</p>

<i>3. Regulation Through DPAs and NPAs.</i> As noted above (see supra p. 835), prosecutors are increasingly opting not to charge corporations criminally and instead to negotiate agreements to change company practices. Although the precise terms of these agreements vary, prosecutors often demand that companies adopt compliance programs policed by independent monitors, pay fines and restitution, cooperate with investigations against employees, make personnel changes, and alter business practices. See Brandon L. Garrett, Structural Reform Prosecution, 93 Va. L. Rev. 853, 894-901 (2007). Many NPAs and DPAs go quite far into the operation of companies, requiring companies to eliminate lawful lines of business, fire corporate officers, or make other dramatic shifts in operation, including changing fee structures or imposing disclosure obligations where none exist under law. Prosecutors in the Boardroom: Using Criminal Law to Regulate Corporate Conduct 3 (Anthony S. Barkow &amp; Rachel E. Barkow eds., 2011). NPAs and DPAs have the benefit of avoiding the collateral consequences of conviction while forcing the company to change its practices. The Department of Justice explains their value as follows (U.S. Attorneys’ Manual §9-28.1000):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec6d04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such agreements are a third option, besides a criminal indictment, on the one hand, and a declination, on the other. Declining prosecution may allow a corporate criminal to escape without consequences. Obtaining a conviction may produce a result that seriously harms innocent third parties who played no role in the criminal conduct. Under appropriate circumstances, a deferred prosecution or non-prosecution agreement can help restore the integrity of a company’s operations and preserve the financial viability of a corporation that engaged in criminal conduct, while preserving the government’s ability to prosecute a recalcitrant corporation that materially breaches the agreement.</p>

<p id="76ec6d05-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">Some critics think the demands made on companies are too great, while others, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, view DPAs and NPAs as “get-out-of-jail-free cards for the biggest corporations in the world.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12310_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12310_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">19</a></span> They <span title="850" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-850">p. 850</span>point to cases such as the one against the bank HSBC, which laundered money for drug traffickers and banks linked to terrorist organizations. Despite ample evidence of the bank’s culpability, prosecutors instead opted for a DPA because of a worry that criminal charges could destabilize the global financial system.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1231E_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1231E_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span>

<i>Questions:</i> What information would you need to determine which of these competing views is correct? Does it matter what evidence the government has against the companies, which might affect the odds of winning at trial? Is it relevant what conditions are required by the DPAs and NPAs as compared to the punishment that would likely be imposed after a conviction? To the extent the critics are correct that prosecutors have too much leverage when negotiating DPAs and NPAs, such that the terms are likely to be excessively harsh or disruptive, is that phenomenon unique to corporate prosecutions? See Chapter 10, infra for a general discussion of prosecutorial discretion. For analysis of the use of prosecutorial discretion to obtain DPAs and NPAs and proposed reforms to the practice, see Prosecutors in the Boardroom, supra; Brandon L. Garrett, Too Big to Jail: How Prosecutors Compromise with Corporations (2014). For an examination of how the current practice of using NPAs and DPAs comports with optimal deterrence, see Jennifer Arlen, Economic Analysis of Corporate Criminal Liability: Theory and Evidence, in Research Handbook on the Economics of Criminal Law 144 (Keith Hylton &amp; Alon Harel eds., 2012).</p>
<p id="76ec6d09-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Putting aside whether the terms of specific agreements are too harsh or too lenient, are prosecutors well positioned to regulate business practices and decide which officers should stay or go? Is it appropriate for prosecutors to use the threat of criminal liability to get corporations to change the way they operate, when the operation of the business itself is not a crime?</p>
<p id="76ec6d0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The role of judicial review.</i> Some judges have sought to play a greater role in overseeing the agreements that prosecutors reach with corporations. Some have followed Judge Frank’s approach in <i>Guidant</i> and have refused to accept the plea agreement. See, e.g., United States v. Orthofix, Inc., 956 F. Supp. 2d 316, 337 (D. Mass. 2013) (“[T]he court will not place the imprimatur of the judiciary on bargain-basement justice” or “accept pleas that mandate the imposition of paltry sentences lest they turn the normative edifice of criminal justice into a Bergsonian theater of the absurd.”). Other judges have pursued different avenues for greater judicial oversight. For example, when the government and the corporation agree to a DPA, they often need the court to approve their joint motion for exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act because the period of the agreement would otherwise extend past the point when the government could proceed. Thus, to allow the government to assess the defendant’s compliance with the agreement over its entire period and not lose its ability to bring charges, the parties request an exception from <span title="851" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-851">p. 851</span>the Speedy Trial Act. When a district judge in Washington, D.C. rejected such a motion because of his view that the DPA itself was too “anemic[]” in addressing what he believed to be “egregious conduct,” the parties appealed. United States v. Fokker Services, B.V., 79 F. Supp. 3d 160, 167 (D.D.C. 2015). The D.C. Circuit reversed, observing:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec6d0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While the exclusion of time is subject to “the approval of the court,” there is no ground for reading that provision to confer free-ranging authority in district courts to scrutinize the prosecution’s discretionary charging decisions. Rather, we read the statute against the background of settled constitutional understandings under which authority over criminal charging decisions resides fundamentally with the Executive, without the involvement of—and without oversight power in—the Judiciary.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ec6d0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para   epub-continue-para">United States v. Fokker Services, B.V., 818 F.3d 733, 741 (D.C. Cir. 2016). The D.C. Circuit did not decide, however, whether a court would have authority to reject a DPA because it contained illegal or unethical provisions, because the district court did not make such a determination in <i>Fokker</i>. Id. at 747. Other courts have suggested that district courts should have such authority and have scrutinized the terms of a DPA before approving it. See, e.g., United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 2013 WL 3306161, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2013) (“[I]t is easy to imagine circumstances in which a deferred prosecution agreement, or the implementation of such an agreement, so transgresses the bounds of lawfulness or propriety as to warrant judicial intervention to protect the integrity of the Court.”). Should there be a greater role for judicial oversight? Is judicial involvement consistent with a prosecutor’s traditional charging authority?</p>
<p id="76ec6d0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. The corporate death penalty.</i> In the wake of Arthur Andersen’s collapse after indictment and conviction, the prospect of criminal charges “killing” a company has loomed large in the debate over corporate criminal liability. The data show that the overwhelming majority of companies survive criminal charges. Gabriel Markoff, Arthur Andersen and the Myth of the Corporate Death Penalty: Corporate Criminal Convictions in the Twenty-First Century, 15 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 797, 836 (2013). But some companies will not survive, because either they rely on government contracts and their conviction means disqualification, or they lose a necessary license or permit, or the adverse publicity is just too much of a reputational hit. See Beale, A Response to the Critics, supra, at 1501-1503. One of the reasons that HSBC was not indicted and instead received a DPA is a concern that formal charges would be a “death sentence” for the bank.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12353_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12353_12a1c299-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">21</a></span> Assuming that some companies are at risk for failure after a conviction, should that fact drive prosecutorial charging decisions? In the case of individual liability, collateral consequences (such as to family members) are not ordinarily considered. Why <span title="852" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-852">p. 852</span>are the collateral consequences to corporations given greater significance than those that affect individuals facing criminal liability?</p>

<p id="76ec9423-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Personal liability of corporate officers and agents has not been much affected by the conceptual concerns that hindered development of criminal liability of the corporate entity. One argument against criminal liability was that corporate agents should not be criminally liable for their actions when they acted for the corporation in a representative capacity. But this argument never drew much support in the case law. See 3A W. Fletcher, Encyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations §1348, at 630 (1975). The prevailing view is reflected in §2.07(6) of the MPC:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ec9424-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(a) A person is legally accountable for any conduct he performs or causes to be performed in the name of the corporation or an unincorporated association or in its behalf to the same extent as if it were performed in his own name or behalf.</p>

<p id="76ec9426-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A major problem in seeking to impose criminal liability on individual corporate actors derives from the bureaucratic arrangement of corporate activities, with lower employees responsible to higher-level employees in a hierarchy leading up to the highest officers. This arrangement often makes it difficult to fasten liability upon the upper-echelon employees and officers under the prevailing standards of accomplice liability requiring intentional aiding or encouraging criminal conduct of another, for these doctrines are designed for personal rather than bureaucratic relationships. The doctrine of vicarious liability would be one solution, but its use entails potential unfairness and injustice. The materials that follow explore these problems.</p>

Section 601 provided that any person who “willfully” violated its provisions or any <span title="853" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-853">p. 853</span>regulation or order issued thereunder should upon conviction be punished as therein specified. The case was not submitted to the jury on the question whether the partners had actual notice of the transactions. Instead, it was tried and submitted on the theory that knowledge of one partner regarding the transactions was “imputable, attributable and chargeable” to the other and that the knowledge and acts of the salespeople who made the sales and kept the records while acting in the course of their employment were imputable and chargeable to the employing partners. On the “very perplexing question whether the partners can be held criminally responsible for the knowledge and acts of their agents and employees, who the evidence shows, while acting in the course of their employment, actually made the sales without having collected the required down payment,” the court, per Murrah, J., answered in the affirmative, stating:]</p><p id="76ec942c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Deeply rooted in our criminal jurisprudence is the notion that criminal guilt is personal to the accused; that wilfulness or a guilty mind is an essential ingredient of a punishable offense, and that one cannot intend an act in which he did not consciously participate, acquiesce, or have guilty knowledge. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246.</p><p id="76ec942d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Amenable to this notion, the courts have been reluctant to hold the master or the employer criminally responsible for the acts of his agent or employee which he did not authorize, counsel, advise, approve or ratify.</p><p id="76ec942e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is only in the so-called public welfare offenses usually involving police regulation of food, drink and drugs that the courts have relaxed the necessity for proof of a wilful intent.</p><p id="76ec942f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our case wilfulness is specifically made a prerequisite to guilt. Indeed it is the gist of the offenses charged in all of the counts in the information. And the trial court instructed the jury that in every crime or public offense there must be a “union or joint operation of act and intent” but “that the intent or intention is manifest by the circumstances connected with the offense as well as by direct testimony.”</p><p id="76ec9430-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What the court did in effect was to make wilfulness an essential element of the offenses charged in the information, and to charge the employers with the guilty knowledge and acts of the employees in determining the question of willfulness. . . . 
</p><p id="76ecbb41-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The effect of this is not to dispense with wilfulness or guilty knowledge as an element of the offense. It is to charge the employer with knowledge of records he is required to keep and acts he is required or forbidden to do, and which he necessarily keeps, does or omits to do by and through his agents and employees. To be sure, the knowledge with which he is charged is not direct; it is constructive. If it be called vicarious responsibility, it is nevertheless a responsibility of him on whom the law places the duty. It is permissible proof of a wilfulness which in its proper context denotes more than mere negligence but less than bad purpose or evil motive. It connotes a course of conduct which may be construed by the triers of facts as deliberate and voluntary, hence intentional; or it may be construed as negligent, inadvertent and excusable. The act or omission itself is not inexorably penalized. The <span title="854" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-854">p. 854</span>ultimate question of guilt is left to the ameliorating influence of those who sit in judgment.

<span class="epub-small-caps">HUXMAN</span>, J. dissenting: . . . The partners denied intent to violate the law or any knowledge that their employees were violating it. They were entitled to have their testimony weighed and evaluated under proper instructions by the court together with all other relevant evidence. They were entitled to have the jury told that they were not criminally liable for the acts of their employees, although committed within the scope of their employment, unless they directed such activities or had guilty knowledge thereof. It is a principle embedded in the English law from time immemorial that the sins of the father shall not be visited upon the son merely because the father is the agent of the son and his unlawful acts were committed within the scope of his employment, under a criminal statute making wilfulness an element of the offense when the son had no knowledge of or part in such violations.</p><p id="76ecbb43-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Strong reliance is placed upon Inland Freight Lines v. United States, 191 F.2d 313, by this court. But that case is clearly distinguishable. There the sole defendant was the corporation charged with keeping false records and it was held that the knowledge of its agents was the knowledge of the corporation. That is the well-established principle of criminal law as applied in the case of a corporation. It is, as the law recognizes, the only way a corporation can be held criminally responsible for violations of penal statutes. While a corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity, such separate entity is a pure fiction of the law. As a separate entity and aside from its agents and employees a corporation can do nothing. It has no conscience, will, or power of thought. It acts only through its agents. Their acts are the only acts it can commit and their knowledge of necessity is the only knowledge it can have.</p><p id="76ecbb44-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The only cases in which a principal without actual intent or knowledge of criminal acts of wrong-doing by his employees has been held criminally responsible for such acts arose under welfare statutes such as the Pure Food and Drug Laws, Liquor Laws and Weight and Measure Acts. But under all of these acts where a principal was held guilty because of the acts of his agents without knowledge or intent on his part wilfulness was not an element of the offense and the statute made the doing of the act the offense.</p></div>

Its headquarters, including the office of the president, respondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, Pa. [T]he Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. [T]he information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been shipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore warehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to rodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the food’s being adulterated within the meaning of [the statute].</p><p id="76ece260-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Acme pleaded guilty. . . . Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at trial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by letter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar conditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning evidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of the Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the warehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been improvement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building and in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.”</p><p id="76ece261-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

</p><p id="76ece268-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Respondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a sense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for certain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, in turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for sanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice president for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating the situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the corrective action to reply to the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] could have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.”</p><p id="76ece269-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to the public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company.” . . .

</p><p id="76ece271-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. That court viewed the Government as arguing “that the conviction may be predicated solely upon a showing that [respondent] was the President of the offending corporation,” and it stated that as “a general proposition, some act of commission or omission is an essential element of every crime.” It reasoned that, although our decision in United States v. Dotterweich had construed the statutory provisions under which respondent was tried to dispense with the traditional element of “ ‘awareness of some wrongdoing,’ ” the Court had not construed them as dispensing with the element of “wrongful action.” The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial judge’s instructions “might well have left the jury with the erroneous impression that Park could be found guilty in the absence of ‘wrongful action’ on his part,” and that proof of this element was required by due process. It . . . directed that on retrial the jury be instructed as to “wrongful action,” which might be “gross negligence and inattention in discharging . . . corporate duties and obligations or any of a host of other acts of commission or omission which would ‘cause’ the contamination of food.” . . . 
</p><p id="76ece272-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The question presented by the Government’s petition for certiorari in <i>United States v. Dotterweich</i> [supra p. 304 this casebook] . . . was whether “the manager of a corporation, as well as the corporation itself, may be prosecuted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 for the introduction of misbranded and adulterated articles into interstate commerce.” . . . 
</p><p id="76ece273-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In . . . reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court looked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of <span title="858" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-858">p. 858</span>people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection.”</p><p id="76ece274-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Central to the Court’s conclusion that individuals other than proprietors are subject to the criminal provisions of the Act was the reality that “the only way in which a corporation can act is through the individuals who act on its behalf.” . . . 
</p><p id="76ed0985-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time, however, the Court was aware of the concern which was the motivating factor in the Court of Appeals’ decision, that literal enforcement “might operate too harshly by sweeping within its condemnation any person however remotely entangled in the proscribed shipment.” A limiting principle, in the form of “settled doctrines of criminal law” defining those who “are responsible for the commission of a misdemeanor,” was available. In this context, the Court concluded, those doctrines dictated that the offense was committed “by all who . . . have . . . a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws.”</p><p id="76ed0986-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court recognized that, because the Act dispenses with the need to prove “consciousness of wrongdoing,” it may result in hardship even as applied to those who share “responsibility in the business process resulting in” a violation. It regarded as “too treacherous” an attempt “to define or even to indicate by way of illustration the class of employees which stands in such a responsible relation.” The question of responsibility, the Court said, depends “on the evidence produced at the trial and its submission—assuming the evidence warrants it—to the jury under appropriate guidance.” The Court added: “In such matters the good sense of prosecutors, the wise guidance of trial judges, and the ultimate judgment must be trusted.” . . . 
</p><p id="76ed0987-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Dotterweich</i> and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and touch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to a single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy violations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that violations will not occur. The requirements of foresight and vigilance imposed on responsible corporate agents are beyond question demanding, and perhaps onerous, but they are no more stringent than the public has a right to expect of those who voluntarily assume positions of authority in business enterprises whose services and products affect the health and well-being of the public that supports them. . . . 
</p><p id="76ed0988-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Act does not, as we observed in <i>Dotterweich</i>, make criminal liability turn on “awareness of some wrongdoing” or “conscious fraud.” The duty imposed by Congress on responsible corporate agents is, we emphasize, one that requires the highest standard of foresight and vigilance, but the Act, in its criminal aspect, does not require that which is objectively impossible. The theory upon which responsible corporate agents are held criminally accountable for “causing” violations of the Act permits a claim that a defendant was “powerless” to prevent or correct the violation to “be raised defensively at a trial on the merits.” United States v. Wiesenfeld Warehouse Co., 376 U.S. 86, 91 (1964). If such a claim is made, the defendant has the burden of coming <span title="859" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-859">p. 859</span>forward with evidence, but this does not alter the Government’s ultimate burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant’s guilt, including his power, in light of the duty imposed by the Act, to prevent or correct the prohibited condition. . . . 
</p><p id="76ed0989-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot agree [that it was necessary to] instruct the jury that the Government had the burden of establishing “wrongful action” in the sense in which the Court of Appeals used that phrase. The concept of a “reasonable relationship” to, or a “reasonable share” in, a violation of the Act indeed imports some measure of blameworthiness; but it is equally clear that the Government establishes a prima facie case when it introduces evidence sufficient to warrant a finding by the trier of the facts that the defendant had, by reason of his position in the corporation, responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct, the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so. . . . 
</p><p id="76ed098a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reading the entire charge satisfies us that the jury’s attention was adequately focused on the issue of respondent’s authority with respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations. Viewed as a whole, the charge did not permit the jury to find guilt solely on the basis of respondent’s position in the corporation. . . .

A jury may then draw the inference that when the food is found to be in such condition as to violate the statute’s prohibitions, that condition was “caused” by a breach of the standard of care imposed upon the responsible official.

Park, by virtue of his position in the company, had a position of authority and responsibility in the situation out of which these charges arose.” Requiring, as it did, a verdict of guilty upon a finding of “responsibility,” this instruction standing alone could have been construed as a direction to convict if the jury found Park “responsible” for the <span title="860" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-860">p. 860</span>condition in the sense that his position as chief executive officer gave him formal responsibility within the structure of the corporation. But the trial judge went on specifically to caution the jury not to attach such a meaning to his instruction, saying that “the fact that the Defendant is pres[id]ent and is a chief executive officer of the Acme Markets does not require a finding of guilt.” “Responsibility” as used by the trial judge therefore had whatever meaning the jury in its unguided discretion chose to give it.</p><p id="76ed0991-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The instructions, therefore, expressed nothing more than a tautology.

<i>1. Vicarious liability?</i> Reconsider the <i>Guminga</i> case, supra p. 313. Guminga’s objection was to the kind of vicarious liability exemplified in the tort doctrine of respondeat superior; namely, where the liability of <i>A</i> for the acts of <i>B</i> is based solely on some relationship between them rather than on any culpable conduct of <i>A.</i> Are Park and Dotterweich being held liable for <i>their own</i> misconduct, or are they being held liable for the misconduct of others?

<p id="76ed30a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under the “responsible corporate officer” doctrine as described in [<i>Dotterweich</i> and <i>Park</i>], a corporate official can be convicted of a misdemeanor under the FDCA if he or she had a “responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws, namely, to put into the stream of interstate commerce adulterated or misbranded drugs.” <i>Dotterweich</i>, 320 U.S. at 284. Although the doctrine “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal conduct—awareness of some wrongdoing,” id. at 281, liability under the FDCA remains subject to a “limiting principle,” namely that the defendant had the “power . . . to prevent or correct the prohibited condition” but failed to do so. <i>Park</i>, 421 U.S. at 669. Corporate officials are thus subject to prosecution under the doctrine <i>only</i> if they stand in some “responsible relationship” to a specific violation of the Act, meaning that their “failure to exercise the authority and supervisory responsibility reposed in them by the business organization resulted in the violation complained of.” Id. at 671. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ed30a7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As made clear by the Supreme Court, it is simply not the case that a defendant can be convicted of a misdemeanor under the responsible corporate officer doctrine based solely on his position within the corporate hierarchy. Rather, to establish a prima facie case, the government must introduce evidence demonstrating that “the defendant had, by reason of his position <span title="861" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-861">p. 861</span>in the corporation, responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct, the violation complained of, and that he failed to do so.” <i>Park</i>, 421 U.S. at 673-74. A defendant’s position within a company is certainly relevant, but it is no more than one link in the causal chain to establish liability. Indeed, the Court went to great lengths in <i>Park</i> to clarify that the trial court’s instructions (which the Court affirmed) did <i>not</i> permit the jury to convict the defendant based solely on his position as President and CEO of the company, as such instructions would have been legally erroneous.</p>

<i>2. The responsible corporate officer doctrine and the powerless defendant.</i> Although a defendant can raise as a defense that the “defendant was ‘powerless’ to prevent or correct the violation,” federal courts have been slow to recognize situations in which it was “objectively impossible” to avoid the harm. See United States v. Gel Spice Co., 773 F.2d 427 (2d Cir. 1985). The court in United States v. New England Grocers Supply Co., 488 F. Supp. 230 (D. Mass. 1980), addressed the difficulty in “ascertain[ing] from [<i>Park</i>] the exact nature and scope of the impossibility defense”:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ed30aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One interpretation . . . is that it relates only to the power of the corporate officer, by virtue of his position in the corporation, to correct or prevent violations of the Act. Under this interpretation, the evidence introduced by the defendant at trial to sustain his impossibility defense would serve only to rebut the evidence introduced by the government in establishing its prima facie case. [T]he impossibility defense would not serve as an affirmative defense, but would merely provide corporate officers a defense open to all who are criminally accused, that is, rebuttal of the government’s proof.</p>
<p id="76ed30ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An alternative interpretation of the impossibility defense is that it is satisfied by evidence that the corporate officer exercised “extraordinary care” and was still unable to prevent violations. Under this interpretation, the impossibility defense would serve as an affirmative defense, incorporating an objective element—use of extraordinary care—into a strict liability offense.</p>
<p id="76ed30ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In light of the severe penalties which may be imposed for a second violation under the Act, I am inclined to adopt [the latter] more lenient position of the impossibility defense.</p>

<i>3. Severity of penalties.</i> In <i>Park</i>, the responsible corporate officer doctrine led to the defendant’s conviction, but only a minor penalty (several fines of $50) was imposed. Most public welfare offenses are misdemeanor offenses that carry neither serious stigma nor substantial punishment. Should the responsible corporate officer doctrine be applied equally to crimes that impose a <span title="862" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-862">p. 862</span>more significant punishment, such as imprisonment? A district court in Iowa rejected a due process challenge to a sentence of up to one year of imprisonment under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the owner and chief operating officer of a company that shipped and sold eggs contaminated with salmonella, after they had been convicted under a strict liability theory. United States v. Quality Egg, LLC, 99 F. Supp. 3d 920, 958 (N.D. Iowa 2015).</p>
<p id="76ed30af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could even longer sentences be permissible if the statute also requires mens rea?

<span class="epub-small-caps">CAMPBELL</span>, C.J. [MacDonald &amp; Watson Waste Oil Co., a corporation engaged in the business of transporting and disposing of contaminated wastes, operated a disposal facility at the Poe Street Lot, a facility leased from the Narragansett Improvement Company (NIC). Neither MacDonald nor NIC held a permit authorizing them to dispose of solid hazardous wastes in that site, although NIC did have a permit to dispose of <i>liquid</i> wastes there.</p>
<p id="76ed57c5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[MacDonald was hired to remove solid waste (toluene-contaminated soil) from the grounds of the Master Chemical Company. An employee of MacDonald supervised the transportation of the contaminated soil from Master Chemical to the Poe Street Lot. Subsequently, Eugene K. D’Allesandro, president of MacDonald, was convicted of knowingly transporting and causing the transportation of hazardous waste to a facility that did not have a permit, in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), §3008(d)(1). The company was also convicted, but discussion of its liability is omitted.]</p>
<p id="76ed57c6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">D’Allesandro . . . contends that his conviction . . . must be vacated because the district court incorrectly charged the jury regarding the element of knowledge in the case of a corporate officer. Section 3008(d)(1) penalizes “Any person who . . . (1) knowingly transports or causes to be transported any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter . . . to a facility which does not have a permit. . . . ” In his closing, the prosecutor conceded that the government had “no direct evidence that Eugene D’Allesandro actually knew that the Master Chemical shipments were coming in,” i.e., were being transported to the Poe Street Lot under contract with his company. The prosecution did present evidence, however, that D’Allesandro was not only the President and owner of MacDonald &amp; Watson but was a “hands-on” manager of that relatively small firm. There was also proof that . . . D’Allesandro’s subordinates had contracted for and transported the Master Chemical <span title="863" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-863">p. 863</span>waste for disposal at [the Poe Street] site. The government argued that D’Allesandro was guilty of violating §3008(d)(1) because, as the responsible corporate officer, he was in a position to ensure compliance with RCRA and had failed to do so even after being warned by a consultant on two earlier occasions that other shipments of toluene-contaminated soil had been received from other customers, and that such material violated NIC’s permit. In the government’s view, any failure to prove D’Allesandro’s actual knowledge of the Master Chemical contract and shipments was irrelevant to his criminal responsibility under §3008(d)(1) for those shipments.</p>
<p id="76ed57c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court apparently accepted the government’s theory. It instructed the jury as follows:</p>

The first way is to demonstrate that the defendant had actual knowledge of the act in question.

In order to prove that a person is a responsible corporate officer three things must be shown.</p>
<p id="76ed57c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, it must be shown that the person is an officer of the corporation, not merely an employee.</p>

<i>1. RCRA, mens rea, and the responsible corporate officer doctrine.</i> RCRA imposes liability on any person who “knowingly transports . . . any hazardous waste . . . to a facility which does not have a permit.” Why were the jury instructions insufficient to satisfy the requirements of RCRA? Note that the judge explicitly told the jury it must find that the “officer must have known or believed that the illegal activity of the type alleged occurred.” Why was this instruction not equivalent to proof of knowledge?

<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ed7ee5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[A] number of former U.S. attorneys say [the] Justice [Department] subscribes to the view that holding high-level executives criminally liable will often bring changes in the behavior of their companies. Prosecutors and regulators at the state and local levels seem to agree. Apparently, so do legislators, who have incorporated criminal penalties into an increasing number of regulatory statutes, such as the federal clean air and water acts, aimed at carrying out public policy priorities. Typically, those provisions make the highest-ranking official involved in a particular company activity the ultimately responsible party, even where that person’s direct participation in the violation cannot be shown.</p>

The court rejected the defendant’s argument that he was being held vicariously liable for the negligence of the backhoe operators, pointing out that the trial court did in fact instruct the jury that the discharge must have been “caused by the negligence of the particular defendant,” presumably Hanousek’s negligence in failing to protect the pipeline adequately.</p>

Is liability for a negligent failure to act significantly more troubling than liability for negligent action? For a defense of the responsible corporate officer doctrine, see Amy J.

<i>3. Expanding the responsibilities of corporate officers after</i> Enron. What environmental crime was to the 1990s, the Enron scandal became to the first decade of the twenty-first century. The massive fraud allegedly perpetrated by Enron’s corporate officers and the catastrophic collapse of Enron Corporation (and other corporate scandals) generated widespread concern about whether criminal law offered adequate tools to prosecute and thus deter financial fraud. In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, H.R. 3763, 107th Congress, 116 Stat. 745, 807 (2002). The Act did not alter the fundamental structure of criminal liability for either corporate officers or corporations. Rather, the Act’s changes were more in the nature of gap-filling: It created several new obstruction-of-justice offenses; increased maximum penalties for existing crimes; and imposed new obligations on chief executive officers and chief financial officers to personally certify the accuracy of their companies’ financial statements, subject to severe criminal penalties for false certifications. These certification provisions make it more difficult for CEOs and CFOs responsible for their firms’ accounting practices to later try to claim that they were unaware of the relevant accounting facts when they are charged with issuing misleading financial reports.</p>

There is uncertainty about what, if any, crimes were committed, and few criminal cases were brought. In response to arguments that more cases were not brought because it would have been too difficult to prove fraudulent intent, Judge Jed Rakoff has argued that a theory of willful blindness should have been pursued. Jed S. Rakoff, The Financial Crisis: Why Have No High-Level Executives Been Prosecuted?, N.Y. Rev. Books, Jan. 9, 2014. Judge Rakoff also criticized the trend over the past few decades to focus on prosecuting companies without indicting individuals: “I suggest that the future deterrent value of successfully prosecuting individuals far outweighs the prophylactic benefits of imposing internal compliance measures that are often little more than window-dressing.” Does Judge Rakoff take adequately into account the difficulties of bringing actions against individuals even under a willful blindness theory? Even if Judge Rakoff believes those actions could have been brought, does the fact that prosecutors themselves thought the cases too difficult to prove suggest that laws should be modified to make those prosecutions easier? Or would such an approach pose too great a threat that individuals could face criminal charges without sufficient moral culpability?</p>

<i>4. Pursuing other theories of criminal liability against officers.</i> Statutes like the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act facilitate bringing charges against corporate officers because no mens rea is required, but they raise concerns about imposing liability in the absence of fault. In contrast, statutes like the one at issue in <i>MacDonald &amp; Watson Waste Oil</i> may make it too difficult to bring charges. Prosecutors turned to conspiracy law as another option in the wake of a 2010 mining explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia that left 29 coal miners dead. After getting the company to pay more than $200 million in fines that included investments in safety improvements, the Department of Justice also pursued criminal charges against the CEO of the coal company, Donald L. Blankenship. Their theory was that he was part of a conspiracy to ignore safety standards that threatened the company’s profits. Although jurors acquitted him of more serious charges related to the theory, he was convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to a year in prison. Prosecutors lauded the result for being the first time a high-level executive faced prison time for workplace safety violations. Alan Blinder, Mine Chief Is Sentenced in Conspiracy over Safety, N.Y. Times, Apr. 7, 2016, at A12. Is the use of conspiracy laws likely to be a fruitful avenue in other cases, or will the need to show an agreement to violate the law likely be a difficult task in most cases? <span title="867" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-867">p. 867</span>Similarly, even if an agreement could be established, would it be hard for prosecutors in most cases to show that corporate officers had the intent to violate the law because they had a stake in the venture? Assuming this is a viable threat in other cases, is the one-year sentence likely to act as a sufficient deterrent? Or should a greater emphasis instead be placed on improving the underlying regulatory framework for industries? For a view that more robust regulatory efforts should be the focus, see Chase Madar, The Real Crime Is What’s Not Done, N.Y. Times, Aug. 24, 2016, at A19. For an argument that criminal law will remain important even with more robust civil regulations, using the recent fraud perpetrated by VW as an example, see Robert H. Tillman &amp; Henry N.

<p class="cc-font-small cc-wrapper epub-footnote-text" id="76e7d93b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e">At trial in the instant case, the government’s attorney argued that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability for Agent Rios’s murder properly could be imposed on all of the conspirators, and expressed the view that prosecutorial discretion would protect truly “minor” participants, such as appellants Rios and Raymond, from liability for the far more serious crimes committed by their coconspirators. We do not find this argument persuasive. In our view, the liability of such “minor” participants must rest on a more substantial foundation than the mere whim of the prosecutor.</p>

Our holding is limited to conspirators who played more than a “minor” role in the conspiracy, or who had actual knowledge of at least some of the circumstances and events culminating in the reasonably foreseeable but originally unintended substantive crime.</p>
