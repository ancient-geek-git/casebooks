<i>1. An overview</i>. American criminal justice has produced the largest penal system in the world. More than 2.3 million people are incarcerated in the United States, a situation that is “historically unprecedented and internationally unique.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1003C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1003C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> The current incarceration rate of 716 per 100,000 is five times what it was in 1972, and America, with less than 5 percent of the world’s population, has almost 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. “The U.S. rate of incarceration . . . is 5 to 10 times higher than rates in Western Europe and other democracies.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10046_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10046_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> Moreover, an additional one out of every 36 people in the United States is under some other form of criminal justice supervision (such as probation or parole).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1004E_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1004E_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">3</a></span> In some states, the rates are even higher.

So while the mark of a criminal conviction was unusual throughout most of American history, today it is commonplace.</p>

<i>3. Causes.</i> How did the criminal justice landscape change so dramatically in the few short decades since the early 1970s? One instinct may be to assume that the fault lies not in our laws or institutions but instead in our high volume of serious crime. Yet the relationship between crime rates and incarceration rates does not follow a clear pattern. Indeed, crime rates declined steeply throughout the 1990s and stabilized in the early 2000s at “the lowest levels recorded” since the Justice Department started conducting surveys 1973.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100E2_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100E2_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">14</a></span> Some researchers argue that mass incarceration is primarily a result of the prevalence of increasingly high <i>rates</i> of arrest for known crimes, more punitive attitudes in American culture that are reflected in longer sentences, and more aggressive policies in the enforcement of our drug laws.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100F1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">15</a></span> The National Research Council concludes:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN100F9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N100F9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">16</a></span>

<p id="765e1060-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The best single proximate explanation of the rise in incarceration is not rising crime rates, but the policy choices made by legislators to greatly increase the use of imprisonment as a response to crime. [These choices] contributed not only to overall high rates of incarceration, but also especially to extraordinary rates of incarceration in black and Latino communities. Intensified enforcement of drug laws subjected blacks, more than whites, to new mandatory minimum sentences—despite lower levels of drug use and no higher demonstrated levels of trafficking among the black than the white population. Blacks had long been more likely than whites to be arrested for violence. But [changes in sentencing policies, such as three-strikes laws and the elimination of or restrictions on parole] have likely increased sentences and time served for blacks more than whites. As a consequence, the absolute disparities in incarceration increased, and imprisonment became common for young minority men, particularly those with little schooling. [A]n increasingly punitive political climate surrounding criminal justice policy . . . provided the context for a series of policy choices—across all branches and levels of government—that significantly increased sentence lengths, required prison time for minor offenses, and intensified punishment for drug crimes.</p>

<i>4. Consequences: public safety and social welfare.</i> Criminal law has traditionally been society’s primary mechanism for protecting the safety and security of individuals and the community. But many now worry that the deployment of criminal sanctions, especially imprisonment, has expanded far beyond what’s needed to serve those purposes. As we explore in more detail in Chapter 2, there is at most only a small incremental deterrent effect from adding more time to already-long prison sentences—for example through “three strikes” and mandatory minimum sentences. And because <span title="4" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-4">p. 4</span>the risk of recidivism declines sharply as prisoners age, using long prison sentences for incapacitation makes sense only when those sentences can be reserved for exceptionally dangerous offenders or those who can be identified in advance as very likely to re-offend. Moreover, long sentences can themselves become criminogenic because it is more difficult for those released from prison after long periods of time to successfully reenter society.</p>

<i>5. Implications for the substantive criminal law.</i> Behavior like murder, rape, burglary, and theft remains all too common, and any well-ordered society will respond to such conduct with criminal sanctions. But do our written laws sweep too broadly? Do we fail to account for economic and structural deprivation in assessing blame and/or punishment? More narrowly drafted offenses and greater allowance for justifications or excuses offer ways to restrain the reach of criminal law. The appropriate role for criminal sanctions in maintaining social order and promoting social welfare is thus a bedrock question for criminal justice and for public policy generally, one we examine throughout this book.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10151_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10151_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span> But even when violent behavior, interference with property rights, and dealing in hard drugs are properly defined as crimes, the punitive impact of the system still depends crucially on policy choices embedded in substantive criminal law, especially the extent to which the law affords discretion and how that discretion is exercised—whether the right crime was charged and whether the right sentence was imposed. These topics are taken up systematically in Chapter 10.</p>

<i>6. Questions.</i> Do the preceding concerns suggest a strong presumption in favor of lenity—that we should resolve close questions by narrowing the reach of criminal statutes, reducing punishments, and granting officials greater discretion to treat potentially criminal conduct more leniently? Given the broad consensus that America is too quick to resort to criminal law solutions and that we have far too many people in prison, a clear preference for lenity might seem the right way to frame our thinking about problems throughout the criminal law. But matters are not so simple. There are also many situations where the criminal justice system fails to do enough. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, few individuals were prosecuted, leading many to question why prosecutors failed to pursue criminal cases. See Brandon L. Garrett, Too Big to Jail (2014); Jed S. Rakoff, The Financial Crisis: Why Have No High-Level Executives Been Prosecuted?, N.Y. Rev. Books, Jan. 9, 2014. Many lament what they see as unjustified impunity for police officers and civilians who use deadly force against unarmed African-American youth. <span title="6" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-6">p. 6</span>See Aya Gruber, Leniency as a Miscarriage of Race and Gender Justice, 76 Alb. L. Rev. 1571 (2013). Critics often argue that inner-city minority neighborhoods receive <i>too little</i> police protection and that sexual assault and domestic violence laws are woefully <i>undere</i>nforced. See Chapters 3.B, 4.A, and 8.B.2, infra.

This type of underenforcement deprives residents of personal and economic security, rendering calls to the police futile or even dangerous and victimhood a routine fact of life.</p>
<p id="765eacb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Overenforcement and underenforcement] are typically juxtaposed as a conundrum, particularly in poor, high-crime communities of color: How can a community be simultaneously over-policed and under-policed? [Yet] underenforcement is not necessarily an alternative to overenforcement but often its corollary. Over- and underenforcement are twin symptoms of a deeper democratic weakness of the criminal system: its non-responsiveness to the needs of the poor, racial minorities, and the otherwise politically vulnerable. Because of this weakness, justice and lawfulness are distributed unevenly and unequally across racial and class lines, crime remains rampant in some <span title="7" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-7">p. 7</span>communities but not others, and some people can trust and rely on law enforcement while others cannot. Official disregard of crime is part of this dynamic, as are mass imprisonment, excessive sentences, and racially skewed enforcement practices. . . .

<p id="765eacb2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Underenforcement encompasses a broad spectrum of state behavior, not all of which is pernicious.

<i>Questions</i>: Is criminal law predestined to reinforce these social inequalities? Or are there reliable ways to identify the situations in which enforcement needs to be strengthened, not restrained, without creating a risk that the carceral state will balloon even more and further aggravate racial disparities? The challenge is to ensure that stronger enforcement tools—when needed—are deployed fairly, and not just in favor of individuals and groups that are already advantaged. Can criminal law address these issues meaningfully on its own, or are they inextricably embedded in broader social policies, from educational and employment opportunities to affordable housing, urban design, and access to medical services and mental health care? Consider how the criminal justice dimension of these issues can best be addressed in the context of the material in the next section and throughout this book.</p>

<p id="765efad8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Separate from the preceding <i>substantive</i> questions—whether and how much to rely on criminal law—is the issue of <i>who</i> should make the controlling decision in any given case. Even if our substantive criminal laws make sense in the abstract, they must be applied in the real world, by real—and inevitably fallible—people. It thus becomes critical to understand these institutional actors and the constraints under which they operate.</p>
<p id="765efad9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">First, the agencies of criminal justice must deal with what is, by any measure, a <i>high volume of cases.</i> As a result, although the mission of the criminal process is to deliver carefully individualized justice, in practice “the process is in fact one of mass production.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101E0_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N101E0_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span> Second, the agencies of criminal justice face a <i>chronic shortage of resources and personnel.</i> The interaction of these two factors, heavy volume and restricted resources, multiplies the pressures for a mass-production approach and mandates a high degree of selectivity in choosing the individuals who will be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced at the highest available levels.</p>
<p id="765efadb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="8" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-8">p. 8</span>Third, that selection process operates through the exercise of broad, largely unguided and largely uncontrolled <i>discretion.</i> Within police departments, decisions about what crimes to target and which individuals to arrest are often left to the personal judgment of the police officer on the beat. Within the prosecutor’s office, charging decisions are often left to the personal judgment of the assistant district attorney assigned to the case, subject to guidance and review that is extensive in some offices but virtually nonexistent in others. The result can be wide variation in the criminal justice treatment of similarly situated offenders and outcomes determined by many considerations extraneous to the formal criteria of the law on the books.</p>
<p id="765efadc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Fourth, public opinion often affects the way this discretion is exercised; criminal law in the United States is highly <i>politicized</i>. In most jurisdictions, the head prosecutor and the judges are chosen by popular election. For at least four decades, criminal law has been a high-profile political issue and anyone running for office—whether as a prosecutor, judge, legislator, mayor, governor, or president—has taken pains to avoid the label of being soft on crime. These pressures accordingly influence their decisions (legitimately or otherwise). For example, there is evidence that judges impose harsher sentences the closer they are to their reelection.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN101FB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N101FB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">23</a></span> Elected prosecutors will also consider voter reactions in deciding which crimes to prioritize and what sentences to pursue. The United States is distinctive in this regard:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10203_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10203_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">24</a></span>

<p id="765f21ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compared with the criminal justice systems of many other developed countries, the U.S. system is more susceptible to the influence of “short-term emotionalism” and partisan and interest group politics. . . . Because of the nation’s system of frequent legislative elections, dispersed governmental powers, and election of judges and prosecutors, policy makers tend to be susceptible to public alarms about crime and drugs and vulnerable to pressures from the public and political opponents to quickly enact tough legislation. [Prosecutors and judges] are typically mindful of the political environment in which they function. . . . In contrast, prosecutors and judges in many European countries are career civil servants who have evolved a distinctive occupational culture with a less punitive orientation, partly as a result of differences in legal training and career paths between the United States and European countries.</p>

<p id="765f21f0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With these dynamics in mind, consider the structures of criminal justice administration described in the following Notes and how the incentives of individuals charged with particular roles affect the ways that criminal law actually operates in practice.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1021A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1021A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">25</a></span>

<i>1. Multiple jurisdictions.</i> References to our criminal justice “system” are in some ways a misnomer. America has no single criminal justice “system.” There are some 40,000 independent police departments, roughly one for every city and town in the nation. More than 3,000 counties have elected sheriffs in charge of their police departments, but most urban police departments are led by chiefs of police who are typically appointed by a mayor, who in turn is elected by the voters of the <i>municipality.</i> The chief prosecutor typically is not appointed by or responsible to the mayor. The prosecutor is usually an independent elected official; she may or may not represent the same political party as the mayor. Either way, she may be a political rival, and in most instances, she is elected by the voters of the <i>county</i>, a constituency that may be larger (as in the Chicago area) or smaller (as in New York City) than the constituency that elects the mayor. Judges are often elected on a countywide basis, but sometimes they are appointed by the governor of the <i>state.</i> The agencies responsible for punishment and corrections are similarly fractured. Probation services and jails are typically run and paid for by the county, but prisons and parole systems are run and paid for by the state.</p>
<p id="765f4903-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In practice, criminal justice authority is even more dispersed and decentralized than this oversimplified picture suggests. State governments have their own police forces (state troopers), many cities have independent police agencies with specialized missions (transit police, housing police), and most cities and states have independent prosecuting authorities with specialized mandates (a city department for municipal code enforcement, a state attorney general’s office).</p>
<p id="765f4904-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Alongside all of this, and entirely independent of it, is the powerful engine of <i>federal</i> law enforcement. The federal process (again, it would be an exaggeration to call it a “system”) has its own complement of prosecutors (U.S. Attorneys appointed by the President and centrally supervised, to a degree, by the Department of Justice), independent judges (appointed for life terms by the President, on the advice and consent of the Senate), and correctional authorities (the U.S. Probation Service, responsible to the courts, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, within the Department of Justice). For its police force, the federal government of course has the FBI, responsible to the Department of Justice, but that is not all: Also of great importance are the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), also in the Department of Justice; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in the Treasury Department; the bureaus of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Department of Homeland Security; and the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for certain white-collar offenses—to name only a few.</p>

<span title="10" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-10">p. 10</span>The criminal justice system, in short, is extremely <i>decentralized.</i> Many view the uncoordinated, overlapping, and conflicting responsibilities of its various agencies as inefficient and even irrational. Others view the same chaotic arrangement as a valuable mechanism for preventing the accumulation and centralization of power, with its accompanying dangers of abuse. Either way, extreme decentralization is and will remain a dominant fact of life in American criminal justice. As a Presidential Commission stated in 1967:<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1024C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1024C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">26</a></span>

<p id="765f7017-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What most significantly distinguishes the system of one country from that of another is the extent and the form of the protections it offers individuals in the process of determining guilt and imposing punishment. Our system of justice deliberately sacrifices much in efficiency and even in effectiveness in order to preserve local autonomy and to protect the individual.</p>
</div>
<p id="765f7018-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That said, the agencies and institutions of criminal justice are highly interdependent. Police, prosecutors, courts, and correctional agencies inevitably interact. The results of police effort—suspects arrested—are passed on to prosecutors for the filing of charges, those charged move into the judicial system for adjudication, and those convicted and sentenced become the responsibility of probation services, jails, and prisons. For these reasons, efforts to address problems in one of these agencies are likely to fail if they do not take into account the repercussions of reform on all the others.</p>
<p id="765f7019-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The police.</i> To an important extent, crimes are defined, in practice, by the police officer on the beat. Because officers cannot possibly arrest all the offenders they encounter, they must decide which scuffles warrant an arrest for assault. They must decide when a juvenile responsible for vandalism should be arrested rather than merely warned or taken home to his parents. Sometimes the police chief or precinct captain sets guidelines. More often, the decision is made <i>ad hoc</i> by the individual officer. It may or may not be the same as the decisions made in similar circumstances by other officers or even by the same officer at other times.</p>
<p id="765f701a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Prosecutors.</i> The decision whether there is sufficient evidence to send a case to trial is initially made by the prosecutor. Although that judgment must be approved by a judge at a preliminary hearing or by a grand jury, these steps are largely formalities, because of the low level of proof required at those stages. The grand jury and the preliminary-hearing judge almost always ratify the prosecutor’s decision. As a result, the prosecutor wields enormous power, deciding whether to press charges or drop a case, whether to file the most serious charges or lesser offenses, and whether to reduce the charges after they are filed.</p>
<p id="765f701b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Yet many prosecutors serve only part-time, while conducting a private law practice on the side. And whether full-time or part-time, prosecutors generally are elected on a partisan political basis and serve for relatively short terms. Often the position serves as a stepping-stone to higher political office. Only the federal government and four states (Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey) <span title="11" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-11">p. 11</span>choose their chief prosecutors by appointment. The system of choosing chief prosecutors by popular election (rather than by professional training and advancement) is a distinctively American practice, virtually unknown elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p id="765f972c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Large cities always have a chief prosecutor employed full-time and a large staff of full-time assistants, but 15 percent of American jurisdictions do not have a full-time chief prosecutor, and a majority of prosecutors’ offices only employ three or fewer full-time assistant prosecutors.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1027A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1027A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">27</a></span>

<i>4. Defense counsel.</i> Only about 20 percent of criminal defendants have the means to hire their own lawyers, so the kind of defense representation commonly seen in civil litigation is the exception on the criminal side. Five distinct criminal-defense systems are in use—two for defendants who can afford to retain counsel and three for those who cannot.</p>
<p id="765f972f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Non-indigent defendants.</i> In the approach most analogous to representation in major tort and contract suits, a defendant of substantial means retains a highly experienced attorney (or team of attorneys), agreeing to compensate them on an hourly basis or paying up front a substantial retainer (often in the range of $100,000 or more). This approach is often used in white-collar and political-corruption cases, but overall it is the rare exception, even for the minority of defendants who can afford to retain counsel at all.</p>
<p id="765f9730-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Far more common for these non-indigent defendants is a second system, in which a person with limited financial resources retains an attorney by paying in advance a modest fee (a few hundred or a few thousand dollars) that will constitute the lawyer’s sole compensation. Because rules of court typically prevent a retained attorney from withdrawing from a case once an appearance is entered, the lawyer’s compensation under this approach remains identical, regardless of whether the defendant quickly accepts a guilty plea offer, prefers to negotiate at length, or seeks to present an elaborate defense at trial. Attorneys who defend cases under this arrangement must manage their ethical obligation to provide vigorous representation along with their personal need to avoid strategies that require large amounts of uncompensated time.</p>
<p id="765f9731-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Indigent defendants.</i> The three systems in common use for indigent defendants share one common characteristic: All of them deny the defendant any say in choosing his or her counsel. Under each system a judge, court administrator, or some other official makes the choice, and the indigent defendant must either accept the lawyer who has been selected or agree to proceed without professional assistance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1029B_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1029B_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">28</a></span>
</p>
<p id="765fbe43-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="12" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-12">p. 12</span>One common approach is the <i>appointed counsel system</i>: A judge or court official selects defense counsel from a list of attorneys in private practice. The system of conscripting these lawyers to serve “pro bono,” without compensation, still exists in a few jurisdictions but is now rare. Instead, appointed attorneys typically are compensated at a fixed hourly rate up to a predetermined maximum. The maximum usually is higher for felonies than for misdemeanors, but it usually is not higher for complex cases that go to trial than for simple cases that plead out quickly.</p>
<p id="765fbe44-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a second approach, the <i>contract system</i>, a lawyer or group of lawyers in private practice agree that over the course of a year, in return for a substantial retainer paid by the government, they will represent a specified number of indigent criminal defendants along with their own paying clients. Again, the attorney’s compensation for the indigent defense side of her work remains independent of the time and effort spent on the representation.</p>
<p id="765fbe45-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, in the <i>defender system</i>, often used in the larger cities, an agency funded by the city, county, or state (sometimes with partial support from private sources) represents most or all criminal defendants in the jurisdiction. Its staff attorneys are paid an annual salary and usually serve full-time. As a result, they are not under personal financial pressure to control the time spent on individual cases, and many defender offices are organized to permit a team of attorneys, social workers, and investigators to work intensively on felony jury trials and other high-stakes cases. Many defender offices, however, are characterized by high caseloads and strong pressures for staff attorneys to budget their time carefully.</p>
<p id="765fbe46-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Judges.</i> The mechanism for selecting judges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and some states use different methods of selection for appellate judges than for lower court judges. In 21 states, appellate judges are chosen by popular election. In 29 states, appellate judges are initially appointed either by the governor or the legislature; in 16 of these states, appellate judges must run for election after serving their first term. Only 22 states appoint lower court judges and 10 states require that they be elected for subsequent terms.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102C1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">29</a></span> Thus, in the great majority of states, judges must stand for election at some point. In some states, a nonpartisan screening committee identifies well-qualified candidates, but that safeguard of competence and quality is not in widespread use, nor is it always effective in jurisdictions where it exists. Political party influence and, more recently, expensive television advertising are widely used in the effort to achieve electoral success. These ads increasingly focus on judges’ records in criminal cases, with 56 percent of the ads in 2013-2014 focused on criminal law.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102C9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102C9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">30</a></span> Among Western democracies, the United States is virtually unique in selecting its judges predominantly by popular election.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102D5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102D5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">31</a></span>

These courts process the overwhelming majority of offenses and offenders, yet they are chronically understaffed. In many jurisdictions, judges in the lower courts must handle a hundred cases or more in a single day. Observers report that speed becomes more important than care, and casual out-of-court bargains are often substituted for adjudication.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102E3_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102E3_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">32</a></span> In 2008, American courts achieved an average of 991 criminal case dispositions per judge. Federal judges have, on average, only 102 criminal cases per year,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102EB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102EB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">33</a></span> but the average number of felony case filings per judge in a single year (1995) was 487 in Los Angeles, 516 in San Francisco, and 776 in Denver.</p>
<p id="76600c6d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>6. Corrections.</i> Although it remains customary to identify the agency responsible for a state’s prison system as the “Department of Corrections,” incarceration no longer aims primarily to “correct” (i.e., rehabilitate) offenders. Punishment itself and incapacitation have become the system’s principal purposes.</p>
<p id="76600c6e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One result of the emphasis on incapacitation is that there is little interest in, or resources for, creative programs to treat or educate offenders. This is true not only of individuals in prison but also of people on probation and parole. While probationers and parolees need varying degrees of assistance and supervision, most experts agree that an average of no more than 35 cases per officer is necessary to give convicted offenders sufficient attention and support. Yet probation supervision caseloads now average about 117 offenders per officer.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN102FE_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N102FE_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">34</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76600c70-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In addition to these obstacles to successful rehabilitation, convicted individuals typically encounter difficulty obtaining housing and lawful employment when they reenter free society. Even if charges do not lead to imprisonment, the encounter with the criminal justice system can have devastating consequences. This problem has always existed to some extent, but it is becoming increasingly common and severe, because statutory restrictions on obtaining occupational licenses, educational assistance, and other public benefits and necessities have proliferated. Technological advances allow would-be employers, landlords, and any other interested member of the public to obtain a wealth of information about the more than 25 percent of the U.S. adult population with a criminal record.

<p id="76603283-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The breadth of official discretion becomes even clearer when we consider the criminal justice process in greater detail. At virtually every step along the way, some official can exercise discretion to drop or divert a case. And even when a case is pursued, there is broad discretion to determine how it should be handled. As Kenneth Culp Davis has observed, “the power to be lenient is the power to discriminate,”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1031F_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1031F_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">35</a></span> so disparities in criminal justice outcomes are often a byproduct of accumulated acts of discretion throughout the process. Yet without discretion, criminal law might have even harsher impact than it does at present and might suffer disparities from <i>too little</i> individualization: Discrimination occurs not only when like cases are not treated alike but also when dissimilar cases <i>are</i> treated alike. Striking the right balance between equal treatment and individualization is a dilemma throughout the substantive criminal law and its administration.</p>

<p id="76605997-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Overview.</i> A common impression of the criminal justice process is that when a crime is committed, a policeman finds the perpetrator, if possible, arrests him, and brings him promptly before a magistrate. If the offense is minor, the magistrate disposes of it on the spot. If the offense is serious, the magistrate retains the case for further action and releases the defendant on bail. Next, again according to the theory, the file goes to a prosecutor, who charges the defendant with a specific offense. The charge is reviewed at a preliminary hearing, where a judge determines whether there is a prima facie case sufficient to hold the defendant for trial, and in some jurisdictions, if the offense is a felony, the charges must be presented to a grand jury, which determines whether to issue an indictment. If the defendant pleads “not guilty,” the case goes to trial, and witnesses called by the opposing attorneys describe the facts to a jury. If the jury finds the defendant guilty, the judge sentences him to probation, jail (a local facility for sentences under one year), or prison (for offenders serving longer terms).</p>
<p id="76605998-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some cases do proceed in that fashion, especially when they involve acts of violence or thefts of large amounts of money. But not all major cases follow this route. And in any event, the great majority of criminal offenses are far less serious—petty thefts, disorderly conduct, simple assaults, and the like. These relatively minor cases and many of the more serious ones are disposed of in informal and sometimes haphazard fashion.</p>
<p id="76605999-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The initial stages of a case. (a) Investigation.</i> Unless an arrest has been made at the scene, police must attempt to identify the perpetrator, and in all cases they must assemble sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a <span title="15" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-15">p. 15</span>reasonable doubt. Most large police departments have a corps of detectives who question victims, suspects, and witnesses; seek physical evidence at the crime scene; and undertake other investigative work. Often, however, the crime simply is not solvable. In most cases, personal identification by a victim or witness is the only clue to the perpetrator’s identity. FBI statistics for 2014 indicate that of the violent crimes (murder, aggravated assault, forcible rape, and robbery) reported or otherwise known to the police, only 47 percent were cleared by an arrest. Of the serious property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other larceny-theft), only 20 percent of offenses known to the police were cleared, and for cities with a population of more than 1 million, only 15 percent of serious property offenses were cleared.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10350_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10350_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">36</a></span>
</p>
<p id="766080ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Dismissal and diversion.</i> In roughly half of the cases initiated by an arrest, the case is eventually dismissed at an early stage, either by the police, a prosecutor, or a magistrate. Some suspects avoid prosecution because they are not guilty, or cannot be proved guilty, either because they did not commit the acts in question or because they have a legally acceptable explanation for committing them. Often, however, offenders who could be convicted are released simply because police or prosecutors are too busy to pursue their cases. In other instances, police or prosecutors decline to proceed because an offender appears to have mental, emotional, or social problems that can be better dealt with by official agencies, private organizations, or individuals outside the criminal justice process. First offenders are often dealt with in this way, as are those who commit minor offenses such as shoplifting (if restitution has been made), statutory rape (when both parties are young), and automobile theft (when committed by teenagers solely for the purpose of joyriding).</p>
<p id="766080ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In many jurisdictions, these dismissals sometimes have a more formal character. The defendant may be placed in a “pretrial diversion” program that requires him to meet certain conditions (such as attending a drug or alcohol treatment program or an anger management class) and to avoid re-arrest for a designated period, usually a year. Defendants who complete such a program successfully then qualify to have all charges formally dismissed; those who fail the program have their cases reopened.</p>
<p id="766080ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Pretrial release.</i> Most arrestees brought into a magistrate’s court are released (or convicted and sentenced) within 24 hours of their arrest. The remainder may wait weeks or months for the disposition of their cases, depending on the prosecutor’s workload, the complexity of the case, and the calendar of the judge assigned to hear it. Usually, the magistrate who conducts this initial proceeding decides whether to release the defendant pending further proceedings. Traditionally, the device most often used to free an untried defendant and at the same time assure his or her appearance <span title="16" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-16">p. 16</span>for trial was money bail. In this system, still in use in many areas, the court fixes the amount of a bond to be posted in cash or by a secured pledge; defendants able to post the required amount win their release and recover the sum upon appearance for trial. Defendants unable to raise the required amount usually attempt to secure the services of a bail-bond agency, which posts the necessary bond in return for a fixed fee, typically 10 percent of the total bail. In this system, the bondsman’s obligations are satisfied upon the defendant’s appearance, but the 10 percent charge has to be paid by the defendant in any event. Some jurisdictions have tried to eliminate the need for a bail-bond agency by allowing the defendant to post 10 percent of the face amount of the bail bond directly with the court, and most or all of that sum is refundable when the defendant appears for trial. But even small amounts can prove to be too much for many poor defendants. In New York City, for example, only 21 percent of arrestees in 2010 were able to make bail for amounts less than $500.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10370_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10370_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">37</a></span>
</p>
<p id="766080af-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The money bail system is unsatisfactory in many respects. It results in confinement of large numbers of untried defendants, solely on account of inability to raise the required amounts. A recent White House brief notes that all too often it results in “detaining the poorest rather than the most dangerous defendants before trial.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10380_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10380_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">38</a></span> And in many localities, the relationships between bail-bond agencies and court officials have been a source of malfeasance and corruption.</p>
<p id="7660a7c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">During the 1960s and 1970s, bail-reform projects were initiated in numerous cities around the country. The principal aims of these projects were to ascertain the kinds of community ties that would make defendants safe candidates for release without financial guarantees, to establish procedures for expeditiously collecting the information necessary to identify these defendants, and to develop a better system of financial guarantees for defendants who could not qualify for release on any other basis. Pretrial release projects are now operational in more than 100 cities. They help the local magistrates to identify defendants who can be released without money bail and often follow up with the defendant to help ensure that he or she returns for any scheduled appearances. Nevertheless, traditional money bail survives in many localities as the primary avenue of pretrial release.</p>
<p id="7660a7c2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. §§1341-1350, expressly authorizes preventive detention prior to trial in federal criminal prosecutions, on a finding that “no condition or conditions [of release] will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant] as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” §3142(e). The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of these preventive detention provisions in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987). Partly as a result, pretrial detention in the federal courts has <span title="17" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-17">p. 17</span>been rising sharply since the 1990s. In 1996, 34 percent of federal defendants were detained prior to trial, but for cases filed during 2012, 77 percent of the defendants were detained until their trials.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10392_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10392_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span> And at least one study suggests that blacks and Hispanics are much more likely to be detained than white defendants facing similar charges.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1039A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1039A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">40</a></span> Detention rates in state court remain significant, but have not increased substantially since the reforms of the 1970s; in 2006, 42 percent of the felony defendants in large urban counties were detained prior to trial. Again, there are disturbing indications that minority defendants must meet higher bail and are more likely to be detained than similarly situated whites.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103A2_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N103A2_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">41</a></span>

<p id="7660ced6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The guilty plea.</i> Most convictions—more than 90 percent in most jurisdictions—are not the result of adjudications at trial but of guilty pleas, often obtained by negotiation over the charge or the sentence.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103B1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N103B1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">42</a></span> A plea negotiation can involve lengthy conferences in which the relevant facts and applicable legal defenses are explored in detail. More often, however, the guilty plea discussion involves little more than a hurried conversation in a courthouse hallway or even a prosecutor’s quick “take it or leave it” offer to defense counsel. In some courts, there are no explicit negotiations at all, but most defendants plead guilty nonetheless, usually in the expectation that their plea will win them some leniency from the sentencing judge. The guilty plea, a crucially important feature of the American criminal justice system, is considered briefly in Section D, The Process for Determining Guilt, infra, and explored in more detail in Chapter 10, Discretion, infra. Prosecutorial charging decisions (and the sentencing consequences that follow) are a main driver—if not <i>the</i> main driver of mass incarceration—and in a world of guilty pleas and few trials, that means the plea stage is the critical point in the process, a stage where prosecutors are the actors in charge.</p>
<p id="7660ced8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. The trial.</i> Cases decided at trial are a small fraction of the total. In one study, 96 percent of the cases filed were resolved by guilty plea, dismissal, or pretrial diversion; only 4 percent of the defendants went to trial, and only 1 percent <span title="18" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-18">p. 18</span>were acquitted.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103C5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N103C5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">43</a></span> In 2012, 97 percent of the cases filed in federal district courts were resolved by guilty plea, dismissal, or pretrial diversion, only 3 percent of the defendants went to trial, and only 0.5 percent of them were acquitted.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN103CD_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N103CD_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> But the exceptional, fully adjudicated cases establish standards that influence much of what happens in matters that never reach the trial stage. The legal rules that define crimes and defenses, the effectiveness of prosecutors, the attitudes of judges, and the conviction propensities of juries all have an impact (<i>how much</i> of an impact is an important, much debated question) on decisions whether to arrest, charge, dismiss, divert before trial, and bargain over a plea.</p>
<p id="7660f5eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Sentencing.</i> Although the adjudication of guilt in contested cases is an elaborately formal procedure, the determination of punishment for convicted offenders is much less formal, and it can even be exceedingly informal. We examine the sentencing process in depth in Chapter 10, infra.</p>

<p id="76611d04-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Does the guilty plea system produce results different from those that would occur at trial? To be more specific, does it convict defendants who are in fact innocent (<i>and</i> would be acquitted) or convict defendants who committed the offense but could not be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at trial? Does the plea negotiation process produce convictions for offenses significantly different from the crimes a defendant may actually have committed? For the many observers who are inclined to give affirmative answers to these questions, the entire body of substantive criminal law may seem a supreme irrelevance; convictions obtained by guilty pleas are seen as the outcome of hurried horse-trading rather than the thoughtful application of complex legal principles to the known facts. What is the practical significance of substantive law in a world dominated by plea bargaining? Consider the following comments:</p>

Some, but by no means all, criminal cases fit this image. For example, this is a relatively accurate description of the issues at stake in a case in which the defendant asserts a defense of mistaken identity. . . . 
</p><p id="76619244-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But not all criminal cases fit the above picture. . . . Much criminal adjudication concerns the passing of value judgments on the accused’s conduct as is obvious where negligence, recklessness, reasonable apprehension of attack, use of unnecessary force, and the like are at issue. . . . In many of these cases, objective truth is more ambiguous, if it exists at all. Such truth exists only as it emerges from the fact-determining process, and accuracy in this context really means relative equality of results as between defendants similarly situated and relative congruence between the formal verdict and our understanding of society’s less formally expressed evaluation of such conduct.</p><p id="76619245-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The negotiated plea can, then, be an accurate process in this sense. So long as the judgment of experienced counsel as to the likely jury result is the key element entering into the bargain, substantial congruence is likely to result. Once we recognize that what lends rationality to the factfinding process in these instances lies not in an attempt to discover objective truth but in the devising of a process to express intelligent judgment, there is no inherent reason why plea negotiation need be regarded any the less rational or intelligent in its results.</p><p id="76619246-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Indeed, it may be that in some instances plea negotiation leads to more “intelligent” results. A jury can be left with the extreme alternatives of guilty of a crime of the highest degree or not guilty of any crime, with no room for any intermediate judgment. And this is likely to occur in just those cases where an intermediate judgment is the fairest and most “accurate” (or most congruent). . . . The low visibility of the negotiated plea allows this compromise which may be more rational and congruent than the result we are likely to arrive at after a trial. While the desire to protect the symbolism of legality and the concern over lay compromises may warrant limiting the jury to extreme alternative[s], it does not follow that to allow the defendant to choose such a compromise is an irrational or even a less rational procedure.</p></div>

[Yet] Specter’s argument is a forceful one. In the homicide area particularly, . . . the distinctions drawn by the criminal code . . . sometimes prove too fine for workable, everyday application.</p><p id="7661e070-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . If the perspective of these practitioners is sound, the best solution to the defects they perceive in the trial system does not lie in a shift from trial procedures to off-stage compromises. It lies instead in a simplification of the criminal code to reflect “everyday reality.” [But] it seems doubtful that plea negotiation can eliminate the irrationalities of the criminal code without substituting more serious irrationalities of its own. . . . Most barroom killings seem to end in bargained pleas to voluntary manslaughter; but some end in bargained pleas to second-degree murder; some end in bargained pleas to various categories of felonious assault; and I know of one barroom shooting that was resolved by a guilty plea to the crime of involuntary manslaughter, which, under the circumstances, seemed to be the last crime in the code of which the defendant might be guilty. It is therefore not clear that plea negotiation leads to greater uniformity of result than trial by jury.</p><p id="7661e071-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Juries, of course, have biases, but the rules of evidence attempt to direct their attention to relevant issues. There are no rules of evidence in plea negotiation; individual prosecutors may be influenced not only by a desire to smooth out the irrationalities of the criminal code but by thoroughly improper considerations that no serious reformer of the penal code would suggest. . . .  Juries may react differently to the circumstances of indistinguishable crimes, but at least they react to the circumstances of the crimes. A jury is unlikely to seek conviction for the sake of conviction, to respond to a defense attorney’s tactical pressures, to penalize a defendant because he has taken an inordinate share of the court’s and the prosecutor’s time, to do favors for particular defense attorneys in the hope of future cooperation, or to attempt to please victims and policemen for political reasons.</p></div>

<i>1. Conflicts of interest.</i> What sorts of “lawyers’ self-interest” could skew the bargaining process in the ways that Professor Bibas describes? Can you think of personal motivations that might (consciously or subconsciously) lead a defense attorney to advise her client to accept an unduly severe plea offer? Can you think of personal motivations that might lead a prosecutor to offer an overly lenient plea offer? Would it ever be in a defense attorney’s self-interest to recommend <i>rejection</i> of a favorable plea agreement?</p>

<i>2. Agency costs.</i> Where potential conflicts of interest exist, monitoring is essential; there must be some way to assure that attorneys act in the best interests of their clients—the accused in the case of the defense attorney and the general public in the case of the prosecutor. What factors make it difficult for some (or all) defendants to determine whether their attorney’s advice is influenced by the attorney’s personal interests? What factors make it difficult for the general public to determine whether the prosecutor’s actions are influenced by her personal interests?

<i>3. Implications for substantive criminal law.</i> Despite the distortions described by Alschuler and Bibas, there undoubtedly remains a degree of truth in the picture painted by Enker: At least to some extent, the substantive law and the expected outcome of a trial remain important elements (though not the only elements) in determining the outcome of plea negotiation. At this early point in the study of criminal law, it is premature to discuss plea bargaining in greater detail or to investigate possibilities for reform. We defer those issues to Chapter 10, where we consider the ways in which the modern administrative state uses prosecutorial discretion, plea bargaining, and sentencing practices to determine culpability and impose punishment outside the framework of the formal criminal trial.</p>
<p id="76622e9d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For present purposes, our concern is to set the stage for the study of substantive criminal law by asking whether its principles really make a difference in a world dominated by plea bargaining. On that question, there can be no doubt that criminal law matters, but it is not the only thing that matters. And we can expect the role of the substantive law to grow when cases are handled by sophisticated attorneys who know the doctrines of criminal law well enough to invoke them effectively in the course of bargaining.</p>

<i>NOTE ON FORMAL TRIAL PROCEDURE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="766255b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Sections B and C of this chapter described the organization of the criminal justice system and typical pretrial procedures. To introduce our examination of the trial stage itself, the present note briefly summarizes the typical course of a formal criminal trial. Naturally, the procedure followed in some jurisdictions or in particular cases may differ in points of detail from that set out in this preliminary overview.</p>
<p id="766255b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A formal trial typically begins with the selection of the jury. A panel of prospective jurors (called a <i>venire</i>) enters the courtroom, and the judge describes the nature of the case and the identity of the parties so that any prospective jurors who are personally involved may be excused. Prospective jurors are then questioned individually by the judge or by opposing counsel to determine possible bias. On the basis of this questioning (called <i>voir dire</i>) prospective jurors may be excused <i>for cause</i>, and both prosecution and defense may remove a certain number of the panel, without showing cause, by exercising <i>peremptory challenges.</i> When the requisite number of acceptable jurors (usually 12) has been obtained by this procedure, the panel is sworn.</p>
<p id="766255b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now the presentation of the case begins. Usually, the indictment is read to the jury; the prosecutor then makes an opening statement outlining the facts she plans to prove. Defense counsel also may make an opening statement. Claims made in these statements do not constitute <i>evidence</i>; they serve only to help the jury understand the testimony about to be presented. In many <span title="24" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-24">p. 24</span>jurisdictions, motions relating to the scope or validity of the indictment and motions to suppress evidence must be made prior to trial. In others, such motions can be made at the outset of the trial. If the judge grants a motion to dismiss the indictment, the case will terminate at this point. Otherwise the trial goes forward, although motions may be made or renewed as the trial proceeds.</p>
<p id="766255b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Next the prosecution calls its witnesses. Their testimony often evokes objections from counsel, and the judge must decide the bounds of permissible testimony under complex rules of evidence. We examine some of these rules in the sections to follow. When the prosecution has completed the presentation of its evidence, the defense may choose to stand on the <i>presumption of innocence</i> and move for a <i>directed verdict</i> or <i>judgment of acquittal</i> on the ground that the charges have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If such a motion is not made, or if the motion is made and denied, the defense may decide to offer its own evidence (through the defendant or other witnesses). The prosecution then will have an opportunity to present further evidence in rebuttal. When both sides have finished presenting their evidence, counsel may make closing arguments to the jury. Ordinarily, the prosecution’s closing argument is presented first (because it bears the burden of proof), and the prosecutor is usually allowed an opportunity for rebuttal after the closing argument of the defense.</p>
<p id="76627cc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At this point the work of the opposing parties has been completed. The judge now intercedes with her most important contribution—the <i>instructions to the jury.</i> Ordinarily, judicial comment on the evidence tends to be cautious and limited. Formal instructions on the law, however, are always given, and they are typically quite detailed. The instructions serve both as a guide for the jury’s deliberations and as a focal point for challenges on appeal in the event of a conviction. Usually, the instructions cover responsibilities of the jurors (for example, how to elect a foreperson, when to refrain from discussing the case with other jurors or outsiders), matters related to the relevance of particular kinds of testimony, and, above all, detailed explanations of the substantive criminal law applicable to the case, including the facts necessary to establish the offense and definitions of legal concepts that the jury is called on to apply.</p>
<p id="76627cc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury at last retires to deliberate. Its verdict of guilty or not guilty on each charge must be reached by a substantial majority (and usually by unanimity). After a verdict of guilty and the imposition of sentence (usually by the judge), the trial terminates. There may of course be an appeal. If it finds trial errors, the reviewing court may reverse the conviction and order another trial, since American double jeopardy principles generally do not bar the retrial of a defendant who has successfully appealed her conviction.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10576_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10576_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">45</a></span> A verdict of not guilty is not subject to review of any kind, even when flagrant errors <span title="25" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-25">p. 25</span>prejudicial to the prosecution occurred at trial.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10580_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10580_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">46</a></span> When the jury is unable to agree by the requisite majority on a verdict of either guilty or not guilty (a hung jury case), a <i>mistrial</i> is declared, and the defendant then may be retried at the prosecutor’s discretion.</p>
<p id="76627cc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Such, in rough outline, is the procedure by which guilt must be established when a criminal case is fully litigated through the formal trial stage. Further treatment of trial procedure lies beyond the province of this book. Nevertheless, a book devoted primarily to the substantive law should provide an introduction to the central features of the process of proof, in order to illuminate the context in which criminal law is applied and the ways in which the procedural system shapes the substantive content of the criminal law. The remaining sections of this chapter undertake such an exploration.</p>

<i>1. The order of proof.</i> At trial the evidence is presented in a formally prescribed order. The prosecution first calls witnesses in an effort to prove the elements of the offense charged. As we have seen, p. 24 supra, the case may terminate at this point if the prosecution fails to sustain its burden of proof. If not, the defense may then call witnesses to refute the prosecution’s <i>case-in-chief</i> or to establish some <i>affirmative defense.</i> The prosecution has an opportunity to recall witnesses or to call new witnesses for purposes of <i>rebuttal</i>, that is, to refute evidence offered by the defense. The defense in turn is afforded a chance to answer by <i>rejoinder</i> any matters introduced in the prosecutor’s rebuttal.</p>
<p id="7662a3de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Within these stages the examination of each witness follows a similar pattern. The witness is first questioned by the party that called the witness (<i>direct examination</i>), and afterward the opposing party has an opportunity to question that witness (<i>cross-examination</i>). Further questioning by the first party (<i>re-direct</i>) and by the opposing side (<i>re-cross</i>) may follow.</p>
<p id="7662caef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Relevance.</i> The rules governing the admissibility of evidence are extremely complex. For present purposes, it will be useful to begin by focusing on one obvious but deceptively simple requirement, the rule of relevancy. Irrelevant evidence is <i>never</i> admissible. The converse cannot be stated so categorically. Relevant evidence is <i>generally</i> admissible, but there are many exceptions to this principle. Before turning to the exceptions, we must first be clear about the meaning of <i>relevancy.</i>
</p>
<p id="7662caf0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="26" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-26">p. 26</span>Evidence is considered relevant for purposes of the rules of evidence only if it is both <i>probative</i> and <i>material</i>, and these are precise terms of art. Evidence is probative only if it tends to establish the proposition for which it is offered or—to be precise—if the proposition is more likely to be true given the evidence than it would be without the evidence. Thus, if the proposition to be proved is that <i>H</i> was the person who killed his wife <i>W</i>, evidence of a motive (that is, that <i>H</i> stood to inherit a substantial estate on <i>W</i>’s death) is probative. Of course, the existence of the motive does not, by itself, make it probable that <i>H</i> is the killer, but <i>H</i> is more likely to be the killer if he had a motive than if he did not; this greater likelihood is all that is required to establish probative value.</p>
<p id="7662caf1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Probative value alone is often thought of as synonymous with relevancy. But relevancy for purposes of the rules of evidence requires in addition that the proposition that the evidence tends to prove be one that will affect the outcome of the case under applicable law. So, for example, evidence in a homicide prosecution that the defendant acted in self-defense is material, because under the substantive law self-defense is a defense. But evidence that the deceased consented to be killed is not material, because under the substantive law consent by the victim is not a defense to a homicide charge. Thus, evidence may be excluded as irrelevant for one of two distinct reasons—either because the evidence does not tend to establish the proposition in question or because that proposition is not material to the outcome of the case. The materiality requirement means that the first prerequisite for determining the relevancy and hence the admissibility of evidence is a command of the substantive law of crimes.</p>
<p id="7662f202-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We may sum up what we have so far said about relevancy by quoting the formulation used in the Federal Rules of Evidence:</p>

<i>3. Privilege.</i> When is relevant evidence <i>not</i> admissible? The law of evidence embodies dozens of distinct rules requiring the exclusion of relevant evidence. For example, the various rules relating to <i>privilege</i> give individuals the right to withhold certain kinds of testimony, often in order to protect particular interests of a witness or specially important relationships with others.</p>
<p id="7662f208-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One of the most important privileges is the privilege against self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment provides: “[N]or shall [any person] be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” The Supreme Court has construed this provision to imply that the government cannot <span title="27" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-27">p. 27</span>require a criminal defendant to take the witness stand, cannot invite a jury to draw adverse inferences from a defendant’s refusal to testify, and cannot in any other way compel the defendant to disclose potentially incriminating facts about the case. These principles are of great significance for the substantive criminal law. They not only make the prosecutor’s task more difficult than it otherwise would be, but they pose an especially difficult barrier when the defendant’s own frame of mind is an essential part of what the prosecutor must prove. The privilege against self-incrimination places largely beyond the government’s reach the best (and sometimes the only) information about these elusive state-of-mind facts. As a result, substantive criminal law must constantly consider whether the government should be obliged to prove state-of-mind facts, and if so, what kinds of evidence will satisfy that obligation.</p>
<p id="76631919-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Other exclusionary rules: prejudice.</i> Like the rules of privilege, many other rules exclude relevant evidence. One of the best known is the rule barring the use of evidence obtained through an illegal search. Indeed, criminal lawyers often refer to this prohibition as <i>the</i> exclusionary rule, and it is a major topic of study in criminal procedure. We will consider some of the other exclusionary rules in connection with the substantive crimes for which they have the greatest significance.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10637_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10637_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">47</a></span> The balance of the present section is devoted to exploring one open-ended rule—the rule that evidence must be excluded whenever its probative value is outweighed by its <i>prejudicial effect.</i>
</p>
<p id="7663191b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term <i>prejudicial effect</i> has a technical meaning. To pursue the example previously mentioned, suppose that in <i>H</i>’s murder prosecution, testimony is offered that shortly before the discovery of <i>W</i>’s bullet-ridden body, <i>H</i> was seen running from the scene carrying a smoking revolver. This testimony will undoubtedly be harmful to <i>H</i>’s chances for acquittal, but it will not be prejudicial in the technical sense, because its harmfulness flows solely from its legitimate probative value. Evidence is considered prejudicial only when it is likely to affect the result in some <i>improper</i> way. Thus, prejudice is involved if the jury is likely to overestimate the probative value of the evidence or if the evidence will arouse undue hostility toward one of the parties.</p>
<p id="7663191c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The exclusionary rule relating to prejudicial effect is of pervasive importance in the substantive criminal law, and we will encounter it repeatedly in the chapters that follow. The principle of weighing probative value against prejudicial effect is particularly central to developing doctrines in such areas as rape-shield laws; the adequacy of victim provocation in homicide; battered spouse evidence; and testimony concerning intoxication, diminished capacity, and the insanity defense. As a foundation for the study of such topics throughout this book, the present section considers the problem of prejudicial effect in depth, in a context of recurring importance: evidence of other crimes.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">CARDOZO,</span> C.J. On November 10, 1929, shortly after midnight, the defendant in Kings County shot Frank Coppola and killed him without justification or excuse. A crime is admitted. What is doubtful is the degree only.</p><p id="76634034-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four young men, of whom Coppola was one, were at work repairing an automobile in a Brooklyn street. A woman, the defendant’s wife, walked by on the opposite side. One of the men spoke to her insultingly, or so at least she understood him. The defendant, who had dropped behind to buy a newspaper, came up to find his wife in tears. He was told she had been insulted, though she did not then repeat the words. Enraged, he stepped across the street and upbraided the offenders with words of coarse profanity. He informed them, so the survivors testify, that “if they did not get out of there in five minutes, he would come back and bump them all off.” Rejoining his wife, he walked with her to their apartment house located close at hand. He was heated with liquor which he had been drinking at a dance. Within the apartment he induced her to tell him what the insulting words had been. A youth had asked her to lie with him, and had offered her two dollars. With rage aroused again, the defendant went back to the scene of the insult and found the four young men still working at the car. In a statement to the police, he said that he had armed himself at the apartment with a twenty-five calibre automatic pistol. In his testimony at the trial he said that this pistol had been in his pocket all the evening. Words and blows followed, and then a shot. The defendant kicked Coppola in the stomach. There is evidence that Coppola went for him with a wrench. The pistol came from the pocket, and from the pistol a single shot, which did its deadly work. . . . 
</p><p id="76634035-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the trial the vital question was the defendant’s state of mind at the moment of the homicide. Did he shoot with a deliberate and premeditated design to kill? Was he so inflamed by drink or by anger or by both combined that, though he knew the nature of his act, he was the prey to sudden impulse, the fury of the fleeting moment?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10693_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10693_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> If he went forth from his apartment with a preconceived design to kill, how is it that he failed to shoot at once? How [can one] reconcile such a design with the drawing of the pistol later in the heat and <span title="29" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-29">p. 29</span>rage of an affray? These and like questions the jurors were to ask themselves and answer before measuring the defendant’s guilt. Answers consistent with guilt in its highest grade can reasonably be made. Even so, the line between impulse and deliberation is too narrow and elusive to make the answers wholly clear. The sphygmograph records with graphic certainty the fluctuations of the pulse. There is no instrument yet invented that records with equal certainty the fluctuations of the mind. . . . With only the rough and ready tests supplied by their experience of life, the jurors were to look into the workings of another’s mind, and discover its capacities and disabilities, its urges and inhibitions, in moments of intense excitement. Delicate enough and subtle is the inquiry, even in the most favorable conditions, with every warping influence excluded. There must be no blurring of the issues by evidence illegally admitted and carrying with it in its admission an appeal to prejudice and passion.</p><p id="76634037-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Evidence charged with that appeal was, we think, admitted here. . . . Almost at the opening of the trial the People began the endeavor to load the defendant down with the burden of an evil character. He was to be put before the jury as a man of murderous disposition. To that end they were allowed to prove that at the time of the encounter and at that of his arrest he had in his apartment, kept there in a radio box, three pistols and a teargas gun. There was no claim that he had brought these weapons out at the time of the affray, no claim that with any of them he had discharged the fatal shot. He could not have done so, for they were all of different calibre. The end to be served by laying the weapons before the jury was something very different. The end was to bring persuasion that here was a man of vicious and dangerous propensities, who because of those propensities was more likely to kill with deliberate and premeditated design than a man of irreproachable life and amiable manners. Indeed, this is the very ground on which the introduction of the evidence is now explained and defended. The District Attorney tells us in his brief that the possession of the weapons characterized the defendant as “a desperate type of criminal,” a “person criminally inclined.” [Yet t]he weapons were . . .  left in his apartment where they were incapable of harm. In such circumstances, ownership of the weapons, if it has any relevance at all, has relevance only as indicating a general disposition to make use of them thereafter, and a general disposition to make use of them thereafter is without relevance except as indicating a “desperate type of criminal,” a criminal affected with a murderous propensity. . . . 
</p><p id="76636748-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If a murderous propensity may be proved against a defendant as one of the tokens of his guilt, a rule of criminal evidence, long believed to be of fundamental importance for the protection of the innocent, must be first declared away. [C]haracter is never an issue in a criminal prosecution unless the defendant chooses to make it one. In a very real sense a defendant starts his life afresh when he stands before a jury, a prisoner at the bar. There has been a homicide in a public place. The killer admits the killing, but urges self-defense and sudden impulse. Inflexibly the law has set its face against the endeavor to fasten guilt upon him by proof of character or experience <span title="30" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-30">p. 30</span>predisposing to an act of crime. . . . The principle back of the exclusion is one, not of logic, but of policy. There may be cogency in the argument that a quarrelsome defendant is more likely to start a quarrel than one of milder type, a man of dangerous mode of life more likely than a shy recluse. The law is not blind to this, but equally it is not blind to the peril to the innocent if character is accepted as probative of crime. “The natural and inevitable tendency of the tribunal—whether judge or jury—is to give excessive weight to the vicious record of crime thus exhibited, and either to allow it to bear too strongly on the present charge, or to take the proof of it as justifying a condemnation irrespective of guilt of the present charge” (Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 1, §194, and cases cited).</p><p id="76636749-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different question would be here if . . . the defendant had been shown to have gone forth from the apartment with all the weapons on his person. To be armed from head to foot at the very moment of an encounter may be a circumstance worthy to be considered, like acts of preparation generally, as a proof of preconceived design. There can be no such implication from the ownership of weapons which one leaves behind at home.</p><p id="7663674a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The endeavor was to generate an atmosphere of professional criminality. It was an endeavor the more unfair in that, apart from the suspicion attaching to the possession of these weapons, there is nothing to mark the defendant as a man of evil life. . . . If his own testimony be true, he had gathered these weapons together as curios, a collection that interested and amused him. Perhaps his explanation of their ownership is false. There is nothing stronger than mere suspicion to guide us to an answer. Whether the explanation be false or true, he should not have been driven by the People to the necessity of offering it. Brought to answer a specific charge, and to defend himself against it, he was placed in a position where he had to defend himself against another, more general and sweeping. He was made to answer to the charge, pervasive and poisonous even if insidious and covert, that he was a man of murderous heart, of criminal disposition. . . .

<p id="76638e5e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1.</i> On the facts of <i>Zackowitz</i>, we may assume that the killing was intentional. The principal issue at trial was whether the killing was “deliberate” (that is, whether the intent to kill was formulated before the shot, making the crime first-degree murder) or whether the killing was instead “impulsive” (that is, whether the intent to kill was formulated during the final scuffle, making the crime second-degree murder). Does the defendant’s possession of the weapons have some bearing on this issue? Recall that very slight probative value is usually sufficient to render evidence admissible; for example, evidence that Zackowitz stood to inherit money from the victim would undoubtedly be admissible as tending to show a motive for a deliberate killing. Does the evidence of weapons possession have at least that much probative value?</p>

Judge Cardozo stresses that the issue in the case was a “delicate” and “subtle” one. Under these circumstances was it not particularly important for the jury to have access to as much relevant evidence as possible? In which case will the trier of fact be better able to evaluate what actually happened: when it knows about the weapons, knows the defendant’s explanation for them and has a chance to judge the credibility of that explanation, or when—as <i>Zackowitz</i> requires—all of this information is withheld?</p>

<i>1. The general rule and its foundations.</i> Subject to certain exceptions to be explored below, the basic principle invoked by the majority in <i>Zackowitz</i> appears to enjoy universal acceptance: Other crimes (and indeed any other kind of evidence designed to show “bad character”) may not be introduced to show that the accused had an evil disposition and thus was more likely to have committed the offense charged.</p>
<p id="76638e63-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Rules 403 and 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence illustrate one rigorous statement of these principles:</p>

<p id="7663b575-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.</p>
<p id="7663b576-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

</p>
</div>
<p id="7663b578-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is the justification for these principles? McCormick states that such evidence “is not irrelevant, but in the setting of jury trial the danger of prejudice outweighs the probative value.” C. McCormick, Evidence §190, at 447 (2d ed. 1972). See also Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 475-476 (1948): “The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.” Undoubtedly, this statement holds true in a wide range of contexts. But there can be situations in which the danger of prejudice is arguably insufficient to justify the exclusion. Are there more basic reasons to exclude other-crimes evidence?</p>
<p id="7663b579-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="32" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-32">p. 32</span>Consider how the criminal process would be affected if the prosecution were free to support its case by proving previous instances of a defendant’s criminal conduct. The accused, who is contesting the present indictment, may deny having committed the other crimes as well. And if the prosecution has not already obtained a conviction for the other crimes, the entire focus of the trial could be diverted by the dispute about whether those alleged crimes were in fact committed.</p>
<p id="7663b57a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if the other crimes are easily proved by a record of prior convictions, the defendant may want to explain the background of the other offenses or claim extenuating circumstances. The vice here is not simply that time and attention may be diverted from the main issue in the case. It is also that a defendant should not be forever obliged to explain prior transgressions in order to dispel suspicions of further misconduct. A person who has suffered conviction and sentence is said to have “paid his debt to society”; the slate should be wiped clean. Cardozo alludes to these concerns when he states: “In a very real sense a defendant starts his life afresh when he stands before a jury, a prisoner at the bar. . . . Whether the explanation [for Zackowitz’s possession of the weapons] be true or false, he should not have been driven by the People to the necessity of offering it.”</p>
<p id="7663dc8b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Whether or not a defendant has already “paid his debt” for the prior offense, basic assumptions about criminal responsibility are tested when a trial focuses on the defendant’s general character rather than his behavior in a discrete situation. To be sure, a trial designed to determine a defendant’s responsibility for particular events often must explore many background circumstances, but ultimately the events themselves are at issue, the concrete behavior specified in the charges. The criminal trial usually is not viewed as a vehicle for passing judgment on the whole person. Again, Cardozo alludes to this principle: “Brought to answer a specific charge, [the defendant] had to defend himself against another, more general and sweeping[,] . . . pervasive and poisonous even if insidious and covert, that he was a man of murderous heart, or criminal disposition.” Consider Gerard E. Lynch, RICO: The Crime of Being a Criminal, Parts III &amp; IV, 87 Colum. L. Rev. 920, 934-936 (1987):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7663dc8c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he model of crime based on specific incidents or acts [is] associated with a particular conception of the individual as a moral actor. . . . The individual is implicitly conceived . . . as free at any given moment to make choices at odds with any consistent character that may be deduced from his prior acts. To infer that a defendant committed the particular offense for which he is being tried from the fact that he has previously committed other crimes of a generally similar nature—or, worse still, other crimes of an entirely different nature—is not only unfair, but inconsistent with a fundamental supposition that criminal behavior is punishable because it represents a free choice at a particular moment in time to commit an immoral act.</p>

<p id="7663dc8f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Exceptions to the rule.</i> Despite the concerns mentioned by the court in <i>Zackowitz</i>, the rule against admitting other-crimes evidence is subject to a number of “exceptions.” For example, evidence that the defendant had previously stolen the pistol with which the victim was shot ordinarily will be admissible—not to show the defendant’s disposition to crime but to help <i>identify</i> him as the killer. Similarly, evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery witnessed by the victim ordinarily will be admissible—not to show propensity but to show his <i>motive</i> for this particular killing. See, e.g., White v. Commonwealth, 178 S.W.3d 470 (Ky. 2005).</p>
<p id="7663dc90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Technically speaking, these situations do not involve exceptions to the rule of exclusion because, properly stated, that rule renders other-crimes evidence inadmissible only when offered “to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with [that] character.” Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). In other words, the rule itself does not bar the use of other-crimes evidence for some purpose <i>other than</i> that of suggesting that he acted in conformity with a bad character.</p>
<p id="766403a1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When evidence of other crimes is not offered to prove propensity, and therefore is not barred by Rule 404(b), the evidence nonetheless may run afoul of some other prohibition. In particular, evidence offered to prove identity or other nonpropensity matters will be barred by Rule 403 if its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. Evidence, even when relevant, must be excluded when it “tends to subordinate reason to emotion in the factfinding process.” United States v. Queen, 132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir. 1997). When other-crimes evidence is both highly relevant and highly inflammatory, courts face a dilemma; in such cases, the Supreme Court has held, judges must consider using factual stipulations or other alternative methods for conveying the essential facts to the jury in less prejudicial fashion. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997).</p>
<p id="766403a2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is not always easy to tell whether other-crimes evidence links the defendant to the crime in some legitimate way or whether it simply suggests a criminal propensity. The problem generates a large volume of litigation. For helpful discussion, see Paul S. Milich, The Degrading Character Rule in American Criminal Trials, 47 Ga. L. Rev. 775 (2013).</p>

<i>3. Sex offenses.</i> The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 amended the Federal Rules of Evidence by adding the following provision (Fed. R. Evid. 413(a)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="766403a4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of a sexual assault, the court may admit evidence that the defendant committed another sexual assault. The evidence may be considered on any matter to which it is relevant.</p>
</div>
<p id="766403a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An analogous provision (Fed. R. Evid. 414(a)) rendered the defendant’s commission of child molestation admissible in a prosecution for other acts of child molestation. Evidence of prior sex crimes can be admitted under Rules 413 and 414 only when the evidence also passes the Rule 403 requirement that its prejudicial effect not outweigh its probative value. United States v. Loughry, 660 F.3d 965 (7th Cir. 2011). With this safeguard in place, the admission of evidence of prior sex crimes does not amount to an unconstitutional denial of due process. People v. Falsetta, 986 P.2d 182 (Cal. 1999); Enjady v. United States, 134 F.3d 1427 (10th Cir. 1998). Nonetheless, some courts treat Rules 413 and 414 as “provid[ing] a presumption in favor of . . .  admission” for prior sexual offenses and rarely hold such evidence to be barred under Rule 403. E.g., United States v. Merz, 396 Fed. Appx. 838, 843 (3d Cir. 2010). Some have admitted evidence of prior sexual offenses even when those offenses were committed several decades before the incident in question. E.g., United States v. Benally, 500 F.3d 1085 (10th Cir. 2007). See Aviva Orenstein, Deviance, Due Process, and the False Promise of Federal Rule of Evidence 403, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 1487, 1519-1521 (2005).</p>
<p id="766403a6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What is the justification for treating prior sexual acts differently from other evidence of bad character or criminal propensity? Can an exception to the rule of exclusion be justified on the ground that sexual misconduct has greater predictive value than other misconduct? Or should the rule of exclusion be applied even <i>more</i> strictly, on the ground that evidence of prior sexual misconduct has especially strong prejudicial effects?</p>
<p id="766403a7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For in-depth examination of the issues, see Katharine K. Baker, Once a Rapist? Motivational Evidence and Relevancy in Rape Law, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 563 (1997). Professor Baker charges that “Rule 413’s proponents rely on antiquated notions of rapists as rare, depraved psychopaths who have some sort of perverse psychological need for sex.” The empirical evidence, she argues, indicates that convicted rapists are much less likely to repeat their crimes than are convicted larcenists and burglars. Professor Baker concludes that Rule 413 is misguided because it “relies on outmoded and demonstrably false stereotypes of who rapes, what rape is, and why rape might be different from other crimes.” Id. at 565, 578, 589.</p>
<p id="766403a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In accord with Professor Baker’s analysis, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policy-making body of the federal judiciary chaired by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, urged Congress to repeal the new rules. The Judicial Conference concluded that “the new rules, which are not supported by empirical evidence, could diminish significantly the protections that have safeguarded persons accused in criminal cases,” and noted that the rules posed a <span title="35" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-35">p. 35</span>“danger of convicting a criminal defendant for past, as opposed to charged, behavior or for being a bad person.” The Judicial Conference also noted that its conclusions about the undesirability of Rules 413 and 414 reflected a “highly unusual unanimity” of the judges, lawyers, and academics who serve on its advisory committees. See 56 Crim. L. Rptr. 2139-2140 (Feb. 15, 1995). Nonetheless, Congress has declined to modify or repeal the rules.</p>
<p id="766403a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several states have adopted similar rules, modeled on Federal Rule 413, for admitting evidence of prior sex crimes, on the theory that a defendant’s “lustful disposition” is especially probative in sex-offense prosecutions. In most states, however, the usual rule excluding evidence of prior misconduct continues to apply in rape and child abuse trials, just as it does in other prosecutions, and in some states, legislative changes similar to Rules 413 and 414 have been held to violate the state constitution. E.g., State v. Gresham, 269 P.3d 207 (Wash. 2012); State v. Cox, 781 N.W.2d 757 (Iowa 2010). See David P. Bryden &amp; Roger C. Park, “Other Crimes” Evidence in Sex Offense Cases, 78 Minn. L.

<i>4. The impeachment exception.</i> In all of the situations so far discussed, the question has been whether the prosecution can use evidence of other crimes as part of its case-in-chief. Even when the other-crimes evidence is clearly inadmissible for this purpose, if the accused chooses to testify in his defense, the prosecution generally will be permitted to ask about the other crimes when it cross-examines him. The prosecution will also be permitted to introduce other-crimes evidence in its rebuttal for purposes of impeaching the defendant’s testimony. Many states hold that such evidence is admissible automatically, regardless of whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. E.g., State v. Harrington, 800 N.W.2d 46 (Iowa 2011). In theory, the other-crimes evidence cannot be used to provide affirmative support for the prosecution’s case; it may be considered only for purposes of judging the credibility of the defendant’s testimony, and the jury will be so instructed.</p>
<p id="76642abb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The rationale of the impeachment exception appears to be that a person convicted of crime may be more likely to give false testimony than a citizen with a “clean” record. Whatever the soundness of this rationale when the previous misconduct involves perjury or similar crimes of dishonesty, its invocation in the case of other offenses can border on the absurd. In a prosecution for burglary, previous burglary convictions are not admissible to show the defendant’s disposition to commit this crime, but if the defendant claims to have been elsewhere at the time, the burglary convictions will generally be held admissible to show a possibility that the defendant may be disposed to perjury!</p>
<p id="76642abc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The impeachment exception is premised on the assumption that the jury will consider the other crimes <i>only</i> for the limited purpose of judging credibility and will not treat the other crimes as affirmative evidence of guilt. Is this a plausible assumption? Lawyers and social scientists have studied the question but have not reached definitive conclusions. The Note that follows <span title="36" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-36">p. 36</span>explores the effectiveness of cautionary instructions and collects some of the available findings. The immediate problem is to understand how the other-crimes rules actually function, but questions about the effectiveness of jury instructions are central to understanding the actual impact of all the elaborate rules of criminal law and evidence that the jury is called upon to apply.</p>

Indeed the rule generally excluding other-crimes evidence is premised on the assumption that such evidence <i>is</i> relevant to guilt and is very difficult for the jury to keep in perspective once it becomes known. Thus jurors may be tempted to disregard the instruction, even if they are able to grasp the subtle distinction it asks them to draw. The problem arises over and over in administering the complex rules that ostensibly govern the criminal process. Yet just as the jury creates the need for many of these rules, the nature of the jury raises doubts about whether subtle or counterintuitive instructions actually affect the outcome of the case.</p>

Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 565 (1967), the Supreme Court expressed its faith in “the ability of juries to approach their task responsibly and to sort out discrete issues given to them under proper instructions.” Others have been more skeptical. Justice Robert H. Jackson warned: “The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . . . all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.” Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 453 (1949) (concurring opinion). In Dunn v. United States, 307 F.2d 883, 886 (5th Cir. 1962), the court was equally pessimistic:</p>

<i>1. The basis of the reasonable-doubt requirement.</i> Is it clear, as Justice Harlan argues, that the “social disutility” of convicting an innocent person is always far worse than that of releasing a guilty person? William Blackstone went even further, asserting the often-repeated view that it is “better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.” 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *352 (1765). Other judges and commentators have approved even higher ratios, such as one hundred to one or even more. See Alexander Volokh, <i>n</i> Guilty Men, 146 U. Pa. L. Rev. 173, 187-191 (1997). But how can we really be sure that it is less “costly” to release ten (or one hundred) suspected serial killers who are guilty than to convict one suspected serial killer who is innocent?</p>
<p id="7664c724-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the reasonable-doubt requirement appears to enjoy broad support, some skeptics wonder where Blackstone and Justice Harlan can <span title="40" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-40">p. 40</span>get the information necessary to calculate and compare these kinds of social costs. If the cost comparisons are arbitrary and indeterminate, does it follow that the reasonable-doubt requirement is not justified after all? Or does the reasonable-doubt requirement rest on a different principle? Regardless of any alleged balance of societal gains and losses, doesn’t every individual enjoy a fundamental right not to suffer punishment in the absence of reliable proof of fault?</p>

<i>2. How burden-of-proof problems arise.</i> Problems relating to the reasonable-doubt standard normally arise first at the close of the prosecution’s case. If the judge decides that the evidence raises a reasonable doubt about guilt <i>as a matter of law</i> (an elusive concept explored in the next Note), the judge must direct a verdict for the defendant. The same problem of assessing the sufficiency of the evidence may be presented to the judge again at the close of all the evidence (when the defendant may again move for a directed verdict); it will be a central concern of the jurors in their deliberations; and it may arise again on appeal (when the defendant may seek reversal on the basis of insufficient evidence).</p>
<p id="7664ee36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Reasonable doubt as a matter of law.</i> Courts often have difficulty determining whether the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law. In a sense, the judges must give the defendant the <i>benefit of the doubt.</i> If there is a reasonable doubt, then a guilty verdict would seem improper. On the other hand, before taking a case away from the jury (or reversing a jury’s verdict), judges must resolve all evidentiary doubts against the proponent of the motion; in this sense the courts must give the <i>prosecution</i> the benefit of the doubt on the question whether its evidence does prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The following comment from the opinion in Curley v. United States, 160 F.2d 229, 232-233 (D.C. Cir. 1947), helps clarify this elusive problem and explains the test that judges apply to determine evidentiary sufficiency:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7664ee37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[It is sometimes said] that unless the evidence excludes the hypothesis of innocence, the judge must direct a verdict . . . [and] that if the evidence is such that a reasonable mind might fairly conclude either guilt or innocence, a verdict of guilt must be reversed on appeal. But obviously neither of those translations is the law. Logically the ultimate premise of that thesis is that if a reasonable mind might have a reasonable doubt, there is, therefore, a reasonable doubt. That is not true. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7664ee38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The functions of the jury include the determination of the credibility of witnesses, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of justifiable inferences of fact from proven facts. It is the function of the judge to deny the jury any opportunity to operate beyond its province: The jury may not be permitted to conjecture merely, or to conclude upon pure speculation or from passion, prejudice or sympathy. The critical point in this boundary is the existence or non-existence of a reasonable doubt as to guilt. If the evidence is such that reasonable jurymen must necessarily have such a doubt, the judge must require acquittal, because no other result is permissible within the fixed bounds of jury consideration. But if a reasonable mind might fairly have a <span title="41" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-41">p. 41</span>reasonable doubt or might fairly not have one, the case is for the jury, and the decision is for the jurors to make. . . . 
</p>
<p id="7664ee39-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The true rule, therefore, is that a trial judge, in passing upon a motion for directed verdict of acquittal, must determine whether upon the evidence, giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If he concludes that either of the two results, a reasonable doubt or no reasonable doubt, is fairly possible, he must let the jury decide the matter.</p>

<i>4. Explaining reasonable doubt.</i> The problem of evidentiary sufficiency arises not only for judges but for the jury, and the instructions accordingly must tell the jury how to evaluate the evidence. Empirical studies confirm that jurors convict more readily when instructed under a more-likely-than-not standard than when instructed under the reasonable-doubt standard,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1091C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1091C_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">55</a></span> and courts must protect the jury against any instruction that might dilute the latter standard. Accordingly, a conviction must be reversed for error in explaining the reasonable-doubt standard to the jury, even when the appellate court does not find the evidence insufficient as a matter of law.</p>

<i>(a)</i> In McCullough v. State, 657 P.2d 1157 (Nev. 1983), the trial judge had explained degrees of proof to the jury in terms of “a scale of zero to ten.” He placed the burden of persuasion in civil trials at just over five. He then described beyond a reasonable doubt as “seven and a half, if you had to put it on a scale.” The Nevada Supreme Court reversed, stating (id. at 1159): “The concept of reasonable doubt is inherently qualitative. Any attempt to quantify it may impermissibly lower the prosecution’s burden of proof, and is likely to confuse rather than clarify.” In <i>In re</i> As. H., 851 A.2d 456 (D.C. 2004), the only witness to identify the suspect as the perpetrator testified that her level of certainty was “seven or eight” on a scale of one to ten. Although acknowledging that it is “difficult (if not impossible) to place a meaningful numerical value on reasonable doubt,” the court found that “very few judges would consider an 80% probability sufficient” and that 70 percent was “altogether inadequate.” Accordingly, the court held (over one dissent) that as a matter of law “the evidence was insufficient to prove [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 457, 461.</p>

<i>(b)</i> Courts often get into trouble when attempting to explain “reasonable doubt” in qualitative terms. In Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990), the trial judge in a first-degree murder prosecution had instructed the jury that “a reasonable doubt [must be] founded upon a real tangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice and conjecture. It must be such doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty. . . . A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt. . . . What is required is not an absolute or mathematical certainty, but a moral certainty.” The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the references to “grave uncertainty” and “moral certainty” improperly diluted the <i>Winship</i> standard.</p>

<i>(c)</i> A traditionally accepted definition of reasonable doubt was the following, which was required by Cal. Penal Code §1096 (1994):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="7665154f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Reasonable doubt is . . . not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.</p>
</div>
<p id="76651550-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This language was drawn verbatim from an 1850 jury instruction given by Massachusetts Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw. See Commonwealth v. Webster, 59 Mass. 295, 320 (1850). But what is the meaning, to a modern juror, of “moral evidence” and “moral certainty”? Does the instruction meet the requirements of <i>Winship</i> and <i>Cage v. Louisiana</i>?</p>
<p id="76651551-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1 (1994) (decided with a companion case from California), the Court distinguished <i>Cage</i> and upheld the constitutionality of the California instruction. The Court conceded that “the phrase ‘moral evidence’ is not a mainstay of the modern lexicon,” and that “moral certainty is ambiguous” but concluded that the instruction as a whole gave sufficient content to the reasonable-doubt requirement. Several concurring justices agreed that use of the nineteenth-century phrases was not unconstitutional but urged states to choose more modern language. California responded the following year by deleting the phrase “moral certainty”; the current statute describes reasonable doubt as a situation in which jurors “cannot say they feel an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge.” Cal. Penal Code §1096 (2016). In some states, the “moral certainty” language is still used. E.g., 7 Tenn. Prac. Pattern Jury Instr. T.P.I.-Crim. 2.03 (2016), explaining that “[a]bsolute certainty of guilt is not demanded . . . , but moral certainty is required, and this certainty is required as to every element of proof necessary to constitute the offense.” Massachusetts, where the “moral certainty” language originated, continues to use it but now explains to the jury that moral certainty means “the highest degree of certainty possible in matters relating to human affairs.” Commonwealth v. Russell, 23 N.E. 3d 867, 878 (Mass. 2015).</p>
<p id="76651552-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recent studies indicate that among various formulations, jurors told that they must be “firmly convinced” were most likely to differentiate between strong and weak cases, acquitting in the latter. But even when given the “firmly convinced” language, “more than one-third of the [mock] juries voted to convict when the prosecution’s evidence did not even satisfy a preponderance of the evidence standard.” See Stoltie v. California, 501 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1261 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Many experts believe “[c]olloquial words that describe subjective certainty will likely be more effective in explaining to the jury the truly high standard of proof.” Id. at 1262. But to date, courts have not required more emphatic explanations of this sort.</p>
<p id="76651553-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d)</i> Because reasonable doubt is difficult to explain correctly, several courts consider it preferable to give the jury no explanation at all. E.g., United States v. Hornsby, 666 F.3d 296, 310-311 (4th Cir. 2012). In United States v. <span title="43" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-43">p. 43</span>Walton, 207 F.3d 694 (4th Cir. 2000), a jury that had received no explanation of reasonable doubt sent the judge a note asking him to define it. After the judge refused, the jury convicted. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, stating that trying to explain things will “confuse rather than clarify.” Is this an appropriate solution to the problem?</p>

<p id="76653c68-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An important aspect of the overall sufficiency of the evidence is the burden of proof on particular subsidiary issues in the case. Even though the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the state is sometimes permitted to allocate the burden of persuasion on certain subsidiary issues to the defense.</p>
<p id="76653c69-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court considered one such effort to subdivide the burden of proof in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 (1975). <i>Mullaney</i> involved Maine’s complex scheme of homicide statutes. The state defined murder as a killing with “malice aforethought,” and malice aforethought was defined as a state of mind consisting of, among other things, an intent to kill “without a considerable provocation.” A killing <i>with</i> provocation was classified as manslaughter and was subject to a lower punishment. At the defendant’s trial, the jury was instructed that any intentional killing would involve “malice aforethought” and would therefore constitute murder, unless the defendant could rebut malice aforethought by proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had acted “in the heat of passion, on sudden provocation.”</p>
<p id="76653c6a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court held that the defendant’s due process rights were violated by Maine’s decision to place upon him the burden of proving provocation. Because provocation negated the “malice aforethought” required to convict him of murder, the approach used in Maine violated the <i>Winship</i> requirement that the state prove “beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.”</p>
<p id="76653c6b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Mullaney</i>, however, left room for argument about the crucial question of <i>why</i> the absence of provocation was a necessary fact. Was it because provocation was inherently important in determining the degree of culpability and punishment? Or was it because the absence of provocation had been included in the statutory definition of what murder was? The Supreme Court soon faced a case requiring it to choose between these two approaches.</p>

</p><p id="76656381-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After a brief and unstable marriage, the appellant, Gordon Patterson, Jr., became estranged from his wife, Roberta. Roberta resumed an association <span title="44" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-44">p. 44</span>with John Northrup, a neighbor to whom she had been engaged prior to her marriage to appellant. On December 27, 1970, Patterson borrowed a rifle from an acquaintance and went to the residence of his father-in-law. There, he observed his wife through a window in a state of semiundress in the presence of John Northrup. He entered the house and killed Northrup by shooting him in the head.</p><p id="76656382-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Patterson was charged with second-degree murder. In New York there are two elements of this crime: (1) “intent to cause the death of another person”; and (2) “caus[ing] the death of such person or of a third person.” Malice aforethought is not an element of the crime. In addition, the State permits a person accused of murder to raise an affirmative defense that he “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN109D4_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N109D4_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>
</p><p id="76656384-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">New York also recognizes the crime of manslaughter. A person is guilty of manslaughter if he intentionally kills another person “under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.” Appellant confessed before trial to killing Northrup, but at trial he raised the defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</p><p id="76656385-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury was . . . instructed, consistently with New York law, that the defendant had the burden of proving his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The jury was told that if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had intentionally killed Northrup but that appellant had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that he had acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, it had to find appellant guilty of manslaughter instead of murder. The jury found appellant guilty of murder. [The New York Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Patterson’s argument that the statutory scheme had improperly shifted to him the burden of proof on the crucial question of extreme emotional disturbance.]</p><p id="76658a96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether New York’s allocation to the defendant of proving the mitigating circumstances of severe emotional disturbance is consistent with due process, it is . . . relevant to note that this defense is a considerably expanded version of the common-law defense of heat of passion on sudden provocation and that at common law the burden of proving the latter, as well as other affirmative defenses—indeed, “all . . . circumstances of justification, excuse or alleviation”—rested on the defendant. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *201. This was the rule when the Fifth Amendment was adopted, and it was the American rule when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.</p><p id="76658a97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1895 the common-law view was abandoned with respect to the insanity defense in federal prosecutions. Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469 (1895). This ruling had wide impact on the practice in the federal courts with respect to the burden of proving various affirmative defenses, and the prosecution in a majority of jurisdictions in this country sooner or later came to shoulder the <span title="45" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-45">p. 45</span>burden of proving the sanity of the accused and of disproving the facts constituting other affirmative defenses, including provocation. <i>Davis</i> was not a constitutional ruling, however, as Leland v. Oregon, [343 U.S. 790 (1952)], made clear.</p><p id="76658a98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At issue in Leland v. Oregon was the constitutionality under the Due Process Clause of the Oregon rule that the defense of insanity must be proved by the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Noting that <i>Davis</i> “obviously establish[ed] no constitutional doctrine,” the Court refused to strike down the Oregon scheme, saying that the burden of proving all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including the elements of premeditation and deliberation, was placed on the State under Oregon procedures and remained there throughout the trial. To convict, the jury was required to find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, based on all the evidence, including the evidence going to the issue of insanity. Only then was the jury “to consider separately the issue of legal sanity per se. . . . ” This practice did not offend the Due Process Clause even though among the 20 States then placing the burden of proving his insanity on the defendant, Oregon was alone in requiring him to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . 
</p><p id="76658a99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We cannot conclude that Patterson’s conviction under the New York law deprived him of due process of law. . . . The death, the intent to kill, and causation are the facts that the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt if a person is to be convicted of murder. No further facts are either presumed or inferred in order to constitute the crime. . . . It seems to us that the State satisfied the mandate of <i>Winship</i> [p. 38 supra,] that it prove beyond a reasonable doubt “every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [Patterson was] charged.”</p><p id="76658a9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even if we were to hold that a State must prove sanity to convict once that fact is put in issue, it would not necessarily follow that a State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact, the existence or nonexistence of which it is willing to recognize as an exculpatory or mitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of the punishment. Here, in revising its criminal code, New York provided the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, a substantially expanded version of the older heat-of-passion concept; but it was willing to do so only if the facts making out the defense were established by the defendant with sufficient certainty. The State was itself unwilling to undertake to establish the absence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, perhaps fearing that proof would be too difficult and that too many persons deserving treatment as murderers would escape that punishment if the evidence need merely raise a reasonable doubt about the defendant’s emotional state. . . . The Due Process Clause, as we see it, does not put New York to the choice of abandoning such defenses or undertaking to disprove their existence in order to convict of a crime which otherwise is within its constitutional powers to sanction by substantial punishment. . . . 
</p><p id="76658a9b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This view may seem to permit state legislatures to reallocate burdens of proof by labeling as affirmative defenses at least some elements of the crimes now defined in their statutes. But there are obviously constitutional limits <span title="46" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-46">p. 46</span>beyond which the States may not go in this regard. “[I]t is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.” McFarland v. American Sugar Rfg. Co., 241 U.S. 79, 86 (1916). The legislature cannot “validly command that the finding of an indictment, or mere proof of the identity of the accused, should create a presumption of the existence of all the facts essential to guilt.” Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 469 (1943). . . . 
</p><p id="7665b1ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is urged that <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur</i> necessarily invalidates Patterson’s conviction. . . . 
<i>Mullaney</i>’s holding, it is argued, is that the State may not permit the blameworthiness of an act or the severity of punishment authorized for its commission to depend on the presence or absence of an identified fact without assuming the burden of proving the presence or absence of that fact, as the case may be, beyond a reasonable doubt. In our view, the <i>Mullaney</i> holding should not be so broadly read. . . . The Maine Supreme Judicial Court made it clear that . . . malice, in the sense of the absence of provocation, was part of the definition of that crime. Yet malice, i.e., lack of provocation, was presumed and could be rebutted by the defendant only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted with heat of passion upon sudden provocation. . . .

<i>Mullaney</i> held invalid Maine’s requirement that the defendant prove heat of passion. The Court today, without disavowing the unanimous holding of <i>Mullaney</i>, approves New York’s requirement that the defendant prove extreme emotional disturbance. The Court manages to run a constitutional boundary line through the barely visible space that separates Maine’s law from New York’s. It does so on the basis of distinctions in language that are formalistic rather than substantive. . . . The test the Court today establishes allows a legislature to shift, virtually at will, the burden of persuasion with respect to any factor in a criminal case, so long as it is careful not to mention the nonexistence of that factor in the statutory language that defines the crime. . . . 
</p><p id="7665b1b0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With all respect, this type of constitutional adjudication is indefensibly formalistic. . . . What <i>Winship</i> and <i>Mullaney</i> had sought to teach about the limits a free society places on its procedures to safeguard the liberty of its citizens becomes a rather simplistic lesson in statutory draftsmanship. Nothing in the Court’s opinion prevents a legislature from applying this new learning to many of the classical elements of the crimes it punishes. . . .

<span title="47" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-47">p. 47</span>The Court understandably . . . issues a warning that “there are obviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard.” . . .  But if the State is careful to conform to the drafting formulas articulated today, the constitutional limits are anything but “obvious.” This decision simply leaves us without a conceptual framework for distinguishing abuses from legitimate legislative adjustments of the burden of persuasion in criminal cases.</p><p id="7665d8c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is unnecessary for the Court to retreat to a formalistic test for applying <i>Winship</i>. . . . The Due Process Clause requires that the prosecutor bear the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt only if the factor at issue makes a substantial difference in punishment and stigma. The requirement of course applies a fortiori if the factor makes the difference between guilt and innocence. But a substantial difference in punishment alone is not enough. It also must be shown that in the Anglo-American legal tradition the factor in question historically has held that level of importance. If either branch of the test is not met, then the legislature retains its traditional authority over matters of proof. . . . 
</p><p id="7665d8c4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I hardly need add that New York’s provisions allocating the burden of persuasion as to “extreme emotional disturbance” are unconstitutional when judged by these standards. “Extreme emotional disturbance” is, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the direct descendant of the “heat of passion” factor considered at length in <i>Mullaney.</i>
 . . . The presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance makes a critical difference in punishment and stigma, and throughout our history the resolution of this issue in fact, although expressed in somewhat different terms, has distinguished manslaughter from murder. . . . New ameliorative affirmative defenses, about which the Court expresses concern, generally remain undisturbed by the holdings in <i>Winship</i> and <i>Mullaney</i>—and need not be disturbed by a sound holding reversing Patterson’s conviction.</p></div>

<i>1. The burden of production versus the burden of persuasion.</i> Rules allocating the burden of proof deal with two distinct problems. The first concerns allocating the burden of coming forward with enough evidence to put a certain fact in issue. This is commonly referred to as the burden of <i>production.</i> The second problem concerns allocating the burden of convincing the trier of fact. This is commonly referred to as the burden of <i>persuasion.</i> With respect to most facts relevant to guilt, the prosecution bears <i>both</i> burdens. That is, the prosecution must introduce enough evidence not only to put the facts in issue but also to persuade the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. In some instances, state law may require the defense to bear both burdens. But note that an intermediate position is possible: State law might allocate the burden of <i>production</i> to the defense but the burden of <i>persuasion</i> to the prosecution. For example, the state might provide that a defendant seeking acquittal on grounds of duress must introduce some evidence of duress, but that once this is done, <span title="48" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-48">p. 48</span>the prosecution must prove the absence of duress beyond a reasonable doubt. In this situation, it is sometimes said (confusingly) that the defendant bears the initial burden of proof and that, once duress is at issue, the burden <i>shifts</i> to the prosecution. Or it may be said that absence of duress is <i>presumed,</i> but that when evidence of duress is introduced the presumption is <i>rebutted</i> or simply <i>disappears.</i> All these expressions are equivalent to the more straightforward statement that the defendant bears the burden of production and the prosecution the burden of persuasion.</p>
<p id="7665ffd8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the defendant bears the burden of production on an issue, the issue is commonly referred to as an <i>affirmative defense.</i> In some states, when an issue is designated an affirmative defense, the defendant must bear the burdens of both production and persuasion, but it is common practice to treat burdens of production and persuasion as separate issues. Thus, the defendant may bear the burden of persuasion on <i>some</i> affirmative defenses, but with respect to others he may bear <i>only</i> the burden of production.</p>
<p id="7665ffd9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the defendant bears the burden of production, how much evidence is necessary to satisfy that burden so that the prosecution will be required to disprove the claim beyond a reasonable doubt? Most courts require that the evidence be sufficient to raise at least a reasonable doubt on the matter. See Frazier v. Weatherholtz, 572 F.2d 994 (4th Cir. 1978). When the defense produces evidence sufficient to satisfy the threshold requirements, it becomes necessary to determine which party must bear the burden of persuading the trier of fact.</p>

<i>2. Allocating the burden of persuasion: the basis of</i> Patterson. Are states free to allocate the burden of persuasion however they choose, or does the reasoning of <i>Patterson</i> suggest some limits? Consider the following problems.</p>
<p id="7665ffdb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Liberalizing and nonliberalizing changes in the law.</i> In <i>Patterson</i> the affirmative defense involved “a substantially expanded version of the older heat-of-passion concept,” and the Court stressed the need for permitting the states flexibility in this situation. But what if, after <i>Patterson</i>, a state shifts to the defendant a burden of persuasion previously imposed on the prosecution and does not enlarge the scope of the defense? Should it matter whether the traditional defense might otherwise have been restricted or repealed?</p>

<i>(b) Gratuitous defenses.</i> The <i>Patterson</i> majority assumed that New York could eliminate the “extreme emotional disturbance” defense altogether, a point conceded by Justice Lewis Powell’s dissent. If this is so, how can there be any serious challenge to the constitutionality of recognizing the defense only in diluted form, that is, when the defendant can prove it? Several commentators argue that “the greater power should include the lesser.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10AFF_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10AFF_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">56</a></span> Under this analysis, states would be free to reallocate burdens of persuasion <span title="49" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-49">p. 49</span>relating to any fact that is not a constitutionally mandated prerequisite to just punishment.

It does not, however, speak to the question of what that something must be. [When] the state considers a gratuitous defense, that is, one that it may grant or deny as it sees fit, a constitutional insistence on proof beyond a reasonable doubt no longer makes sense. Such a rule would purport to preserve individual liberty and the societal sense of commitment to it by forcing the government either to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt or to eliminate the defense altogether. The latter solution results in an extension of penal liability despite the presence of mitigating or exculpatory facts. It is difficult to see this result as constitutionally compelled and harder still to believe that it flows from a general policy, whether actual or symbolic, in favor of individual liberty. . . . 
</p>
<p id="766625f2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trouble lies in trying to define justice in exclusively procedural terms. <i>Winship</i>’s insistence on the reasonable doubt standard is thought to express a preference for letting the guilty go free rather than risking conviction of the innocent. This value choice, however, cannot be implemented by a purely procedural concern with burden of proof. Guilt and innocence are substantive concepts. Their content depends on the choice of facts determinative of liability. If this choice is remitted to unconstrained legislative discretion, no rule of constitutional procedure can restrain the potential for injustice. . . .

<i>(c) Nongratuitous defenses.</i> In <i>Patterson</i> the affirmative defense was “gratuitous,” in the sense that the state could have eliminated the defense completely. Should the state’s freedom to shift the burden of proof extend to defenses that are <i>not</i> gratuitous? Consider, for example, the insanity defense. There is a long-standing debate over the question whether some form of an insanity defense is constitutionally mandated. Yet in Rivera v. Delaware, 429 U.S. 877 (1976), the Court summarily dismissed a challenge to a Delaware law that required the defendant to bear the burden of proving insanity. Should <i>Rivera</i> be read as holding, by implication, that states are free to eliminate the insanity defense completely? If not, what is the justification for permitting states to avoid the reasonable-doubt requirement and to “dilute” a defense that may be constitutionally mandated?</p>
<p id="766625f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In connection with these questions, consider Martin v. Ohio, 480 U.S. 228 (1987). The defendant, a battering victim, shot her husband in what she claimed was an act of self-defense. She was charged with aggravated murder, defined under Ohio law as a killing “purposely, and with prior calculation and design.” Ohio law provides that self-defense is a complete defense when “the defendant was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the argument; [and] had an honest belief that she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that her only means of escape from such danger was in the use of such force. . . . ” At trial, the jury was instructed that the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of aggravated murder, but that the defendant was required to prove her self-defense claim by a preponderance of the evidence. The defendant’s aggravated murder conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court. Writing for the majority, Justice White said (id. at 233-235):</p>

<p id="766625f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The State did not exceed its authority in defining the crime of murder as purposely causing the death of another with prior calculation or design.

<p id="76664d07-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Powell, writing for the four dissenters, argued that the defense claim of imminently necessary self-defense was inherently inconsistent with the prosecution claim of killing “by prior calculation and design.” As a result, he argued, the instruction requiring the defendant to prove self-defense was in direct conflict with the instruction requiring the prosecution to prove aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt. As to this point, the majority asserted (id. at 235) that “the instructions were sufficiently clear to convey to the jury that the state’s burden of proving prior calculation did not shift.”</p>
<p id="76664d08-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note that no member of the Court challenged Justice White’s assertion that “[t]he State did not exceed its authority in defining the crime of murder as purposely causing the death of another. . . . ” Is this so clear?

<i>3. Sentencing enhancements.</i> Legislatures often define a crime and then specify that the punishment to be imposed will depend on certain characteristics of the offense committed (such as whether the offense involved a firearm or a given quantity of drugs). Usually, the judge determines at a sentencing hearing whether such circumstances exist and then imposes sentence accordingly. The procedure at the sentencing hearing is relatively informal, and the judge is not required to find beyond a reasonable doubt every fact she considers in fixing the sentence. Clearly, this technique affords an easy way to ease the burden of compliance with the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt—facts that support a large increase in punishment can be established merely by a preponderance of the evidence. But this technique is available only when the facts at issue are merely “sentencing factors,” rather than elements of a separate offense. For facts of the latter sort, as <i>Mullaney</i> holds, nothing less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt will suffice. A question of statutory structure therefore takes on great importance—when is a fact that enhances the sentence merely a sentencing factor and when is it an element of a separate, aggravated offense?</p>
<p id="76664d0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a landmark decision, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the Supreme Court made clear that the states do not have unlimited discretion to characterize facts as mere sentencing considerations rather than elements of the offense. <i>Apprendi</i> involved a “hate-crimes” statute that provided for doubling the maximum punishment applicable to any offense if the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense was committed with “a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” (Id. at 469.) The Court held this scheme unconstitutional, ruling that any fact (other than prior criminal record) that increases the maximum penalty applicable to an offense is an “element” of the offense, which therefore must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. And the Court has held the <i>Apprendi</i> principle applicable not only to facts that increase a <i>statutory</i> maximum but also to facts that increase the maximum punishment authorized under sentencing guidelines. Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). Similarly, in Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 2155 (2013), the Court held that legislatures cannot <span title="52" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-52">p. 52</span>require judges to impose a mandatory <i>minimum</i> sentence on the basis of facts proved by a mere preponderance of the evidence; the Court declared that “[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime” is an “element” that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p id="76664d0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast, however, facts that affect the choice of sentence within an authorized range continue to be treated merely as “sentencing factors,” and such facts do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Legislatures therefore can give themselves considerable flexibility simply by setting a very high maximum sentence for an offense. They can then authorize or even require judges to impose a <i>lower</i> sentence if certain facts are proved by a mere preponderance. This distinction between facts that are offense “elements” and those that are mere “sentencing factors” has important implications not only for the reasonable-doubt principle but also for the right to jury trial and for the dynamics of the sentencing process. We explore those implications below at p. 78 with respect to jury trial, and at p. 1260 with respect to sentencing.</p>

<i>4. How should a jurisdiction exercise its discretion?</i> Even where <i>Patterson</i> leaves a jurisdiction free to impose a burden of persuasion on the defendant, the decision does not imply that the state must or should do so. Legislatures (or courts, when statutes do not control) must decide what is desirable with respect to each defense of this kind. The Supreme Court held, for example, that in a federal prosecution for illegally receiving a firearm, a defendant who claims duress must prove that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1 (2006). In contrast, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has held that once a defendant presents some evidence supporting the partial defense of provocation, the state must prove the absence of provocation beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Soto, 162 N.H. 708 (2011). Burden-of-proof questions therefore must be reconsidered in light of problems associated with particular substantive law doctrines.</p>

<p id="7666741f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As the preceding section shows, the prosecution’s burden of proof often can be eased by defining an offense in such a way that the burden of proving certain facts can be assigned to the defense. Another device that can ease the prosecutor’s burden is the <i>presumption.</i> The presumption can come into play even when the state has not exercised (or cannot exercise) the <i>Patterson</i> option of reallocating the burden of proof. Suppose, for example, that murder is defined as an <i>intentional</i> killing. The state might hesitate to redefine murder as including all killing (with lack of intent relevant only as an affirmative defense). Can the state instead choose to retain intent as a required element of murder, but then provide that the existence of the necessary intent will be <i>presumed</i> from some other fact (for example, from the use of a deadly weapon)? The question has great practical importance because intent is a required element of so many criminal offenses, but there is often no direct evidence of what was going on in the defendant’s mind. Rather than give a straightforward answer to the question, the Supreme Court has held that it is sometimes—but not always—permissible to presume the existence of an essential fact (like intent) from proof of some other fact. The Court has said that a <i>mandatory</i> presumption—one that the jury is required to accept in the absence of defense rebuttal—is constitutionally acceptable only if, over the universe of all cases in general, the presumed relationship holds true beyond a reasonable doubt. In contrast, in order for the prosecution to rely on a <i>permissive</i> inference—one that the jury may choose to accept or reject <span title="53" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-53">p. 53</span>even in the absence of any defense rebuttal—all that is required is that the relationship be “more likely than not” to hold true under the circumstances of the particular case. County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140 (1979).</p>
<p id="76667420-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider the application of this standard to one of the criminal law’s most commonly invoked presumptions—the presumption that a “person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.” Is reliance on this presumption constitutionally permissible? For example, if the defendant, a person of sound mind, shoots at the victim, hitting him in the chest and killing him, is it permissible to presume that the defendant intended to kill? The issue was presented in Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307 (1985). The case involved an escaped convict (Franklin) who shot a 72-year-old man in the course of attempting to steal the man’s car. The trial judge told the jury that Franklin was “presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts, but the presumption may be rebutted.” Franklin was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court held the jury instruction unconstitutional and reversed the conviction. Do you see why?</p>

But the public plays a critical role in criminal cases through its service on the jury. While jury trials have become rare in an age of plea bargaining, pleas operate in the shadow of these jury trials.

It is sufficient for present purposes to say that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to the Magna Carta. Its preservation and proper operation as a protection against arbitrary rule were among the major objectives of the revolutionary settlement which was expressed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689. . . .

A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government. Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power—a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. . . . The deep commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law enforcement qualifies for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must therefore be respected by the States. . . .

Yet, the most recent and exhaustive study of the jury in criminal cases concluded that juries do understand the evidence and come to sound conclusions in most of the cases presented to them and that when juries differ with the result at which the judge would have arrived, it is usually because they are serving some of the very purposes for which they were created and for which they are now employed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C3D_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C3D_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">26</a></span> The State of Louisiana urges that holding that the Fourteenth Amendment assures a right to jury trial will cast doubt on the integrity of every trial conducted without a jury. . . . We would not assert, however, that every criminal trial—or any particular trial—held before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury. Thus we hold no constitutional doubts about the practices, common in both federal and state courts, of accepting waivers of jury trial and prosecuting petty crimes without extending a right to jury trial. However, the fact is that in most places more trials for serious crimes are to juries than to a court alone; a great many defendants prefer the judgment of a jury to that of a court. Even where <span title="56" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-56">p. 56</span>defendants are satisfied with bench trials, the right to a jury trial very likely serves its intended purpose of making judicial or prosecutorial unfairness less likely.</p><p id="7666c253-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Louisiana’s final contention is that even if it must grant jury trials in serious criminal cases, the conviction before us is valid and constitutional because here the petitioner was tried for simple battery and was sentenced to only 60 days in the parish prison. We are not persuaded. It is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision and should not be subject to the Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States. . . .

<i>1.</i> Duncan <i>in context.</i> Justice White mentions, early in his opinion, that Duncan’s cousins had recently transferred to a previously all-white high school where “racial incidents” had been reported. That description of the circumstances was a colossal, and no-doubt deliberate, understatement. The previous year, the U.S. attorney general had declared Plaquemines Parish one of the nine most discriminatory counties in the nation, and in 1966, at the time of the incident, the parish was in the midst of a ferocious school desegregation battle, pitting Justice Department attorneys, civil rights lawyers, and the federal courts against Leander H. Perez, Sr., a political figure and ardent segregationist (known locally as “the Bonaparte of the Bayou”) who had ruled the parish with an iron fist for decades. Perez had hand-picked all judges and other officials in the parish, and he tolerated no opposition. Many civil <span title="57" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-57">p. 57</span>rights activists who dared to enter the parish were arrested as “outside agitators.” When the civil rights lawyer who had taken Duncan’s case appeared at the courthouse to file a motion needed for the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Plaquemines sheriff arrested him on a charge of practicing law without a license and confiscated the briefcase that contained all of Duncan’s appeal papers. For a fascinating, in-depth description of this background, see Nancy J. King, <i>Duncan v. Louisiana</i>: How Bigotry in the Bayou Led to Federal Regulation of State Juries, in Criminal Procedure Stories (C. Steiker ed., 2006).</p>
<p id="7666e96b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why didn’t the Court make more of these local circumstances? The political situation in Plaquemines Parish seems to afford a perfect opportunity to make vivid the value of the jury as a check on official power. Would an emphasis on these facts have made the Court’s opinion more persuasive? Or would such an emphasis detract from the Court’s effort to establish a more general principle—that the jury should be considered an important safeguard against abuse even in a well-functioning democracy?</p>

<i>2. The scope of the right to jury trial.</i> Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote that “[n]o changes or chances can alter the content of the verbal symbol of ‘jury’—a body of twelve men who must reach a unanimous conclusion if the verdict is to go against the defendant.” Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 170 (1952). Except for the limitation to males, which had passed away long before Justice Frankfurter reiterated it, this statement expressed a nearly universal view about what was meant by a jury. Nevertheless, in Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 86 (1970), the Court said that the decision to fix the size of the jury at 12 “appears to have been a historical accident, unrelated to the great purposes that gave rise to the jury” and held that a 6-member jury satisfied the constitutional requirement.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C95_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C95_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">57</a></span> In Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), the Court held that unanimity was not required in state criminal trials, so long as a substantial majority of the jury supports the verdict. The Court in that case upheld guilty verdicts obtained by 11–1 and 10–2 votes, without ruling explicitly on whether a smaller majority could also be sufficiently substantial.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10C9D_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10C9D_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">58</a></span>

<i>Duncan</i> did not resolve the question of what may be deemed a “petty offense,” for which the Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee would be inapplicable. In Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970), the Court held that no offense may be deemed petty where imprisonment for more than six months is authorized. In such cases, a defendant has a constitutional right to jury trial, whether or not imprisonment is in fact likely to be imposed.</p>

<i>3. The representative jury.</i> Contrary to popular folklore, there is no requirement that a defendant be tried by a jury of “his peers.” Nor is there any requirement that the trial jury of 6 or 12 reflect the demographic character of the locality. But the Supreme Court has held that under the Sixth Amendment, the “venire”—the panel of potential jurors from which the trial jury is drawn—must reflect “a fair cross section of the community.” Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 537 (1975). The Court has treated the “fair cross section” requirement as a means to ensure the <i>impartiality</i> of the jury, but has not recognized an independent Sixth Amendment right to a jury that <i>represents</i> the community in any broader sense. See Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474 (1990); Nina W. Chernoff, Wrong About the Right: How Courts Undermine the Fair Cross-Section Guarantee by Confusing it with Equal Protection, 64 Hastings L.J. 141 (2012); Laura G. Dooley, The Dilution Effect: Federalization, Fair Cross-Sections, and the Concept of Community, 54 DePaul L. Rev. 79 (2004).</p>
<p id="76671081-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once the venire is assembled, potential jurors who know the defendant, the victim, or a witness can be challenged “for cause” and removed from the pool. The opposing attorneys are then allowed “peremptory challenges,” which permit them to remove a certain number of potential jurors without giving any reason, simply because they suspect that the potential juror may be unsympathetic to their side. In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), and J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994), the Supreme Court held that attorneys cannot use peremptory challenges to deliberately exclude potential jurors on grounds of race or gender. But the requirement is difficult to enforce because a peremptory challenge can pass muster when the attorney can offer a plausible race-neutral and gender-neutral explanation for making it. As a result, the trial jury ultimately empanelled often will differ markedly from the character of the community as a whole, even when the venire was well balanced. An experienced federal judge reported that in Boston, “the vast majority of juries in federal court . . . did not have a single African-American member.” Nancy S. Gertner, 12 Angry Men (and Women) in Federal Court, 82 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 613, 619 (2007).</p>

<i>4. The effect of jury trial on the criminal justice system. (a)</i> The entire texture of the trial is influenced by the existence of the jury. Instead of addressing arguments to one law-trained person, the lawyers address themselves to 12 lay people. Lawyers are often convinced that nonlegal factors will influence the jury even when those factors are not technically “relevant,” and as a result they often attempt, with some success, to find indirect ways to make the jury aware of such matters.</p>
<p id="76671083-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Because lay people may not assess items of proof as carefully as trained lawyers, Anglo-American law includes elaborate rules for excluding certain evidence at the trial.</p>
<p id="76671084-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> The judge is judge of the law; the jury decides questions of fact. The legal system must characterize the nature of a given question: Is it a question of law or of fact?</p>

<i>(d)</i> Judges must formulate for jurors’ use an acceptable statement of applicable legal rules, though these rules are often extremely complex. When significant errors are made in stating these rules, a conviction must be reversed, and a new trial must be held.</p>

<i>5. The policies served (and disserved) by jury trial.</i> The Court in <i>Duncan</i> summarizes the principal reasons why it regards the availability of trial by jury as an essential component of fair procedure. Is it clear that the advantages of jury trial outweigh its costs or that experimentation with different kinds of factfinding procedures should be considered intolerable? Consider the following comments:</p>

</p><p id="76675eaf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the case against the criminal jury as a protector of individual liberty extends further than to contests between government and citizens opposed to its policies.

It may seriously be doubted whether entrusting the jury with law-dispensing powers is justified.

<p id="7667d3e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The [jury] controversy centers around three large issues. First, there is a series of collateral advantages and disadvantages that are often charged against, or pointed to on behalf of, the jury as an institution. In this realm fall such positive points as that the jury provides an important civic experience for <span title="60" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-60">p. 60</span>the citizen<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D47_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D47_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>; that, because of popular participation, the jury makes tolerable the stringency of certain decisions; that, because of its transient personnel, the jury acts as a sort of lightning rod for animosity and suspicion which otherwise might center on the more permanent judge; and that the jury is a guarantor of integrity, since it is said to be more difficult to reach twelve men than one. Against such affirmative claims, serious collateral disadvantages have been urged, chiefly that the jury is expensive; . . . that jury service imposes an unfair tax and social cost on those forced to serve; and that, in general, exposure to jury duty disenchants the citizen and causes him to lose confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
<p id="7667d3e6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, there is a group of issues that touch directly on the competence of the jury. . . . On the one hand, it is urged that the judge, as a result of training, discipline, recurrent experience, and superior intelligence, will be better able to understand the law and analyze the facts than laymen, selected from a wide range of intelligence levels, who have no particular experience with matters of this sort, and who have no durable official responsibility. On the other hand, it is argued that twelve heads are inevitably better than one; that the jury as a group has wisdom and strength which need not characterize any of its individual members; that it makes up in common sense and common experience what it may lack in professional training, and that its very inexperience is an asset because it secures a fresh perception of each trial, avoiding the stereotypes said to infect the judicial eye.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10D5A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10D5A_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">b</a></span>
</p>
<p id="7667faf8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The third group of issues about the jury goes to what is perhaps the most interesting point. The critics complain that the jury will not follow the law, either because it does not understand it or because it does not like it, and that thus only a very uneven and unequal administration of justice can result from reliance on the jury; indeed, it is said that the jury is likely to produce that government by man, and not by rule of law, against which Anglo-American political tradition is so steadfastly set.</p>
<p id="7667faf9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This same flexibility of the jury is offered by its champions as its most endearing and most important characteristic. The jury, it is said, is a remarkable device for insuring that we are governed by the spirit of the law and not by its letter; for insuring that rigidity of any general rule of law can be shaped to justice in the particular case. One is tempted to say that what is one man’s equity is another man’s anarchy.</p>

<i>6. Defense interests versus community interests.</i> Suppose that the defendant prefers <i>not</i> to be tried by a jury. Should the defendant’s preference control, or does the community have an independent interest in jury decision making? American jurisdictions are closely divided on the issue. See Uzi Segal <span title="61" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-61">p. 61</span>&amp; Alex Stein, Ambiguity Aversion and the Criminal Process, 81 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1495, 1501-1504 (2006). Many courts permit the prosecutor to demand a jury trial, even over the defendant’s objection, e.g., State v. Greenwood, 297 P.3d 556, 561 (Utah 2012), and some courts, as in State v. Burks, 674 N.W.2d 640 (Wis. App. 2003), permit the trial judge to insist on a jury trial even when <i>both</i> the defense and the prosecution prefer a non-jury trial.</p>
<p id="7667fafb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should these issues be resolved? The Sixth Amendment, of course, grants the defendant the right <i>to have</i> a jury, but not a right <i>to waive</i> the jury, that is, to insist upon a bench trial instead. In fact, Professor Laura I. Appleman argues that in the original understanding, “the right of the jury trial . . . is all about <i>representation</i>, or the participation of the citizenry in [the] rule of law. Fairness to the defendant plays a part, . . . but the right emphasized over and over again is that belonging to the local community and to the people at large.” Appleman, The Lost Meaning of the Jury Trial Right, 84 Ind.

This separate public interest derives from what can be called the criminal jury’s “communitarian” function. The communitarian function of public trial by jury in criminal cases can be divided into three related aspects: 1) a democratic vehicle for community participation in government in general and the criminal justice system in particular; 2) a means by which the community is educated regarding our system of justice; and 3) a ritual by which the faith of the community in the administration of justice is maintained.</p>

<i>7. The prevalence (or non-prevalence) of jury trial in the United States.</i> As we saw earlier in this chapter, jury trials are rare.

<i>8. Lay adjudicators in other countries.</i> In Canada, the criminal trial jury remains a “robust” institution that accounts for a significant proportion of criminal case dispositions. See Neil Vidmar, The Canadian Criminal Jury: Searching for a Middle Ground, 62 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 141, 172 (1999). Elsewhere in the common-law world, jury trials have dwindled, in part because governments concerned about costs and the jury’s competence have steadily narrowed the range of criminal cases in which jury trial is available. See Freedom’s Lamp Dims, Economist, June 23, 2005. In nations outside the common-law tradition, independent juries on the American model are rare, but Spain introduced criminal jury trials in 1995, and more qualified forms of citizen participation are widespread. Indeed, 55 of the 192 UN member states—including such culturally diverse nations as Croatia, Kazakhstan, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and South Korea—use or are currently adopting some form of lay participation to aid in criminal trials.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DC5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10DC5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">62</a></span>

<p id="76687034-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But most nations, including many with strong democratic traditions (such as India, Israel, and the Netherlands) do not use jury trials in criminal cases.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DD1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10DD1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">63</a></span> For discussion of current practice in more than two dozen countries, see Symposium on Juries and Lay Participation: American Perspectives and Global Trends, 90 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 785 (2015); Ethan J. Leib, A Comparison of Criminal Jury Trial Rules in Democratic Countries, 5 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 629 (2008). Do these patterns cast doubt on the importance of jury trials in the American setting? If non-jury criminal trials are fully compatible with democracy, are there other features of American culture or the American judicial system that make jury trials especially important?</p>

<i>9. The behavior of the jury in the United States.</i> The empirical study referred to in <i>Duncan</i>, Harry Kalven &amp; Hans Zeisel, The American Jury (1966), sought to determine the extent to which juries and judges decide cases differently and the sources of such differences.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10DE3_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10DE3_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">64</a></span> The authors found that judges and juries disagree in roughly 25 percent of jury trial cases. In a small portion of these (2 percent of the total), the jury convicts when the <span title="63" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-63">p. 63</span>judge would acquit; in 17 percent of all cases the jury acquits when the judge would convict; in roughly 6 percent of the cases the jury “hangs” (fails to agree on a verdict). Id. at 56-57.</p>
<p id="76689748-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The authors examined in depth the reasons for judge-jury disagreement. They attributed 79 percent of the disagreements to differences in assessing the evidence in close cases. Other major factors that helped account for disagreement were jury sentiments about the law (50 percent of the disagreements), jury sentiments about the defendant (22 percent), facts only the judge knew (5 percent), and disparity of counsel (8 percent). Id. at 111. Often there was more than one reason for disagreement in a case. In fact, the closeness of the evidence usually appeared with one of the other reasons, so that this factor apparently “liberated the jury to respond to non-evidentiary factors.” Id. at 106. Jury sentiment about the law was thus especially significant, and this factor of course lies close to the heart of the jury’s function as a guarantor of lenity and equity in dispensing criminal justice. The study suggested that “in cases having a de minimus cast or a note of contributory fault or provocation . . . the jury will exercise its de facto powers to write these equities into the criminal law.” Id. at 285. Other sentiments about the law that appeared to have significant impact included “impatience with the nicety of the law’s boundaries hedging the privilege of self-defense” (id. at 241) and resistance to the enforcement of a few unpopular laws, such as hunting, gambling, and drunken-driving laws. While the study provided evidence of extensive jury nullification, it also should be noted that the judge and jury <i>agreed</i> in 75 percent of the cases, that only half the disagreements involved jury sentiments about the law, and that these sentiments usually emerged in combination with other factors, principally the closeness of the evidence. The authors observed that the “jury’s war with the law is now a polite one” (id. at 76) and concluded (at 498):</p>

<i>1. Effects in practice.</i> Empirical studies have probed the impact of nullification instructions. A fundamental question underlying the debate is whether jurors who nullify are reflecting the community sense of justice, <span title="67" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-67">p. 67</span>or instead (as the <i>Dougherty</i> court feared) are responding to vengeful instincts and emotional biases triggered by characteristics of the victim or the defendant. A further question, then, is whether explicit instructions about the nullification power will exacerbate these possibilities. One empirical study probing these issues<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10ED8_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10ED8_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">65</a></span> considered the effect of instructing mock juries that “nothing would bar them from acquitting the defendant if they feel that the law . . . would produce an inequitable or unjust result.” In a case involving a nurse tried for the “mercy” killing of a terminally ill cancer patient, mock juries given the nullification instruction were, predictably, less likely to convict than mock juries not given the instruction. But, unexpectedly, the instructed mock juries were <i>more</i> likely to convict in a homicide case involving a drunk driver who struck and killed a pedestrian. In deliberations, mock juries spent less time discussing the evidence and more time discussing the defendant’s character when a nullification instruction had been given. Another study found that in cases where the fairness of the underlying law was a concern, jurors given negative information about the victim were less likely to convict when given a nullification instruction, whereas negative information about the victim did not affect the likelihood of conviction when jurors were given standard jury instructions, without reference to nullification.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EE5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10EE5_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">66</a></span>

<i>2. Current state of the law.</i> The federal courts and nearly all the states follow <i>Dougherty</i> and refuse to permit instructions informing the jury of its nullification power. See, e.g., United States v. Moran-Toala, 726 F.3d 334, 343 (2d Cir. 2013); State v. Paul, 104 A.3d 1058 (N.H. 2014). In State v. Kelly, 727 S.E.2d 912, 915 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012), the court declared that granting a right to nullification instructions “would lead to chaos.” In contrast, in United States v. Folse, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176610, at *54 (D.N.M. Nov. 9, 2015), the court acknowledged that precedent precluded a nullification instruction but nonetheless, after review of the early history, concluded that “the current prohibitions against any mention of the jury’s ability to mitigate or nullify its verdict are inconsistent with the Framers’ intent.” For further development of that argument, see Clay S. Conrad, Jury Nullification 13-115 (2014).</p>
<p id="76695abb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In three states, the approach rejected in <i>Dougherty</i> survives through constitutional provisions that the jury shall be the judge of the law as well as the fact. Ga. Const. art. 1, §1, §11(a); Ind. Const. art. 1, §19; Md. Const., Decl. of Rights, art. 23. In Georgia, however, courts have confined the provision—for example, by upholding a charge that the jurors are the judges of the law but are obliged to apply the court’s instructions to the facts and by forbidding defense counsel to argue to the jury that it should disregard the law. See Newsome v. State, 747 S.E.2d 99 (Ga. Ct. App. 2013).

But that is precisely what jury nullification is: the power to undo everything that is precious in our system of criminal justice, the power to act arbitrarily to convict one and acquit another where there is absolutely no apparent difference between the two. It is a power, unfortunately, that is there, that this Court cannot terminate, but a power that should be restricted as much as possible.</p>

 . . . The lengths to which we go to exclude irrelevant evidence, the expenditures made to protect defendants from juror prejudice, the energy, study, and work devoted to a particular prosecution, all of these are prodigious. Having gone through that process, admired by us both for its thoroughness and its goals, astonishing to others for its devotion to fairness and reason, it is incomprehensible that at the very end we should tell those who are to make the judgment that they may do so without regard to anything that went before and without guidance as to why they should disregard what went on before, and without the obligation of explaining why they so disregarded everything. . . .

<i>4. Other mechanisms of “arbitrary” leniency.</i> The <i>Ragland</i> court rests part of its case against jury nullification on the ground that this power “arbitrarily, to pick and choose” defendants for unexplained leniency exists “[a]bsolutely nowhere [else] in the system.” But at the outset of this book we noted the importance of discretion <i>throughout</i> the criminal justice system. In particular, the judgments of police and prosecutors about whether and what to charge are largely unguided and uncontrolled. See p. 8, supra, and the flow chart on p. 19, supra. Another important source of discretionary leniency is the power of state governors and the President to grant executive clemency, a power that is likewise unrestricted and therefore in essence “arbitrary.” In Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 380 (1867), the Supreme Court declared that “[t]he benign prerogative of mercy reposed in [the President] cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.” Given the <span title="69" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-69">p. 69</span>phenomenon of <i>pervasive</i> discretion (which we examine in detail in Chapter 10, infra), does jury nullification really deserve special skepticism? Is unexplained leniency granted by a citizen group serving on a one-time basis more trustworthy or more problematic than unexplained leniency granted by elected officials accountable to voters and the political process?</p>
<p id="766981d2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Andrew D. Leipold considers nullification undesirable, and he challenges the <i>Ragland</i> court’s premise that the nullification power is unavoidable. He would restrict the de facto nullification power by authorizing prosecution appeals (a view that would require reversal of current double jeopardy case law);<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10F48_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10F48_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">67</a></span> at the same time, he would permit explicit instructions authorizing nullification in cases involving de minimis harms, and would bar prosecution appeal from an acquittal on that ground (if made explicit by a jury’s special verdict).

<p id="766981d4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A different view is developed in Sherman J. Clark, The Courage of Our Convictions, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 2381 (1999). Professor Clark argues that jury trials “serve as a means through which we as a community take responsibility for—own up to—inherently problematic judgments regarding the blameworthiness or culpability of our fellow citizens.” Id. He suggests, accordingly, that “procedures governing the criminal jury trial [should] engender in jurors a sense of personal responsibility for the fate of the accused.” Id. at 2382. He recommends that jurors be instructed in a way that stresses their responsibility for their decision and makes them aware of their nullification power, without expressly encouraging them to use it—for example, by telling the jurors (id. at 2446) that “the responsibility for this decision is entirely yours and . . . you will not be required to explain or justify your verdict except to your own conscience.”</p>

<i>5. The legality principle.</i> A traditional principle of criminal law—also a constitutional mandate under the requirement of “due process of law”—is that punishment can be imposed only for violation of clear standards promulgated in advance of the defendant’s conduct. See pp. 158-202 infra. Suppose that the jurors are instructed, over the defendant’s objection, that they are the judges of the law as well as the facts. Does such an instruction subject the defendant to capricious judgment and violate his right to be tried in accordance with ascertainable law, with guilt established beyond a reasonable doubt? Or are due process concerns met by the trial judge’s power to set aside a conviction not supported by sufficient evidence? See State v. Waine, 122 A.3d 294, 301 (Md. 2015).</p>

<i>7. Constraining nullification.</i> If jury nullification is usually or (as the <i>Ragland</i> court argues) always undesirable, how far can courts go to discourage it? In a civil suit, the judge can set aside a jury verdict for one party and enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict (often called “judgment n.o.v.”) for the other side. But in a criminal case, a judgment n.o.v. or directed verdict for the prosecution violates the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U.S. 73, 84 (1983); United States v. Salazar, 751 F.3d 326, 334 (5th Cir. 2014). Are other judicial efforts to prevent nullification similarly barred by the Sixth Amendment? Consider these situations:</p>
<p id="7669a8eb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> In People v. Fernandez, 31 Cal. Rptr. 2d 677 (Ct. App. 1994), the jurors interrupted their deliberations to send the judge a note in which they stated their belief that the defendant had committed battery with serious bodily injury and then asked whether they nonetheless had the power to acquit on that charge and instead return a verdict of guilty on the lesser offense of assault. The trial judge simply replied, “No.” The court of appeal held that this response was not error.</p>
<p id="7669a8ec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> In State v. Smith-Parker, 340 P.3d 485, 499 (Kan. 2014), the defendant was convicted of murder after the judge instructed the jury: “If you do not have a reasonable doubt from all the evidence that the State has proven murder in the first degree on either or both theories, then you <i>will</i> enter a verdict of guilty” (emphasis added). The Kansas Supreme Court reversed, holding that the “wording at issue here—‘will’—fl[ies] too close to the sun of directing a verdict for the State. A judge cannot compel a jury to convict, even if it finds all elements proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” <i>Id.</i> at 507. Compare United States v. Folse, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176610, at *7 (D.N.M. Nov. 9, 2015), where the jury convicted defendant of murder after being instructed: “You have no right . . . to question the wisdom or correctness of any rule I may state to you. You must not substitute or follow your own <span title="71" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-71">p. 71</span>notion or opinion as to what the law is or ought to be. It is your duty to apply the law as I explain it to you, regardless of the consequences.” Id. at *7. Is the instruction consistent with <i>Dougherty</i>? Should the conviction in <i>Folse</i> be upheld on appeal?</p>

<i>(c)</i> United States v. Thomas, 116 F.3d 606 (2d Cir. 1997), was a prosecution of several African-American defendants charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine. During deliberations, several jurors informed the judge that Juror No. 5, the sole African American on the panel, was refusing to follow the judge’s instructions, was calling his fellow jurors “racists,” and was adamantly holding out for acquittal. The judge interrupted the deliberations and interviewed each of the jurors. According to several of them, Juror No. 5 had said he thought the government’s evidence was unreliable, and Juror No. 5 told the judge that he needed “substantial evidence” of guilt. But several other jurors testified that Juror No. 5 had said he favored acquittal because the defendants were black and had committed the alleged crimes out of economic necessity. The trial judge accepted the latter account and dismissed Juror No. 5 on the ground that he would not convict “no matter what the evidence was” and had “preconceived . . . economic [or] social reasons [for acquittal] that are totally improper.” The remaining jurors then unanimously convicted.</p>
<p id="7669a8ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On appeal, the court, per Judge José Cabranes, “categorically reject[ed] the idea that jury nullification is desirable or that courts may permit it to occur when it is within their authority to prevent it.” The court held that the Constitution permits removal whenever there is unambiguous evidence of a juror’s refusal to follow the judge’s instructions. The court reversed the convictions, however, because Juror No. 5’s intentions were ambiguous and there was “some possibility” he had based his vote on his view of the evidence.</p>
<p id="7669a8ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Roughly in accord with the <i>Thomas</i> standard, most of the recent decisions hold that it is error to remove an allegedly recalcitrant juror if there is “any reasonable possibility” that the juror is following the judge’s instructions. State v. Morfin, 287 P.3d 600, 605 (Wash. Ct. App. 2012). In United States v. Abbell, 271 F.3d 1286, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001), the court described this as “basically a ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard.” Nonetheless, courts often find that this tough requirement has been met and accordingly uphold decisions to remove a juror who has been holding out for acquittal. E.g., United States v. Godwin, 765 F.3d 1306 (11th Cir. 2014). And in Johnson v. Williams, 133 S. Ct. 1088, 1098 (2013), the Court upheld a more permissive California approach that allows a juror to be discharged when inquiry reveals a “demonstrable reality” that the juror is unwilling or unable to deliberate.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> If jury departures from the law are so unequivocally bad, why should the defendant have a constitutional right to jury trial in the first place? Was <i>Duncan</i> wrongly decided? Conversely, if the jury’s equity-dispensing function is central to its constitutional role, how can it be proper for a trial judge to remove jurors who reveal their intent to exercise that function? And what effect will the existence of such a removal power have on jurors’ ability <span title="72" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-72">p. 72</span>to express their views candidly during deliberation?

<i>(d)</i> The Fully Informed Jury Association (FIJA) is a Montana-based organization supported by a politically diverse array of protest groups, including anti-abortion activists, supporters of alternative medicines, and opponents of laws regulating firearms, marijuana, motorcycle helmets, prostitution, and the right to die. See King, supra at 434; Marder, supra at 942. Through a national newsletter, website, and handbills distributed at courthouses, FIJA seeks to spread awareness of the nullification power and encourage its use. At many courthouses throughout the country, FIJA distributes pro-nullification literature to potential and actual jurors, and encourages them to call an 800 number to hear a recorded message describing what one juror discovered were “more rights than what was read to me by the judge.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10FD1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10FD1_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">68</a></span>

<p id="7669d003-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall that in <i>Dougherty</i>, the majority considered formal nullification instructions unnecessary, in part because “the jury gets its understanding . . .  from more than one voice”; the court concluded that awareness of the nullification power can best come from “informal input.” Are FIJA’s activities therefore legitimate and perhaps even desirable? Many judges and other court officials apparently do not think so. FIJA activists who contact jurors or engage in leafleting at the courthouse have been charged with jury tampering, obstruction of justice, and contempt of court, even though FIJA’s informational materials are not alleged to be incorrect or misleading. An Alaska case involved an FIJA activist who approached three potential jurors and urged them to call a toll-free number to hear a recorded message about the jury’s powers. He was convicted of jury tampering under a state statute that prohibits “directly or indirectly communicat[ing] with a juror . . . with intent to . . . influence the juror’s vote, opinion or decision.” The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected his First Amendment challenge to the conviction. Turney v. Pugh, 400 F.3d 1197, 1199 (9th Cir. 2005). More recently, federal authorities filed jury tampering charges against Julian Heicklen, a 79-year-old retired university professor who allegedly stood on the plaza outside the U.S. Courthouse in Manhattan handing out brochures to passers-by (some of whom could have been potential jurors), accurately explaining the jury’s power to acquit in cases where they disagree with the law. The government used an undercover agent to secretly record a conversation in which Heicklen allegedly said “I’m not telling you to find anybody not guilty. But if there is a law you think is wrong then you should do that.” Prosecutors insisted that his speech was not protected by the First Amendment. Lawyers helping to defend him commented that the prosecution would raise awareness of the nullification power and “surely convert more to the cause than poor Mr. Heicklen ever <span title="73" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-73">p. 73</span>could on his own.” See Benjamin Weiser, Prosecution Explains Jury Tampering Charge, N.Y. Times, Nov. 27, 2011. Ultimately, the trial court dismissed the jury-tampering charge, holding that the statute banned communication on an “issue or matter” before the jury, and that brochures merely describing a juror’s duties did not involve an “issue or matter” unless directed to a specific case. United States v. Heicklen, 858 F. Supp. 2d 256, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).</p>

<p id="7669d007-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Andrew D. Leipold raises an additional concern. If jurors are supposed to decide whether application of the law is unfair in a given case, they “would probably want to know [a host of details, including] whether the defendant is contrite[,] . . . whether he had a criminal record, and if so, how serious were his prior crimes. [They] might wonder how the prosecution enforces this crime against others: are African-Americans disproportionately targeted[?] . . . The problem is that almost none of this information is admissible at trial.” Leipold, Race-Based Jury Nullification: Rebuttal (Part A), 30 J. Marshall L. Rev. 923, 923-924 (1997). Can we assume that the jury will glean <i>this</i> information from informal sources? And if nullification is a legitimate option, does such information become legally relevant, so that it <i>should be</i> admissible at trial? What are the perils of that approach?</p>

[Butler] assumes that it is proper for prospective black jurors to care more about black communities than white communities, that it is proper for black jurors to be more concerned with the fate of black defendants than white defendants, and that it is proper for black jurors to be more protective of the property (and perhaps the lives?) of black people than white people. Along that road lies moral and political disaster. The disaster includes not only increasing but, worse, legitimizing the tendency of people to privilege in racial terms “their own.” Some will say that this racial privileging has already happened and is, in any event, <span title="76" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-76">p. 76</span>inevitable.

<i>NOTES ON THE JURY’S ROLE IN SENTENCING</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="766a936e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because <i>Duncan</i> emphasizes that a central jury function is to afford protection against the “compliant, biased, or eccentric judge,” it might seem that the constitutional right to jury trial should include a right to have the jury decide not only matters of guilt and innocence but the offender’s punishment. In capital cases, nearly all states do give the jury this broader responsibility; we explore the jury’s special role in this context in Chapter 5, pp. 567-602 infra. But for other sentencing matters, only six states allow for punishment to be determined largely by the jury. In all the others, the sentencing decision is left to the judge, and this arrangement is normally not thought to violate Sixth Amendment requirements. Why not? Why should decisions about the sentence be treated differently from decisions about whether to convict? And what freedom should states have to shift factual questions from the guilt phase, where the jury must resolve them, to the sentencing phase, where the prosecution needs only to convince a single judge? Consider the Notes that follow.</p>
<p id="766a936f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Jury sentencing.</i> In Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia, defendants who plead guilty or opt for a bench trial are sentenced by a judge, but those who elect to go to trial before a jury are sentenced by the same jury, usually in a “bifurcated” proceeding—the trial on guilt or innocence occurs first, and if the jury convicts, it then hears further evidence and retires to deliberate separately on the question of punishment. (The principal exception is Oklahoma, where first offenders are tried and sentenced in a unitary proceeding.)</p>
<p id="766a9370-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the penalty phase, sentencing juries typically are not given guidelines of any sort. Instead, they are simply asked to pick any sentence within the authorized statutory range. (In contrast, in many jurisdictions guidelines and presentence reports shape the sentencing decisions of judges, as discussed in Chapter 10, infra.) As a result, jury sentencing produces enormous variation in the sentences imposed on similarly situated offenders. See Nancy J. King &amp; Rosevelt L. Noble, Felony Jury Sentencing in Practice: A Three-State Study, 57 Vand. L. Rev. 885 (2004); Jenia Iontcheva, Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice, 89 Va. L. Rev. 311 (2003). In addition, sentencing juries typically have fewer options for leniency than are available when the sentence <span title="77" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-77">p. 77</span>is fixed by the judge. For example, in several of the jury-sentencing states, judges can grant probation or a suspended sentence, but juries cannot. For this reason and others, studies suggest, defendants sentenced by a jury typically receive more severe sentences than similarly situated defendants sentenced by a judge. See Nancy J. King &amp; Rosevelt L. Noble, Jury Sentencing in Non-Capital Cases: Comparing Severity and Variance with Judicial Sentences in Two States, 2 J. Empirical Legal Stud. 331 (2005).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110D9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N110D9_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">71</a></span>
</p>
<p id="766a9372-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Despite these features (or perhaps because of them), state officials have shown little enthusiasm for reforms that would permit more leniency or consistency in jury sentencing, through sentencing guidelines and other devices now widely used to promote uniformity in sentencing by judges. Prosecutors and legislators in jury-sentencing states seem to believe that the greater severity and unpredictability of jury sentencing is an important factor in inducing guilty pleas, so that cases can be disposed of quickly and cheaply. Professor Nancy King concludes that “the wild card aspect of jury sentencing helps to funnel defendants to guilty pleas and bench trials. . . . For criminal justice insiders, the unpredictability of jury sentencing is a blessing, not a curse; the more freakish, the better.” Nancy J. King, How Different Is Death? Jury Sentencing in Capital and Non-Capital Cases Compared, 2 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 195, 198 (2004). Yet courts have consistently rejected the argument that unguided jury discretion in non-capital cases violates due process. E.g., Torres v. United States, 140 F.3d 392, 397 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>
<p id="766a9373-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do these problems suggest that at the sentencing stage, the jury cannot serve as an effective equity-dispensing mechanism for the benefit of defendants? Or do they simply show that jury sentencing has not been permitted to fulfill its potential?</p>
<p id="766aba84-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Judicial sentencing: What is the jury permitted to know?</i> Does it follow from <i>Dougherty</i> that a judge not only may refuse to inform the jury of its nullification power but also may refuse to inform the jury about the severity of the sentence that a defendant faces upon conviction? The question has become increasingly important with the proliferation of mandatory minimum sentencing laws, which often dictate long terms of imprisonment for things like possession of drugs, even when the defendant is a first offender. Yet nearly all courts hold that because the jury’s role is solely to determine the facts relevant to guilt, the jury has no legitimate concern with the consequences of a conviction. E.g., Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573 (1994). For criticism of this approach, see Jeffrey Bellin, Is Punishment Relevant After All? A Prescription for Informing Juries of the Consequence of Conviction, B.U. L. Rev. 2223 (2010); Michael T. Cahill, Punishment Decisions at Conviction: Recognizing the Jury as Fault-Finder, 2005 U. Chi. Legal F. 91.</p>
<p id="766aba85-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="78" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-78">p. 78</span>United States v. Polizzi, 549 F. Supp. 2d 308 (E.D.N.Y. 2008), illustrates another challenge to the prevailing view. The defendant was convicted on 12 counts of receiving child pornography. The jury rejected his insanity plea despite evidence that he had suffered vicious sexual abuse as a child, had nonetheless established a home with a loving family, and had no prior criminal history. After the verdict, a poll of the jurors revealed that, had they been aware of the applicable five-year mandatory minimum sentence, they would not have convicted, because they thought the defendant should receive treatment and close supervision to prevent a recurrence, not a long prison term. Noting that a properly informed jury would likely have deadlocked or found the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity, the district judge awarded a new trial. Based on an extensive review of the history of jury trial, the judge held that under these circumstances, the failure to inform the jury of the mandatory minimum sentence prior to its deliberations deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to jury trial, as that right had been understood at the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights. However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that absent unusual circumstances, it is an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to inform the jury of the sentencing consequences of its verdict. United States v. Polouizzi [a/k/a/ Polizzi], 564 F.3d 142 (2d Cir. 2009).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN110FB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N110FB_12a17473-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">72</a></span> Compare United States v. Datcher, 830 F. Supp. 411, 414-418 (M.D. Tenn. 1993), where another district judge, protesting against the prevailing bar on instructions about sentencing consequences, commented:</p>

<i>3. Judicial sentencing: When can factual questions be shifted from the jury’s domain to that of the judge?</i> <i>Duncan</i> protects the defendant’s right to have the jury determine, under a strict beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, all facts necessary to constitute the crime charged—that is, all “elements” of the offense. But a single judge, acting under a preponderance-of-the-<span title="79" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-79">p. 79</span>evidence standard, can determine all other facts relevant to the level of punishment—that is, all “sentencing factors.” Years of imprisonment can therefore turn on whether the fact is characterized as an “element” of the offense or merely as a “sentencing factor.” For discussion of the case law on this issue, see p. 51 Note 3, supra. Consider to what extent the “sentencing factor” option (together with the rule against informing the jury about the sentencing consequences of a conviction (Note 2 supra)) enables the legislature to defeat the jury’s constitutionally protected functions identified in <i>Duncan</i>—the functions of restraining overly harsh laws and preventing prosecutors from using generally reasonable laws in an oppressive manner. For discussion, see Rachel E. Barkow, Recharging the Jury: The Criminal Jury’s Constitutional Role in an Era of Mandatory Sentencing, 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 33 (2003).</p>

<p id="766ae19d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The problem and the prevailing solution.</i> When a prosecution involves several separate counts, it sometimes happens that the jury’s verdict on one count will be irreconcilably in conflict with its verdict on another count. Consider, for example, DeSacia v. State, 469 P.2d 369 (Alaska 1970). The defendant’s reckless driving forced another vehicle off the road, and both the driver (Hogan) and passenger (Evangelista) in the other vehicle were killed. The defendant was prosecuted on two counts of manslaughter. The jury convicted on the count charging manslaughter of Evangelista but acquitted on the count charging manslaughter of Hogan. Because the defendant’s conduct had endangered the two victims in precisely the same way, he was in principle guilty of manslaughter either in both cases or in neither. Should the inconsistent verdicts nevertheless be allowed to stand?</p>
<p id="766ae19e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the <i>DeSacia</i> case, the court noted that the verdict of acquittal was final; any relitigation of that count would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. But the court set aside the conviction on the other count, to assure that the conviction was not the product of jury confusion or irrationality. The court therefore remanded for a new trial on the count relating to the death of Evangelista. Similarly, in Price v. State, 405 Md. 10, 23-29 (2008), the court acknowledged that inconsistent verdicts had been accepted in the interests of lenity or compromise, but held that such verdicts, because they are contrary to the law, would no longer be tolerated.</p>
<p id="766ae19f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although several American jurisdictions refuse to accept inconsistent verdicts, see McNeal v. State, 44 A.3d 982 (Md. 2012), the federal courts and the great majority of the states permit the inconsistent conviction to stand. See Priest v. State, 879 A.2d 575 (Del. 2005); People v. Jones, 207 Ill. 2d 122, 133 (2003); Eric L. Muller, The Hobgoblin of Little Minds? Our Foolish Law of Inconsistent Verdicts, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 771, 787-788 (1998). Which approach seems more faithful to the premises of jury trial? If the jury is expected to give voice to the rough common sense of the community, isn’t the <i>DeSacia</i> court’s desire for consistency out of place? Do inconsistent <span title="80" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-80">p. 80</span>verdicts facilitate the exercise of the jury’s leniency or do they encourage compromise <i>convictions</i> on counts about which the jury may not really be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt? In United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 65 (1984), the Supreme Court noted:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="766ae1a0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Inconsistent verdicts . . . present a situation where “error,” in the sense that the jury has not followed the court’s instructions, most certainly has occurred, but it is unclear whose ox has been gored. Given this uncertainty, and the fact that the Government is precluded from challenging the acquittal, it is hardly satisfactory to allow the defendant to receive a new trial on the conviction as a matter of course. . . . For us, the possibility that the inconsistent verdicts may favor the criminal defendant as well as the Government militates against review of such convictions at the defendant’s behest.</p>
</div>
<p id="766ae1a1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Criticism of the prevailing acceptance of inconsistent verdicts.</i> The <i>Powell</i> Court’s assumptions have drawn sharp criticism. Professor Leipold notes that “[f]or every case where the jury extends mercy to a deserving defendant, there may well be another (or two, or five others) where the verdict is based on improper considerations.” Andrew Leipold, Rethinking Jury Nullification, 82 Va. L. Rev. 253, 304 (1996). Professor Muller, supra Note 1, at 795, argues that “by refusing to disturb inconsistent verdicts, the Court is buying a chance for [leniency] at the price of protecting jury confusion, mistake, and compromise.” He concludes that courts should set aside inconsistent convictions unless the evidence supporting the conviction is so overwhelming that any jury error can be deemed harmless.</p>
<p id="766ae1a2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> What if the prosecution seeks an instruction, in a case like <i>DeSacia</i>, that the jury must either acquit on both counts or convict on both counts? Does the result in <i>DeSacia</i> in effect require such an instruction in future cases? If so, would the defendant then be justified in claiming that the instruction improperly constrained the jury’s equity-dispensing function?</p>
<p id="766ae1a3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In connection with these problems, consider whether it was entirely a coincidence that the <i>DeSacia</i> jury convicted for the death of Evangelista, who was a passenger, but acquitted for the death of Hogan, the other driver. As we shall see, contributory negligence is not a defense in a criminal prosecution, see p. 495 infra, but the Kalven and Zeisel study, p. 62 supra, at 242-257, showed that jury nullification often occurred when contributory fault by the victim was involved. If this factor played a role in the acquittal with respect to Hogan, then wasn’t the jury—to quote from <i>Duncan v. Louisiana</i>, p. 55 supra—“serving some of the very purposes for which [it was] created”? Or are the dangers identified by Professor Muller (jury confusion, mistake, inappropriate compromise, and disregard of the reasonable-doubt requirement) more substantial than the risk of chilling the jury’s equity-dispensing function?</p>

The State, in other words, could be relieved altogether of responsibility for proving <i>anything</i> regarding the defendant’s state of mind, provided only that the face of the statute meets the Court’s drafting formulas. . . .

For a critique of its methodology, see Michael H. Walsh, The American Jury: A Reassessment, 79 Yale L.J. 142 (1969). In more recent research, the rate of judge-jury disagreement has been similar to that found in the Kalven-Zeisel study, and evidentiary strength, in combination with other factors, continues to play an important role in explaining the differences. See Valerie P. Hans, What Difference Does a Jury Make?, 3 Yonsei L.J. 36, 42-44 (2012); Amy S.

Thus, if a witness had stated that acquittal by reason of insanity would allow the defendant to “go free,” the trial judge could properly explain that civil commitment would be available to ensure confinement in the event of such a verdict.

On the far left is a dark shape containing the labels, from top to bottom, “Crimes Observed by the Police,” “Crime,” and “Crimes Reported to the Police.” The area at the top but outside of this shape is labeled “Undetected Crimes.” The area at the bottom but outside of the shape is labeled “Unreported Crimes.”</p>
<p id="76614419-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">An area protrudes from the center of this shape and has multiple labeled branches. Five branches flow up toward the top of the diagram and end with text. At each branch the protrusion gets a little smaller. The first branch is labeled “Investigation” and has the following footnote: “May continue until trial.” The branch ends with the text “Unsolved or Not Arrested.” The second branch is labeled “Arrest” and ends with the text “Released Without Prosecution.” The third branch is labeled “Booking” and has the following footnote: “Administrative record of arrest. First step at which temporary release on bail may be available.” The branch ends with the text “Released Without Prosecution.” The fourth branch is labeled “Initial Appearance” and has the following footnote: “Before magistrate, commissioner, or justice of peace. Formal notice of charge, advice of rights. Bail set. Summary trials for petty offenses usually conducted here without further processing.” The branch ends with the text “Charges Dropped or Dismissed.” The fifth branch is labeled “Preliminary Hearing” and has the following footnote: “Preliminary testing of evidence against defendant. Charge may be reduced. No separate preliminary hearing for misdemeanors in some systems.” The branch ends with the text “Charges Dropped or Dismissed.”</p>
<p id="7661441a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The protrusion continues and splits into two paths. The upper path is labeled “Felonies,” and the lower path is labeled “Misdemeanors.”</p>
<p id="7661441b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Felonies:</p>
<p id="7661441c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Felonies path splits into two and shows the following procedural steps. The top is labeled “Information” and has the following footnote: “Charge filed by prosecutor on basis of information submitted by police or citizens. Alternative to grand jury indictment; often used in felonies, almost always in misdemeanors.” The bottom is labeled “Grand Jury” and has the following footnote: “Reviews whether Government evidence sufficient to justify trial. Some States have no grand jury system; others seldom use it.” A line extends from Grand Jury and ends with the text “Refusal to Indict.” The two paths join back together and are labeled “Arraignment,” which has the following footnote: “Appearance for plea; defendant elects trial by judge or jury (if available); counsel for indigent usually appointed here in felonies. Often not at all in other cases.” Here the path splits in four directions with the following labels: “Charge Dismissed,” “Trial,” “Guilty Pleas,” and “Reduction of Charge.” Reduction of charge contains the following footnote: “Charge may be reduced at any time prior to trial in return for plea of guilty or for other reasons.” This branch connects to the Trial stage of the Misdemeanors path. The Trial branch splits into another branch labeled “Acquitted.” The Trial and Guilty Pleas paths then join back together and are labeled “Sentencing.” A path splits off at Sentencing and is labeled “Appeal.” After Sentencing, the path splits again. One branch is labeled “Probation,” and the other branch is labeled “Penitentiary.” An arrow labeled “Revocation” points from Probation to Penitentiary. A branch splits from Penitentiary and is labeled “Habeas Corpus.” It has the following footnote: “Challenge on constitutional grounds to legality of detention. May be sought at any point in process.” The Probation and Penitentiary paths join together again and end at the label “Out of System.” There is a loop from Out of System labeled “Parole” that points back to Penitentiary. From this loop is a second loop labeled “Revocation” that also points back to Penitentiary.</p>
<p id="76616b2d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Misdemeanors:</p>
<p id="76616b2e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This path roughly mirrors the Felonies path with the following stages: Information; Arraignment, which can end in Charge Dismissed; Guilty Pleas; Trial, which can end in Acquitted; and Sentencing. After Sentencing, the path splits into branches labeled “Probation” and “Jail.” An arrow labeled “Revocation” points from Probation to Jail. The two branches join together and end at the label “Out of System.” A branch from Sentencing is labeled “Fine.” An arrow labeled “Nonpayment” points from Fine to Jail. A branch from the original protrusion at the Initial Appearance point is labeled “Petty Offences.” It runs below the Felonies and Misdemeanors paths and joins the Misdemeanors path at Sentencing.</p>
<p id="76616b2f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two branches flow from the original protrusion at the Investigation and Arrest points. These two branches join together and are labeled “Police Juvenile Unit.” It has the following footnote: “Police often hold informal hearings, dismiss or adjust many cases without further processing.” Two branches split off here and are labeled “Release or Station Adjustment” and “Non-Police Referrals.” The path then continues and is labeled “Intake Hearing.” It has the following footnote: “Probation officer decides desirability of further court action.” Two branches split off here and are labeled “Released” and “Juvenile Offenses.” This branch ends at the label “Nonadjudicatory Disposition.” It has the following footnote: “Welfare agency, social services, counselling, medical care, etc., for cases where adjudicatory handling not needed.” The path continues and is labeled “Adjudicatory Hearing.” A branch splits off and is labeled “Released.” The path then splits into branches labeled “Probation” and “Juvenile Institution.” An arrow labeled “Revocation” points from Probation to Juvenile Institution. The two branches rejoin and end at the label “Out of System.” There is a loop from Out of System labeled “Parole” that points back to Juvenile Institution. From this loop is a second loop labeled “Revocation” that also points back to Juvenile Institution.</p>
