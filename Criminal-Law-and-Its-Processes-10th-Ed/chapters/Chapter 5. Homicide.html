<p id="76b7c927-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One may ask two kinds of questions about any category of crime. The first is a question of criminality: What distinguishes criminal from non-criminal behavior? The second is a question of grading: What factors warrant greater or lesser punishment when behavior qualifies as criminal? In the preceding chapter on rape, we dealt primarily with the first question. In this chapter, we deal primarily with the second. The distinction between criminal and non-criminal homicide usually turns on such issues as causation, self-defense, insanity, etc. We will deal separately with these issues in later chapters, because they arise for many different kinds of crimes. The principal focus of the present chapter is on the severity of punishment authorized for homicides that are criminal.</p>
<p id="76b7c928-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Conventional public thinking about criminal law understandably concentrates on the threshold question of guilt versus innocence. The severity of the sentence is obviously important too, but we are less accustomed to thinking of this issue as one governed by rigorous legal analysis. Yet the stakes in determining the <i>degree</i> of punishment are always high, and nowhere more so than when a victim has died. Homicide that seems a product of mere carelessness or extraordinary provocation is often punished by no more than a fine or a few months in jail; at the other extreme, some defendants who kill incur the death penalty or imprisonment for life with no possibility for parole. A society under the rule of law must have clear, objective ways for choosing between these dramatically different alternatives (and the many that fall in between).</p>
<p id="76b7f039-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Legislative grading is accomplished by dividing homicidal conduct into crimes of different names (murder and manslaughter) and by dividing the same crime into different degrees (first-degree and second-degree murder). Following the historical and statutory materials in this introductory section, Section B considers the grading of intended killings and Section C examines the grading of unintended killings. Section C also considers the distinction between involuntary manslaughter and wrongful killings that are not subject to criminal punishment at all. With that last exception, however, the behavior <span title="444" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-444">p. 444</span>in this chapter is always a crime of some sort; the central concern is to determine how much punishment can be imposed. And in addressing that issue, the law has traditionally been preoccupied with two distinct problems. The first, and most obvious, is a <i>substantive</i> problem—which facts determine whether punishment will be more severe. The second problem, though less obvious, is often equally important for lawyers; this is the <i>institutional</i> problem—which decision-making institution (for example, trial judge or jury) has authority to make the controlling assessment of these facts.</p>

<b>BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF MURDER IN ENGLAND</b>
</span>
</p>
<p id="76b7f03e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">72. Homicide is the killing of a human being by a human being. Unlawful homicide may be murder, manslaughter, suicide or infanticide. Murder and manslaughter are felonies at common law and are not defined by statute. The traditional definition or description of murder . . . is in common practice often . . . briefly defined as “unlawful killing with ‘malice aforethought’ ”; while manslaughter is defined as “unlawful killing without ‘malice aforethought.’ ” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76b7f03f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">74. The meaning of “malice aforethought,” which is the distinguishing criterion of murder, is certainly not beyond the range of controversy. The first thing that must be said about it is that neither of the two words is used in its ordinary sense: the phrase “malice aforethought” is now a highly technical term of art. “It is now only an arbitrary symbol. For the ‘malice’ may have in it nothing really malicious; and need never be really ‘aforethought,’ except in the sense that every desire must necessarily come before—though perhaps only an instant before—the act which is desired. The word ‘aforethought,’ in the definition, has thus become either false or else superfluous. The word ‘malice’ is neither; but it is apt to be misleading, for it is not employed in its original (and its popular) meaning.” “Malice aforethought” is simply a comprehensive name for a number of different mental attitudes which have been variously defined at different stages in the development of the law, the presence of any one of which in the accused has been held by the courts to render a homicide particularly heinous and therefore to make it murder. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76b7f040-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">75. We must now consider how “malice aforethought” came to be the distinctive element of murder and to bear such a meaning as is given to it at the present time. . . . It is sufficient to say here that “murder” originally meant a “secret killing” and only gradually, from the fourteenth century onwards, came to be the name of the worst form of homicide characterised <span title="445" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-445">p. 445</span>by “malice prepense” or “malice aforethought.” . . . It seems clear that at this period and for sometime afterwards “malice prepense” or “malice aforethought” was understood to mean a deliberate, premeditated intent to kill formed some time beforehand, and that no killing “on a sudden,” even without provocation or on slight provocation, was considered to be murder. In effect the law regarded unlawful killings as being of only two kinds—killing with malice aforethought and killing on a sudden quarrel. Experience showed, however, that this view was much too simple and the definitions founded upon it inadequate. There were many kinds of killing which should clearly be considered unlawful but which did not fall into either of these categories, and many such cases seemed to deserve the extreme penalty although the offender had no premeditated desire to kill his victim. During the last four centuries the meaning to be given to the term “malice aforethought” has been affected by the changes in the conception of mens rea as a necessary ingredient in criminal liability at common law for all crimes. The courts and the writers of legal textbooks have responded to this change by giving to “malice aforethought” a wider and more technical meaning. As Stephen put it, “the loose term ‘malice’ was used, and then when a particular state of mind came under their notice, the Judges called it ‘malice’ or not, according to their view of the propriety of hanging particular people. That is, in two words, the history of the definition of murder.” There can be no doubt that the term now covers, and has for long covered, all the most heinous forms of homicide, as well as some cases—those of “constructive murder”—whose inclusion in the category of murder has often been criticised.</p>
<p id="76b7f041-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">76. Thus the following propositions are commonly accepted:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-parenlistlcroman">
<li>
<p id="76b7f042-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is murder if one person kills another with intent to do so, without provocation or on slight provocation, although there is no premeditation in the ordinary sense of the word.</p>

<li>
<p id="76b7f043-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is murder if one person is killed by an act intended to kill another.</p>

<li>
<p id="76b7f044-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is murder if a person is killed by an act intended to kill, although not intended to kill any particular individual, as if a man throws a bomb into a crowd of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="76b81755-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is murder if death results from an act which is intended to do no more than cause grievous bodily harm. An early example may be found in the case of Grey, where a blacksmith, who had had words with an apprentice, struck him on the head with an iron bar and killed him. It was held that it “is all one as if he had run him through with a sword” and he was found guilty of murder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="76b81756-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is murder if one person kills another by an intentional act which he knows to be likely to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, although he may not intend to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm and may either be recklessly indifferent as to the results of his act or may even desire that no harm should be caused by it.</p>

</div><p id="76b9282e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Prior to the recodification effort begun by the Model Penal Code, most American jurisdictions maintained a law of murder built around . . .  common-law [concepts]. The most significant departure was the division of murder into degrees, a change initiated by the Pennsylvania legislation of 1794. That statute provided that “all murder, which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary shall be deemed murder in the first degree; and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree.” The thrust of this reform was to confine the death penalty, which was then mandatory on conviction of any common-law murder, to homicides judged particularly heinous. Other states followed the Pennsylvania practice until at one time the vast majority of American <span title="452" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-452">p. 452</span>jurisdictions differentiated degrees of murder and the term “first-degree murder” passed into common parlance.</p></div>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BELL</span>, C.J. The defendant, Carroll, pleaded guilty generally to an indictment charging him with the murder of his wife, and was tried by a judge without a jury. . . . The Court found him guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. [D]efendant took this appeal. The only questions involved are thus stated by the appellant:</p>

</div>
<p id="76b92836-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendant married the deceased in 1955, when he was serving in the Army in California. Subsequently he was stationed in Alabama, and later in Greenland. During the latter tour of duty, defendant’s wife and two children lived with his parents in New Jersey. Because this arrangement proved incompatible, defendant returned to the United States on emergency leave in order to move his family to their own quarters. On his wife’s insistence, defendant was forced first to secure a “compassionate transfer” back to the States, and subsequently to resign from the Army in July of 1960, by which time he had attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. Defendant was a hard worker, earned a substantial salary and bore a very good reputation among his neighbors.</p>
<p id="76b92837-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1958, decedent-wife suffered a fractured skull while attempting to leave defendant’s car in the course of an argument. Allegedly this contributed to her mental disorder which was later diagnosed as a schizoid personality type. In 1959 she underwent psychiatric treatment at the Mental Hygiene Clinic in Aberdeen, Maryland. She complained of nervousness and told the examining doctor “I feel like hurting my children.” This sentiment sometimes took the form of sadistic “discipline” toward their very young children. Nevertheless, upon her discharge from the Clinic, the doctors considered her much improved. With this background we come to the immediate events of the crime.</p>
<p id="76b92838-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In January, 1962, defendant was selected to attend an electronics school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for nine days. His wife greeted this news with violent argument. Immediately prior to his departure for Winston-Salem, at the suggestion and request of his wife, he put a loaded .22 calibre <span title="453" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-453">p. 453</span>pistol on the window sill at the head of their common bed, so that she would feel safe. On the evening of January 16, 1962, defendant returned home and told his wife that he had been temporarily assigned to teach at a school in Chambersburg, which would necessitate his absence from home four nights out of seven for a ten week period. A violent and protracted argument ensued at the dinner table and continued until four o’clock in the morning.</p>

I became angry and more angry especially what she was saying about my kids and myself, and sometime between 3 and 4 o’clock in the morning I remembered the gun on the window sill over my head.

I could see the bruises on him and Michael’s chin was split open, four stitches. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to help my boys. Sometime in there she said something in there, she called me some kind of name. I kept thinking of this. During this time I either thought or felt—I thought of the gun, just thought of the gun. I am not sure whether I felt my hand move toward the gun—I saw my hand move, the next thing—the only thing I can recollect after that is right after the shots or right during the shots. I saw the gun in my hand just pointed at my wife’s head. She was still lying on her back—I mean her side. I could smell the gunpowder and I could hear something—it sounded like running water. I didn’t know what it was at first, didn’t realize what I’d done at first. Then I smelled it. I smelled blood before. . . .

He tried to clean up as well as he could. That night he took his wife’s body, wrapped in a blanket with a rug over it to a desolate place near a trash dump. He then took the children to his parents’ home in Magnolia, New Jersey. He was arrested the next Monday in Chambersburg where he had gone to his teaching assignment.</p>

</p>
<p id="76b94f55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If we consider only the evidence which is favorable to the Commonwealth, it is without the slightest doubt sufficient in law to prove first degree. However, even if we believe all of defendant’s statements and testimony, there is no doubt that this killing constituted murder in the first degree. Defendant first urges that there was insufficient time for premeditation in the light of his good reputation. This is based on an isolated and oft repeated statement in Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9, 16, that “ ‘no time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind the scheme of murder.’ ” Defendant argues that, conversely, a long time is necessary to find premeditation in a “good man.” We find no merit in defendant’s analogy or contention. As Chief Justice Maxey appropriately and correctly said in Commonwealth v. Earnest, 342 Pa. 544, 549-550, 21 A.2d 38, 40: “Whether the intention to kill and the killing, that is, the premeditation and the fatal act, were within a brief space of time or a long space of time is immaterial if the killing was in fact intentional, wilful, deliberate and premeditated.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76b94f56-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant further contends that the time and place of the crime, the enormous difficulty of removing and concealing the body, and the obvious lack of an escape plan, militate against and make a finding of premeditation legally impossible. This is a “jury argument”; it is clear as crystal that such circumstances do not negate premeditation. This contention of defendant is likewise clearly devoid of merit.</p>
<p id="76b94f57-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s most earnestly pressed contention is that the psychiatrist’s opinion of what defendant’s state of mind must have been and was at the time of the crime, clearly establishes not only the lack but also the legal impossibility of premeditation. Dr. Davis, a psychiatrist . . . , testified that defendant was</p>

He knew that if he didn’t accept this teaching assignment in all probability he would be dismissed from the Government service, and at his age and his special training he didn’t know whether he would be able to find employment. More critical to that was the fact that at this point, as we understand it, his wife issued an ultimatum that if he went and gave this training course she would leave him. . . . He was so dependent upon her he didn’t want her to leave. He couldn’t make up his mind what to do. He was trapped. . . .

<p id="76b94f59-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The doctor then gave his opinion that “rage,” “desperation,” and “panic” produced</p>

<p id="76b94f5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There are three answers to this contention. First, . . . neither a judge nor a jury has to believe all or any part of the testimony of the defendant or of any witness. Secondly, the opinion of the psychiatrists was based to a large extent upon statements made to them by the defendant, which need not be believed and which are in some instances opposed by the facts themselves. Thirdly, a psychiatrist’s opinion of a defendant’s impulse or lack of intent or state of mind is, in this class of case, entitled to very little weight, and this is especially so when defendant’s own actions, or his testimony or confession, or the facts themselves, belie the opinion. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76b94f5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s own statement after his arrest, upon which his counsel so strongly relies, as well as his testimony at his trial, clearly convict him of first-degree murder. . . . From his own statements and from his own testimony, it is clear that, terribly provoked by his allegedly nagging, belligerent and sadistic wife, defendant remembered the gun, deliberately took it down, and deliberately fired two shots into the head of his sleeping wife. There is no doubt that this was a willful, deliberate and premeditated murder.</p>
<p id="76b94f5d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While defendant makes no contention that he was insane at the commission of the murder or at any time, what this Court said in Commonwealth v. Tyrrell, 174 A.2d 852, 856-857, is equally appropriate here:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76b9766e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s psychiatrist did not testify that the defendant was insane. What he did say was that because defendant’s wife frequently picked on him and just before the killing insulted or goaded him, defendant had an emotional impulse to kill her which he could not resist. . . . [S]ociety would be almost completely unprotected from criminals if the law permitted a blind or irresistible impulse or inability to control one’s self, to excuse or justify a murder or to reduce it from first degree to second degree. In the times in which we are living, nearly every normal adult human being has moments or hours or days or longer periods when he or she is depressed and disturbed with resultant emotional upset feelings and so-called blind impulses; and the <span title="456" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-456">p. 456</span>young especially have many uncontrolled emotions every day which are euphemistically called irresistible impulses. The Courts of Justice should not abdicate their function and duty of determining criminal responsibility to the psychiatrist.

The two men worked together as dishwashers at Danny’s Rib House in Nitro and got along well together before this incident. On the night of the killing, the victim [and other employees] were joking around while working in the kitchen of the restaurant. The victim was poking fun at the defendant who appeared to be in a bad mood. He told the defendant to “lighten up” and snapped him with a dishtowel several times. Apparently, the victim had no idea he was upsetting the defendant very much. The dishtowel flipped the defendant on the nose and he became enraged.</p>

Mr. Farley looked up and cried: “Man, I was just kidding around.” The defendant responded: “Well, man, you should have never hit me in my face.” . . .

He experiences up to two panic attacks daily and had received treatment for them . . . for more than a year preceding the killing. He suffers from chronic depression (dysthymic disorder), an obsession with his nose (body dysmorphic disorder), and borderline personality disorder. The defendant’s father shed some light on his nose fixation. He stated that dozens of times a day the defendant stared in the mirror and turned his head back and forth to look at his nose. . . . The defendant repeatedly asked for assurances that his nose was not too big.

In hindsight, the defendant believed the better decision would have been to punch out on his time card and quit over the incident. However, all the witnesses related that the defendant was in no way attacked, as he perceived it, but that Mr. Farley was playing around.

Although an elaborate plan or scheme to take life is not required, our <i>Schrader</i> instruction’s notion of instantaneous premeditation and momentary deliberation is not satisfactory for proof of first-degree murder. In Bullock v. United States, 122 F.2d 213, 214 [D.C. Cir. 1941], the court discussed the need to have some appreciable time elapse between the intent to kill and the killing:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76b9c4a3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To speak of premeditation and deliberation which are instantaneous or which take no appreciable time, is a contradiction in terms. . . . Statutes like ours, which distinguish deliberate and premeditated murder from other murder, reflect a belief that one who meditates an intent to kill and then deliberately executes it is more dangerous, more culpable or less capable of reformation than one who kills on sudden impulse; or that the prospect of the death penalty is more likely to deter men from deliberate than from impulsive murder. The deliberate killer is guilty of first degree murder; the impulsive killer is not.</p>

<i>1. Statutory interpretation.</i> Twenty-nine states, D.C., and the federal government currently use the criterion of “premeditation” to identify the most serious murders; <i>Carroll</i> and <i>Guthrie</i> exemplify the differing approaches on how to interpret the term. See Kimberly Kessler Ferzan, Plotting Premeditation’s Demise, 75 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 83, 84 (2012); Matthew A. Pauley, Murder by Premeditation, 36 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 145 (1999).</p>

<i>(a)</i> A majority of those using the premeditation test (roughly 16 jurisdictions) hold that it can be satisfied either an instant before or simultaneously with the act of homicide. Ferzan, supra, at 88. See, e.g., State v. Martin, 859 N.W.2d 600, 606 (S.D. 2015) (“premeditated design . . . may be formed instantly before committing the act”); Annot., 18 A.L.R.4th 961 (2010); Commonwealth v. Jordan, 65 A.3d 318, 323 (Pa. 2013) (“Premeditation and deliberation exist whenever the assailant possesses the conscious purpose to bring about death. [I]ndeed, the design to kill can be formulated in a fraction of a second.”).</p>
<p id="76b9c4ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider Young v. State, 428 So. 2d 155, 158 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982). Defendant and his brother were playing cards with several friends when an argument and then a scuffle broke out. Defendant fired several shots, and two of the men were hit; each died from a single .22 caliber shot to the chest. The court upheld defendant’s conviction on two counts of first-degree murder. Stressing that “[no] appreciable space of time between the formation of the intention to kill and the act of killing” was required, the court said that “[p]remeditation and deliberation may be formed while the killer is ‘pressing the trigger that fired the fatal shot.’ ”</p>

<i>Question:</i> In jurisdictions that follow the <i>Carroll</i> approach, is there a difference between a premeditated intention to kill and an intention to kill without premeditation?</p>
<p id="76b9ebbd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Arizona Supreme Court does not think so. In an attempt to resolve difficulties in defining the premeditation element of first-degree murder, the Arizona legislature amended its statute as follows, Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13-1101(1):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76b9ebbe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Premeditation means that the defendant acts with either the intention or the knowledge that he will kill another human being, when such intention or knowledge precedes the killing by any length of time to permit reflection. Proof of actual reflection is not required, but an act is not done with premeditation if it is the instant effect of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</p>
</div>
<p id="76b9ebbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In State v. Thompson, 65 P.3d 420 (Ariz. 2003), the Arizona Supreme Court could find no difference between intentional killings that are first-degree murders and those that are second-degree if “proof of actual reflection is not required.” It therefore concluded that the statute was arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional, in violation of due process. To save its constitutionality, the court interpreted the statute to require proof of actual reflection.</p>
<p id="76b9ebc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Because the <i>Carroll</i> approach in effect equates “premeditation” with any intent to kill, it eliminates any distinction between first- and second-degree murder when a killing is <i>intentional</i>. But is the <i>Guthrie</i> court correct in concluding that this approach “<i>completely eliminates</i> the distinction between the two degrees of murder”? Is there any kind of <i>unintentional</i> killing that could demonstrate “malice” and thus qualify for a second-degree but not a <span title="460" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-460">p. 460</span>first-degree conviction? Note that common-law courts traditionally have considered a wide range of circumstances sufficient to establish “malice aforethought.” (See the summary of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, pp. 444-445 supra.) In Pennsylvania, these unintentional murders are not eligible for designation as <i>first-degree</i>. Since the <i>Carroll</i> approach does preserve some distinction between first- and second-degree murder, is there some other reason to reject its interpretation of “premeditation”?</p>
<p id="76b9ebc1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> The <i>Guthrie</i> approach distinguishes between mere intent to kill and intent <i>plus</i> premeditation, so as a matter of statutory interpretation it avoids rendering statutory terms superfluous. But it raises two troublesome issues: What kind of evidence is sufficient to establish this more substantial sort of premeditation? And how useful is this sort of premeditation as a basis for distinguishing the worst forms of murder?</p>
<p id="76b9ebc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Policy rationales.</i> Is premeditation relevant because premeditated killings are more culpable, because they are harder to deter, or because planning activity can include precautions to reduce the risk of getting caught? See Michael J. Zydney Mannheimer, Not the Crime But the Cover-Up: A Deterrence-Based Rationale for the Premeditation-Deliberation Formula, 86 Ind. L.J. 879 (2011). Which rationale is consistent with the result in <i>Carroll</i>? With the result in <i>Guthrie</i>?</p>
<p id="76b9ebc3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Proof of premeditation.</i> Jurisdictions that interpret “premeditation” to require actual reflection have to consider what kind of evidence is sufficient to support this finding, particularly when the accused has made no statements indicating that the killing was the result of a preconceived plan. In a leading decision relied on in many jurisdictions, the California Supreme Court (People v. Anderson, 447 P.2d 942 (Cal. 1968)) explained that evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of premeditation generally falls into three basic categories: (1) facts regarding the defendant’s behavior prior to the killing that might indicate a design to take life (“planning” activity); (2) facts about the defendant’s prior relationship with the victim that might indicate a reason to kill (“motive”); and (3) evidence that “the <i>manner</i> of killing was so particular and exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to a ‘preconceived design.’ ” The court added that “this court sustains verdicts of first degree murder typically when there is evidence of all three types and otherwise requires at least extremely strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with either (1) or (3).”</p>
<p id="76b9ebc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the <i>Guthrie</i> court reversed the defendant’s conviction because of the erroneous instruction, it found the evidence adequate to permit a properly instructed jury to find premeditation under the <i>Anderson</i> standard. On remand, after the jury was instructed under the new test for premeditation, Guthrie was again convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. As of 2016, he had not been granted parole, and his next parole hearing is scheduled for February 1, 2018. Do you <span title="461" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-461">p. 461</span>agree that the <i>Anderson</i> tests were met on the facts of <i>Guthrie</i>? Could they be met in the <i>Carroll</i> case?</p>
<p id="76b9ebc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In subsequent decisions, the California Supreme Court has backed away from its view that a finding of premeditation requires particular types of evidence. Instead, the California court now maintains that no specific combination of these classes of evidence is essential and that other types of evidence may also suffice. People v. Solomon, 234 P.3d 501, 517 (Cal. 2010).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN105A7_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N105A7_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">1</a></span> But other jurisdictions continue to approve <i>Anderson</i>’s suggestion that premeditation requires evidence falling in all three categories or in the specified combinations of (1), (2), and (3). See, e.g., Ken v. State, 267 P.3d 567 (Wyo. 2011).</p>

<i>4. Identifying the worst murders. </i>
<b>
<i>(a)</i>
</b> The <i>Anderson</i> case referred to in the previous note involved the brutal murder of a ten-year-old girl. The victim’s brother and mother had returned home one afternoon to find blood on the living room couch. The defendant (who was also living in the house) claimed first that he had cut himself and later that the victim had cut herself. Both claims proved false when the child’s nude body was discovered in another room. Police later found the defendant’s blood-spotted clothing and a knife. The victim’s bloodstained clothes were scattered throughout the house, and there was blood in almost every room except the kitchen, which appeared to have been mopped. Over 60 wounds, extending over the victim’s entire body, were found. Several of the wounds were post-mortem. The California Supreme Court reversed the first-degree murder conviction, finding this evidence insufficient to show premeditation: There was no evidence that defendant planned the killing; nothing in his prior relationship with the victim revealed a motive; and the court said that the manner of killing (by multiple random knife wounds) suggested an explosion of violence rather than a preconceived design to kill.</p>
<p id="76ba12d8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> How do you explain the court’s conclusion? If the result seems unacceptable, is that because the evidence did prove actual premeditation, or because actual premeditation is not an appropriate requirement for identifying the most serious homicides?</p>
<p id="76ba12d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Consider State v. Forrest, 362 S.E.2d 252 (N.C. 1987). The defendant took a pistol with him on a visit to his hospitalized, terminally ill father and, sobbing with emotion, killed his father with a single shot to the head. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the conviction.</p>
<p id="76ba12da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is Forrest more deserving of severe punishment than Guthrie or Anderson? If not, does the court’s decision to uphold his conviction indicate a flaw in its assessment of the evidence of premeditation or a flaw in the concept of premeditation itself?</p>
<p id="76ba12db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="462" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-462">p. 462</span>Consider Samuel H. Pillsbury, Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter 104-105 (1998). Commenting on the California court’s decision to reverse Anderson’s first-degree murder conviction, Professor Pillsbury observes:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ba12dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As a matter of statutory interpretation, the <i>Anderson</i> decision is defensible. Premeditation does seem to involve coolness and calculation, and proof of those was weak at trial. [But] even if we assume the killing was unplanned and impassioned, there were significant aggravating circumstances. . . . The butchering of a child for reasons of sexual frustration and rage . . . ranks high on any intuitive scale of wrongdoing, and may explain why many appellate courts have been so reluctant to take premeditation seriously—it leads to decisions like <i>Anderson.</i> In particular, the case leads us to doubt whether an impassioned decision to kill is necessarily less culpable than a dispassionate one. [D]epending on motivation, an unplanned killing may present a more culpable offense than a reflective killing by a brooding, self-doubting, self-reflective offender. <i>Anderson</i> suggests that what premeditation misses is the moral importance of the motive for the homicide.</p>
</div>
<p id="76ba12dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> Following the lead of the Model Penal Code, some states have rejected premeditation as the basis for identifying murders that deserve the greatest punishment. See, e.g., the New York provisions, pp. 449-450 supra. The rationale of this approach is set out in Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §210.6 at 127-128 (1980):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76ba12de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he case for a mitigated sentence on conviction of murder does not depend on a distinction between impulse and deliberation. Prior reflection may reveal the uncertainties of a tortured conscience rather than exceptional depravity. The very fact of a long internal struggle may be evidence that the homicidal impulse was deeply aberrational and far more the product of extraordinary circumstances than a true reflection of the actor’s normal character. [M]ost mercy killings are the consequence of long and careful deliberation, but they are not especially appropriate cases for imposition of capital punishment. . . . It also seems clear, moreover, that some purely impulsive murders will present no extenuating circumstances. The suddenness of the killing may simply reveal callousness so complete and depravity so extreme that no hesitation is required.</p>

Petitioner argues that manslaughter is a catchall for homicides which are criminal but that lack the malice essential for a conviction of murder. [He] argues . . . that the categories of provocation adequate to mitigate should be broadened to include factual situations such as this one.

Although we agree with the trial judge that there was needless provocation by Joyce, we also agree with him that the provocation was not adequate to mitigate second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter.</p>

That standard of reasonableness has not been met here. We cannot in good conscience countenance holding that a verbal domestic argument ending in the death of one spouse can result in a conviction of manslaughter. [S]ocial necessity dictates our holding.

<span class="epub-small-caps">CHRISTIANCY</span>, J. The prisoner was charged with an assault with intent to kill and murder one Patrick Hunt. [The prosecution’s evidence was that defendant entered a saloon in an agitated manner, approached Hunt, said something unintelligible to him, and shot him, inflicting a non-fatal wound <span title="465" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-465">p. 465</span>“in and through the left ear.” Maher offered evidence to show an adulterous intercourse between his wife and Hunt less than an hour before the assault. He had followed his wife and Hunt as they entered the woods together, and when they left a half hour later, he followed Hunt to the saloon; just before he entered the saloon a friend told him that Hunt and his wife had had intercourse in the woods the day before. The trial court ruled this evidence inadmissible, and the jury convicted Maher of assault with intent to murder.]</p>
<p id="76ba6118-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Was the evidence properly rejected? This is the main question in the case, and its decision must depend upon the question whether the proposed evidence would have tended to reduce the killing—had death ensued—from murder to manslaughter. . . . If the homicide—in case death had ensued—would have been but manslaughter, then defendant could not be guilty of the assault with intent to murder, but only of a simple assault and battery. The question therefore involves essentially the same principles as where evidence is offered for a similar purpose in a prosecution for murder. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba6119-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[W]ithin the principle of all the recognized definitions [of malice aforethought], the homicide must, in all ordinary cases, have been committed with some degree of coolness and deliberation or, at least, under circumstances in which ordinary men . . . would not be liable to have their reason clouded or obscured by passion; and the act must be prompted by, or the circumstances indicate that it sprung from, a wicked, depraved or malignant mind. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba611a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But if the act of killing, though intentional, be committed under the influence of passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or reasonable provocation, and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control, and is the result of the temporary excitement, by which the control of reason was disturbed, rather than of any wickedness of heart or cruelty or recklessness of disposition: then the law, out of indulgence to the frailty of human nature, or rather, in recognition of the laws upon which human nature is constituted, very properly regards the offense as of a less heinous character than murder, and gives it the designation of manslaughter.</p>
<p id="76ba882b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To what extent the passions must be aroused and the dominion of reason disturbed to reduce the offense from murder to manslaughter, the cases are by no means agreed. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba882c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The principle involved . . . would seem to suggest as the true general rule that reason should, at the time of the act, be disturbed or obscured by passion to an extent which might render ordinary men, of fair average disposition, liable to act rashly or without due deliberation or reflection, and from passion, rather than judgment.</p>
<p id="76ba882d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To the question, what shall be considered in law a reasonable or adequate provocation for such state of mind, so as to give to a homicide, committed under its influence, the character of manslaughter? On principle, the answer, as a general rule, must be, anything the natural tendency of which would be to produce such a state of mind in ordinary men, and which the jury are satisfied did produce it in the case before them—not such a provocation as must, by the <span title="466" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-466">p. 466</span>laws of the human mind, produce such an effect with the certainty that physical effects follow from physical causes; for then the individual could hardly be held morally accountable. Nor, on the other hand, must the provocation, in every case, be held sufficient or reasonable, because such a state of excitement has followed from it; for then, by habitual and long continued indulgence of evil passions, a bad man might acquire a claim to mitigation which would not be available to better men, and on account of that very wickedness of heart which, in itself, constitutes an aggravation both in morals and in law.</p>
<p id="76ba882e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In determining whether the provocation is sufficient or reasonable, ordinary human nature, or the average of men recognized as men of fair average mind and disposition, should be taken as the standard. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba882f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is doubtless, in one sense, the province of the court to define what, in law, will constitute a reasonable or adequate provocation, but not, I think, in ordinary cases, to determine whether the provocation proved in the particular case is sufficient or reasonable. This is essentially a question of fact, and to be decided with reference to the peculiar facts of each particular case. . . . [J]urors from the mode of their selection, coming from the various classes and occupations of society, and conversant with the practical affairs of life, are, in my opinion, much better qualified to judge of the sufficiency and tendency of a given provocation and much more likely to fix, with some degree of accuracy, the standard of what constitutes the average of ordinary human nature, than the judge whose habits and course of life give him much less experience of the workings of passion in the actual conflicts of life.</p>
<p id="76ba8830-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge, it is true, must, to some extent, assume to decide upon the sufficiency of the alleged provocation, when the question arises upon the admission of testimony, and when it is so clear as to admit of no reasonable doubt upon any theory, that the alleged provocation could not have had any tendency to produce such state of mind, in ordinary men, he may properly exclude the evidence; but, if the alleged provocation be such as to admit of any reasonable doubt, whether it might not have had such tendency, it is much safer, I think, and more in accordance with principle, to let the evidence go to the jury under the proper instructions. . . . The law can not with justice assume by the light of past decision, to catalogue all the various facts and combinations of facts which shall be held to constitute reasonable or adequate provocation. Scarcely two past cases can be found which are identical in all their circumstances; and there is no reason to hope for greater uniformity in future. Provocations will be given without reference to any previous model, and the passions they excite will not consult the precedents.</p>
<p id="76ba8831-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The same principles which govern, as to the extent to which the passions must be excited and reason disturbed, apply with equal force . . . to the question of cooling time. This, like the provocation itself, must depend upon the nature of man and the laws of the human mind, as well as upon the nature and circumstances of the provocation. . . . I am aware there are <span title="467" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-467">p. 467</span>many cases in which it has been held a question of law, but I can see no principle on which such a rule can rest. The court should, I think, define to the jury the principles upon which the question is to be decided, and leave them to determine whether the time was reasonable under all the circumstances of the particular case. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba8832-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It remains only to apply these principles to the present case. The proposed evidence, in connection with what had already been given, would have tended strongly to show the commission of adultery by Hunt with the prisoner’s wife, within half an hour before the assault; that the prisoner saw them going to the woods together, under circumstances calculated strongly to impress upon his mind the belief of the adulterous purpose; that he followed after them to the woods; that Hunt and the prisoner’s wife were, not long after, seen coming from the woods, and that the prisoner followed them, and went in hot pursuit after Hunt to the saloon, and was informed by a friend on the way that they had committed adultery the day before in the woods. I can not resist the conviction that this would have been sufficient evidence of provocation to go to the jury, and from which, when taken in connection with the excitement and “great perspiration” exhibited on entering the saloon, the hasty manner in which he approached and fired the pistol at Hunt, it would have been competent for the jury to find that the act was committed in consequence of the passion excited by the provocation, and in a state of mind which, within the principle already explained, would have given to the homicide had death ensued, the character of manslaughter only. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76ba8833-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>
<p id="76ba8834-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span class="epub-small-caps">MANNING</span>, J. I differ from my brethren in this case. I think the evidence was properly excluded. To make that manslaughter which would otherwise be murder, the provocation—I am not speaking of its sufficiency, but of the provocation itself—must be given in the presence of the person committing the homicide. . . . Any other rule in an offense so grave as taking the life of a fellow-being, in the heat of passion, I fear would be more humane to the perpetrator than wise in its effects on society. More especially since the abolition of the death penalty for murder, and the division of the crime into murder in the first and second degree there is not now the same reason, namely, the severity of the punishment, for relaxing the rules of law in favor of a party committing homicide as before. It would, it seems to me, be extremely mischievous to let passion engendered by suspicion, or by something one has heard, enter into and determine the nature of a crime committed while under its influence. The innocent as well as the guilty, or those who had not as well as those who had given provocation, might be the sufferers. If it be said that in such cases the giving of the provocation must be proved or it would go for nothing; the answer is, that the law will not, and should not permit the lives of the innocent to be exposed with the guilty in this way, as it would do did it not require the cause of the provocation to occur in the presence of the person committing the homicide.</p>

<i>1.</i> <i>What is legally adequate provocation?</i> The <i>Girouard</i> and <i>Maher</i> cases present contrasting approaches to provocation. The former, reflecting the predominant common-law position, maintains that only a few specific circumstances can serve as legally adequate provocation. See, e.g., Riggs v. State, 138 So. 3d 1014, 1024 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013) (recognizing only three situations: “(1) when the accused witnesses his or her spouse in the act of adultery; (2) when the accused is assaulted or faced with an imminent assault on himself; and (3) when the accused witnesses an assault on a family member or close relative”); People v. Garcia, 651 N.E.2d 100, 110 (Ill. 1995) (recognizing only “substantial physical injury or substantial physical assault, mutual quarrel or combat, illegal arrest, and adultery with the offender’s spouse”). And jurisdictions that follow this categorical approach rarely consider insulting words to be sufficient. Annot., 2 A.L.R.3d 1292 (2005). But the prevailing view that words cannot suffice has been softened in many jurisdictions to allow an exception when the words provoke, not simply because they are insulting, but because they disclose facts that could be sufficient if the defendant had observed them directly—for example, when the words disclose an act of adultery. The <i>Maher</i> approach, in contrast, holds that provoking circumstances need not conform to any pre-established categories and that it is normally a question for the jury to decide whether the facts as a whole demonstrate sufficient provocation. Although this remains the minority view, several American jurisdictions follow it. See, e.g., People v. Beltran, 301 P.3d 1120, 1127-1129 (Cal. 2013). For a review and assessment of American law, see Victoria Nourse, Passion’s Progress: Modern Law Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106 Yale L.J. 1331 (1999).</p>

<i>2. Rationale of the provocation defense.</i> A variety of rationales for the mitigating effect of provocation have been offered. They are critically reviewed in Mitchell N. Berman &amp; Ian P. Farrell, Provocation Manslaughter as Partial Justification and Partial Excuse, 52 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1027 (2011). The two most common rationales are grounded in the notion of either partial justification or partial excuse. Self-defense when an actor kills as a necessary measure to protect himself from an unlawful and imminent threat of great bodily harm is a classic example of a justification. In contrast, a killing is certainly not <i>justified</i> merely because the killer was insane; insanity is a classic example of an excuse. We explore the differences between justifications and excuses in greater detail in Chapter 8. Professor Vera Bergelson explains the fundamental distinction (Justification or Excuse? Exploring the Meaning of Provocation, 42 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 307, 307 (2009)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76baaf49-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justifications focus on the wrongfulness of an act; excuses focus on the culpability of the actor. [W]hen we say that a perpetrator is excused, we wholly <span title="469" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-469">p. 469</span>condemn what he did and forgive him merely because of his reduced volitional or cognitive capacity. When we say that the perpetrator is justified, even in part, we treat him as a fully responsible agent and acknowledge that what he did was right or at least not entirely wrong. . . .

<p id="76baaf4a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Which of these concepts best explains the law’s willingness to mitigate punishment in the classic instances of provocation cited in <i>Girouard</i> (“serious abuse of a close relative . . . or the sudden discovery of a spouse’s adultery”)? Are defendants in those situations partially <i>justified</i> in responding with lethal force? Or are their actions entirely wrong but partially <i>excusable</i> because they lacked their usual ability to exercise self-control? Consider these efforts to explain the basis of the provocation defense:</p>
<p id="76baaf4b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Provocation as partial excuse.</i> Consider United States v. Roston, 986 F.2d 1287, 1294 (9th Cir. 1993) (Boochever, J., concurring):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76baaf4c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[Some observers speak as if] the provocation must be such as would “arouse a reasonable and ordinary person to kill someone.” But “a reasonable person does not kill even when provoked. . . . ” Model Penal Code §210.3 cmt. 5(a), at 56 (1980). The Model Criminal Jury Instructions for the Ninth Circuit set forth . . . a more appropriate standard: “Provocation, in order to be adequate, must be such as might naturally cause a reasonable person in the passion of the moment to lose self-control and act on impulse and without reflection.” This standard does not imply that reasonable people kill, but rather focuses on the degree of passion sufficient to reduce the actor’s ability to control his actions.</p>

The proper focus is placed on the defendant’s state of mind, not on his particular act. To be adequate, the provocation must be one that would cause an emotion so intense that an ordinary person would simply <i>react</i>, without reflection.</p>

<p id="76baaf50-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Law students often, and courts on occasion, speak about provocation as requiring a judgment that the defendant did as the reasonable person would do in the situation. [H]owever, this is clearly incorrect. [The adequately provoked defendant] has committed a serious crime. No matter how we define the reasonable person, the adjective describes a law-abiding individual. We do not expect a law-abiding person to commit a felony, let alone a serious crime of homicidal violence. [A] finding of provocation does not represent a judgment that the defendant’s conduct was in any sense morally acceptable.</p>

While it is true, it is also beside the point, that most men do not kill on even the gravest provocation; the point is that the more strongly they would be moved to kill by circumstances of the sort which provoked the actor to the homicidal act, and the more difficulty they would experience in resisting the impulse to which he yielded, the less does his succumbing serve to differentiate his character from theirs. But the slighter the provocation, the more basis there is for ascribing the actor’s act to an extraordinary susceptibility to intense passion, to an unusual deficiency in those other desires which counteract in most men the desires which impel them to homicidal acts, or to an extraordinary weakness of reason, and consequent inability to bring such desires into play.</p>

<i>(b) Provocation as partial justification.</i> Others argue that the provocation defense rests in part on notions of justification. Consider A.J. Ashworth, The Doctrine of Provocation, 35 Cambridge L.J. 292, 307-308 (1976):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bad664-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The term partial justification [is closely related to] the moral notion that the punishment of wrongdoers is justifiable. This is not to argue that it is ever morally right to kill a person who does wrong. Rather, the claim implicit in partial justification is that an individual is to some extent morally justified in making a punitive return against someone who intentionally causes him serious offence, and that this serves to differentiate someone who is provoked to lose his self-control and kill from the unprovoked killer. Whereas the paradigmatic case of murder might be an attack on an innocent victim, the paradigm of provocation generally involves moral wrongs by both parties. [T]he complicity of the victim cannot and should not be ignored, for the blameworthiness of his conduct has a strong bearing on the court’s judgment of the seriousness of the provocation and the reasonableness of the accused’s failure to control himself.</p>

<i>(c) Both or neither?</i> Does it matter which explanation for the defense we choose? Some argue that the underlying rationale of the provocation defense does not have practical consequences. See, e.g., Gabriel J. Chin, Unjustified: The Practical Irrelevance of the Justification/Excuse Distinction, 43 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 79 (2009). Professor Bergelson notes (supra at 309) that “[a]s a product of historical tradition, political compromise, and changing cultural norms, the law often combines elements of more than one rationale.” But she also cautions (id. at 308) that “[k]nowing whether . . . the defendant was right or wrong in what he did and whether society can fairly expect others in his situation to behave differently is essential for society’s collective sense of justice and for people’s ability to make personal decisions.” If so, then should we treat the defendant who kills in response to serious abuse of a close relative <span title="471" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-471">p. 471</span>as partially justified or partially excused?

Sent to his room, the boy grabbed a shotgun, waited ten minutes in his room, and then shot and killed his grandfather. Tried as an adult, the boy was convicted of murder, after the trial judge refused to instruct the jury on the provocation defense. The state supreme court affirmed. Although noting that “an overt threatening act or a physical encounter may constitute sufficient legal provocation,” the court held that rule inapplicable because “Appellant’s guardian . . . was legally entitled to paddle him,” and therefore “we decline to hold that a child has sufficient legal provocation to use deadly force against a guardian who disciplines through corporal punishment.” Id. at 168.

Reasonable people do not kill no matter how much they are provoked, and even enraged people generally retain the capacity to control homicidal or any other kind of aggressive or antisocial desires. We cheapen both life and our conception of responsibility by maintaining the provocation/passion mitigation. This may seem harsh and contrary to the supposedly humanitarian reforms of the evolving criminal law. But this . . . interpretation of criminal law history is morally <span title="472" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-472">p. 472</span>mistaken. It is humanitarian only if one focuses sympathetically on perpetrators and not on their victims, and views the former as mostly helpless objects of their overwhelming emotions and irrationality. This sympathy is misplaced, however, and is disrespectful to the perpetrator. As virtually every human being knows because we all have been enraged, it is easy not to kill, even when one is enraged.</p></div>

One school of thought holds that anger cannot ethically afford any ground for mitigating the gravity of deliberately violent action, or at any rate violent action which threatens life. . . . Nevertheless, a killing in anger produced by serious wrongdoing is ethically less wicked, and therefore deserving of a lesser punishment, than say, a killing out of greed, lust, jealousy or for political reasons. . . . There is a distinction in moral blameworthiness between overreaction to grave provocation and unprovoked use of violence. . . .

<i>(b) Recent reforms.</i>
</b> In a move that is rare among common-law jurisdictions, three Australian states recently abolished the provocation defense; defendants who kill in response to reasonable provocation are therefore subject to conviction for murder. For an assessment of these reforms, see Carolyn B. Ramsey, Provoking Change: Comparative Insights on Feminist Homicide Law Reform, 100 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 33 (2010).</p><p id="76bafd92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> If a jurisdiction abolishes the provocation defense, what punishment should be imposed on defendants convicted of murder? Should provoked defendants face the same punishment as defendants who kill in cold blood, or should judges be authorized to extend some form of leniency when the killing is the result of “reasonable” provocation? If the latter, has the provocation defense been <i>abolished</i> or merely <i>moved</i> to a different place in the criminal process? If provocation should be taken into account in some fashion, where and how is this best accomplished?</p><p id="76bafd93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">

<i>4. Sexual infidelity as provocation.</i>
</b> <b>
<i>(a)</i>
</b> Why has the law traditionally regarded sexual infidelity as adequate provocation? What does it share with the other categories that the common law allowed—for example, serious physical assault, mutual combat, and illegal arrest? For discussion of the cultural presuppositions of voluntary manslaughter doctrine, see Donna K. Coker, Heat of Passion and Wife Killing: Men Who Batter/Men Who Kill, 2 S. Cal. Rev. L. &amp; Women’s Stud. 71 (1992). Note that women seldom kill their unfaithful male partners. Does this fact have a bearing on the reasonableness of a husband’s loss of self-control in response to unfaithfulness by his wife?</p><p id="76bb24a5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although the <i>Girouard</i> court mentions “sudden discovery of a spouse’s adultery” as an allowable form of provocation in Maryland, this rule prompted a public outcry in 1994 when Keith Peacock killed his unfaithful wife, was convicted of manslaughter, and was sentenced only to an 18-month term in a work-release program. In response, Maryland amended its law to provide that “discovery of one’s spouse engaged in sexual intercourse with another person does not constitute legally adequate provocation for the purpose of mitigating a killing from the crime of murder to voluntary manslaughter.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108CA_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N108CA_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">4</a></span> The British Parliament enacted a similar provision in 2009.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN108D2_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N108D2_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">5</a></span> But few other common-law jurisdictions have taken this step.</p><p id="76bb24a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> <i>Should</i> the sudden, unexpected discovery of a spouse’s adultery provide the basis for a provocation defense? If not, is that because adultery is (usually) not illegal? Is it because sexual infidelity does not constitute a significant wrong or a significant harm to the deceived spouse? Professor Susan D. Rozelle argues that the provocation defense should be restricted to “defendants who were legally entitled to use some amount of force when they killed,” and accordingly that sudden discovery of a spouse’s adultery should never suffice. Rozelle, Controlling Passion: Adultery and the Provocation Defense, 37 Rutgers L.J. 197, 200 (2005). But Professor Rozelle acknowledges that under this approach, an enraged husband who kills his wife’s rapist (in circumstances not sufficient to establish a privilege to use defensive force) would be guilty of murder. Is that an acceptable result?</p><p id="76bb24a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should the issue be analyzed if provocation is viewed not as a partial justification but rather as a partial excuse? Is a provocation defense inappropriate because an emotionally healthy individual would not become exceptionally upset, would not lose their normal capacity for self-control, upon unexpectedly discovering a spouse’s infidelity? Or is a provocation defense <span title="475" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-475">p. 475</span>inappropriate because society must condemn and forcefully deter the response of the deceived spouse, <i>even if</i> his (or her) loss of self-control is understandable? To what extent should the policy decision be shaped by the fact that defendants who invoke this defense are overwhelmingly male, and that the victims of such killings are overwhelmingly female? For probing discussion of the issues, see Samuel H. Pillsbury, Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter (1998); Carolyn B. Ramsey, Provoking Change: Comparative Insights on Feminist Homicide Law Reform, 100 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 33 (2010); Coker, supra.</p><p id="76bb24aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>
<i>(b)</i>
</b> Courts that permit sexual infidelity to qualify for a heat-of-passion defense often interpret the boundaries of this category narrowly. In State v. Simonovich, 688 S.E.2d 67, 72 (N.C. Ct. App. 2010), the defendant killed his wife in a rage after she admitted to past acts of adultery and taunted him, stating that she intended to continue having sex with other men. The court held that the defendant was not entitled to voluntary manslaughter instructions, because he had not discovered his wife “in the very act of intercourse.” In Dennis v. State, 661 A.2d 175 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1995), the defendant, after observing his wife, her dress raised, in a sexual embrace with another man, burst into the room and fatally shot the other man. The court held it proper to instruct the jury that the circumstances could qualify as legally adequate provocation only if the defendant had seen sexual intercourse, not other sorts of sexual contact. State v. Turner, 708 So. 2d 232 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997), was an unusual case in which an enraged woman shot and killed a sexually unfaithful man. But the court held that voluntary manslaughter instructions were not required because the defendant and her victim, who had lived together for many years, were not legally married.</p><p id="76bb24ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Does the absence of a formal marriage affect the emotional significance of sexual infidelity when the parties are living together in a long-standing relationship? Does the relevancy of a formal marriage depend on whether provocation is a partial justification or a partial excuse?</p><p id="76bb24ac-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>
<i>5. Same-sex advances as provocative acts.</i>
</b> Trial judges sometimes allow defendants to raise a provocation defense when they have killed in response to an unwelcome, though nonviolent, homosexual advance. Several appellate courts, however, have ruled provocation claims of this sort to be insufficient as a matter of law, e.g., Patrick v. State, 104 So. 3d 1046 (Fla. 2012); Commonwealth v. Pierce, 642 N.E.2d 579 (Mass. 1994). Recent scholarship has also considered “trans panic” provocation defenses; a common fact pattern is the sudden discovery by a man, during sexual intimacy, that his partner is transsexual. See Cynthia Lee &amp; Peter Kwan, The Trans Panic Defense: Masculinity, Heteronormativity, and the Murder of Transgender Women, 66 Hastings L.J. 77 (2014).</p><p id="76bb24ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Why should a proposal to engage in <i>consensual</i> sexual activity, whether from a member of the same or the opposite sex, ever be sufficient provocation to reduce an intentional killing from murder to manslaughter? <span title="476" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-476">p. 476</span>Joshua Dressler argues that there can sometimes be valid, nonhomophobic reasons to permit a provocation defense when an engaged person kills, for example, in response to sexually suggestive touching on an intimate area, because “ordinary, fallible human beings might become so upset that their out of control reaction deserves mitigated punishment.” Dressler, When “Heterosexual” Men Kill “Homosexual” Men: Reflections on Provocation Law, Sexual Advances, and the “Reasonable Man” Standard, 85 J. Crim. Law &amp; Criminology 726 (1995). Can a defendant’s anger or indignation in such cases be disentangled from feelings of homophobia? Compare Robert B. Mison, Comment, Homophobia in Manslaughter: The Homosexual Advance as Insufficient Provocation, 80 Cal. L. Rev. 133 (1992) (opposing Dressler’s view and emphasizing that such a defense is likely to exploit bias against gays and to imply that their lives are less worthy of protection).</p><p id="76bb4bbe-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cynthia Lee takes a third position. In The Gay Panic Defense, 42 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 471, 471 (2008), Professor Lee recognizes that such a defense “promote[s] negative stereotypes about gay men” and “seek[s] to capitalize on unconscious bias in favor of heterosexuality.” Nonetheless, Professor Lee argues, “gay panic” arguments should not be banned in homicide cases; instead, she suggests, the best way for a prosecutor to undermine explicit or implicit arguments of this sort is to permit them to be aired and then to counter them directly. Do you agree? What are the likely advantages and obstacles to implementing her suggestion in the courtroom?</p><p id="76bb4bbf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<b>
<i>6. Cooling time.</i>
</b> The common-law view is that a significant lapse of time between the provocation and the act of killing renders the provocation inadequate “as a matter of law” and therefore deprives the defendant of the right to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. In United States v. Bordeaux, 980 F.2d 534 (8th Cir. 1992), defendant was told, during the course of an all-day drinking party, that Shelby White Bear, also at the party, had raped defendant’s mother 20 years earlier. Later, about midday, defendant’s mother confirmed the report. Sometime during the early evening, defendant and some friends severely beat White Bear and left him lying in a bedroom. Defendant returned to the bedroom shortly afterward, saw White Bear lying on the floor bleeding, and slashed his throat. He then told a friend that he had killed White Bear because of the rape and said he would do it again because “[h]e deserved it.” The court of appeals upheld the trial judge’s refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter and affirmed the conviction of murder. The court said that because the revelation of the rape had occurred much earlier in the day, and because the fatal act was committed “well after” the beating of White Bear had ended, there was “no rational basis for the jury to find that Bordeaux killed White Bear in the heat of passion. . . . ”</p><p id="76bb4bc0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The cooling-time limitation can sometimes be surmounted by arguing that an event immediately preceding the homicide rekindled an earlier provocation. But many courts refuse to take note of “rekindling.” Consider State v. Gounagias, 153 P. 9 (Wash. 1915). The deceased had committed an act of forcible sodomy upon the defendant and then bragged to others about it. Those <span title="477" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-477">p. 477</span>who heard of the episode repeatedly ridiculed the defendant, and after two weeks he finally lost control and killed the man who had assaulted him. The defendant argued that the cumulative effect of the taunts, reminding him of the previous provocation, led to a sudden heat of passion. But the court held that the legally sufficient provoking event had occurred two weeks before the killing and that the interval constituted adequate cooling time as a matter of law. Many modern courts are similarly unwilling to allow “rekindling” of prior provocation. In Commonwealth v. LeClair, 708 N.E.2d 107 (Mass. 1999), a man had for several weeks suspected his wife of infidelity and upon suddenly confirming his suspicions, he strangled her in a rage. The court held that his prior suspicions provided adequate cooling time, and therefore no manslaughter instructions were required. Some courts, however, permit the jury to make the judgment whether sufficient cooling time has elapsed. Thus, in People v. Berry, 556 P.2d 777 (Cal. 1976), the provoked defendant waited for his victim in her apartment for 20 hours before killing her. The court held that the defendant was nevertheless entitled to a manslaughter instruction, because the jury could find that the defendant’s heat of passion resulted from a long-smoldering prior course of provocative conduct by the victim, the passage of time serving to aggravate rather than cool defendant’s agitation.</p></div>

<p id="76bb4bc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Derivative provocation.</i> Three friends, Nathan, Matt, and Talia, are having a drink at the local bar when suddenly the conversation becomes acrimonious. Nathan sics his little dog, Spot, on Matt, and while Matt is struggling with the dog and screaming with fear and anger, Nathan cruelly tells Matt the lie that Spot has never had a rabies inoculation. Talia thinks it’s all very funny and laughs uproariously. Matt becomes enraged and shoots both Nathan and Talia dead. Assuming Matt is entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction in a prosecution for the murder of Nathan (query: Would he be?), is he also entitled to such an instruction in a prosecution for the murder of Talia?</p>
<p id="76bb4bc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Misdirected reaction.</i> In State v. Mauricio, 568 A.2d 879 (N.J. 1990), a bouncer forcefully ejected the defendant from a bar. He slammed defendant against a wall and then kicked and pushed him down the stairs, making him hit his head sharply on the floor. Expecting the bar to close shortly (it was 2:30 <span class="epub-small-caps">A.M.</span>), defendant waited outside for the bouncer to emerge. About five minutes later, a patron who had not been involved in the fight left the bar. Defendant mistook the patron for the bouncer, followed him, and shot him dead. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed a murder conviction, holding that the trial judge had erred in refusing to give voluntary manslaughter instructions. <span title="478" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-478">p. 478</span>Several states would reach the same result by statute. See, e.g., Pa. Stat. §2503(a)(2), p. 448 supra. Are these results sound if the provocation defense is designed to afford mitigation for partially justified killings? Or do these results suggest that provocation must be viewed as a partial excuse? Compare Tex. Penal Code §19.02, requiring the provocation be given “by the individual killed or another acting with the person killed.”</p>
<p id="76bb4bc6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Intentionally killing a non-provoking victim.</i> Suppose that the person killed is not associated with the provoker and is not the accidental victim of anger directed against the provoker. Should a justifiably enraged defendant be able to claim mitigation to manslaughter when he knows that the person he intends to kill is an innocent bystander? In Rex v. Scriva, [1951] Vict. L.R. 298, a father observed an automobile driver knock down and severely injure his daughter. When the father, brandishing a knife, went after the driver, a bystander attempted to restrain him, and the father then fatally stabbed the bystander. In People v. Spurlin, 202 Cal. Rptr. 663 (Ct. App. 1984), the defendant killed his wife after an intense argument over their respective sexual escapades, and still in a rage, killed his sleeping nine-year-old son. In both <i>Scriva</i> and <i>Spurlin</i>, the courts held that a provocation defense was unavailable on the charges of murdering the non-provoking victims.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10961_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10961_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">6</a></span> In accord, People v. Verdugo, 236 P.3d 1035, 1061 (Cal. 2010), holds that “[t]he provocation which incites the defendant to homicidal conduct in the heat of passion must be caused by the victim, or be conduct reasonably believed by the defendant to have been engaged in by the victim.”</p>
<p id="76bb4bc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are these holdings sound? If a defendant claiming provocation must show that the killing was partially <i>justified</i> by the victim’s wrongful conduct, then <i>Scriva</i> and <i>Spurlin</i> are obviously correct. But courts often permit a provocation defense when the defendant’s loss of control is merely <i>excusable.</i> Are the decisions in <i>Scriva</i> and <i>Spurlin</i> appropriate on the ground that a loss of self-control is understandable <i>only</i> when it prompts violence directed against the actual or perceived provoker? Compare R.S. O’Regan, Indirect Provocation and Misdirected Retaliation, 1968 Crim. L. Rev. 319, 323: “Once an accused loses his self-control it is unreal to insist that his retaliatory acts be directed only against his provoker. When his reason has been dethroned a man cannot be expected . . . ‘to guide his anger with judgment.’ ” For a detailed analysis that probes the psychological dynamics of provocation, see Rebecca Hollander-Blumoff, Crime, Punishment, and the Psychology of Self-Control, 61 Emory L.J. 501 (2012); Reid Griffith Fontaine, Adequate (Non)Provocation and Heat of Passion as Excuse Not Justification, 43 U.

<i>2. Defendants who elicit provocation.</i> In Regina v. Johnson, [1989] 2 All E.R. 839, defendant had threatened and insulted Roberts; Roberts responded by pouring beer over the defendant’s head, pinning him to a wall, and then punching him. Defendant drew a knife and fatally stabbed Roberts. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury on provocation, ruling that it was “difficult to see how a man who excites provocative conduct can in turn rely on it as provocation in the criminal law.” The appellate court reversed, stating, “[W]e find it impossible to accept that the mere fact that a defendant caused a reaction in others, which in turn led him to lose his self-control, should result in the issue of provocation being kept outside a jury’s consideration.” Some American statutes preclude the defense in these circumstances.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10993_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10993_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">7</a></span> E.g., Or.

<span class="epub-small-caps">JASEN</span>, J. . . . On February 28, 1977, Victoria Lo Consolo was brutally murdered. Defendant Victor Casassa and Miss Lo Consolo . . . met in August, 1976, as a result of their residence in the same apartment complex. . . . The two apparently dated casually . . . until November, 1976, when Miss Lo Consolo informed defendant that she was not “falling in love” with him. Defendant claims that Miss Lo Consolo’s candid statement of her feelings “devastated him.”</p>
<p id="76bb72e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Miss Lo Consolo’s rejection of defendant’s advances also precipitated a bizarre series of actions on the part of defendant which, he asserts, demonstrate the existence of extreme emotional disturbance upon which he predicates his affirmative defense. Defendant, aware that Miss Lo Consolo maintained social relationships with others, broke into the apartment below Miss Lo Consolo’s on several occasions to eavesdrop. These eavesdropping sessions allegedly caused him to be under great emotional stress. Thereafter, on one occasion, he broke into Miss Lo Consolo’s apartment while she was out . . . , disrobed and lay for a time in Miss Lo Consolo’s bed. During this break-in, defendant was armed with a knife which, he later told police, he carried “because he knew that he was either going to hurt Victoria or Victoria was going to cause him to commit suicide.”</p>
<p id="76bb72e3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant’s final visit to his victim’s apartment occurred on February 28, 1977. Defendant brought several bottles of wine and liquor with him to offer as a gift. Upon Miss Lo Consolo’s rejection of this offering, defendant produced a steak knife which he had brought with him, stabbed Miss Lo <span title="480" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-480">p. 480</span>Consolo several times in the throat, dragged her body to the bathroom and submerged it in a bathtub full of water to “make sure she was dead.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bb98f4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant [was charged with second-degree murder. He] waived a jury and proceeded to trial before the County Court. . . . The defendant did not contest the underlying facts of the crime. Instead, the sole issue presented to the trial court was whether the defendant, at the time of the killing, had acted under the influence of “extreme emotional disturbance.” The defense presented only one witness, a psychiatrist, who testified, in essence, that the defendant had become obsessed with Miss Lo Consolo and that the course which their relationship had taken, combined with several personality attributes peculiar to defendant, caused him to be under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the killing.</p>
<p id="76bb98f5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In rebuttal, the People produced . . . a psychiatrist who testified that although the defendant was emotionally disturbed, he was not under the influence of “extreme emotional disturbance” within the meaning . . . of the Penal Law, because his disturbed state was not the product of external factors but rather was “a stress he created from within himself, dealing mostly with a fantasy, a refusal to accept the reality of the situation.”</p>
<p id="76bb98f6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court . . . considered the appropriate test to be whether in the totality of the circumstances the finder of fact could understand how a person might have his reason overcome. Concluding that the test was not to be applied solely from the viewpoint of defendant, the court found that defendant’s emotional reaction at the time of the commission of the crime was so peculiar to him that it could not be considered reasonable so as to reduce the conviction to manslaughter in the first degree. Accordingly, the trial court found defendant guilty of the crime of murder in the second degree. . . . On this appeal defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to afford him the benefit of the affirmative defense of “extreme emotional disturbance.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bb98f7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Section 125.25(1)(a) of the Penal Law provides that it is an affirmative defense to the crime of murder in the second degree where “[t]he defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.” . . . In enacting [this provision], the Legislature adopted the language of the manslaughter provisions of the Model Penal Code. The only substantial distinction between the New York statute and the Model Penal Code is the designation by the Legislature of “extreme emotional disturbance” as an “affirmative defense,” thus placing the burden of proof on this issue upon defendant. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bb98f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The “extreme emotional disturbance” defense is an outgrowth of the “heat of passion” doctrine [but] the new formulation is significantly broader in scope than the “heat of passion” doctrine which it replaced.</p>
<p id="76bb98f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, the “heat of passion” doctrine required that a defendant’s action be undertaken as a response to some provocation which prevented him from reflecting upon his actions. Moreover, such reaction had to be immediate. The existence of a “cooling off” period completely negated any mitigating effect which the provocation might otherwise have had. In <i>Patterson</i>[, 39 N.Y.2d 288], however, this court recognized that “[a]n action influenced by <span title="481" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-481">p. 481</span>an extreme emotional disturbance is not one that is necessarily so spontaneously undertaken. Rather, it may be that a significant mental trauma has affected a defendant’s mind for a substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing subconscious and then inexplicably coming to the fore.” This distinction between the past and present law of mitigation, enunciated in <i>Patterson</i>, was expressly adopted by the trial court and properly applied in this case.</p>
<p id="76bb98fa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The thrust of defendant’s claim, however, concerns a question arising out of another perceived distinction between “heat of passion” and “extreme emotional disturbance” . . . , to wit: whether, assuming that the defense is applicable to a broader range of circumstances, the standard by which the reasonableness of defendant’s emotional reaction is to be tested must be an entirely subjective one. Defendant [claims] that the reasonableness of his “explanation or excuse” should be determined solely with reference to his own subjective viewpoint. [This argument] is misplaced. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bb98fb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[We have] noted that “[the] purpose of the extreme emotional disturbance defense is to permit the defendant to show that his actions were caused by a mental infirmity not arising to the level of insanity, and that he is less culpable for having committed them.” We also noted that “[the] differences between the present New York statute and its predecessor . . . can be explained by the tremendous advances made in psychology since 1881 and a willingness on the part of the courts, legislators, and the public to reduce the level of responsibility imposed on those whose capacity has been diminished by mental trauma.” . . . While it is true that . . . “extreme emotional disturbance” . . . is a lesser form of mental infirmity than insanity, [we have not held] that all mental infirmities not arising to the level of insanity constitute “extreme emotional disturbance” . . . .</p>
<p id="76bb98fc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he Comments to the Model Penal Code, from which the New York statute was drawn, are instructive. The defense of “extreme emotional disturbance” has two principal components—(1) the particular defendant must have “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance,” and (2) there must have been “a reasonable explanation or excuse” for such extreme emotional disturbance, “the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant’s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.” The first requirement is wholly subjective—i.e., it involves a determination that the particular defendant did in fact act under extreme emotional disturbance, that the claimed explanation as to the cause of his action is not contrived or sham.</p>
<p id="76bb98fd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The second component is more difficult to describe—i.e., whether there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance. It was designed to sweep away “the rigid rules that have developed with respect to the sufficiency of particular types of provocation, such as the rule that words alone can never be enough. . . . The ultimate test, however, is objective; there must be ‘reasonable’ explanation or excuse for the actor’s disturbance.” In light of these comments and the necessity of articulating the defense in terms comprehensible to jurors, we conclude that the determination whether there <span title="482" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-482">p. 482</span>was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the subjective, internal situation in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived them at the time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so as to entitle him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder in the second degree to manslaughter in the first degree.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A31_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A31_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">2</a></span> We recognize that even such a description of the defense provides no precise guidelines and necessarily leaves room for the exercise of judgmental evaluation by the jury. This, however, appears to have been the intent of the draftsmen. “The purpose was explicitly to give full scope to what amounts to a plea in mitigation based upon a mental or emotional trauma of significant dimensions, with the jury asked to show whatever empathy it can.” (Wechsler, Codification of Criminal Law in the United States: The Model Penal Code, 68 Col. L. Rev. 1425, 1446.)</p>
<p id="76bbe71f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">By suggesting a standard of evaluation which contains both subjective and objective elements, we believe that the drafters of the code adequately achieved their dual goals of broadening the “heat of passion” doctrine to apply to a wider range of circumstances while retaining some element of objectivity in the process. [The statute] offers the defendant a fair opportunity to seek mitigation without requiring that the trier of fact find mitigation in each case where an emotional disturbance is shown—or as the drafters put it, to offer “room for argument as to the reasonableness of the explanations or excuses offered.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bbe720-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he trial court, in this case, properly applied the statute. The court apparently accepted, as a factual matter, that defendant killed Miss Lo Consolo while under the influence of “extreme emotional disturbance,” a threshold question which must be answered in the affirmative before any test of reasonableness is required. The court, however, also recognized that in exercising its function as trier of fact, it must make a further inquiry into the reasonableness of that disturbance. In this regard, the court considered each of the mitigating factors put forward by defendant, including his claimed mental disability, but found that the excuse offered by defendant was so peculiar to him that it was unworthy of mitigation. The court obviously made a sincere effort to understand defendant’s “situation” and “the circumstances as defendant believed them to be,” but concluded that the murder in this case was the result of defendant’s malevolence rather than an understandable human response deserving of mercy. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that the court erred in so concluding. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bbe721-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our opinion, this statute would not require that the jury or the court as trier of fact find mitigation on any particular set of facts, but, rather, allows the <span title="483" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-483">p. 483</span>finder of fact the opportunity to do so, such opportunity being conditional only upon a finding of extreme emotional disturbance in the first instance. . . .

<i>1. Influence of the MPC.</i> Of the 34 jurisdictions that revised their criminal codes in the post-MPC era, five adopted its provocation proposals almost verbatim (Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, and New York). At least a dozen other states adopted some of the Code’s features, usually the “extreme emotional disturbance” (EED) formulation, but with significant alterations, for example, requiring a provocative act and rejecting the “actor’s situation” language in favor of a more general “reasonableness” standard. See Law Commission Working Paper, Partial Defences to Murder, Appendix F: The Model Penal Code’s Provocation Proposal and Its Reception in the State Legislatures (Law Comm. No. 290) (2010). Altogether, roughly 20 states now employ some version of the EED test. See Caroline Forell, Homicide and the Unreasonable Man, 72 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 597, 603 (2004).</p>
<p id="76bbe726-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Distinctive features of the MPC formula.</i> What was the “provocation” in the <i>Casassa</i> case? Under the MPC standard, does emotional disturbance require manslaughter instructions even when the disturbance is not attributable to any provocative behavior at all? Consider State v. White, 251 P.2d 820 (Utah 2011). After a troubled marriage, Brenda and Jon White divorced. Brenda won ownership of their house in the divorce settlement but had difficulty meeting the mortgage payments, in part because Jon allegedly failed to provide child support and other financial assistance. After mounting stress because of the financial difficulties and other problems, Brenda one day drove to Jon’s place of work, and when he emerged into the parking lot, she drove toward him at high speed, striking him twice with her vehicle and nearly killing him. In a prosecution for attempted murder, she argued for an EED defense on the ground that mounting anger and grief had caused her to lose control of her emotions. An intermediate appellate court held that the defense was properly denied because “defendant’s loss of control [must] be in reaction to a highly provocative triggering event . . . contemporaneous with the defendant’s loss of self-control.” The Utah Supreme Court reversed, holding that an EED defense may be based on “a significant mental trauma [that] has affected the defendant’s mind for a substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing subconscious and then inexplicably coming to the fore.” Id. at 823, 827. Is this the correct interpretation of the MPC standard? If so, is the standard itself too broad?</p>
<p id="76bc0e37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In State v. Elliot, 177 Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), the defendant had for years suffered from an overwhelming fear of his brother. One day, for no apparent reason, he appeared at his brother’s house and killed him. His attempt to raise an EED defense was denied at trial, and he was convicted of murder, but the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed, holding that under <span title="484" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-484">p. 484</span>Connecticut’s statute (based on the MPC), EED instructions were required. The court said:</p>

<p id="76bc3548-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[T]he defense does not require a provoking or triggering event. [T]o establish the “heat of passion” defense a defendant had to prove that the “hot blood” had not had time to “cool off” at the time of the killing. A homicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance, in contrast, is not one which is necessarily committed in the “hot blood” stage, but rather one that was brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused the defendant to brood for a long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation.</p>
</div>
<p id="76bc3549-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> If the traditional provocation formula and the EED test produce different results in cases like <i>White</i> and <i>Elliot</i>, which approach is preferable?</p>
<p id="76bc354a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For a study of developments in MPC jurisdictions, see Victoria Nourse, Passion’s Progress: Modern Law Reform and the Provocation Defense, 106 Yale L.J. 1331 (1997). Professor Nourse concludes that the EED test aggravates the provocation defense’s unfairness to women by greatly expanding the kinds of frictions in intimate settings that may suffice to reduce a killing from murder to manslaughter. A particularly frequent and disturbing scenario is the “separation killing,” one that occurs when a man reacts violently to his domestic partner’s decision to move out or file for divorce. Professor Nourse found that trial courts frequently permitted defendants in such cases to present an EED claim to the jury, and that no appellate court had held “separation” to be an insufficient basis for such a claim under the EED test. Id. at 1333. On the other hand, there is little evidence that juries find such claims convincing. See Gruber, p.<b></b> 472 supra, at 310-311. One study of EED defenses presented in New York over a ten-year period found that such claims were “very rarely successful.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10A95_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10A95_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">8</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76bc354c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Examples like <i>White</i> and <i>Elliot</i> nonetheless suggest that the EED test is arguably too broad, opening the door to possible mitigation where the traditional common-law approach justifiably precludes it. But are there situations in which the common-law test is too narrow, precluding <i>appropriate</i> mitigation where the EED test would allow it? Consider Boyle v. State, 363 Ark. 356 (2005), where a distraught defendant shot and killed his partner, because she suffered from severe physical ailments and lived in extreme pain. Does Boyle have a claim for mitigation to manslaughter under either the EED or common-law tests? <i>Should</i> Boyle have a claim for mitigation to manslaughter?</p>

<i>3. Roles of judge and jury.</i> In People v. Walker, 473 N.Y.S.2d 460 (App. Div. 1984), the defendant, a drug dealer, received a $4,500 consignment of marijuana from his supplier, William Edmunds. He failed to pay Edmunds and claimed that he had been robbed of the marijuana. In spite of the defendant’s plea for additional consignments, Edmunds refused to supply him. One evening, the defendant encountered Edmunds in a restaurant. A witness <span title="485" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-485">p. 485</span>heard an angry argument between the two. Edmunds demanded his money, the defendant responded that he did not have any, and Edmunds then asked how he could afford to eat in the restaurant. The defendant replied that Edmunds should give him money, to which Edmunds responded, “The only dough you’re going to get is the dough in that bread.” The defendant was then heard to say, “Take your damn hand out of my plate,” after which he rose, gun in hand, and fired several shots in rapid succession, killing Edmunds.</p>
<p id="76bc354e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At Walker’s trial on murder charges, the judge refused to instruct the jury on an extreme emotional disturbance defense. Was this error? The appellate court affirmed, but a dissenting judge commented:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bc354f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From the evidence presented at the trial the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant killed the deceased in a burst of anger, that a smoldering sense of grievance had been ignited by insulting and contemptuous words and actions. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bc5c60-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Once it is determined that there was “evidence of extreme emotional disturbance,” the controlling rule is clear . . . : “it is for the trier of fact to decide, in light of all the circumstances of the case, whether there exists a reasonable explanation or excuse for the actor’s mental condition.” (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, §210.3, p. 61.) . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bc5c61-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This is not a sympathetic case. The plight of a narcotics dealer cut off from his source of supply, and then subjected to insulting and contemptuous words and actions by his former supplier, is not likely to evoke widespread feelings of acute compassion. Nevertheless, it is clear that the controlling statutory sections were carefully designed to permit the essential judgment on the kind of issue presented here to be made by jurors on the basis of all the circumstances, and not by the trial judge as a matter of law.</p>

<p id="76bc5c66-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The common-law and MPC approaches both contain an objective element—not every defendant who flies off the handle and kills is a candidate for the provocation defense. The loss of self-control must in some sense be “reasonable.” What should that mean? Consider the following:</p>
<p id="76bc5c67-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The MPC solution.</i> As the <i>Casassa</i> opinion points out, the MPC test is whether the defendant acted “under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.” The Code then directs that the determination of the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse shall be made “from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation under the circumstances as he believes them to be.” In explaining this formulation, the Reporter’s Comments state (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §210.3 at 62-63 (1980)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bc5c68-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The word “situation” is designedly ambiguous. On the one hand, it is clear that personal handicaps and some external circumstances must be taken into <span title="486" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-486">p. 486</span>account. Thus, blindness, shock from traumatic injury, and extreme grief are all easily read into the term “situation” . . . for it would be morally obtuse to appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic moral values are not part of the actor’s situation. An assassin who kills a political leader because he believes it is right to do so cannot ask that he be judged by the standard of a reasonable extremist. Any other result would undermine the normative message of the criminal law. In between these two extremes, however, there are matters neither as clearly distinct from individual blameworthiness as blindness . . . nor as integral a part of moral depravity as a belief in the rightness of killing. . . . The proper role of such factors cannot be resolved satisfactorily by abstract definition. . . . The Model Code endorses a formulation that affords sufficient flexibility to differentiate in particular cases between those special aspects of the actor’s situation that should be deemed material for purpose of grading and those that should be ignored. There thus will be room for interpretation of the word “situation,” and that is precisely the flexibility desired. . . . In the end, the question is whether the actor’s loss of self-control can be understood in terms that arouse sympathy in the ordinary citizen. Section 210.3 . . . leaves [this] judgment to the ordinary citizen in the function of a juror. . . .

<i>2. Problems.</i> Consider how the common-law and MPC reasonableness standards would deal with the following special circumstances:</p>
<p id="76bc837a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Culture.</i> Should the defendant’s nationality and cultural background be taken into account? Suppose that the defendant recently emigrated from a country where the provoking circumstances (e.g., marital infidelity or a particular insult) are regarded as far more serious than they are in the United States. Suppose that ordinary people in the immigrant’s country are far more likely to respond violently to such circumstances. Should the defendant’s response be assessed from the perspective of the reasonable person of his cultural background? Or is it more appropriate to hold such a defendant to the standards of self-control that our society expects Americans to exercise?</p>
<p id="76bc837b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In The Queen v. Zhang, [2011] N.I.C.A. 25 (N. Ire. Ct. App.), the defendant had been brought up in China, spoke no English, and lived within the Chinese community in Dublin. When his girlfriend admitted that she had been working as a prostitute, he killed her in a rage. An expert witness for the defense testified that in light of his upbringing and “the concept of face” as understood in Chinese society, her admission was “tantamount to throwing down a gauntlet, challenging his manhood,” and that its effect on a person of his background would be quite different from the effect of such an admission on others in Northern Ireland. The trial judge initially permitted the jury to hear this testimony but ultimately told the jury that the expert’s testimony was not relevant to the question whether “an ordinary man of ordinary self-control would have done what the appellant did.” The court of appeal upheld this instruction and affirmed a conviction for murder. Is this the appropriate standard for assessing whether the circumstances warrant mitigation? <span title="487" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-487">p. 487</span>Compare the views of an Australian justice, dissenting in Masciantonio v. R., 129 Austr. L.R. 575 (High Court Australia, 1995):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bc837c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Without incorporating [the general characteristics of an ordinary person of the same age, race, culture, and background as the accused on the self-control issue] the law of provocation is likely to result in discrimination and injustice. In a multicultural society such as Australia, invocation [of the reasonable-man standard] in cases heard by juries of predominately Anglo-Saxon-Celtic origin almost certainly results in the accused being judged by the standard of self-control attributed to a middle class Australian of Anglo-Saxon-Celtic heritage. . . . If it is objected that [incorporating the characteristics of an ordinary person of the same cultural background as the accused] will result in one law of provocation for one class of persons and another law for a different class, I would answer that that must be the natural consequence of true equality before the law in a multicultural society when the criterion of criminal liability is made to depend upon objective standards of personhood.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> Does the suggested approach—incorporating the characteristics of an ordinary person of the same cultural background as the accused—eliminate discrimination against members of the ethnic minority, or is this approach itself discriminatory? Does it advantage or disadvantage members of that ethnic minority? See James M. Donovan &amp; John Stuart Garth, Delimiting the Culture Defense, 26 Quinnipiac L. Rev. 109, 110 (2007). Compare the problem of cultural background in administering the mistake-of-law defense, p. 349 supra.</p>

<i>(b) Battered women.</i> In State v. McClain, 591 A.2d 652 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1991), defendant shot and killed the man with whom she had lived for nine years in a troubled relationship. Though the man had not physically assaulted her for several years (there had been two beating incidents, several years apart, earlier in the relationship), a psychologist testified that the defendant suffered from battered woman syndrome because a series of psychological humiliations had triggered a mental “breakdown” and led to the killing. The court held that evidence relating to the defendant’s status as a battered woman was “irrelevant on the question of whether the victim’s conduct was adequately provocative because that inquiry requires application of the ‘reasonable person’ test.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10B38_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10B38_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">9</a></span> In accord, see J.C.S., Comment on <i>R. v. Thornton</i>, [1996] Crim. L. Rev. 597, 598:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bc8380-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of an ordinary person suffering from a personality disorder and battered woman syndrome is a difficult one. It could be . . . put to the jury in some such form as: “If you think that she may in fact have lost her self-control, <span title="488" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-488">p. 488</span>you must not convict of murder unless you are sure that a woman, suffering from this personality disorder and from battered woman syndrome but otherwise an ordinary woman, exercising such restraint as could reasonably be expected of a woman in that condition, would not have lost her self-control and done what the accused did.” But this seems substantially to abandon the notion of the reasonable or ordinary person.</p>
</div>
<p id="76bc8381-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For criticism of this approach, see Lawrence S. Lustberg &amp; John V. Jacobi, The Battered Woman as a Reasonable Person: A Critique of the Appellate Division Decision in <i>State v. McClain</i>, 22 Seton Hall L. Rev. 365 (1992). See also State v. Felton, 329 N.W.2d 161, 172-173 (Wis. 1983): “It is proper in applying the objective test . . . to consider how other persons similarly situated with respect to that type, or that history, of provocation would react. [T]he objective test may be satisfied by considering the situation of the ordinary person who is a battered spouse.”</p>

<p id="76bcaa93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Mental disorder.</i> In State v. Klimas, 288 N.W.2d 157 (Wis. Ct. App. 1979), the defendant, after months of intense conflict with his wife, shot and killed her. He claimed to be distraught over the disintegration of his marriage, his wife’s relationship with another man, and her efforts to obtain a divorce. He sought to introduce psychiatric testimony to the effect that he had been suffering severe depression, that events on the day preceding the killing had “overwhelmed” him, and that although not legally insane, he was “a desperate man overwhelmed by a psychotic depressive illness.” The defendant apparently sought to have his conduct assessed from the perspective of a person in that emotional situation. The trial judge ruled the psychiatric evidence irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. In another case, the court held inadmissible the proffered evidence that the defendant was a traumatized Vietnam veteran who had just “snapped” when he heard the sound of an approaching helicopter. People v. Steele, 47 P.3d 225 (Cal. 2002). Are these rulings sound? On what principle?</p>
<p id="76bcaa94-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3.</i> <i>Partial individualization?</i> In D.P.P. v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705, a 15-year-old murder defendant had killed an older man in response to sexual abuse and taunting. The trial judge instructed the jury that in applying the reasonableness standard, they had to consider whether “the provocation was sufficient to make a reasonable man in like circumstances act as the defendant did. Not a reasonable boy, as [counsel for Camplin] would have it, . . . ; it is an objective test—a reasonable man.” The House of Lords held these instructions erroneous. It ruled that in considering the <i>gravity</i> of the provoking words or actions, the reasonable man should be assumed to share “such of the accused’s characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to <span title="489" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-489">p. 489</span>him.” However, in considering the <i>self-control</i> to be exercised, the jury was to apply the standard of a “person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the age and sex of the accused,” without regard to any other special characteristics of the defendant.</p>
<p id="76bcaa95-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The case for considering personal characteristics of the defendant in determining the <i>gravity</i> of the provocation was explained in one of the <i>Camplin</i> opinions as follows: “[The] expression . . . ‘Your character is as crooked as your back’ would have a different connotation to a hunchback . . . and to a man with a back like a ramrod.” The case for not considering personal characteristics in determining the required level of <i>self-control</i> is likewise readily explicable: The law could not allow an exceptionally angry or aggressive person to exercise less self-control than everyone else. But why should the expected degree of self-control be individualized for “the age and sex of the accused”?</p>
<p id="76bcaa96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> With respect to age, the House of Lords said that “to require old heads on young shoulders is inconsistent with the law’s compassion [for] human infirmity.” If that point is well taken, shouldn’t it apply to other unchosen and immutable characteristics, like cultural upbringing (reconsider <i>The Queen v. Zhang</i>, p. 486 supra) or a life-long history of having a short temper?</p>
<p id="76bcaa97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> With respect to gender, the <i>Camplin</i> opinions gave no explanation for mandating an individualized standard of self-control. What is the justification for that feature of the decision? And justified or not, what does it mean? Is the required degree of self-control higher for women than for men, or vice versa? Does our society expect men and women to abide by different standards of self-control? And if so, should the law endorse those expectations?</p>
<p id="76bcaa98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> These difficulties aside, is it <i>feasible</i> to distinguish between personal characteristics relevant to gravity and those relevant to self-control? In Regina v. Smith (Morgan), [2001] 1 A.C. 146, a clinically depressed alcoholic stabbed and killed a friend who had stolen from him. Under the <i>Camplin</i> approach, the trial judge was required to instruct the jury that it should first consider the defendant’s depression and alcoholism in judging the seriousness of the provocation, and then ask how a person with ordinary powers of self-control would have reacted. The “reasonable” person, in other words, was a clinically depressed alcoholic with ordinary powers of self-control. Faced with that prospect, the House of Lords altered course. Noting that the <i>Camplin</i> formula produced “glazed looks” in jurors’ eyes, the House of Lords held that the jury should simply be left to decide whether in all the circumstances “there was some characteristic of the accused . . . which it would be unjust not to take into account.”</p>
<p id="76bcaa99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is this a satisfactory way to preserve an objective but suitably individualized standard? <i>Smith (Morgan)</i> was sharply criticized for inviting “an evaluative free-for-all in which anything that induces sympathy by the same token helps to excuse [and] little more than lip-service is paid to the all-important <span title="490" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-490">p. 490</span>objective (impersonal) standard of the reasonable person.” John Gardner &amp; Timothy Macklen, Compassion Without Respect?

<p id="76bcaa9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d)</i> Responding to such criticism, Parliament endorsed a return to the <i>Camplin</i> approach: The statute now permits a provocation defense only when a defendant <i>D</i> can show that his loss of control was the result of “a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BCC_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BCC_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">10</a></span> The necessary loss of control is established if “a person of <i>D</i>’s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in [all of <i>D</i>’s circumstances other than those whose only relevance to <i>D</i>’s conduct is that they bear on <i>D</i>’s general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint], might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to <i>D.</i>”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10BE3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10BE3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">11</a></span>

<i>4. Problem.</i> In Regina v. Morhall, [1996] 1 A.C. 90, a drug addict, taunted about his addiction, killed the person who was mocking him. How should the relevance of his drug addiction be explained to the jury charged with deciding whether the circumstances qualify for mitigation to manslaughter? Does the British test quoted above or the MPC approach provide a better framework for grading the severity of punishment in such a case?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">LUMMUS</span>, J.

[The only entrance to the club was through a single revolving door. Various rooms were connected by narrow passageways and corridors to one another and to a various exits. Three emergency exits were in obscure locations, poorly marked and accessible only to knowledgeable employees. The court observed that an emergency escape “would be difficult for a patron not thoroughly familiar with parts of the premises not ordinarily open to him.” Two other emergency exits were marked by “Exit” lights and equipped with panic bars, but one of the two was blocked by a screen and dining tables; the other was regularly kept locked, and the court noted that “if that door should be left so that it could be opened by means of the panic bar, a patron might leave through that door without paying his bill.”]</p>

[The bar boy lit a match to see the bulb, turned the bulb in its socket to light it, and blew out the match. The flame of the match ignited a palm tree, which in turn ignited a low cloth ceiling nearby.] The fire spread with great rapidity. . . . The crowd were panic stricken, and rushed and pushed in every direction through the night club, screaming, and overturning tables and chairs in their attempts to escape.</p>

Sometimes the word “wilful” is prefaced to the words “wanton” and “reckless” in expressing the concept. That only blurs it. Wilful means intentional. In the phrase “wilful, wanton or reckless conduct,” if “wilful” modifies “conduct” it introduces something different from wanton or reckless conduct, even though the legal result is the same. Wilfully causing harm is a wrong, but a different wrong from wantonly or recklessly causing harm. If “wilful” modifies “wanton or reckless conduct” its use is accurate. What must be intended is the conduct, not the resulting harm. The words “wanton” and “reckless” are practically synonymous in this connection, although the word “wanton” may contain a suggestion of arrogance or insolence or heartlessness that is lacking in the word “reckless.” But intentional conduct to which either word applies is followed by the same legal consequences as though both words applied. . . .

<p id="76bd1fe3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judge charged the jury correctly when he said, “To constitute wanton or reckless conduct, as distinguished from mere negligence, grave danger to others must have been apparent and the defendant must have chosen to run the risk rather than alter his conduct so as to avoid the act or omission which caused the harm. If the grave danger was in fact realized by the defendant, his subsequent voluntary act or omission which caused the harm amounts to wanton or reckless conduct, no matter whether the ordinary man would have realized the gravity of the danger or not. But even if a particular defendant is so stupid (or) so heedless . . . that in fact he did not realize the grave danger, he cannot escape the imputation of wanton or reckless conduct in his dangerous act or omission, if an ordinary normal man under the same <span title="493" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-493">p. 493</span>circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger. A man may be reckless within the meaning of the law although he himself thought he was careful.”</p>
<p id="76bd1fe4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another. Wanton or reckless conduct amounts to what has been variously described as indifference to or disregard of probable consequences to that other. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bd1fe5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The words “wanton” and “reckless” are thus not merely rhetorical, vituperative expressions used instead of negligent or grossly negligent. They express a difference in the degree of risk and in the voluntary taking of risk so marked, as compared with negligence, as to amount substantially and in the eyes of the law to a difference in kind. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bd1fe6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Notwithstanding language used commonly in earlier cases, and occasionally in later ones, it is now clear in this Commonwealth that at common law conduct does not become criminal until it passes the borders of negligence and gross negligence and enters into the domain of wanton or reckless conduct. There is in Massachusetts at common law no such thing as “criminal negligence.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bd1fe7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To convict the defendant of manslaughter, the Commonwealth was not required to prove that he caused the fire by some wanton or reckless conduct.

<i>1. The traditional tests.</i> Does <i>Welansky</i> offer a reasonably clear statement of the difference between the ordinary negligence that suffices for civil tort liability and the more culpable kind required for criminal liability? What are the distinctive features of actions that “[pass] the borders of negligence and gross negligence and [enter] into the domain of wanton and reckless conduct”? Is “wanton and reckless conduct” in Massachusetts different from ordinary civil negligence? Reaffirming the <i>Welansky</i> formula, Commonwealth v. Pugh, 969 N.E.2d 672, 685 (Mass. 2012), explains: “Proof of recklessness requires ‘more than a mistake of judgment or even gross negligence’. . . . Wanton or reckless conduct is determined based either on the defendant’s specific knowledge or on what a reasonable person should have known in the circumstances. [T]he defendant’s actions constitute ‘wanton or reckless conduct . . . if an ordinary normal [woman] under the same circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger’ [citing <i>Welansky</i>].”</p>

<p id="76bd4702-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">“The degree of negligence necessary to establish criminal liability has perplexed the courts of England and America for centuries. . . . In the early development of the criminal law in England it was held that ordinary negligence, that is, the failure to exercise due care, was sufficient. Later it was found that this rule was too harsh. A noted English authority observed that an accident brought about by an act of ordinary negligence ‘may be the lot of even the wisest and the best of mankind.’ The English courts finally concluded that more carelessness was required to create criminal liability than civil but they found it difficult to determine ‘how much more.’ [In the United States] it is now generally held that the negligence of the accused must be ‘culpable,’ ‘gross,’ or ‘reckless,’ that is, the conduct of the accused must be such a departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinarily prudent or careful man under the same circumstances as to be incompatible with a proper regard for human life, or conduct amounting to an indifference to consequences. In perhaps a majority of the states, the offense of involuntary manslaughter is now defined by statute. Although variously worded, these statutes, with a few exceptions, have been construed as requiring gross negligence or recklessness.”</p>

<i>2. Problem.</i>
</b> Cal. Penal Code §192(b) defines involuntary manslaughter (in cases not involving vehicular homicide) to include deaths that result from an act committed “without due caution and circumspection.” See <span title="495" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-495">p. 495</span>p. 446 supra. Under the appropriate principles of statutory interpretation, should this language be construed to require gross negligence or to impose criminal liability for ordinary civil negligence? See People v. Penny, 285 P.2d 926, 937 (Cal. 1955); People v. Butler, 114 Cal. Rptr. 3d 696, 711 (Ct. App. 2010).</p>

<b>
<i>3. Contributory negligence.</i>
</b> Notwithstanding the ambiguity of the line between civil and criminal negligence, one difference is clear. In civil cases, the deceased’s contributory negligence is usually a partial defense, involving an assessment of comparative negligence, and sometimes it is a complete defense. In criminal cases, however, the deceased’s contributory negligence or other misconduct has never afforded a defense. In Dickerson v. State, 441 So. 2d 536 (Miss. 1983), the defendant drove his car into another car and killed its drunken driver, who had stopped the car with its lights off in the middle of the road. Commenting on the import of this evidence, the court observed (id. at 538):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bd4709-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Contributory negligence is not a defense to manslaughter. All that the state must prove with respect to the victim is that he was prior to the incident a live human being. The homicide laws of this State protect all living beings within the jurisdiction, sinners as well as saints, drunks as well as deacons.</p>
</div>
<p id="76bd470a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Note, however, that although contributory negligence does not itself afford a defense as it often would in a civil case, it may bear on the question whether the defendant’s conduct was a proximate cause of the death. State v. Brammer, 343 P.3d 75, 82 (Kan. 2015). See the material on causation in Chapter 6, infra.</p>

<b>
<i>4. The MPC alternative.</i>
</b>  The MPC creates two crimes, manslaughter (§210.3) and a lesser crime, negligent homicide (§210.4), distinguished by whether the defendant was aware of the unwarranted risk he was creating. A killing is manslaughter if the actor was “reckless,” that is, if he “consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his conduct would cause the death of another”; and if the risk was “of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor’s situation.” By contrast, a killing is negligent homicide when a person <i>should have been</i> aware of such a risk.</p>
<p id="76bd6e1c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> The MPC distinction between unintentional killings that are criminal and those that are not (found in its definition of negligent homicide) is designed to avoid the epithets typical in earlier formulations and thereby to give greater guidance to the jury. Does it succeed? Are juries apt to reach better and more consistent conclusions if they are asked to decide according to the MPC standard than if they are asked whether conduct was “culpable and gross”? Could the MPC drafters have done a better job?</p>
<p id="76bd6e1d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A number of modern statutory revisions have followed the MPC. The following case illustrates the MPC formula in action.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">BENDER, J.:</span> While skiing on Vail mountain, Hall flew off of a knoll and collided with Allen Cobb, who was traversing the slope below Hall. Cobb sustained traumatic brain injuries and died as a result of the collision. The People charged Hall with felony reckless manslaughter.</p>
<p id="76bd6e23-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At a preliminary hearing to determine whether there was probable cause for the felony count, the county court found that Hall’s conduct “did not rise to the level of dangerousness” required under Colorado law to uphold a conviction for manslaughter, and the court dismissed the charges. [Colorado statutes followed the MPC definitions of manslaughter and negligent homicide.] On appeal, [t]he district court determined that in order for Hall’s conduct to have been reckless, it must have been “at least more likely than not” that death would result. Because the court found that “skiing too fast for the conditions” is not “likely” to cause another person’s death, the court concluded that Hall’s conduct did not constitute a “substantial and unjustifiable” risk of death. Thus, the district court affirmed the finding of no probable cause.</p>
<p id="76bd6e24-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The charge of reckless manslaughter requires that a person “recklessly cause the death of another person.” §18-3-104(1)(a). For his conduct to be reckless, the actor must have consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death could result from his actions. See §18-1-501(8). . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bd9535-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The district court’s conclusion that Hall’s conduct did not represent a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death rested on an erroneous construction of recklessness. . . . [A] risk of death that has less than a fifty percent chance of occurring may nonetheless be a substantial risk depending on the circumstances of the particular case. Because this case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing, we must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution and we must draw all inferences against the defendant. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bd9536-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Like other activities that generally do not involve a substantial risk of death, such as driving a car . . . “skiing too fast for the conditions” is not widely considered behavior that constitutes a high degree of risk. However, we hold that the specific facts in this case support a reasonable inference that Hall created a substantial and unjustifiable risk that he would cause another’s death.</p>
<p id="76bd9537-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Several . . . eyewitnesses all said that Hall was travelling too fast for the conditions. . . . All the witnesses said Hall . . . was skiing straight down the fall line. Hall was back on his skis, with his ski tips in the air and his arms out to his sides to maintain balance. [A witness, himself a ski instructor,] said that Hall was bounced around by the moguls on the slope rather than skiing in control and managing the bumps. Hall admitted . . . that he first saw Cobb when he was airborne and that he was unable to stop when he saw people below him just before the collision. Hence, in addition to finding that Hall was skiing at a very high rate of speed, a reasonably prudent person could have <span title="497" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-497">p. 497</span>concluded that Hall was unable to anticipate or avoid a potential collision with a skier on the trail below him.</p>
<p id="76bd9538-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While skiing ordinarily carries a very low risk of death to other skiers, a reasonable person [i.e., a reasonable juror—E<span class="epub-small-caps">DS</span>.] could have concluded that Hall’s excessive speed, lack of control, and improper technique for skiing bumps significantly increased both the likelihood that a collision would occur and the extent of the injuries that might result from such a collision, including the possibility of death, in the event that a person like Cobb unwittingly crossed Hall’s downhill path. [Another experienced witness] testified that he was aware of only two other deaths from skier collisions on Vail mountain in the past eleven years, but a reasonable person could have determined that Hall’s conduct was precisely the type of skiing that risked this rare result.</p>
<p id="76bd9539-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We next ask whether a reasonable [juror] could have concluded that Hall’s creation of a substantial risk of death was unjustified. To the extent that Hall’s extremely fast and unsafe skiing created a risk of death, Hall was serving no direct interest other than his own enjoyment. Although the sport often involves high speeds and even moments where a skier is temporarily out of control, a reasonable [juror] could determine that the enjoyment of skiing does not justify skiing at the speeds and with the lack of control Hall exhibited. Thus, a reasonable [juror] could have found that Hall’s creation of a substantial risk was unjustifiable.</p>

However, the General Assembly [enacted a statute imposing] upon a skier the duty to avoid collisions with any person or object below him. Although this statute may not form the basis of criminal liability, it establishes the minimum standard of care for uphill skiers and, for the purposes of civil negligence suits, creates a rebuttable presumption that the skier is at fault whenever he collides with skiers on the slope below him. A violation of a skier’s duty in an extreme fashion, such as here, may be evidence of conduct that constitutes a “gross deviation” from the standard of care imposed by statute for civil negligence.

For example, compare two defendants: Skier <i>A</i> loses control because he doesn’t (but should) realize that conditions are icy; skier <i>B</i> knows that conditions are icy but skis anyway and loses control because he incorrectly thinks he is a hot-shot skier. Or suppose that skier <i>B</i> knows that the danger is substantial but figures that taking risks is part of the good life and hence justifiable. If the <i>reasons</i> for unawareness matter, how should the definitions of recklessness and negligence be changed to take account of them?</p>

<p id="76bdbc59-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One may ask two major questions about the offense of negligent homicide: its justification and its definition.</p>
<p id="76bdbc5a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Justification.</i> Are the MPC and most American jurisdictions right to punish inadvertent (negligent) killing? Is it ever justified to convict a person of a homicidal crime when she did not realize that her actions were dangerous?</p>
<p id="76bdbc5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Definition.</i> Even if punishment for negligence can sometimes be justified, how should the jury determine whether a defendant <i>was</i> negligent? The standard, in principle, is that of the reasonable person in the circumstances. But what circumstances should be considered? Do they include the competence and capabilities of the particular defendant? Or should the law apply a single invariant standard for all, regardless of a particular defendant’s ability to meet that standard?</p>
<p id="76bdbc5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The following case provides a setting for examining both problems—justification and definition.</p>

His sole occupation is that of laborer. The defendant wife, Bernice Williams, is a 20-year-old part Indian with an 11th grade education. At the time of the marriage, the wife had two children, the younger of whom was a 14-month-old son. Both parents worked and the children were cared for by the . . . mother of the defendant husband. The defendant husband assumed parental responsibility with the defendant wife to provide clothing, care and medical attention for the child. Both defendants possessed a great deal of love and affection for the defendant wife’s young son. The court expressly found:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76bde374-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That both defendants were aware that William Joseph Tabafunda was ill during the period September 1, 1968, to September 12, 1968. The defendants were ignorant. They did not realize how sick the baby was. They thought that the baby had a toothache and no layman regards a toothache as dangerous to life. They loved the baby and gave it aspirin in hopes of improving its condition. They did not take the baby to a doctor because of fear that the Welfare Department would take the baby away from them. They knew that medical help was available because of previous experience. They had no excuse that the law will recognize for not taking the baby to a doctor.</p>
<p id="76bde375-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The defendants Walter L. Williams and Bernice J. Williams were negligent in not seeking medical attention for William Joseph Tabafunda.</p>
<p id="76bde376-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">That as a proximate result of this negligence, William Joseph Tabafunda died.</p>
</div>
<p id="76bde377-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From these and other findings, the [trial] court concluded that the defendants were each guilty of the crime of manslaughter as charged. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bde378-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[The appellate court held that both defendants were under a legal duty to obtain medical assistance for the child.] On the question of the quality or seriousness of breach of the duty, at common law, in the case of involuntary manslaughter, the breach had to amount to more than mere ordinary or simple negligence—gross negligence was essential. . . . Under [Washington] statutes [however] the crime is deemed committed even though the death of the victim is the proximate result of only simple or ordinary negligence. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bde379-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The concept of simple or ordinary negligence describes a failure to exercise the “ordinary caution” necessary to make out the defense of excusable homicide. Ordinary caution is the kind of caution that a man of reasonable prudence would exercise under the same or similar conditions. If, therefore, the conduct of a defendant, regardless of his ignorance, good intentions and good faith, fails to measure up to the conduct required of a man of reasonable prudence, he is guilty of ordinary negligence because of his failure to use “ordinary caution.” . . . If such negligence proximately causes the death of the victim, the defendant . . . is guilty of statutory manslaughter. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bde37a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The remaining issue of proximate cause requires consideration of the question of when the duty to furnish medical care became activated. If the duty to furnish such care was not activated until after it was too late to save the life of the child, failure to furnish medical care could not be said to have proximately caused the child’s death. Timeliness in the furnishing of medical care also must be considered in terms of “ordinary caution.” [T]he duty as <span title="501" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-501">p. 501</span>formulated in People v. Pierson, 176 N.Y. 201, 68 N.E. 243 (1903) . . . properly defines the duty contemplated by our manslaughter statutes. . . . The court there said: “We quite agree that the Code does not contemplate the necessity of calling a physician for every trifling complaint with which the child may be afflicted, which in most instances may be overcome by the ordinary household nursing by members of the family; that a reasonable amount of discretion is vested in parents, charged with the duty of maintaining and bringing up infant children; and that the standard is at what time would an ordinarily prudent person, solicitous for the welfare of his child and anxious to promote its recovery, deem it necessary to call in the services of a physician.”</p>
<p id="76bde37b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It remains to apply the law discussed to the facts of the instant case.</p>
<p id="76bde37c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Because of the serious nature of the charge against the parent and step-parent of a well-loved child, and out of our concern for the protection of the constitutional rights of the defendants, we have made an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether it substantially supports the court’s express finding on proximate cause and its implied finding that the duty to furnish medical care became activated in time to prevent death of the child. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bde37d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Dr. Gale Wilson, the autopsy surgeon and chief pathologist for the King County Coroner, testified that the child died because an abscessed tooth had been allowed to develop into an infection of the mouth and cheeks, eventually becoming gangrenous. . . . Dr. Wilson testified that in his opinion the infection had lasted for approximately 2 weeks, and that the odor generally associated with gangrene would have been present for approximately 10 days before death. He also expressed the opinion that had medical care been first obtained in the last week before the baby’s death, such care would have been obtained too late to have saved the baby’s life. Accordingly, the baby’s apparent condition between September 1 and September 5, 1968 became the critical period for the purpose of determining whether in the exercise of ordinary caution defendants should have provided medical care for the minor child.</p>
<p id="76bde37e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The testimony concerning the child’s apparent condition during the critical period is not crystal clear, but is sufficient to warrant the following statement of the matter. The defendant husband testified that he noticed the baby was sick about 2 weeks before the baby died. The defendant wife testified that she noticed the baby was ill about a week and a half or 2 weeks before the baby died. The evidence showed that in the critical period the baby was fussy; that he could not keep his food down; and that a cheek started swelling up. The swelling went up and down, but did not disappear. In that same period, the cheek turned “a bluish color like.” The defendants, not realizing that the baby was as ill as it was or that the baby was in danger of dying, attempted to provide some relief to the baby by giving the baby aspirin during the critical period and continued to do so until the night before the baby died. The defendants thought the swelling would go down and were waiting for it to do so; and defendant husband testified, that from what he had heard, neither doctors nor dentists pull out a tooth “when it’s all swollen up like that.” There was an additional explanation for not calling a doctor given by each defendant. <span title="502" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-502">p. 502</span>Defendant husband testified that “the way the cheek looked, . . . and that stuff on his hair, they would think we were neglecting him and take him away from us and not give him back.” Defendant wife testified that the defendants were “waiting for the swelling to go down,” and also that they were afraid to take the child to a doctor for fear that the doctor would report them to the welfare department, who, in turn, would take the child away. “It’s just that I was so scared of losing him.” They testified that they had heard that the defendant husband’s cousin lost a child that way. The evidence showed that the defendants did not understand the significance or seriousness of the baby’s symptoms. However, there is no evidence that the defendants were physically or financially unable to obtain a doctor, or that they did not know an available doctor, or that the symptoms did not continue to be a matter of concern during the critical period. Indeed, the evidence shows that in April 1968 defendant husband had taken the child to a doctor for medical attention.</p>
<p id="76bde37f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In our opinion, there is sufficient evidence from which the court could find, as it necessarily did, that applying the standard of ordinary caution, i.e., the caution exercisable by a man of reasonable prudence under the same or similar conditions, defendants were sufficiently put on notice concerning the symptoms of the baby’s illness and lack of improvement in the baby’s apparent condition in the period from September 1 to September 5, 1968 to have required them to have obtained medical care for the child. The failure so to do in this case is ordinary or simple negligence, and such negligence is sufficient to support a conviction of statutory manslaughter.</p>
<p id="76bde380-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p id="76bde383-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Child custody and intervention in Native American families.</i> The defendants’ “fear that the Welfare Department would take the baby away from them” was by no means unusual among Native American families in the 1960s and 1970s. For a variety of reasons, child welfare agencies often were quick to assume that “the best interests of the child” were served by removing Native American children to other homes, and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs sometimes paid states to take Native American children from their families in order to place them in other homes or with religious groups. At one point, up to 25 to 35 percent of all Native American children were being removed from their families and placed elsewhere. In the late 1970s, congressional hearings found convincing evidence of precipitous intervention and other abuses that threatened the welfare of individual children and the long-term survival of Native American culture.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN10EDD_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N10EDD_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">13</a></span> In 1978—well after the facts that gave rise to the <i>Williams</i> case—Congress responded by enacting the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. §§1901 et seq., which aimed to reverse <span title="503" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-503">p. 503</span>that dynamic by giving tribal governments primary authority over child custody proceedings involving Native American children.</p>

<i>2. Assessing the facts of</i> Williams <i>under the criminal-negligence standard.</i> The manslaughter statutes involved in <i>Williams</i> were repealed in 1975. The current statutes create two degrees of manslaughter: recklessly causing death and causing death by criminal negligence. See Wash. Rev. Code §§9A.32.060, 9A.32.070 (2016). In accord with generally prevailing law, Washington no longer imposes manslaughter liability in cases involving ordinary negligence. See State v. Norman, 808 P.2d 1159, 1162 (Wash. Ct. App. 1991).</p>
<p id="76bde386-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Would the <i>Williams</i> court have reached a different result under the criminal negligence requirement in effect today? On the court’s view of the facts, wasn’t the couple’s departure from ordinary standards of care so substantial that it would qualify as <i>criminal</i> negligence?</p>
<p id="76be0a97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Explaining</i> Williams. Despite these changes in the legal framework under which the <i>Williams</i> case arose, the issues it presents remain with us. Many will find the conviction of the <i>Williams</i> couple unjust and, perhaps, pointless. Why were the defendants punished?</p>
<p id="76be0a98-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> Note that the court calls attention to the race of the defendants. In what respect, if any, did their race have a bearing on the issues in the case?</p>
<p id="76be0a99-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Were the defendants punished only because of their lack of knowledge and limited education? If so, can they be <i>blamed</i> for their lack of awareness? See Peter Westen, Individualizing the Reasonable Person in Criminal Law, 2 Crim. L. &amp; Phil. 137, 154 (2008). If blame is inappropriate under these circumstances, does it follow that punishment for negligence (where there is no awareness of the risk) is always unjust?</p>
<p id="76be0a9a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c)</i> Alternatively, was the Williams couple punished because they <i>were</i> aware of the danger and chose not to seek help, out of fear that the Welfare Department would take the baby away from them? If so, should this be viewed as a case of unjustifiably “taking the law into their own hands”? Or was it a <i>justified</i> response to their perception that state authorities were too quick to charge members of their community with child neglect? For a perceptive analysis of this aspect of <i>Williams</i>, see Samuel H. Pillsbury, Judging Evil 181-184 (1998); Megan H. Dearth, Defending the “Indefensible”: Replacing Ethnocentrism with a Native American Cultural Defense, 35 Am. Indian L. Rev. 621 (2011).</p>

There was evidence that he had made similar applications with favorable results in other cases, but that in one the effect had been to blister and burn the flesh as in the present case.</p>

<p id="76be0aa0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The trial court had refused to instruct the jury that a finding of recklessness was required for conviction. Justice Holmes formulated the issue as follows (id. at 175-176):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76be0aa1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[R]ecklessness in a moral sense means a certain state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one’s acts. No matter whether defined as indifference to what those consequences may be, or as a failure to consider their nature or probability as fully as the party might and ought to have done, it is understood to depend on the actual condition of the individual’s mind with regard to consequences, as distinguished from mere knowledge of present or past facts or circumstances from which some one or everybody else might be led to anticipate or apprehend them if the supposed act were done. We have to determine whether recklessness in this sense was necessary to make the defendant guilty of felonious homicide, or whether his acts are to be judged by the external standard of what would be morally reckless, under the circumstances known to him, in a man of reasonable prudence. More specifically, the questions . . . are whether an actual good intent and the expectation of good results are an absolute justification of acts, however foolhardy they may be if judged by the external standard supposed, and whether the defendant’s ignorance of the tendencies of kerosene administered as it was will excuse the administration of it.</p>

<p id="76be0aa2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">After reviewing the objective standards applicable in civil cases, Holmes concluded:</p>

<p id="76be0aa4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> Justice Holmes justifies punishment for inadvertent negligence on the basis of its assumed public safety benefits, but is such punishment <i>fair</i>? Consider Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.02 at 243-244 (1980), which states:</p>

To some extent, at least, this motive may promote <span title="505" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-505">p. 505</span>awareness and thus be effective as a measure of control.

Another involves a teenager showing off for his friends. Assume that in both cases the driver saw neither the light nor the pedestrian. Culpability should depend on the drivers’ reasons for perceptive failure, not on the failure itself. The father’s lack of perception may be attributed to his overriding and morally worthy desire to help his child. . . . The teenager placed a higher value on winning the admiration of friends than on attending to the risks of fast driving.

Hardly any motorist but does not firmly believe that if he is involved in an accident it will be the other fellow’s fault. It may seem, therefore, that the threat of punishment for negligence must pass him by, because he does not realize that it is addressed to him. Even if a person admits that he occasionally makes a negligent mistake, how, in the nature of things, can punishment for inadvertence serve to deter?</p>

<i>3. Individualizing the objective standard.</i> Professor H.L.A. Hart argued that the problem with the so-called objective approach is not that it sets an objective standard, but that the standard is applied without regard to the ability of the defendant to comply with it. He notes a crucial difference between objective standards that are “invariant” and those that are “individualized” (Punishment and Responsibility 153-154 (1968)):</p>

<p id="76be31bf-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The expression “objective” and its partner “subjective” are unhappy because, as far as negligence is concerned, they obscure the real issue. . . . For, when negligence is made criminally punishable, this itself leaves open the question: whether, before we punish, both or only the first of the following two questions must be answered affirmatively:</p>
<ol class="epub-list-reset1 epub-parenlistlcroman">
<li>
<p id="76be31c0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Did the accused fail to take those precautions which any reasonable man with normal capacities would in the circumstances have taken?</p>

<p id="76be31c1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Could the accused, given his mental and physical capacities, have taken those precautions?</p>

<p id="76be31c2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . It may well be that, even if the “standard of care” is pitched very low so that individuals are held liable only if they fail to take very elementary precautions against harm, there will still be some unfortunate individuals who, through lack of intelligence, powers of concentration or memory, or through clumsiness, could not attain even this low standard. If our conditions of liability are invariant and not flexible, i.e., if they are not adjusted to the capacities of the accused, then some individuals will be held liable for negligence though they could not have helped their failure to comply with the standard. In such cases, indeed, criminal responsibility will be made independent of any “subjective element,” since the accused could not have conformed to the required standard. But this result [has] nothing to do with negligence being taken as a basis for criminal liability. . . . “Absolute liability” results, not from the admission of the principle that one who has been grossly negligent is criminally responsible for the consequent harm even if “he had no idea in his mind of harm to anyone,” but from the refusal in the application of this principle to consider the capacities of an individual who has fallen below the standard of care.</p>

<p id="76be31c3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">German law adopts an approach similar to Hart’s. As expressed in a leading case, The Case of the Gable-Wall (Giebelmauer), 56 RGSt 343, 349 (1922), “A harm caused by defendants can be said to be caused by negligence only when it is established that they disregarded the care which they were obliged to exercise and of which they were capable under the circumstances and according to their personal knowledge and abilities. . . . ” For discussion of this approach, see Tatjana Hoernle, Social Expectations in the Criminal Law: The “Reasonable Person” in a Comparative Perspective, 11 New Crim.

<i>Questions:</i> This approach would seem to make legal guilt and moral blameworthiness more nearly the same, but is it workable? How could we know whether a defendant lacked the capacity to be aware of a danger, except in cases of demonstrable mental abnormality?

<i>4. The MPC on individualization.</i> The MPC definition of negligence rejects a fully individualized standard. However, some degree of individualization is invited by its reference to “the care that would be exercised by a reasonable person <i>in [the actor’s] situation.</i>” (Italics added.) Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §2.02 at 242 (1985) states:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76be31c6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There is an inevitable ambiguity in “situation.” If the actor were blind or if he had just suffered a blow or experienced a heart attack, these would certainly be facts to be considered in a judgment involving criminal liability, as they would be under traditional law. But the heredity, intelligence or temperament of the actor would not be held material in judging negligence, and could not be without depriving the criterion of all its objectivity. The Code is not intended to displace discriminations of this kind, but rather to leave the issue to the courts.</p>

<p id="76be31c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Recall that the MPC took a similar approach in its test for provocation, where the objectivity of the standard is qualified by the sentence (§210.3): “The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a person <i>in the actor’s situation</i> under the circumstances as he believes them to be.” (Italics added.)</p>

<i>5. The case law on individualization.</i> Although the MPC leaves to the courts the problem of determining the appropriate degree of individualization, the courts remain ambivalent or in conflict. In State v. Everhart, 231 S.E.2d 604 (N.C. 1977), the defendant, a young girl with an IQ of 72, gave birth in her own bedroom and, thinking that the baby had been born dead, wrapped it from head to foot in a blanket. The baby smothered to death. The court reversed a conviction for involuntary manslaughter, holding that because of the defendant’s low IQ and the admittedly accidental nature of the death, the state had not proved culpable negligence. Compare State v. Patterson, 27 A.3d 374 (Conn. App. Ct. 2011). The defendant withheld water from a two-year-old boy in her care in order to prevent him from wetting his bed. After four days of this mistreatment, the child stopped breathing and died as a result of severe dehydration. The defense argued that the defendant, who had an IQ of 61 (placing her in the bottom one-half of 1 percent of the population), “was cognitively unable to perceive the risks created by her actions.” The appellate court nonetheless upheld her conviction for criminally negligent homicide, stating that “[e]ven if . . . the defendant was incapable of perceiving the risk of death . . . , we cannot consider the defendant’s diminished mental capacity in the context of criminally negligent homicide because we employ an objective standard.”</p>

<i>1. The facts in</i> Malone. In concluding that there was a 60 percent chance of the gun’s discharging, the court apparently assumed that the defendant twirled the revolver cylinder once before beginning to pull the trigger (see footnote 1 of the opinion), contrary to the implication of the defendant’s testimony that he loaded the chamber to the right of the firing pin and fired without spinning the cylinder. On the court’s assumption, pulling the trigger of a five-chambered gun three consecutive times creates roughly a three-out-of-five <span title="511" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-511">p. 511</span>chance of the gun’s discharging.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11108_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11108_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">17</a></span> Some, however, might want to argue that the relevant risk is that of the gun’s discharging on the third pull, which is one out of three. Which is the appropriate way to characterize the defendant’s course of conduct? Would the choice affect the defendant’s liability? Suppose the gun discharged on the first pull, when the chance of that happening would have been only one out of five? Would the defendant still be guilty of murder?</p>

<i>2. Definitions of unintentional murder.</i> Common-law formulations of the circumstances under which an unintentional killing constituted murder rather than manslaughter have been incorporated into many American statutes either directly or by reference to such common-law terms as “malice.” The formulas have tended to rely primarily on colorful epithets—“the dictate of a wicked, depraved and malignant heart”; or “an abandoned and malignant heart.” The <i>Malone</i> case is an example of circumstances in which the criteria have been held satisfied. Other classic examples are throwing a heavy object down upon a busy street, shooting into an occupied building, and beating a person so severely that the person is unintentionally killed. Some states have tried to give these terms an interpretation more meaningful to juries. For example, in People v. Dellinger, 783 P.2d 200, 201 (Cal. 1989), the court defined malice to be implied “when the killing results from an intentional act, . . . which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life.”</p>
<p id="76be800a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Many state statutes now use formulas inspired by the Model Penal Code: Unintended killing is murder when committed recklessly (as defined in §2.02(2)(c)) and “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” (§210.2). The Commentary explains (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §210.2 at 21-22 (1980)):</p>

The significance of purpose or knowledge as a standard of culpability is that, cases of provocation or other mitigation apart, purposeful or knowing homicide demonstrates precisely such indifference to the value of human life. Whether recklessness is so extreme that it demonstrates similar indifference is not a question, it is submitted, that can be further clarified. It must be left directly to the trier of fact under instructions which make it clear that recklessness that can fairly be assimilated to purpose or knowledge should be treated as murder and that less extreme recklessness should be punished as manslaughter.</p>

<i>3. Distinguishing manslaughter from unintentional murder.</i> The common law and statutes derived from it distinguished between manslaughter and unintentional murder based on how wicked and depraved the killing seemed to be. That approach, of course, remits the issue to subjective judgment calls of the judge or jury. The MPC formula, requiring recklessness “in circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” omits the vituperative common-law language, but does it make the call less subjective? For careful analysis of possible solutions, see Eric A. Johnson, Knowledge, Risk, and Wrongdoing: The Model Penal Code’s Forgotten Answer to the Riddle of Objective Probability, 59 Buff. L. Rev. 507 (2011); Alan C. Michaels, Defining Unintended Murder, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 786 (1985); Kyron Huigens, Homicide in Aretaic Terms, 6 Buff. Crim. L. Rev. 97 (2002).</p>
<p id="76be800e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Courts applying the MPC approach have had a hard time with these issues. The New York murder statute roughly follows the MPC language, only substituting “depraved indifference” for “extreme indifference.” The New York Court of Appeals has held that “depraved indifference” requires a finding of “utter depravity, uncommon brutality and inhuman cruelty.” People v. Taylor, 939 N.E.2d 1206, 1209 (N.Y. 2010). Consider how this standard should be applied to these cases:</p>
<p id="76be800f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a)</i> In <i>Taylor</i>, supra, after the defendant and his female neighbor had smoked crack together, she attacked him, and he hit her on the head to defend himself. Later, he covered her head with a tightly knotted plastic bag (allegedly to stop the blood from spreading) and carried her to the roof of his building, where she was found dead the next morning. The court of appeals, stressing that “the People did not establish ‘torture or a brutal, prolonged’ course of conduct,” held that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish the depravity required to establish murder rather than manslaughter. Id. Do you agree?</p>

<i>(b)</i> In People v. Prindle, 944 N.E.2d 1130 (N.Y. 2011), the defendant, after stealing a snowplow blade, led pursuing police officers on a high-speed chase through the streets of Rochester, N.Y., running five red lights and repeatedly driving into the lanes of oncoming traffic, before colliding with another vehicle and killing its driver. Dividing 4–3, the court set aside a conviction for depraved indifference murder, finding the evidence sufficient only to establish reckless manslaughter. The dissenting judges insisted that the defendant’s conduct was “so deficient in a moral sense of concern, so devoid of regard of the live or lives of others . . . as to render defendant as culpable as one whose conscious objective was to kill.” Id. at 1134.</p>
<p id="76be8011-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Murder by omission.</i> We have seen that the death of an infant through its parents’ neglect may constitute manslaughter. <i>State v. Williams</i>, p. 496 supra. May such neglect rise to the level of murder? A California court upheld a second-degree murder conviction of a father for his callous failure to feed his child, resulting in death through malnutrition and dehydration. The evidence showed that during the last two weeks of the baby’s life, the father was aware that it was starving to death, that he did not remember anyone’s having fed the baby in that period, and that he himself did not, because he “just didn’t care.” The court stated: “The omission of a duty is in law the equivalent of an act and when death results, the standard for determination of the degree of homicide is identical.” People v. Burden, 140 Cal. Rptr. 282, 289 (Ct. App. 1977). In accord, see People v. Latham, 137 Cal. Rptr. 3d 443 (Ct. App. 2012); Simpkins v. State, 596 A.2d 655 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1991).</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">WINTER</span>, C.J.: [Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Margaret Haley. At about 3:00 <span class="epub-small-caps">P.M</span>., he was driving southbound on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a park within federal jurisdiction, at speeds between 70 and 100 miles per hour, in zones where the speed limit was 45 m.p.h. Several times he drove into the northbound lanes in order to avoid traffic congestion in the southbound lanes. Northbound traffic had to move out of his way in order to avoid a head-on collision. Approximately six miles from where his car was first observed traveling at excessive speed, he lost control and struck the car driven by Mrs. Haley that was coming in the opposite direction. His car was estimated to be traveling 70 to 80 m.p.h. at the moment of impact, in a zone where the speed limit was 30 m.p.h. Mrs. Haley was severely injured and died at the scene.]</p>

<p id="76bea731-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Murder by drunk driving.</i> In accord with <i>Fleming</i>, the great majority of American courts hold that egregiously dangerous driving can support a conviction of murder. See Dora W. Klein, Is Felony Murder the New Depraved Heart <span title="515" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-515">p. 515</span>Murder? Considering the Appropriate Punishment for Drunken Drivers Who Kill, <span class="epub-small-caps">67</span> S.C. L. Rev<span class="epub-small-caps">.</span> 1 (2015-2016). Usually, the theory is that the defendant had an actual awareness of a great risk of fatal harm. See, e.g., Jeffries v. State, 169 P.3d 913 (Alaska 2007), in which the court upheld a second-degree murder conviction where the defendant, who had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27 (more than three times the ordinary limit) drove his car directly in front of an oncoming vehicle on a well-lit, icy, five-lane street. The court found that “Jeffries’s prior convictions for drunk driving, court orders to attend substance abuse programs, and a condition of probation that he abstain from drinking alcohol permitted a finding that he had a heightened awareness that driving while grossly intoxicated was highly dangerous,” id. at 914, and thus his actions were not merely inadvertent.</p>
<p id="76becd42-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Compare People v. Watson, 637 P.2d 279 (Cal. 1981), where again a drunk driver was convicted of murder. Here the court found sufficient evidence of an actual awareness of the danger merely because the defendant “had driven his car to the establishment where he had been drinking, and he must have known that he would have to drive it later. It also may be presumed that defendant was aware of the hazards of driving while intoxicated.” Id. at 285-286. A dissent observed (id. at 288):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76becd43-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The act of speeding through a green light at 55 or 60 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone was dangerous, but was not an act likely to result in the death of another. It was 1 o’clock in the morning. The person whose car respondent nearly collided with testified that he saw no other cars around. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76becd44-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">No one holds a brief for this type of activity. However, [d]eath or injury is not the probable result of driving while under the influence of alcohol. “Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of Californians each week reach home without accident despite their driving intoxicated.” [T]he majority’s reasoning [could] be used to establish second-degree murder in every case in which a person drives a car to a bar, a friend’s home, or a party, drinks alcohol so that he is under its influence, drives away and is involved in a fatal accident.</p>
</div>
<p id="76becd45-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Nearly everyone knows (is “consciously aware”) that the risks of a serious collision are greater when driving while intoxicated than when driving in the same way while sober. Does that mean that whenever a drunk driver causes a fatal accident, he should be guilty of murder? If not, should the kind of egregiously bad driving illustrated by Fleming be necessary, or does that sort of requirement set the bar too high? See James Jacobs, Drunk Driving: An American Dilemma 87-88 (1989); Douglas Husak, Is Drunk Driving a Serious Offense?, 23 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 52 (1994).</p>
<p id="76becd46-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. The Model Penal Code and inadvertent murder.</i> Under §210.2(1)(b), murder requires proof that the defendant acted “recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.” According to the official Comment (Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §210.2 at 27-28 (1980)):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76becd47-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Model Penal Code provision makes clear that inadvertent risk creation, however extravagant and unjustified, cannot be punished as murder. . . . This <span title="516" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-516">p. 516</span>result is consistent with the general conception of the Model Code that serious felony sanctions should be grounded securely in the subjective culpability of the actor. To the extent that inadvertent risk creation, or negligence, should be recognized as a form of criminal homicide, that question should be faced separately from the offense of murder. [N]egligent homicide should not be assimilated to the most serious forms of criminal homicide catalogued under the offense of murder.</p>
</div>
<p id="76becd48-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The MPC and intoxication.</i> Despite its emphatic opposition to punishing inadvertent risk creation as murder, the MPC, in §2.08(2) (discussed in footnote 3 of the <i>Fleming</i> case), provides that recklessness <i>need not</i> be shown if the defendant was unaware of the risk because of voluntary intoxication. As a result, §2.08(2) can in practice contradict the commentary just quoted, because it makes negligence (in drinking before driving) a sufficient mens rea for murder. Knowledge that drinking impairs driving ability is widely disseminated, of course. All the same, some drivers believe that they can drive safely while drunk. These people are of course negligent, perhaps grossly negligent, but with respect to the risk of killing another person, are they reckless under the Code’s definition of that term? And even if they are, have they “manifest[ed] extreme indifference to the value of human life”?</p>
<p id="76becd49-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider State v. Dufield, 549 A.2d 1205 (N.H. 1988). The defendant was convicted of reckless murder of a woman whom he had brutally injured during a drunken sexual orgy. The New Hampshire reckless murder statute used the same language as the MPC and, like the MPC, also excluded voluntary intoxication as a basis for claiming a lack of awareness. On appeal, the defendant argued that even though his intoxication was immaterial on the issue of recklessness, it was relevant to the extreme indifference required for murder. Hence, he argued, the trial court erred in refusing to recognize his defense. Justice David Souter, then a state judge writing for the New Hampshire Supreme Court, outlined the issues of statutory interpretation (id. at 1206-1207):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76becd4a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If, on the one hand, proof of “circumstances manifesting extreme indifference” required evidence from which a finder of fact would be able to infer a subjective state of indifference, . . . then the defendant might plausibly argue that voluntary intoxication would be relevant to proof of that mental state. On this view, “indifference” would be regarded as an element of an offense comparable to a knowing or purposeful state of mind, which must be shown to have occurred with specific reference to the times and facts to which it relates.</p>
<p id="76bef45b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On the other hand, it could be that the function of proving the existence of “circumstances manifesting extreme indifference” is to establish, not a subjective state of mind, but a degree of divergence from the norm of acceptable behavior even greater than the “gross deviation” from the law-abiding norm, by which reckless conduct is defined. On this view, the words in question would describe a way of objectively measuring such a deviation, in which case any voluntary intoxication that might have blinded a defendant to the risks of such extreme deviant behavior would be [irrelevant].</p>
</div>
<p id="76bef45c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="517" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-517">p. 517</span>The court chose the latter interpretation and affirmed the conviction. Do you agree? Is the holding consistent with the rationale of the “extreme indifference” requirement, as explained in the MPC Commentary, p. 511 supra?</p>
<p id="76bef45d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Intent to inflict great bodily harm.</i> Evidence that a defendant intended to inflict serious injury obviously provides some indication that he recklessly created a risk of death. But the common law went further, by giving such facts independent substantive significance; the malice required for murder was established by the defendant’s intent to inflict great bodily harm. This intent-to-inflict-grievous-harm formula is followed in many American jurisdictions. See Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law 737 (4th ed. 2003). In some states, the doctrine survives as a consequence of statutes retaining the common-law definition of murder (that is, a killing with “malice aforethought”). In a few states, homicide statutes adopt the “great bodily harm” formula explicitly, for example, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a) (2016); N.M. Stat. Ann. §30-2-1(B) (2016).</p>
<p id="76bef45e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Why treat intent to inflict grievous harm as independently sufficient to support a murder conviction when death happens to result? The MPC omitted the doctrine on the ground that recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life captures all the nonintentional homicides that should be elevated to murder. Comment to §210.2 at 28 (1980). Does it?</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">STEPHEN</span>, J. Gentlemen, it is now my duty to direct your attention to the law and the facts into which you have to inquire. The two prisoners are indicted for the wilful murder of the boy Sjaak Serné, a lad of about fourteen years of age; . . . The definition of murder is unlawful homicide with malice aforethought, and the words malice aforethought are technical. You must not, therefore, construe them or suppose that they can be construed by ordinary rules of language. The words have to be construed according to a long series of decided cases, which have given them meanings different from those which might be supposed. One of those meanings is, the killing of another person by an act done with an intent to commit a felony. Another meaning is, an act done with the knowledge that the act will probably cause the death of some person. Now it is such an act as the last which is alleged to have been done in this case; and if you think that either or both of these men in the dock killed this boy, either by an act done with intent to commit a felony, that is to say, the setting of the house on fire in order to cheat the insurance company, or by conduct which to their knowledge was likely to cause death and was therefore eminently dangerous in itself—in either of these cases the prisoners are guilty of wilful murder in the plain meaning of the word.</p>
<p id="76bf1b7b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">I will say a word or two upon one part of this definition, because it is capable of being applied very harshly in certain cases, and also because, though I take the law as I find it, I very much doubt whether the definition which I have given, although it is the common definition, is not somewhat too wide. Now when it is said that murder means killing a man by an act done in the commission of a felony, the mere words cover a case like this, that is to say, a case where a man gives another a push with an intention of stealing his watch, and the person so pushed, having a weak heart or some other internal disorder, dies. To take another very old illustration, it was said that if a man shot a fowl with intent to steal it and accidentally killed a man, he was to be accounted guilty of murder, because the act was done in <span title="519" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-519">p. 519</span>the commission of a felony.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1128B_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1128B_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> I very much doubt, however, whether that is really the law, or whether the Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved would hold it to be so.</p>
<p id="76bf1b7d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The present case, however, is not such as I have cited, nor anything like them. In my opinion the definition of the law which makes it murder to kill by an act done in the commission of a felony might and ought to be narrowed, while that part of the law under which the Crown in this case claim to have proved a case of murder is maintained. I think that, instead of saying that any act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to murder, it would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, done for the purpose of committing a felony which causes death, should be murder. As an illustration of this, suppose that a man, intending to commit a rape upon a woman, but without the least wish to kill her, squeezed her by the throat to overpower her, and in so doing killed her, that would be murder. I think that every one would say in a case like that, that when a person began doing wicked acts for his own base purposes, he risked his own life as well as that of others. That kind of crime does not differ in any serious degree from one committed by using a deadly weapon, such as a bludgeon, a pistol, or a knife. If a man once begins attacking the human body in such a way, he must take the consequences if he goes further than he intended when he began. That I take to be the true meaning of the law in the subject.</p>
<p id="76bf1b7e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the present case, gentlemen, you have a man sleeping in a house with his wife, his two daughters, his two sons, and a servant, and you are asked to believe that this man, with all these people under his protection, deliberately set fire to the house in three or four different places and thereby burnt two of them to death. It is alleged that he arranged matters in such a way that any person of the most common intelligence must have known perfectly well that he was placing all those people in deadly risk. It appears to me that if that were really done, it matters very little indeed whether the prisoners hoped the people would escape or whether they did not. If a person chose, for some wicked purpose of his own to sink a boat at sea, and thereby caused the deaths of the occupants, it matters nothing whether at the time of committing the act he hoped that the people would be picked up by a passing vessel. He is as much guilty of murder if the people are drowned, as if he had flung every person into <span title="520" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-520">p. 520</span>the water with his own hand. Therefore, gentlemen, if Serné and Goldfinch set fire to this house when the family were in it, and if the boys were by that act stifled or burnt to death, then the prisoners are as much guilty of murder as if they had stabbed the children. I will also add, for my own part, that I think, in so saying, the law of England lays down a rule of broad, plain common-sense. . . .

With regard to the facts in the present case, the very horror of the crime, if crime it was, the abomination of it, is a reason for your taking the most extreme care in the case, and for not imputing to the prisoners anything which is not clearly proved. God forbid that I should, by what I say, produce on your minds, even in the smallest degree any feeling against the prisoners. You must see, gentlemen, that the evidence leaves no reasonable doubt upon your minds; but you will fail in the performance of your duty if, being satisfied with the evidence, you do not convict one or both the prisoners of wilful murder, and it is wilful murder of which they are accused.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Honeyman began suffering chest pains, collapsed, and died of a heart attack. He was described as “an obese 60-year-old man, with a history of heart disease, who was under a great deal of pressure due to the intensely competitive nature of his business. Additionally, he did not take good care of his heart.” Doctors testified that “[t]he fright induced by the robbery was too much of a shock to Honeyman’s system.” Defendant’s conviction of first-degree murder was upheld. The court stated:] The [felony-murder] doctrine is not limited to those deaths which are foreseeable. Rather a felon is held strictly liable for all killings committed by him or his accomplices in the course of the felony. As long as the homicide is the direct causal result of the robbery the felony-murder rule applies whether or not the death was a natural or probable consequence of the robbery. So long as a victim’s predisposing physical condition, regardless of its cause, is not the only substantial factor bringing about his death, that condition and the robber’s ignorance of it, in no way destroys the robber’s criminal responsibility for the death. So long as life is shortened as a result of the felonious act it does not matter that the victim might have died soon anyway. In this respect, the robber takes his victim as he finds him.</p>

<i>NOTES ON THE SCOPE OF THE FELONY-MURDER RULE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76bf4296-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Strict liability?</i> Note that the <i>Stamp</i> decision extends murder liability much further than would the felony-murder rule described by Judge Stephen in <i>Serné</i>. Judge Stephen presented a hypothetical very similar to the facts of <i>Stamp</i>: One man pushes another, intending to steal his watch, and the man who was pushed then dies of a heart attack. Judge Stephen assumed that the felony-murder rule did not apply to purely accidental killings, and that the English courts of his day therefore would not find felony murder on such facts.</p>
<p id="76bf4297-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Unlike Judge Stephen, some early English commentators stated that the felony-murder rule <i>did</i> apply in this situation. See p. 519, footnote a, supra. But one examination of the history concludes that in the early common law, every conviction for felony murder required some culpability with respect to the killing, in addition to the fault involved in committing the accompanying felony. See Guyora Binder, The Origin of American Felony-Murder Rules, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 59 (2004).</p>
<p id="76bf4298-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In the United States, however, that qualification was lost, and courts adopted a broad, unqualified felony-murder rule, believing that it was part of the English common law at the time of American independence. Thus, the <i>Stamp</i> case illustrates the view generally accepted in American courts—that the felony-murder rule imposes <i>strict liability</i> for killings that result from the commission of a felony; in other words, it holds felons liable for murder without proof of any mens rea—neither knowledge nor recklessness nor negligence is required with respect to the resulting death. E.g., Commonwealth v. Foster, 28 N.E.2d 427, 434-435 (Mass. 2015); People v. Brothers, 186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 98, 103 (Ct. App. 2015).</p>
<p id="76bf4299-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Sentencing consequences.</i> Whatever its reach, the original common-law felony-murder rule seldom made much practical difference, because very few criminal offenses were considered felonies, and all felonies were punishable by death, even when no victim of the offense had been killed. The principal use of the felony-murder rule was to permit capital punishment when death resulted from an unsuccessful <i>attempt</i> to commit a felony, because as Judge Stephen noted, the felony murder rule came into play when a death was caused by “an act done with <i>an intent to commit</i> a felony” (emphasis added). If the intended felony was not successfully committed, the failed attempt that caused death became a capital offense, even though the attempt by itself was only a misdemeanor at common law. See Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Comment to §210.2, pp. 30-32 (1980). Today, of course, legislatures have enacted a long list of statutory felonies, many of them nonviolent. And even for the most serious felonies, authorized sanctions generally are much lower than those applicable to murder. Transposed into the modern context, therefore, the felony-murder rule can produce a dramatic increase in the applicable punishment.</p>
<p id="76bf429a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The causation requirement.</i> Although the traditional felony-murder rule eliminates the mens rea requirement of murder, it does not dispense <span title="522" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-522">p. 522</span>with the actus reus and causation requirements. Hence, it must be shown, as in all murder cases, that the defendant’s conduct “caused” a person’s death. As we shall see when we reach the material on causation in Chapter 6 infra, a common formulation of this requirement is that (1) “but for” the felony, the death would not have occurred, and (2) the result must have been the natural and probable consequence of the defendant’s action, or that it must have been foreseeable. Underlying the second prong of this formula is the perception that the result must be fairly attributable to the defendant’s action, rather than to mere coincidence or to the intervening action of another.</p>
<p id="76bf429b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For example, in King v. Commonwealth, 368 S.E.2d 704 (Va. Ct. App. 1988), defendant King and his copilot were transporting 500 pounds of marijuana in a light plane when they became lost in fog and crashed into a mountainside. King survived the crash, but his copilot did not, and as a result King was convicted of felony murder. The appellate court reversed, holding that the drug-distribution crime was not the proximate cause of the death. Although the “but for” requirement was met (the crash would not have occurred but for the commission of the felony), the crash was not a <i>foreseeable</i> result of the felony because it was not made more likely by the fact that the plane’s cargo was contraband. The court noted that, in contrast, a finding of proximate causation might have been possible if the crash had resulted from flying the plane at low altitude to avoid detection.</p>

<p id="76bf429e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have previously examined the proposition sometimes asserted that the mens rea of a lesser offense may substitute for the mens rea of a greater offense. Reconsider <i>People v. Olsen</i>, p. 294 supra. That proposition is now rejected in England and in many American jurisdictions. Yet precisely that proposition serves as the basis of liability in felony murder. Does it have any greater justification in homicidal offenses than in other crimes? If the law is sound in requiring a particular mens rea to establish murder, is it, by definition, unsound to require less solely because the actor is guilty of another crime? The offense accompanying the killing has its own punishment. In what sense does that offense also make a crime of an otherwise non-criminal killing or justify more severe punishment for a killing that would otherwise deserve a lower sentence?</p>
<p id="76bf429f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Professor Guyora Binder argues (The Culpability of Felony Murder, 83 Notre Dame L. Rev. 965, 967 (2008)) that a person who negligently kills in the course of committing another felony can justifiably be punished for murder, not just negligent homicide, because “the felon’s additional depraved purpose aggravates his culpability for causing death carelessly.” A related argument is developed in Kenneth W. Simons, When Is Strict Criminal Liability Just?, 87 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1075, 1121-1125 (1997):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">

But can the punishment be more? I believe that it can, insofar as knowingly creating a risk of death in the context of another criminal act is more culpable behavior than knowingly creating a risk of death in the context of an innocent or less culpable act. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76bf69b1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Now consider a . . . case [where] the foreseeability of death resulting from a particular felony is just below the threshold that we require for negligent homicide. For example, consider an unarmed bank robbery in which the risk of death (from a guard or police officer) is real but not sufficient to surpass that threshold. Should we conclude that the bank robber has displayed no culpability as to the risk of death . . . ?</p>
<p id="76bf69b2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[That conclusion would rest] on too narrow a conception of negligence. . . .  To express genuine differentials in retributive blame, we should take a more subtle, holistic view of negligence. . . . [T]he unarmed bank robber . . . can properly be found negligent as to the risk of death even if the foreseeable risk of harm is less than would be required to find him negligent had he been engaged in an innocent or less culpable activity.</p>
</div>
<p id="76bf69b3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In assessing Professor Simons’ argument, note that creating a substantial risk of death may or may not be culpable, depending on whether the risk can be <i>justified</i>. The desire to commit a felony obviously cannot justify taking such a risk, and as a result, as Professor Simons points out, “the unarmed bank robber . . . can properly be found negligent as to the risk of death.” On that basis the unarmed bank robber presumably could be convicted of negligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter. Does the wrongness of the accompanying felony aggravate culpability in some additional way, so that these facts should be considered to convict the defendant of murder?</p>

No man can so conduct himself as to make it absolutely certain that he shall not be so unfortunate as to cause the death of a fellow creature. The utmost that he can do is to abstain from everything which is at all likely to cause death. No fear of punishment can make him do more than this. . . . The only good effect which such punishment can produce will be to deter people from committing any of those offences which turn into murders what are in themselves mere accidents. It is in fact an addition to the punishment of those offences, and it is an addition in the very worst way. For example, hundreds of <span title="524" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-524">p. 524</span>persons in some great cities are in the habit of picking pockets. They know that they are guilty of a great offence. But it has never occurred to one of them, nor would it occur to any rational man, that they are guilty of an offence which endangers life. Unhappily one of these hundreds attempts to take the purse of a gentleman who has a loaded pistol in his pocket. The thief touches the trigger: the pistol goes off: the gentleman is shot dead. To treat the case of this pick-pocket differently from that of the numerous pick-pockets who steal under exactly the same circumstances, with exactly the same intentions, with no less risk of causing death, with no greater care to avoid causing death,—to send them to the house of correction as thieves, and him to the gallows as a murderer,—appears to us an unreasonable course. If the punishment for stealing from a person be too light, let it be increased, and let the increase fall alike on all the offenders. Surely the worst mode of increasing the punishment of an offence is to provide that, besides the ordinary punishment, every offender shall run an exceedingly small risk of being hanged. The more nearly the amount of punishment can be reduced to a certainty the better. But if chance is to be admitted there are better ways of admitting it. It would be a less capricious, and therefore a more salutary course, to provide that every fiftieth or every hundredth thief selected by lot should be hanged, than to provide that every thief should be hanged who, while engaged in stealing, should meet with an unforeseen misfortune such as might have befallen the most virtuous man while performing the most virtuous action.</p></div>

The goal is to encourage greater care in the performance of felonious acts. . . . Still another view suggests that felons who might kill intentionally in order to complete their felonies successfully will be discouraged . . . because of their awareness that the chance of constructing a defense that would eliminate or mitigate liability is virtually nonexistent and that, therefore, their likely fate is a murder conviction. . . .

The subset of such killings that are nonculpable—thus not already subject to the threat of a substantial sanction—is undoubtedly considerably smaller. . . . Moreover, some who are aware of and even sensitive to the threatened sanction will probably still kill negligently or accidentally.</p><p id="76bf90d7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Admittedly, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove that the felony-murder rule does not annually save a considerable number of lives. Nonetheless, in a world in which the evidence is uncertain (or nonexistent) and in which it seems unlikely that felons actually hear the rule’s deterrent message in the ways that courts presume that they do, common sense would suggest putting the burden of proof upon those who contend that deterrent gains are sufficient to outweigh the infringement of our fundamental philosophy of fault and punishment. . . . Without a credible foundation in established facts, deterrence is not a real justification, but is instead a poor excuse for our infidelity [to fundamental principles of culpability].</p></div>

The law may, therefore, throw on the actor the peril, not only of the consequences foreseen by him, but also of consequences which, although not predicted by common experience, the legislator apprehends.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11404_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11404_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">95</a></span>

</div>
<p id="76bfb7ee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The answer to such arguments is twofold. First, there is no basis in experience for thinking that homicides which the evidence makes accidental <span title="526" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-526">p. 526</span>occur with disproportionate frequency in connection with specified felonies.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11413_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11413_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span> Second, it remains indefensible in principle to use the sanctions that the law employs to deal with murder unless there is at least a finding that the actor’s conduct manifested an extreme indifference to the value of human life. The fact that the actor was engaged in a crime of the kind that is included in the usual first-degree felony-murder enumeration or was an accomplice in such crime, as has been observed, will frequently justify such a finding. Indeed, the probability that such a finding will be justified seems high enough to warrant the presumption of extreme indifference that Subsection (1)(b) creates. But liability depends, as plainly it should, upon the crucial finding. The result may not differ often under such a formulation from that which would be reached under some form of the felony-murder rule. But what is more important is that a conviction on this basis rests solidly upon principle.</p>

However, it provided that for the purpose of establishing murder by an act “committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,” the fact that the actor is “engaged, or is an accomplice in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force, arson, burglary, kidnapping or felonious escape” creates a rebuttable presumption (defined in §1.12(5)) that the required indifference and recklessness existed.</p>

<i>NOTES ON THE MISDEMEANOR-MANSLAUGHTER RULE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76bfdf07-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The basic doctrine.</i> Just as a felony resulting in death can provide a basis for a murder conviction without proof of malice, in many states a misdemeanor resulting in death can provide a basis for an involuntary manslaughter conviction without proof of recklessness or negligence. The misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, also known as the unlawful-act doctrine, <span title="527" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-527">p. 527</span>was reflected in the traditional common-law definition of involuntary manslaughter. The language of Cal. Penal Code §192(b), drawn from William Blackstone’s formulation, is typical: Involuntary manslaughter is a killing “in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection.”</p>
<p id="76bfdf08-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Under this traditional common-law formula, the prosecution thus has two theories available to establish involuntary manslaughter. Under the first theory, if a defendant, after driving through a red light, has killed a pedestrian, the prosecution can argue for involuntary manslaughter on the basis that the defendant’s conduct amounted to criminal negligence under the circumstances. See p. 493 supra. Under the second theory, however, in states that recognize the unlawful-act doctrine, the prosecution need only show that the defendant’s unlawful act caused the death; proof of criminal negligence becomes unnecessary. See State v. Hupf, 101 A.2d 355 (Del. 1953).</p>
<p id="76bfdf09-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although many jurisdictions no longer recognize the unlawful-act doctrine, and thus limit involuntary manslaughter liability to conduct involving criminal negligence, California and roughly a dozen other states continue to accept it. See Wayne R. LaFave, <span class="epub-small-caps">2</span> Substantive Criminal Law <span class="epub-small-caps">§15.5 (</span>2d ed. 2015).</p>
<p id="76bfdf0a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Limitations on the unlawful-act doctrine.</i> In states that retain the unlawful-act doctrine, some of its harshest effects have been moderated by a variety of limitations. Most of these limitations are similar to the ones that apply to the felony-murder rule.</p>
<p id="76bfdf0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Proximate cause.</i> In Commonwealth v. Williams, 1 A.2d 812 (Pa. Super. 1938), the defendant had been convicted of manslaughter by vehicle on the basis of his unlawful act of failing to renew his driver’s license. The court reversed, holding that the expiration of the license had no causal connection to the accident, which had resulted from the carelessness of another driver.</p>
<p id="76bfdf0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Regulatory offenses.</i> Some courts restrict the unlawful-act doctrine to malum in se as opposed to malum prohibitum misdemeanors. E.g., People v. Holtschlag, 684 N.W.2d 730, 740 (Mich. 2004).</p>
<p id="76bfdf0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Dangerousness.</i> Another approach is to limit the doctrine to misdemeanors that rise to the level of criminal negligence (State v. Green, 647 S.W.2d 736, 746 (W. Va. 2007)), or to violations that “evince a marked disregard for the safety of others” (State v. Lingman, 91 P.2d 457 (Utah 1939)).</p>

See James J. Tomkovicz, The Endurance of the Felony-Murder Rule, 51 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1429, 1431 (1994). While the influence of the MPC in other areas has been great, it has had little success with its modest proposal to replace the felony-murder rule with a rebuttable presumption. However, statutes over the years have qualified the severity of the common-law rule in a variety of ways.</p>
<p id="76c00624-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Limiting the list of eligible felonies.</i> Some states have designated particular felonies (such as rape, arson, burglary, kidnapping, and robbery) as the only felonies on which a felony-murder conviction may be obtained. Other felonies serve only as the possible basis of a manslaughter conviction (e.g., Ind. Code §35-42-1-4) or cannot by themselves serve as the basis for conviction of any form of culpable homicide (N.Y. Penal Law §125.25(3), p. 450 supra).</p>
<p id="76c00625-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Grading of felony murder.</i> In states that still permit a wide range of felonies to trigger the felony-murder rule, a few particularly dangerous felonies—such as arson, rape, robbery, and burglary—are designated as the only felonies on which a first-degree felony-murder conviction can be obtained. Where this approach is followed (see, e.g., Cal. Penal Code §189, p. 446 supra), a killing in the course of a nondesignated felony still triggers the felony-murder rule, but the offense becomes murder in the second degree.</p>
<p id="76c00626-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Requiring a homicidal mens rea.</i> Another approach is to provide that a killing in the course of the felony can constitute murder only when it is otherwise culpable—for example, providing that the defendant must cause the death “recklessly” (Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, §636 (2015)) or “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” (Ark. Code Ann. §5-10-102 (2015)). Similarly, in Texas the felony-murder rule applies only when the defendant’s act was “clearly dangerous to human life.” See David Crump, Should We Have Different Views of Felony Murder, Depending on the Governing Statute?, 47 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 113, 118 (2014).</p>
<p id="76c00627-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Permitting affirmative defenses.</i> Some states, like New York, allow an affirmative defense when a co-felon caused the death and the defendant himself was not armed and had no reason to believe that co-felon was likely to kill. N.Y. Penal Law §125.25(3), p. 450 supra.</p>

<i>1. Abolition.</i> One state supreme court has abolished the felony-murder rule. In People v. Aaron, 299 N.W.2d 304 (Mich. 1980), the statute did not explicitly codify the felony-murder rule but provided that any murder in the course of designated felonies would be murder of the first degree. Since the statute did not define murder, the court felt free to employ its common-law authority to reject the precedents recognizing the felony-murder theory as a route to establishing malice and treated the statute as simply raising what is otherwise murder (because malice has been proved) to first-degree murder when occurring in the commission of an enumerated felony. “We believe that it is no longer acceptable to equate the intent to commit a felony with the intent to kill, intent to do great bodily harm, or wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood [of] death or great bodily harm. Today we exercise our role in the development of the common law by abrogating the common-law felony-murder rule.”</p>
<p id="76c02d3c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Is this an appropriate exercise of judicial authority?</p>
<p id="76c02d3d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Statutory interpretation.</i> In People v. Dillon, 668 P.2d 697 (Cal. 1983), the California Supreme Court decided not to follow <i>Aaron</i>, even though the wording of California’s statute is identical to Michigan’s and even though both statutes were based on the same 1794 Pennsylvania model. The court concluded that subsequent reenactments by the California legislature demonstrated an intent to codify the felony-murder rule. But <i>Aaron</i> has influenced judicial interpretation of homicide statutes in several other states. In State v. Ortega, 817 P.2d 1196 (N.M. 1991), a case of homicide in the course of a kidnapping and robbery, the court read into New Mexico’s first-degree felony-murder statute a requirement that the state prove intent to kill or conscious disregard for life. Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Matchett, 436 N.E.2d 400 (Mass. 1982), the court held that, before prosecutors can invoke that state’s second-degree felony-murder rule for nonenumerated felonies, the jury must find that the defendant demonstrated a conscious disregard for the risk to human life.</p>
<p id="76c02d3e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond these formal limitations, Professor Guyora Binder argues that in practice the great majority of felony-murder convictions involve some form of criminal negligence with respect to the resulting death, because there was either a negligent mens rea or comparable culpability implicit in other doctrinal requirements such as proximate causation. See Guyora Binder, Making the Best of Felony Murder, 91 B.U. L. Rev. 403, 552-558 (2011). Does this observation overcome criticisms of the rule? Note that the classic felony-murder rule, where accepted, bypasses any formal requirement to prove a culpable mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt. And in any case, as Professor <span title="530" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-530">p. 530</span>Binder acknowledges, the persistence a formal framework of strict liability means that in a number of “anomalous” situations (id. at 558) courts continue to uphold felony-murder liability in the absence of any culpability with respect to the resulting death. In examining the materials that follow, consider whether judicial implementation of the felony-murder rule has or has not served to mitigate the rule’s potential for unfairness and disproportionate punishment.</p>
<p id="76c02d3f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. Constitutional issues.</i> If the felony-murder rule is required by statute, then to what extent is its application to nonintentional killings unconstitutional? In <i>Dillon</i>, supra, the court read California’s felony-murder statute as imposing first-degree murder liability for a wide range of robbery killings—from accidental to premeditated homicides—and held that in order to comply with the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the sentencing court would have to consider whether the first-degree penalty, life imprisonment, was disproportionate to the culpability of the defendant in the particular case. Nelson E. Roth and Scott E. Sundby argue (The Felony-Murder Rule: A Doctrine at Constitutional Crossroads, 70 Cornell L. Rev. 446 (1985)) that courts should hold the felony-murder rule unconstitutional because it either conclusively presumes malice (thus violating the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt) or eliminates malice (thus violating the Eighth Amendment requirement that severe punishments be proportional to culpability). In The Queen v. Vaillancourt, [1987] S.C.R. 636, the Canadian Supreme Court held that the felony-murder provisions of that country’s Criminal Code permit conviction in the absence of mens rea and therefore violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in particular §7 (requiring respect for “principles of fundamental justice”) and §11(d) (guaranteeing the presumption of innocence).</p>
<p id="76c02d40-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Further limitations.</i> The limitations on the felony-murder rule that we now consider derive from three judicial improvisations: the inherently dangerous felony limitation, the merger doctrine, and restrictions on liability for killings not in furtherance of the felonious objective.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">TOBRINER</span> J. [Deceased was an eight-year-old child with a fast-growing cancer of the eye. At a medical center, her parents were advised to consent to immediate removal of the eye as the only means of saving or prolonging her life. However, defendant, a doctor of chiropractic, induced them not to do so by representing that he could cure her without surgery by treatment designed “to build up her resistance.” Defendant charged the parents $700 for his <span title="531" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-531">p. 531</span>treatment and medicine. The child died in about six months. At the conclusion of the defendant’s trial on charges of murdering the child, the judge instructed the jury that it could convict of second-degree murder if it found that defendant committed the felony of grand theft (theft by deception) and that the child died as a proximate result. Upon conviction, the defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court reversed, finding the instruction on felony murder to be erroneous. Previous California cases had ruled that the felony-murder rule could be triggered only by felonies inherently dangerous to life, and the court ruled that the felony of grand theft did not meet this requirement.]</p>
<p id="76c05458-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We have . . . recognized that the felony-murder doctrine expresses a highly artificial concept that deserves no extension beyond its required application. [But the prosecution, a]dmitting that grand theft is not inherently dangerous to life . . . asks us to encompass the entire course of defendant’s conduct so that we may incorporate such elements as would make his crime inherently dangerous. In so framing the definition of a given felony for the purpose of assessing its inherent peril to life the prosecution would abandon the statutory definition of the felony as such and substitute the factual elements of defendant’s actual conduct. In the present case the Attorney General would characterize that conduct as “grand theft medical fraud,” and this newly created “felony,” he urges, clearly involves danger to human life and supports an application of the felony-murder rule.</p>
<p id="76c05459-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To fragmentize the “course of conduct” of defendant so that the felony-murder rule applies if any segment of that conduct may be considered dangerous to life would widen the rule beyond calculation. It would then apply not only to the commission of specific felonies, which are themselves dangerous to life, but to the perpetration of any felony during which defendant may have acted in such a manner as to endanger life. The proposed approach would entail the rejection of our holding in <i>Williams</i> [63 Cal. 2d 452, that the elements of the felony in the abstract, not as committed, determine its inherent dangerousness.] [O]nce the Legislature’s own definition is discarded, the number or nature of the contextual elements which could be incorporated into an expanded felony terminology would be limitless. We have been, and remain, unwilling to embark on such an uncharted sea of felony murder.</p>
<p id="76c0545a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The felony-murder instruction should not, then, have been given; its rendition, further, worked prejudice upon defendant. It withdrew from the jury the issue of malice, permitting a conviction upon the bare showing that Linda’s death proximately resulted from conduct of defendant amounting to grand theft. The instruction as rendered did not require the jury to find either express malice or the implied malice which is manifested in an “intent with conscious disregard for life to commit acts likely to kill.” (People v. Washington, 62 Cal. 2d 777, 780.)</p>

<i>1. The abstract approach to finding inherent danger</i>. In People v. Henderson, 19 Cal. 3d 86 (1977), the California Supreme Court reversed a second-degree felony-murder conviction based on the felony of “false imprisonment . . . effected by violence, menace, fraud or deceit.” Defendant held a gun to the head of a hostage. When the hostage ducked and attempted to deflect the barrel of the gun, it went off and killed a bystander. The court found that false imprisonment does not necessarily involve the danger to life required for felony murder because the statutory elements—violence, menace, fraud, or deceit—do not all involve life-endangering conduct. Violence and menace may endanger life, but the other independently sufficient elements do not. Therefore, viewing the offense in the abstract, it is not inherently dangerous to life. The prosecution argued that the matter would not differ in substance if the legislature had created two separate false imprisonment felonies, one by violence or menace, the other by fraud or deceit. The court disagreed (19 Cal. 3d at 95):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c05460-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Legislature has not evinced a particular concern for violent as opposed to nonviolent acts of false imprisonment by separate statutory treatment, proscription, or punishment. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the cause of deterring homicide during the commission of false imprisonment is better served by imputing malice to one who kills in the course of committing false imprisonment rather than allowing the jury to determine directly the question of the presence of malice aforethought.</p>

<i>2. How dangerous?</i> The “abstract” approach sets a high bar for holding an offense inherently dangerous. Indeed the California courts have held that “for purposes of the second degree felony-murder doctrine, an ‘inherently dangerous felony’ is an offense carrying ‘a high probability’ that death will result. A less stringent standard would inappropriately expand the scope of the second degree felony-murder rule reducing the seriousness of the act which a defendant must commit in order to be charged with murder.” People v. Patterson, 778 P.2d 549, 558 (Cal. 1989). Nonetheless, California courts have found the requirement satisfied for many felonies, including arson of a motor vehicle and manufacturing methamphetamine. See People v. Howard, 34 Cal. 4th 1129, 1136 (2005).</p>
<p id="76c05462-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The scope of the underlying felony.</i> In a 1993 felony-murder case, a California appellate court considered as a predicate felony the offense of “attempt[ing] to elude a pursuing peace officer [while] driv[ing] in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.” Cal. Veh. Code §2800.2; the court held that this offense qualified as “inherently dangerous to human life” and therefore could support a conviction for felony murder. Subsequently, the legislature amended §2880.2 to more clearly define “willful or wanton disregard”; the 1996 amendment specified that this requirement could be met if the fleeing driver committed three or more violations of the traffic code.</p>
<p id="76c05463-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Is the §2800.2 offense <i>still</i> inherently dangerous? In the <i>Howard</i> case, supra, which arose after the 1996 amendment, the defendant was stopped <span title="533" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-533">p. 533</span>for a traffic violation and then attempted to flee, leading officers on a high-speed chase and running several red lights and stop signs, at speeds up to 90 miles per hour. After running an additional red light, he collided with another car, killing the driver. He was convicted of felony murder, based on the §2800.2 offense. Although—prior to the clarifying 1996 amendment—this offense had been held inherently dangerous, the California Supreme Court now held that it was not, because “willful and wanton disregard” could now consist of such conduct as driving with a suspended license or making a right turn without signaling. In dissent, Justice Baxter argued that traffic infractions committed while attempting to elude the police are inherently dangerous in all circumstances. In a third opinion, Justice Brown acknowledged that §2800.2 violations must be considered inherently dangerous (because a fleeing motorist inevitably endangers pursuing officers), but she nonetheless concurred in reversal of Howard’s conviction; she argued that because the second-degree felony-murder doctrine is “irredeemably arbitrary,” she would “abrogate the rule entirely.” 34 Cal. 4th at 1140.</p>

<i>4. Problem.</i> Consider People v. Burroughs, 35 Cal. 3d 824 (1984). Lee Swatsenbarg was diagnosed as having terminal leukemia. He sought treatment from Burroughs, who instructed him to “drink lemonade, salt water, and herb tea, but consume nothing more for the ensuing 30 days.” Burroughs also bathed Swatsenbarg in tinted lights and gave him massages, for an additional fee per session. Within two weeks, Swatsenbarg’s condition began to deteriorate. Shortly thereafter, he died from a massive hemorrhage brought on by Burroughs’s massages. Because the <i>Phillips</i> decision precluded reliance on grand theft as a predicate felony, prosecutors sought a felony-murder conviction by using the predicate offense of felonious unlicensed practice of medicine, defined as willfully practicing “any system or mode of treating the sick [without a valid license] under circumstances or conditions which cause or create a risk of great bodily harm, serious physical or mental illness, or death.” Burroughs had clearly committed this offense, and he was also convicted of felony murder, with this offense as the predicate felony. Should the offense qualify as inherently dangerous under the California test?</p>

They split into two groups, with Hines and his friend Randy Stoker hunting together in one area, and the victim, the victim’s wife, and Hines’s son hunting in a different area, approximately one-fourth mile away. As the sky was growing dark, Hines heard a turkey gobble, “saw it fan out and shot.” Hines’s shot went through heavy foliage and hit the victim approximately eighty feet away. Immediately thereafter, the victim’s wife screamed, “You shot Wood.” Hines and his son went for help, but the victim died before help could arrive.</p>

 . . . Hines contends that a convicted felon’s possession of a firearm while turkey hunting cannot be one of the inherently dangerous felonies required to support a conviction of felony murder. A felony is “inherently dangerous” when it is “dangerous per se” or “by its circumstances create[s] a foreseeable risk of death.” Hulme v. State, 273 Ga. 676, 678 (2001). Depending on the facts, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon can be an inherently dangerous felony. . . . 
<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN115F5_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N115F5_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

<p id="76c0a290-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In Ford v. State, 262 Ga. 602 (1992), the defendant was a convicted felon who was unloading a handgun when it accidentally discharged, went through the floor, and killed an occupant of the apartment below. A jury convicted Ford for felony murder based on his felonious possession of a firearm. This court reversed, finding that, because no evidence showed the defendant knew there was an apartment below him or that the victim was present, his possession of a firearm could not support a conviction of felony murder.</p>
<p id="76c0a291-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In contrast to <i>Ford</i>, Hines intentionally fired his shotgun intending to hit his target. He had been drinking before he went hunting, and there was evidence that he had been drinking while hunting. He knew that other hunters were in the area and was unaware of their exact location. He also knew that other people visited the area in which he was hunting. He took an unsafe shot at dusk, through heavy foliage, at a target eighty feet away that he had not positively identified as a turkey. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Hines’s illegal possession of a firearm created a foreseeable risk of death. Accordingly, Hines’s violation of the prohibition against convicted felons possessing firearms was an inherently dangerous felony that could support a felony-murder conviction. . . .

<span class="epub-small-caps">SEARS</span>, P.J., dissenting. . . . In <i>Ford</i>
 . . . we did not specify how to determine whether a particular felony, whether by its nature or as it was committed, was inherently dangerous to human life. Because of the severe punishments that accompany a conviction of murder . . . I conclude that for purposes of our felony-murder doctrine, a felony is inherently dangerous per se or as committed if it carries “a high probability that [a human] death will result.” People v. Patterson, 778 P.2d 549, 558 (Cal. 1989). This standard will ensure that our felony-murder rule is not inappropriately expanded by “reducing the seriousness of the act which a defendant must commit in order to be charged with murder.” Id.</p>
<p id="76c0a294-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . The fact that Hines was hunting, a dangerous sport; the fact that he had been drinking . . . ; the fact that he was hunting at dusk; and the fact that he fired a shot when he knew other hunters were in the general area . . . may establish that Hines was negligent, but do not establish that his acts created a high probability that death to a human being would result, or that he had a “life-threatening state of mind.” . . . Even though Hines may not, as stated by the majority, have positively identified his target as a turkey, he had to make a split-second decision regarding his target and concluded, based on hearing a gobble and seeing something “fan out,” that the object was a turkey. I cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, the failure of the hunter to identify his target beyond doubt carried a high probability that a human being would be killed or that he acted with a “life-threatening state of mind.” The death in this case is clearly a tragic accident. . . . But the sanction of life in prison for murder should be reserved for cases in which the defendant’s moral failings warrant such punishment. Here, the application of the felony-murder statute to Hines’s actions punishes him more severely than his culpability merits. [He] will be serving the same punishment—life in prison—as an arsonist convicted of felony murder who firebombed an apartment that he knew was occupied, causing the death of two young children, and the same punishment as an armed robber convicted of felony murder who entered a store with a firearm and shot and killed a store employee. This result is unwarranted and unnecessary, as Hines could be prosecuted and convicted of an appropriate lesser crime, such as involuntary manslaughter or the misuse of a firearm while hunting.</p>

 . . . Hunting is a time-honored recreational activity encouraged by the State of Georgia and enjoyed by many of our State’s citizens. No doubt a number of hunters have probably engaged in negligent hunting practices similar to those in this case. Although I do not condone such careless practices, neither can I agree with subjecting so many hunters to the possibility of spending life in prison when they do not fastidiously follow proper hunting procedures and accidentally shoot a fellow hunter.</p>

<p id="76c0c9a8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. The degree of danger.</i> Only a few American jurisdictions follow the California approach of limiting the felony-murder rule to felonies that are dangerous “in the abstract.” See Fisher v. State, 786 A.2d 706, 730-733 <span title="536" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-536">p. 536</span>(Md. 2001); Annot., 50 A.L.R.3d 397 (2016). Instead, most permit a felony (even a nonviolent felony like theft) to qualify if it is committed in a dangerous way. But <i>how</i> dangerous does the felony have to be? What likelihood of death does the <i>Hines</i> majority consider sufficient? What likelihood is sufficient for the dissenting judge? Should inherent danger to life mean that serious bodily harm is <i>likely</i>, that it is <i>possible</i>, or only that such harm is not completely unforeseeable?</p>
<p id="76c0c9a9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Who decides?</i> Notice that although the justices differ about the degree of foreseeability required, they agree that they themselves determine whether this defendant’s offense <i>was</i> sufficiently dangerous under all the circumstances: The majority declares: “<i>[W]e</i> conclude that Hines’s violation . . . created a foreseeable risk of death,” and the dissent states: “<i>I</i> conclude that the possession of a firearm by Hines was not . . . inherently dangerous” (emphasis added). This appears to be the usual practice in Georgia; the justices themselves determine whether the felony was inherently dangerous as committed. E.g., Mosley v. State, 536 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ga. 2000). But if dangerousness under all the circumstances is required for conviction, how can this factual determination be taken away from the jury?</p>
<p id="76c0c9aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Some courts hold that “[t]he proper procedure is to present the facts and circumstances of the particular case to the trier of fact and for the trier of fact to determine if a felony is inherently dangerous in the manner and the circumstances in which it was committed.” People v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 920 (R.I. 1995). Is this a more principled approach? Or does it—by requiring the prosecution to litigate dangerousness in each case—defeat a major purpose of the felony-murder rule?</p>
<p id="76c0c9ab-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">When the dangerousness determination is left to the jury, is there any practical difference between second-degree murder on a felony-murder theory and second-degree murder on a theory of ordinary malice—i.e., extreme recklessness that creates a great danger to life? Consider the facts of <i>Stewart</i>, supra. Stewart, the mother of a two-month-old infant, went on a crack binge for two to three days, and during this period she failed to feed the little boy, who died from dehydration. The prosecution did not claim that Stewart intentionally withheld care, but only that she had neglected her son because in her intoxicated state she had forgotten to feed him. Instead of alleging murder on a theory of conscious recklessness, the prosecution argued that Stewart was guilty of felonious child neglect and that this felony, inherently dangerous to life under the circumstances, was the cause of the infant’s death. The Rhode Island Supreme Court upheld a second-degree felony-murder conviction obtained on this basis.</p>

<i>3. Evaluating the abstract and as committed approaches.</i> Is the “as committed” approach a sensible way to manage the felony-murder rule? Would it be better to abandon the inherent-danger requirement entirely, so that <i>any</i> felony resulting in death could support a murder conviction? If not, how can courts limit the reach of the rule and preserve the legislative preference for maintaining discrete degrees of homicide, while also honoring the legislative preference for denying that calibration of culpability for those who commit (certain) felonies?</p>

The jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree felony murder, and defendant appealed. Defendant contends] that it was error, in the circumstances of this case, to instruct the jury on first-degree felony murder, because the underlying felony was armed robbery. He claims that armed robbery is an offense included in fact within the offense of murder and, therefore, under the rule announced in People v. Ireland, 70 Cal. 2d 522, as applied in People v. Wilson (1969) 1 Cal. 3d 431, such offense cannot support a felony-murder instruction. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c0f0c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[In <i>Ireland</i> the defendant, having shot and killed his wife, claimed that alcohol, prescribed medications, and cumulative emotional pressure established diminished capacity sufficient to preclude the malice required for murder.] The judge instructed the jury on the felony-murder rule, utilizing assault with a deadly weapon as the supporting felony. The effect of such instruction [was] to substantially eviscerate the defense of diminished capacity to negative malice, since malice was imputed. The net effect of this imputation would be to hold that all intentional killings accomplished by means of a deadly weapon . . . could never be mitigated to manslaughter, since all such killings included in fact an assault with a deadly weapon. We held that such effect was impermissible: “This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law. We therefore hold that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not properly be given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral part of the homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution shows to be an offense included in fact within the offense charged.”</p>
<p id="76c0f0c8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In <i>Wilson</i> the underlying felony which supported the felony-murder instruction was burglary—specifically entry coupled with the intent to commit assault with a deadly weapon. [The defendant, intending to assault his estranged wife, entered her home, then entered the bathroom where she had <span title="538" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-538">p. 538</span>taken refuge, and shot and killed her.] Since in <i>Ireland</i> we had held that assault with a deadly weapon could not support an instruction on second-degree felony murder, in <i>Wilson</i> we were faced with the question whether it could support first-degree felony murder because coupled with an entry. We concluded there was no meaningful distinction between assaults with deadly weapons indoors and outdoors, saying: “Where the intended felony of the burglar is an assault with a deadly weapon, the likelihood of homicide from the lethal weapon is not significantly increased by the site of the assault. Furthermore, the burglary statute in this state includes within its definition numerous structures other than dwellings as to which there can be no conceivable basis for distinguishing between an assault with a deadly weapon outdoors and a burglary in which the felonious intent is solely to assault with a deadly weapon.” Thus, even though burglary is one of the felonies specifically enumerated in Penal Code section 189, we excluded burglary from the operation of the felony-murder rule in those cases where the intended felony was assault with a deadly weapon for the reasons stated in <i>Ireland.</i>
</p>
<p id="76c0f0c9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant contends that the language and reasoning of <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Wilson</i> compel us to hold that armed robbery is included in fact within murder and, therefore, cannot support a felony-murder instruction. He argues that armed robbery includes as a necessary element assault with a deadly weapon by the following chain of reasoning: robbery “is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear” (Pen. Code, §211); thus robbery is assault (force or fear directed against a person) coupled with larceny, which when accomplished by means of a deadly weapon necessarily includes in fact assault with a deadly weapon; any charge of murder with respect to a killing arising out of armed robbery then necessarily includes in fact assault with a deadly weapon and cannot support a felony-murder instruction.</p>
<p id="76c0f0ca-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The net effect of defendant’s argument would be to eliminate the application of the felony-murder rule to all unlawful killings which were committed by means of a deadly weapon, since in each case the homicide would include in fact assault with a deadly weapon, even if the homicide resulted from the commission of one of the six felonies (arson, rape, mayhem, robbery, burglary or lewd and lascivious acts upon the body of a child) enumerated in section 189 of the Penal Code. . . . [W]e reject this interpretation of that language and its consequent assertion that the felony-murder rule has been abolished in all homicides accomplished by means of a deadly weapon as unwarranted both in logic and in principle.</p>
<p id="76c0f0cb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We conclude that there is a very significant difference between deaths resulting from assaults with a deadly weapon, where the purpose of the conduct was the very assault which resulted in death, and deaths resulting from conduct for an independent felonious purpose, such as robbery or rape, which happened to be accomplished by a deadly weapon. . . . Our inquiry cannot stop <span title="539" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-539">p. 539</span>with the fact that death resulted from the use of a deadly weapon and, therefore, technically included an assault with a deadly weapon, but must extend to an investigation of the purpose of the conduct. In both <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Wilson</i> the purpose of the conduct which eventually resulted in a homicide was . . . the infliction of bodily injury. . . . The desired infliction of bodily injury was in each case not satisfied short of death. Thus, there was a single course of conduct with a single purpose.</p>
<p id="76c117dc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">However, in the case of armed robbery, as well as the other felonies enumerated in section 189 of the Penal Code, there is an independent felonious purpose, namely in the case of robbery to acquire money or property belonging to another. Once a person has embarked upon a course of conduct for one of the enumerated felonious purposes, he comes directly within a clear legislative warning—if a death results from his commission of that felony it will be first-degree murder, regardless of the circumstances. . . . “The purpose of the felony-murder rule is to deter felons from killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly responsible for killings they commit.” The Legislature has said in effect that this deterrent purpose outweighs the normal legislative policy of examining the individual state of mind of each person causing an unlawful killing . . . and calibrating our treatment of the person accordingly. Once a person perpetrates or attempts to perpetrate one of the enumerated felonies, then in the judgment of the Legislature, he is no longer entitled to such fine judicial calibration, but will be deemed guilty of first-degree murder for any homicide committed in the course thereof.</p>
<p id="76c117dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Wilson</i>, when properly understood, does not eliminate this rule as urged by defendant, but merely excludes from its effect one small area of conduct, which would be irrationally included, due to the unusual nature of burglary. . . . In the normal case, burglary [is] undertaken with an independent felonious purpose, namely to acquire the property of another. In such instances the felony-murder rule would apply . . . , even if the burglary were accomplished with a deadly weapon. However, in <i>Wilson</i> the entry was coupled with the intent to commit assault with a deadly weapon, the defendant in that case bursting through the bathroom door intending to do violent injury upon the body of his wife. We were there presented with the exact situation we faced in <i>Ireland</i>, namely a single purpose, a single course of conduct, except that in <i>Wilson</i> the single course of conduct happened to include an entry, and thus technically became burglary. . . . We merely excluded from the first-degree felony-murder rule the special circumstances of <i>Wilson</i> where the entry was with the intent to commit assault with a deadly weapon. . . .

<p id="76c117de-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant in this case by embarking upon the venture of armed robbery brought himself within the class of persons who the Legislature has concluded must avoid causing death or bear the consequences of first-degree murder. The trial judge quite correctly instructed on felony murder based on homicides directly resulting from the commission of armed robbery.</p>

<i>NOTES ON THE MERGER DOCTRINE</i>
</p></h3></div>

<p id="76c117e2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a few jurisdictions permit felonious assault to serve as a predicate felony that automatically converts a resulting death into murder,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1175A_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1175A_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">20</a></span> the great majority acknowledge the need for some “merger” doctrine, in order to ensure that the felony-murder rule does not obliterate grading distinctions the legislature itself seems to have desired. See, e.g., Rose v. State, 255 P.3d 291, 293 (Nev. 2011). But courts have had difficulty determining which felonies should merge. See David Crump, Assaultive Felony Murder: Homicide with Intent to Cause Serious Injury, <span class="epub-small-caps">55</span> Santa Clara L. Rev<span class="epub-small-caps">. 247, 252-257</span> (2015). To keep the issues in focus, the following Notes center on the law of a single jurisdiction (California), but comparable questions inevitably arise in any jurisdiction that recognizes some sort of merger doctrine.</p>
<p id="76c117e4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Enumerated felonies and first-degree felony murder.</i> Two tests commonly used to determine merger are (i) whether the felony is “included in fact” in the homicide and (ii) whether the felony is “independent” of the homicide. As <i>Burton</i> indicates, the first test would require merger in all robbery cases, a result plainly in conflict with the legislative intent in enumerating this crime as a basis for felony murder. The “independent purpose” test avoids this result and requires merger only in relatively uncommon enumerated-felony situations like <i>Wilson</i>, where the only objective of the burglary was to commit an assault. But the <i>Wilson</i> holding produces anomalies of its own. Consider these problems:</p>
<p id="76c13ef5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(a) Indoors versus outdoors.</i>  Most jurisdictions reject the <i>Wilson</i> holding and permit burglary to support a conviction for first-degree felony murder, even when the defendant’s only objective was to assault the victim. E.g., People v. Miller, 297 N.E.2d 85 (N.Y. 1973). These courts generally support their conclusion by arguing that assaults committed indoors are more dangerous than those committed outside. Is that claim convincing? And even if it is, why is dangerousness relevant to the merger question? Consider two crimes committed outdoors. In the first, the defendant sees a well-dressed person on the street, pushes him to the ground, and steals his wallet. In the second, the defendant, after being insulted and beaten by a person he encounters in the street, shoots him in anger, intending to kill. Which crime is more dangerous to human life? Which can be invoked as a basis for a felony-murder conviction if the victim dies?</p>
<p id="76c13ef6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Non-assaultive and non-independent purposes.</i> Under <i>Wilson</i>, a defendant who enters a home intending to steal a TV is guilty of first-degree murder if the homeowner dies as an accidental result of the burglary, but a defendant who enters the home and kills the homeowner intentionally might not be guilty of first-degree murder. Massachusetts courts apply a somewhat <span title="541" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-541">p. 541</span>similar rule; “armed home invasion” cannot be a predicate for a felony-murder conviction “when the conduct which constitutes the felony [is not] separate from the acts of personal violence which constitute a necessary part of the homicide itself. This requirement ensures that not every assault that results in a death will serve as a basis for murder in the first degree on the theory of felony-murder.” Commonwealth v. Scott, 37 N.E.3d 1054, 1058 (Mass. 2015).</p>
<p id="76c13ef7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">If this approach makes sense, what should be the result when a defendant enters a home intending to kill one person but accidentally kills someone else? Should the merger rule apply, so that his mental state would have to be assessed under all the circumstances, or should he be guilty of first-degree murder automatically under the felony-murder rule? Is this situation a felony murder, because the defendant had a purpose independent of the homicide he actually committed, or is it “anomalous to place the person who intends to attack one person and in the course of the assault kills another inadvertently . . . in a worse position than the person who from the outset intended to attack both persons and killed one or both”?<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11794_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11794_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">21</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76c13ef9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider People v. Farley, 46 Cal. 4th 1053 (2009). The defendant became so obsessed with Laura Black, a fellow employee, that he was fired, but he continued to stalk and harass her. One day he entered her place of work armed with a semiautomatic weapon and began firing, killing seven people and wounding (but not killing) four others, including Black. Under California precedent, if Farley’s sole intent had been to assault just one of the workers—Black—he would be guilty of seven counts of first-degree felony murder. But if Farley had intended to assault <i>all 11</i> workers, he would be permitted to raise mitigating mens rea defenses. The California Supreme Court moved to eliminate this anomaly, but not by permitting merger in both scenarios. Instead, the court overruled <i>Wilson</i> and held that burglary and other enumerated felonies would <i>never</i> merge.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN117AC_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N117AC_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">22</a></span> The court concluded that “there is no room for interpretation when the Legislature has defined first degree felony murder to include any killing ‘committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, . . . burglary.’ [T]he power to define crimes lies exclusively with the Legislature.” 46 Cal. 4th at 1119.</p>
<p id="76c13efb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is <i>Farley</i> sound? Given the absence of legislative history indicating the legislature’s intentions with respect to a fact situation like <i>Wilson</i>, is the court’s reliance on statutory wording persuasive? Does <i>Farley</i> eliminate the dilemmas of first-degree felony murder, or does it produce new anomalies that the legislature itself might not have intended?</p>
<p id="76c13efc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Non-enumerated felonies and second-degree felony murder.</i> In People v. Mattison, 4 Cal. 3d 177 (1971), the defendant had supplied methyl alcohol <span title="542" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-542">p. 542</span>to a fellow prison inmate, who died from ingesting it. Applying the independent-purpose test, the court found merger inappropriate and upheld a conviction for second-degree felony murder, based on the offense of furnishing the drug. In People v. Robertson, 34 Cal. 4th 156 (2004), the defendant shot and killed a person he believed was trying to steal hubcaps from his car. In defense he claimed he had not intended to kill but was only trying to scare the victim. The court again found merger inappropriate and upheld a second-degree felony-murder conviction, based this time on the felony of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner (Cal. Penal Code §246.3). The court held that the independent purpose necessary for felony murder was established by the defendant’s <i>defense</i>—that he was merely trying to frighten away the thief. But three dissenting justices expressed concern over the irony that what might be an accidental killing or involuntary manslaughter became murder because the defendant denied having an intent to kill. Justice Brown’s dissent noted that the merger rule “was intended to avoid elevating every felonious assault that ends in death to second-degree murder, a result that would usurp most of the law of homicide.” She then observed:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c13efd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This [explanation for the merger rule] begins with a nonsequitur from which it never recovers. The merger doctrine applied in this fashion actually ensures the Legislature’s careful calibration of culpability will be ignored in precisely those cases where the absence of malice is a critical issue. Thus, in cases involving intentional assaults—where there will likely be evidence of premeditation and malice—the People must prove every element of the crime. In cases where evidence of malice is likely to be absent or highly equivocal, the second-degree felony-murder rule makes proof of malice unnecessary and imposes murder liability for what might otherwise be manslaughter. It takes no genius to discern that a rule that relieves the People of the need to prove malice because the defendant asserts he did not harbor any is problematic. . . . The problem is: second-degree felony murder . . . is incompatible with the idea of careful gradations of liability.</p>

<span class="epub-small-caps">CHIN</span>, J. In this murder case, the trial court instructed the jury on second degree felony murder with shooting at an occupied vehicle under Penal Code section 246 the underlying felony.</p>
<p id="76c16614-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[On September 13, 2003, Judy Onesavanh, Sophal Ouch, and Bounthavy Onethavong] were driving to the store . . . in a blue Mitsubishi that Onesavanh’s father owned. Onesavanh’s brother, George, also drives the car. The police consider George to be highly ranked in the Asian Boys street gang (Asian Boys). That evening Ouch was driving, with Onesavanh in the <span title="543" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-543">p. 543</span>front passenger seat and Onethavong behind Ouch.

<p id="76c16615-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Ouch and Onesavanh identified the Honda’s driver as . . . Rathana Chan, a member of the Tiny Rascals Gangsters (Tiny Rascals), a [rival] criminal street gang. . . . Chan was never found. . . . Two months after the shooting, [defendant] was arrested and subsequently . . . admitted he was in the backseat of the Honda at the time [of the shooting.

<p id="76c16616-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Defendant . . . was charged with murder . . . , two counts of attempted murder, [and] shooting into an occupied vehicle. . . . The court also instructed the jury on second degree felony murder based on shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (§246). . . . The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder [but] acquitted defendant of both counts of attempted murder. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c16617-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To avoid the anomaly of putting a person who merely intends to frighten the victim in a worse legal position than the person who actually intended to shoot at the victim, . . . we need to reconsider our holdings in <i>Robertson</i> [supra p. 542]. When the underlying felony is assaultive in nature, such as a violation of section 246 or 246.3 [discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner], we now conclude that the felony merges with the homicide and cannot be the basis of a felony-murder instruction. An “assaultive” felony is one that involves a threat of immediate violent injury. . . . In determining whether a crime merges, the court looks to its elements and not the facts of the case. Accordingly, if the elements of the crime have an assaultive aspect, the crime merges with the underlying homicide even if the elements also include conduct that is not assaultive. For example, in People v. Smith, [35 Cal. 3d 798 (1984)], the court noted that child abuse under section 273a “includes both active and passive conduct, i.e., child abuse by direct assault and child endangering by extreme neglect.” Looking to the facts before it, the court decided the offense was “of the assaultive variety,” and therefore merged. . . . It reserved the question whether the nonassaultive variety would merge. . . . Under the approach we now adopt, both varieties would merge. . . . This approach both avoids the necessity of consulting facts that might be disputed and extends the protection of the merger doctrine to the potentially less culpable defendant whose conduct is not assaultive. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c16618-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We do not have to decide at this point exactly what felonies are assaultive in nature, . . . and which are inherently collateral to the resulting homicide and do not merge. But shooting at an occupied vehicle under section 246 is assaultive in nature and hence cannot serve as the underlying felony for purposes of the felony-murder rule. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c16619-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We overrule <i>People v. Robertson. . . . 
</i> This conclusion means the trial court erred in this case in instructing the jury on the second degree felony-murder rule.

<span class="epub-small-caps">MORENO,</span> J. . . . The majority’s reformulation of the merger doctrine is an improvement, but it does not correct the basic flaw in the felony-murder rule; that it is largely unnecessary and, in those unusual instances in which it would produce a different result, may be unfair. . . . Only in those rare cases in which it is not clear that the defendant acted in conscious disregard of life will the second degree felony-murder rule make a difference, but those are precisely the rare cases in which the rule might result in injustice. I would eliminate the second degree felony-murder rule and rely instead upon the wisdom of juries to recognize those situations in which a defendant commits second degree murder by killing the victim during the commission of a felony that is inherently dangerous to life.</p>

<p id="76c18d32-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The felony-murder rule applies only when the act of killing is done in furtherance of the felony. In the materials considered so far, this condition has been easily met. In this section we deal with three situations where this requirement makes felony-murder liability less clear—situations where the lethal act arguably occurs <i>after commission</i> of the felony, where the lethal act arguably is <i>unrelated</i> to the felony, and where the lethal act is committed by someone <i>resisting</i> the felony.</p>
<p id="76c18d33-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Lethal acts after commission of the felony.</i> Suppose that a burglar causes a fatal accident while making his getaway or shortly thereafter. If his actions are considered necessary to successfully complete his crime, they would be “in furtherance” of the felony, and he would be guilty of murder—<i>first-degree</i> murder in many jurisdictions. But if the accident occurred after his getaway was complete, he might be guilty only of involuntary manslaughter or of no crime at all.</p>
<p id="76c18d34-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Consider People v. Gillis, 712 N.W.2d 419 (Mich. 2006). When a homeowner detected the defendant trying to break in, the defendant abandoned his attempt and drove away. Ten to 15 minutes later, about ten miles from the <span title="545" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-545">p. 545</span>home, a trooper spotted a car matching the homeowner’s description and tried to stop it. The defendant sped away and collided with another vehicle, killing two of its occupants. Did these deaths occur in the perpetration of the burglary? Was Gillis still escaping from the commission of that offense, or—having already escaped—was he merely attempting to flee from the officer who pulled him over? The Michigan Supreme Court, by a 3–2 majority, ruled that Gillis was fleeing <i>from the burglary</i> and hence was guilty of first-degree murder. Do you agree? Suppose Gillis had stopped for a hamburger before resuming his drive. Would a fatal accident at this point make him guilty of first-degree murder?</p>
<p id="76c18d35-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">For other situations presenting these issues, see Annot., 58 A.L.R.3d 851 (2016).</p>
<p id="76c18d36-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Lethal acts unrelated to the felony.</i> Suppose that felon <i>A</i>, after entering a building to commit arson, sees an elderly tenant, decides to rob him, and in the process accidentally kills him. The “in furtherance” requirement does not seem to matter here because <i>A</i> is guilty of felony murder, regardless of whether his act furthers the original arson plan; his predicate felony of robbery is sufficient by itself to establish felony murder. But the “in furtherance” requirement becomes important when <i>A</i> has a confederate (felon <i>B</i>) who planned the arson with him. If the robbery by <i>A</i> is unrelated to the arson that <i>B</i> helped plan, then <i>B</i> is not guilty of either the robbery or the resulting homicide. But if the robbery somehow furthers the arson plan, <i>B</i> could be guilty of murder.</p>
<p id="76c18d37-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The latter conclusion, of course, assumes that <i>B</i> can be held responsible for the acts of his co-felon <i>A.</i> We have not examined that issue in the preceding material, because all the felony-murder cases considered up to this point have focused on the liability of a single perpetrator. As we have seen, that person’s liability for his own actions can increase dramatically when the felony-murder rule applies. But the common situation involving multiple confederates introduces an additional complication, because in some situations the felony-murder rule increases the liability of all co-felons, while in other situations it may apply only to the one who is most directly responsible for the killing.</p>
<p id="76c18d38-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Analyzing these situations requires an understanding of the doctrines of complicity and conspiracy, which govern the liability of one person for the criminal conduct of another. We examine this subject in depth in Chapter 7, infra. For present purposes it is sufficient to keep in mind the core principle—a person is liable for the criminal acts of another when he intentionally aids or encourages those acts, or (under some circumstances) when those acts are reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of a common objective. The “in furtherance” requirement therefore does double duty in cases involving several co-felons: It determines when felon <i>A</i> is subject to the felony-murder rule for his own lethal actions, and it determines when those lethal actions trigger felony-murder liability for his confederates. See Steven R. Morrison, Defending Vicarious Felony Murder, 47 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 129, 132 (2014).</p>

Almeida, 68 A.2d 595 (Pa. 1949) . . . , involving the killing of a policeman shot by other police attempting to apprehend robbers[.] [T]he question later arose whether [that theory] should be applied to an effort to inculpate a defendant for the killing of his cofelon at the hands of the victim of the crime. Commonwealth v. Redline, 137 A.2d 472 (Pa. 1958). The court there held against liability[, concluding] that “in order to convict for felony-murder, the killing must have been done by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking.” The court refused, however, actually to overrule the <i>Almeida</i> decision, thereby creating a distinction . . . between the situation in which the victim was an innocent party and the killing therefore merely “excusable” and that in which the deceased was a felon and the killing thus “justifiable.” Twelve years later the Pennsylvania court did overrule <i>Almeida</i> in a case involving Almeida’s companion, Smith. (Commonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Myers, 261 A.2d 550 (Pa. 1970).) The court noted, inter alia, the harsh criticism leveled against the common-law felony rule, its doubtful deterrent effect, the failure of the cases cited in <i>Almeida</i> to support the conclusions reached therein, the inappropriateness of tort proximate-cause principles to homicide prosecution, and the “will-of-the-wisp” distinction drawn by the <i>Almeida</i> court between justifiable and excusable homicides. . . .

The court had no difficulty in finding defendants guilty of murder. The court in <i>Taylor</i> noted . . . that a person could not be held liable for homicide unless the act is either actually or constructively committed by him, but indicated it was inapplicable to a case where defendants forced deceased to occupy a place of danger in order that they might carry out the crime. In <i>Keaton</i>, the court said defendant would be responsible for the “reasonable, natural and probable result of his act” of placing deceased in danger of his life.

<i>1. Who does the killing?</i>  Under the agency theory, the identity of the actual killer becomes a central issue; only if the act of killing is done by a co-felon or someone acting in concert with a co-felon will the felony-murder rule apply. Under the proximate-cause theory, in contrast, the central issue is whether the killing (regardless of who did it) is within the foreseeable risk in committing the felony.</p>
<p id="76c1db6c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Although a substantial majority of American jurisdictions adhere to the agency theory,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119A3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N119A3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">23</a></span> a number of states have adopted the proximate cause approach.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119AB_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N119AB_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">24</a></span> Complicating the picture are statutory revisions that arguably introduce proximate-cause concepts. For example, New York Penal Law §125.25, p. 450 supra, provides that a person is guilty of murder if, “in the course of and in furtherance of [designated felonies,] he, or another participant . . . causes the death of a person other than one of the participants.” Several other states follow the New York model. E.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. §53A-54(c) (2016).</p>
<p id="76c1db6f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Does the New York statute’s “in-furtherance” requirement signify the adoption of the agency approach, or does the “he . . . causes” language require adoption of the proximate-cause theory? The New York Court of <span title="549" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-549">p. 549</span>Appeals chose the latter interpretation and upheld a felony-murder conviction where a policeman was fatally shot by a fellow officer in the course of a gun battle with several armed robbers.

<p id="76c20280-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The New Jersey legislature amended its felony-murder statute several times in response to the problem illustrated by <i>Canola</i>. The current language provides that a person is guilty of murder whenever he commits or attempts to commit a designated felony, and “in the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, any person <i>causes the death</i> of a person other than one of the participants . . . .” N.J. Stat. §2C:11-3(a)(3) (2016) (emphasis added). The statute, like that of New York, affords an affirmative defense for felons who can show that they had no reason to anticipate the use of deadly force. N.J. Stat. §2C:11-3(a)(3)(a)-(d) (2016). The New Jersey Supreme Court held that this statute was intended to adopt Justice Sullivan’s position in his <i>Canola</i> concurrence: a proximate-cause approach, coupled with an exception precluding liability when the victim is a co-felon. See State v. Martin, 573 A.2d 1359, 1368-1371 (N.J. 1990). Thus, although the <i>Canola</i> decision remains influential in guiding judicial interpretation outside New Jersey, the decision has been superseded by legislation in its home state.</p>
<p id="76c20281-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">What accounts for the tendency of some legislatures to expand the felony-murder rule by adopting the proximate-cause approach? Professor Leonard Birdsong argues that this broader approach “would better serve to deter felons who might kill while also reaffirming the sanctity of human life, even the life of co-felons who may be killed.” Birdsong, The Felony Murder Doctrine Revisited, 33 Ohio N.U.

We disagree. . . . Whether the death is an immediate result or an attenuated one, the necessary mens rea is present if the causal act is part of the felonious conduct. No more persuasive is the argument that the proximate cause view will extend criminal liability unreasonably. First, New York law is clear that felony murder . . . is limited to those deaths caused by one of the felons in furtherance of their crime. More than civil tort liability must be established; criminal liability will adhere only when the felons’ acts are a sufficiently direct cause of the death.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN119E0_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N119E0_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">a</a></span>

<i>2. Implied malice.</i> Where a killing by a non-felon occurs during a highly dangerous felony, the felons arguably could be held liable for murder under an “implied malice” or “depraved heart” theory without resort to the <span title="550" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-550">p. 550</span>felony-murder doctrine, on the ground that the felonious actions were taken with a conscious disregard for life. The MPC apparently supports this view. The Commentary to its causation provision, §2.03, provides the following example: “[I]f one of the participants in a robbery shoots at a policeman with intent to kill and provokes a return of fire by that officer that kills a bystander . . . the robber who initiates the gunfire could be charged with purposeful murder.” Model Penal Code and Commentaries, Part I, at 263 (1985). Some courts have reached the same conclusion, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gaynor, 648 A.2d 295, 298 (Pa. 1994). California has adopted the agency approach to killings by non-felons; accordingly, <i>felony-murder</i> theory is not available to convict felon <i>A</i> of murder when the victim of an armed robbery kills his co-felon <i>B.</i> But in People v. Gilbert, 408 P.2d 365, 373 (Cal. 1966), the court explained that the surviving felons sometimes can be held for murder <i>without</i> relying on the felony-murder rule:</p>

Thus, the victim’s self-defensive killing or the police officer’s killing in the performance of his duty cannot be considered an independent intervening cause for which the defendant is not liable, for it is a reasonable response to the dilemma thrust upon the victim or the policeman by the intentional act of the defendant or his accomplice.</p>

<i>Questions:</i> <i>(a)</i> Procedurally, what difference (if any) is there between the results obtainable under this “implied malice” or “provocative act” theory and those obtainable under the felony-murder rule? Was the court inconsistent in rejecting the proximate-cause theory for felony murder but adopting it for implied-malice murder?</p>
<p id="76c20287-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b)</i> What facts should be sufficient to convict for murder on the “provocative act” theory, without resort to the felony-murder rule? Presumably, a robber who opens fire on his victim would exhibit conscious disregard for life, and the victim’s decision to shoot back would be “a reasonable response to the dilemma thrust upon the victim.” Should a court reach the same result if the robber simply points his gun at the victim, without actually firing? See People v. Antick, 539 P.2d 43 (Cal. 1975); Taylor v. Superior Ct., 477 P.2d 131 (Cal. 1970). What if the robber simply says “your money or your life” without displaying a weapon at all?</p>

What penalty should be authorized for the most serious homicidal offenses? Are there situations in which capital punishment is an appropriate or even a necessary response to a criminal offense? In this section we explore the case for and against the death penalty, in terms of principles applicable to criminal punishments generally and in terms of the special requirements of constitutional law flowing from the Eighth Amendment prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.” Of course, the two perspectives are closely intertwined. We believe it preferable to put constitutional problems to one side, for a moment, and to consider first the factors that might motivate a state legislator or a concerned citizen to support or oppose capital punishment as a policy matter.</p>

In 1977, only one execution took place; in 1999, when the rate of executions reached its peak, 98 people were executed, an average of two per week. This rate dropped off significantly in the following years: 28 people were executed in 2015. The rate of death sentencing has similarly declined. Beginning at a rate of 137 sentences per year in 1977, capital sentences peaked at 317 in 1996. Rates declined unevenly thereafter, but have declined steadily since 2003; 73 inmates were sentenced to death in 2014 and 49 in 2015.</p>

Approximately 44 percent of death row inmates are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent (including all races) are of Hispanic origin. Native Americans, Asians, and other races comprise about 3 percent. Approximately one-third of those on death row have no prior felony convictions, though about 9 percent have a prior homicide conviction.

In Chapter 2 we examined materials bearing on the justification of criminal punishments. One concern throughout that chapter was to identify the extent to which punishment serves various utilitarian goals. Another was to consider whether wrongdoing itself justifies punishment of wrongdoers—regardless of the social utility or disutility of doing so—and whether punishment of wrongdoers is not merely morally permissible but morally required. These issues, explored in Chapter 2 with reference to punishment in general, can provide a framework for examining the justification of the ultimate punishment of death.</p>

<p id="76c29def-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">There has been intense debate for decades about whether the death penalty deters (or, more precisely, whether it deters more effectively than life imprisonment). The debate takes three tracks. One is theoretical, using deterrence principles to generate predictions about the effect of capital punishment. Another track is empirical, applying sophisticated methods to data in an attempt to measure the deterrent effect. The third track focuses on the burden of proof: If deterrence effects remain unclear, does that uncertainty argue for or against the death penalty?</p>
<p id="76c29df0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">(1) <i>At the theoretical level</i>, the argument for a deterrent effect from capital punishment derives from both its severity and its salience. As long as most potential murderers believe that execution is a worse fate than life imprisonment, the more severe sanction should—all else equal—decrease the homicide rate. Moreover, even infrequent application of an especially severe sanction should have this effect, given that people tend to overestimate the likelihood of particularly feared or “salient” harms.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B6B_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B6B_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">36</a></span> But from another perspective, theory <span title="556" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-556">p. 556</span>undermines the case for a deterrent effect. The certainty and speed of imposing a sanction play key roles in generating deterrence,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B75_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B75_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">37</a></span> and the death penalty is anything but speedy and sure. There are approximately 15,000-20,000 murders each year in the United States. But the national execution rate in the modern era has been in the range of 50-100 each year, and about 15 years elapses between sentencing and execution. Furthermore, the mental impairments that many capital defendants suffer and the impulsive nature of many capital crimes work against the assumption of rational calculation that deterrence theory must maintain. Deterrence theory can even be used to predict that capital punishment will <i>increase</i> the murder rate, because state executions may have a “brutalization effect”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B80_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B80_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">38</a></span> by encouraging the use of violence to deal with problems. Thus, deterrence theory tells us that the death penalty will either reduce, increase, or have no effect on the number of murders. Some economists argue, however, that empirical analysis can sort among these three alternatives.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11B88_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11B88_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">39</a></span>

For an argument that deterrence does not matter to supporters or opponents of capital punishment, see Dan M. Kahan, The Secret Ambition of Deterrence, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 413, 437-439 (1999). Many of those opposed to the death penalty say they would reject it as immoral or unfair even if it were known to deter. Conversely, proponents of the death penalty often consider it a morally appropriate response to certain crimes, whether or not it deters. Is it justifiable to set aside the deterrence issue in this way? Would it be wrong to inflict capital punishment without any prospect of a crime-control benefit?</p>

Professors Cass Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule contend that if capital punishment were known to deter, then the government would be obligated to employ it to save innocent lives. In their view, opponents of capital punishment are mistaken to distinguish between the government’s responsibility for capital punishment and its responsibility for inadequately deterred private murder: Both <span title="558" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-558">p. 558</span>kinds of killings result from choices by the state.

The policy mix that does not include capital punishment is not an “omission” or a “failure to act” in any meaningful sense. If a government chooses that mix, it is allocating a certain set of rights to both murderers and their victims; the latter are certainly given a right to be free from murder, but the right is limited by the terms of the anticipated punishment. . . .

<p id="76c31342-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One retributivist answer is that punishment is required even when it will not benefit society because only punishment can restore equality among persons.

<p id="76c31343-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The death penalty also serves a powerful expressive function. “The death penalty reminds us . . . that we are responsible for what we do, so that dire consequences for immoral acts are eminently appropriate.” Louis P.

Robinson &amp; John M. Darley, The Utility of Desert, 91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 453, 477 (1997).

Or can the imposition of lesser or different punishments adequately respect the equality of victims, express revulsion at the crime, and therefore maintain the criminal law’s legitimacy? Kant maintained that only the lex talionis could provide a standard sufficiently certain and unwavering, see p. 101 supra.

The question is not as silly as it might first appear. Some criminal acts may be so dreadful that a simple execution would not come close to mirroring the harm inflicted by the perpetrator. What arguments are there, either within or outside of retributivism, for such limitations on punishment? Moreover, the death penalty itself is now ostensibly carried out in a manner designed to make it as painless as possible. Justice Stevens has observed that “by requiring that an execution be relatively painless, we necessarily protect the inmate from enduring any punishment that is comparable to the suffering inflicted on his victim.” Baze v. Rees, 533 U.S. 35, 80-81 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11CA0_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11CA0_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">54</a></span>

<p id="76c33a5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">One retributivist argument against extreme punishments emphasizes the requirement that punishment be fully deserved. Some situations and mental impairments negate the ability to make rational choices, and accordingly the criminal law provides full or partial defenses in such circumstances. See Chapter 8, pp. 982-1095 infra. Should mental disabilities and social disadvantage that fall just short of a full or partial defense preclude the most severe punishment on the ground that it is disproportionate to culpability? If murderers who suffer from acute social deprivation or psychological <span title="561" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-561">p. 561</span>impairment do not deserve the death penalty, what punishment do they deserve? For discussion of these arguments, see Carol S. Steiker, The Death Penalty and Deontology, in The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Criminal Law 444-452 (John Deigh &amp; David Dolinko eds., 2011). Note also the procedural implications of this retributive concern: If social deprivation and mental disability <i>sometimes</i> render the death penalty disproportionate to culpability, shouldn’t a probing examination of such background circumstances be a retributive precondition for judgments about whether to impose the death penalty in a particular case?</p>

Cassell, Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet Study, 41 Stan. L. Rev. 121, 121 (1988) (calling the study “severely flawed” and maintaining that the risk of executing the innocent is “too small to be a significant factor in the debate over the death penalty”).

Some observers are not optimistic; they suggest that forensic evidence is not available in most cases and that the outcome of these cases will still be affected by the factors that led to false convictions before the availability of DNA testing—faulty eyewitness identifications, perjured testimony, planted evidence, jailhouse informants who falsely claim that the cellmate confessed to them, and so on. Brandon Garrett, Convicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong (2011), documents the pervasiveness of such practices. Garrett studied the trials of 250 people exonerated by DNA evidence and found non-DNA related flaws to be so common that he concluded that the 250 may be “just the tip of the iceberg.” Id. at 11. For instance, in many of the cases Garrett studied, police had fed details of the crime to defendants during extensive interrogations, often coupled with abuse or threats. As a result, a high proportion of the exonerees confessed and included in their confession details of the crime that supposedly only the perpetrator could have known. Id. at 23-27, 38-39. To what extent do the DNA exonerations represent only the tip of the iceberg? What rate of wrongful convictions would be acceptable?</p>
<p id="76c36177-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A risk of error is inherent in any human endeavor. Is this risk less acceptable in capital cases than in ordinary criminal cases? Many seem to think so, but why? Obviously, it is not possible to correct a wrongful execution after the fact, but is it really possible to “correct” the injustice of life imprisonment served by an innocent person who was wrongfully convicted of a non-capital offense? Are mistakes more likely in capital cases than in ordinary cases? On the one hand, capital cases receive more resources at trial and on appeal, which ought to promote greater accuracy. On the other hand, ineffective <span title="563" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-563">p. 563</span>assistance of counsel in capital trials is far from uncommon, so the impact of trial resources should not be overstated. David R. Dow, The Autobiography of an Execution (2010). Moreover, the most aggravated murders generate intense pressure to “solve” the case quickly and produce a conviction, which can lead to dubious police investigatory practices, such as reliance on coercive interrogations that generate false statements. The same pressures may lead prosecutors to offer unreliable evidence, such as testimony from jailhouse informants, and to suppress potentially exculpatory information. See Samuel R. Gross, The Risks of Death: Why Erroneous Convictions Are Common in Capital Cases, 44 Buff. L. Rev. 469 (1996).</p>

What about other kinds of inequality? Poor defendants clearly get much worse legal representation than wealthy defendants, and this disparity—though not the product of intentional discrimination—leads to disproportionate numbers of poor people on death row. See Stephen B. Bright, Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not for the Worst Crime But for the Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L.J. 1835 (1994). One view, pungently expressed by Ernest van den Haag, is that “unequal justice [punishing some guilty offenders according to desert, even if others get away] is the only justice we have, and certainly better than equal injustice—giving no murderer the punishment his crimes deserves.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11D2C_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11D2C_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">60</a></span>

<p id="76c3afae-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Until the middle of the twentieth century, opponents of the death penalty had largely devoted their efforts to legislative reform, as it was widely assumed that the Constitution left the question of capital punishment—like nearly all other questions of criminal justice—to the states and the political branches of the federal government. During the 1950s and 1960s, however, when the Supreme Court shined a constitutional spotlight on issues of racial justice and the rights of criminal defendants, abolitionists launched a concentrated assault on the constitutionality of capital punishment.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11D9D_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11D9D_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">64</a></span> Recall that at common law all murder was punishable by death. Gradually, the scope of capital punishment was narrowed, first by the division of murder into two degrees, so that only the more serious was subject to mandatory capital punishment, and then by the introduction of discretion in sentencing even for the highest category of criminal homicides. By the beginning of the twentieth century, 23 American jurisdictions made capital punishment discretionary in first-degree murder cases, and by 1962, all the remaining jurisdictions had adopted this approach.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11DA5_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11DA5_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">65</a></span>
</p>
<p id="76c3afb1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Litigation challenging this punishment scheme focused on two issues:</p>
<p id="76c3afb2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>1. Procedural due process.</i> All the states committed the death penalty decision to the discretion of the judge or jury, but none provided any standards <span title="566" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-566">p. 566</span>to guide the exercise of that discretion. The reliance on unguided discretion was prevalent in sentencing decisions generally, but many thought that when a choice between life and death was to be made, due process required some explicit criteria of decision. The Court rejected that view in McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 207-208 (1971), holding that “committing to the untrammeled discretion of the jury the power to pronounce life or death is [not] offensive to anything in the Constitution.” The Court reasoned that:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c3afb3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">To identify before the fact those characteristics of criminal homicides and their perpetrators which call for the death penalty, and to express these characteristics in language which can be fairly understood and applied by the sentencing authority, appear to be tasks which are beyond present human ability. . . . The States are entitled to assume that jurors confronted with the truly awesome responsibility of decreeing death for a fellow human will act with due regard for the consequences of their decision and will consider a variety of factors. . . . 
</p>
</div>
<p id="76c3d6c4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>McGautha</i> proved to be less significant than it seemed, however, because the same concerns about unguided discretion soon surfaced again in attacks specifically grounded in the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.</p>
<p id="76c3d6c5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>2. Cruel and unusual punishment.</i> Only a year after <i>McGautha</i>, a 5–4 majority of the Court held in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), that capital punishment, as then administered, violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The Court’s holding was stated in a brief per curiam opinion that made no attempt to set forth the majority’s reasoning. Each of the nine justices filed a separate concurring or dissenting opinion explaining his own approach to the Eighth Amendment issue, with none of the five justices in the majority joining any of the others’ opinions. Only Justices Brennan and Marshall concluded that all capital punishment was unconstitutional. Justice Brennan argued that capital punishment did not comport with human dignity, while Justice Marshall maintained that average citizens, if fully informed of the death penalty’s excessiveness in relation to its penological purposes, would reject it as morally unacceptable. The other three concurring justices rested their objections to capital punishment on narrower grounds. Justice Douglas stressed the potential for discriminatory administration of the death penalty. Justice White noted that the extreme infrequency of imposition of the death penalty in the years preceding <i>Furman</i> rendered the penalty incapable of promoting its social or public purposes. In perhaps the most famous passage of the voluminous <i>Furman</i> opinions (id. at 309-310), Justice Stewart emphasized not only the infrequency, but also the randomness of the penalty’s imposition:</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c3d6c6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual. [I]f any basis can be discerned for the selection of these few to be sentenced to die, it is the constitutionally impermissible basis of race. But racial discrimination has not been proved, and I put it to one <span title="567" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-567">p. 567</span>side. I simply conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed.</p>
</div>
<p id="76c3d6c7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Chief Justice Burger and Justices Blackmun, Powell, and Rehnquist dissented. The dissenters stressed the long tradition and continued acceptance of capital punishment and argued that the majority’s position involved an unwarranted intrusion into the legislative process.</p>
<p id="76c3d6c8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Because a clear majority of the justices had neither rejected capital punishment outright nor indicated under what conditions it might be preserved, <i>Furman</i> created considerable confusion for states that desired to retain the death penalty. Two alternatives appeared plausible to address the concerns raised in <i>Furman</i> about the arbitrary or discriminatory application of the death penalty: (1) enacting legislation to make capital punishment mandatory in certain cases; or (2) establishing guidelines to determine who would be subjected to capital punishment. By 1976, at least 35 states and the U.S. Congress had enacted new capital punishment legislation; half of these jurisdictions had adopted provisions for a mandatory death penalty, while the remainder opted for schemes under which the sentencing authority would be required to consider specified aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11DF3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11DF3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">66</a></span> The Court soon confronted challenges to the new legislation, granting certiorari to hear challenges to new death penalty statutes from Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana.</p>

</p>
<p id="76c3fde0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We address initially the basic contention that the punishment of death for the crime of murder is, under all circumstances, “cruel and unusual” <span title="568" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-568">p. 568</span>in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. . . . We now hold that the punishment of death does not invariably violate the Constitution. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fde1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is clear from the . . . precedents that the Eighth Amendment has not been regarded as a static concept. As Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, “[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958). Thus, an assessment of contemporary values concerning the infliction of a challenged sanction is relevant to the application of the Eighth Amendment. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fde2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive. A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S., at 100. This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” [T]he inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects. First, the punishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. Second, the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.</p>
<p id="76c3fde3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Of course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the limited role to be played by the courts. [W]hile we have an obligation to insure that constitutional bounds are not overreached, we may not act as judges as we might as legislators. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fde4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Therefore, in assessing a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature against the constitutional measure, we presume its validity. We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved.</p>
<p id="76c3fde5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . We now consider specifically whether the sentence of death for the crime of murder is a per se violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. We note first that history and precedent strongly support a negative answer to this question. It is apparent from the text of the Constitution itself that the existence of capital punishment was accepted by the Framers. . . . For nearly two centuries, this Court, repeatedly and often expressly, has recognized that capital punishment is not invalid per se. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fde6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Four years ago, the petitioners in <i>Furman</i> and its companion cases predicated their argument primarily upon the asserted proposition that standards of decency had evolved to the point where capital punishment no longer could be tolerated. . . . The petitioners in the capital cases before the Court today renew the “standards of decency” argument, but developments during the four years since <i>Furman</i> have undercut substantially the assumptions upon which their argument rested. Despite the continuing debate, dating back to the 19th century, over the morality and utility of capital punishment, it is now evident that a large proportion of American society continues to regard it as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction. . . . The legislatures of at least 35 States have enacted new statutes that provide for the death penalty for at least <span title="569" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-569">p. 569</span>some crimes that result in the death of another person. [T]he relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se. Rather, the reluctance of juries in many cases to impose the sentence may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fde7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As we have seen, however, the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society. The Court also must ask whether it comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment. Although we cannot “invalidate a category of penalties because we deem less severe penalties adequate to serve the ends of penology,” the sanction imposed cannot be so totally without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering.</p>
<p id="76c3fde8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders.</p>
<p id="76c3fde9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In part, capital punishment is an expression of society’s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct. This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs. “The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they ‘deserve,’ then there are sown the seeds of anarchy—of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law.” Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S., at 308 (Stewart, J., concurring). . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fdea-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Statistical attempts to evaluate the worth of the death penalty as a deterrent to crimes by potential offenders have occasioned a great deal of debate. The results simply have been inconclusive. . . . The value of capital punishment as a deterrent of crime is a complex factual issue the resolution of which properly rests with the legislatures, which can evaluate the results of statistical studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of approach that is not available to the courts. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fdeb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, we must consider whether the punishment of death is disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed. There is no question that death as a punishment is unique in its severity and irrevocability. . . . But we are concerned here only with the imposition of capital punishment for the crime of murder, and when a life has been taken deliberately by the offender, we cannot say that the punishment is invariably disproportionate to the crime. It is an extreme sanction, suitable to the most extreme of crimes.</p>
<p id="76c3fdec-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We hold that the death penalty is not a form of punishment that may never be imposed, . . . regardless of the procedure followed in reaching the decision to impose it. . . . Because of the uniqueness of the death penalty, <i>Furman</i> held that it could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c3fded-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="570" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-570">p. 570</span>Jury sentencing has been considered desirable in capital cases in order “to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system—a link without which the determination of punishment could hardly reflect ‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ” But it creates special problems. Much of the information that is relevant to the sentencing decision may have no relevance to the question of guilt, or may even be extremely prejudicial to a fair determination of that question. This problem, however, is scarcely insurmountable. Those who have studied the question suggest that a bifurcated procedure—one in which the question of sentence is not considered until the determination of guilt has been made—is . . . likely to ensure elimination of the constitutional deficiencies in <i>Furman.</i>
</p>
<p id="76c3fdee-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the provision of relevant information under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used. . . .  Since the members of a jury will have had little, if any, previous experience in sentencing, they are unlikely to be skilled in dealing with the information they are given. . . . It seems clear, however, that the problem will be alleviated if the jury is given guidance regarding the factors about the crime and the defendant that the State, representing organized society, deems particularly relevant to the sentencing decision. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c424ff-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">While some have suggested that standards to guide a capital jury’s sentencing deliberations are impossible to formulate, the fact is that such standards have been developed. [The Court here referred to the MPC proposals. See §210.6, Appendix.] While such standards are by necessity somewhat general, they do provide guidance to the sentencing authority and thereby reduce the likelihood that it will impose a sentence that fairly can be called capricious or arbitrary. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c42500-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In summary, the concerns expressed in <i>Furman</i> that the penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance. As a general proposition these concerns are best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c42501-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">We now turn to consideration of the constitutionality of Georgia’s capital-sentencing procedures. In the wake of <i>Furman</i>, Georgia amended its capital punishment statute, but chose not to narrow the scope of its murder provisions. Thus, now as before <i>Furman</i>, in Georgia “[a] person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.” Ga. Code Ann. §26-1101(a) (1972). All persons convicted of murder “shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life.” §26-1101(c) (1972).</p>
<p id="76c42502-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Georgia did act, however, to narrow the class of murderers subject to capital punishment by specifying 10 statutory aggravating circumstances, one of which must be found by the jury to exist beyond a reasonable doubt <span title="571" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-571">p. 571</span>before a death sentence can ever be imposed.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11EC8_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11EC8_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">48</a></span> In addition, the jury is authorized to consider any other appropriate aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The jury is not required to find any mitigating circumstance in order to make a recommendation of mercy that is binding on the trial court, but it must find a <i>statutory</i> aggravating circumstance before recommending a sentence of death. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c4250e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">On their face these procedures seem to satisfy the concerns of <i>Furman.</i> No longer should there be “no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.”</p>
<p id="76c4250f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The petitioner contends, however, that the changes in the Georgia sentencing procedures are only cosmetic, that the arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned by <i>Furman</i> continue to exist. . . . First, the petitioner focuses on the opportunities for discretionary action that are inherent in the processing of any murder case under Georgia law. He notes that the state prosecutor has unfettered authority to select those persons whom he wishes to prosecute for a capital offense and to plea bargain with them. Further, at the trial the jury may choose to convict a defendant of a lesser included offense rather than find him guilty of a crime punishable by death, even if the evidence would support a capital verdict. And finally, a defendant who is convicted and sentenced to die may have his sentence commuted by the Governor of the State and the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.</p>
<p id="76c44c20-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="572" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-572">p. 572</span>The existence of these discretionary stages is not determinative of the issues before us. At each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice system makes a decision which may remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for the death penalty. <i>Furman</i>, in contrast, dealt with the decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who had been convicted of a capital offense. Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution. <i>Furman</i> held only that, in order to minimize the risk that the death penalty would be imposed on a capriciously selected group of offenders, the decision to impose it had to be guided by standards so that the sentencing authority would focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant. . . .

<i>1. The provisional nature of the 1976 decisions.</i> The Supreme Court did not attempt to catalog the essential elements of a constitutional death penalty statute in <i>Gregg</i> or its quartet of accompanying cases. In <i>Gregg</i>, the Court explained that “each distinct system must be examined on an individual basis.” In Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242 (1976), the Court upheld Florida’s new capital scheme, which (like Georgia’s) required the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors prior to the imposition of the death penalty, but placed ultimate responsibility for sentencing with the trial judge rather than the jury. In Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262 (1976), the Court upheld the Texas system, which limited capital punishment to a subset of five categories of murders<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11F89_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11F89_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">67</a></span> and required the jury to answer three yes-or-no questions during the sentencing phase.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN11F91_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N11F91_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">68</a></span> If the jury answered “yes” to all three questions, then the judge was required to impose a death sentence. The Court reasoned that the five categories of murders were equivalent to aggravating circumstances and noted that Texas courts had read the second question put to the jury—the probability of the defendant’s future dangerousness—as permitting the defense to place before the jury whatever mitigating circumstances might exist. The three statutory schemes from Georgia, Florida, and Texas that passed constitutional muster in 1976 came to be known as “guided discretion” statutes, in that they neither mandated the imposition of capital punishment upon conviction of a given offense nor left the decision to the standardless discretion of the sentencer. In Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976), and Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325 (1976), the Court struck down statutes that mandated the automatic imposition of a capital sentence upon conviction of certain categories of murders.</p>
<p id="76c4733e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">These five opinions, issued on the same day, marked a beginning rather than an end to the Supreme Court’s constitutional regulation of capital punishment. Since then, the Court has continued to demarcate the constitutional <span title="574" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-574">p. 574</span>contours of capital trials, sometimes revising its holdings and reasoning in the 1976 cases.</p>

<i>2. Requiring individualized capital sentencing.</i> In <i>Woodson</i> and <i>Roberts</i>, the Court rejected mandatory capital sentencing, despite its obvious appeal as a response to concerns about excessive sentencing discretion. A plurality of the justices held that mandatory death sentences were inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency. Moreover, the plurality expressed the concern that any mandatory capital sentencing scheme would fail to guide juries effectively, because past experience with mandatory statutes suggested that juries would simply refuse to convict of capital murder when they felt that death was an inappropriate punishment. Thus, the plurality observed, the “mandatory statutes enacted in response to <i>Furman</i> have simply papered over the problem of unguided and unchecked jury discretion.” <i>Woodson</i>, 428 U.S. at 302.</p>
<p id="76c47340-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Can the same point be made about the statute upheld in <i>Gregg</i>?</p>
<p id="76c47341-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Most importantly for future cases, the <i>Woodson</i> plurality (id. at 303-304) emphasized that the fundamental respect for individual dignity underlying the Eighth Amendment requires</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c47342-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of each convicted defendant [and the circumstances of the offense] before the imposition upon him of a sentence of death. . . . A process that [fails to provide such consideration] . . . treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death.</p>
</div>
<p id="76c47343-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court later struck down an exceptionally narrow mandatory statute that required a death sentence only for murder committed by a defendant serving a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U.S. 66 (1987). The Court noted that prior conviction of an offense carrying a life sentence provided insufficient information about the seriousness of the present killing, the defendant’s leadership role in its commission, or mitigating circumstances that might fall short of a complete defense. The Court also noted that a mandatory capital sentence was not essential for deterrence because prisoners serving life sentences who kill could still face the death penalty under a regime of guided discretion.</p>
<p id="76c47344-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s reasons for rejecting wholly mandatory statutes led to challenges to capital statutes that limited the kinds of information that a sentencer could consider in mitigation. Sandra Lockett was a young woman who participated in the robbery of a pawnshop. She had stayed in the car while her brother and two other men entered the shop and shot the pawnbroker after an unexpected struggle. Rejecting a plea offer to voluntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery, Lockett went to trial for capital murder and was sentenced to death. The sentencing judge was permitted to consider neither her youth, minor role in the offense, lack of serious criminal record, nor her good prospects for rehabilitation. Ohio’s capital statute specified that <span title="575" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-575">p. 575</span>once any of seven aggravating circumstances was found, the death penalty must be imposed unless the judge found that (1) the victim had induced or facilitated the offense; (2) it was unlikely that the defendant would have committed the offense but for the fact that he or she was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation; or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the defendant’s psychosis or mental deficiency. The Court struck down this statute by a 7–1 vote but was widely split in its reasoning. The four-member plurality, led by Chief Justice Burger, found the narrow range of permissible mitigating circumstances to be a fatal flaw. “[T]he sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, [must] not be precluded from considering <i>as a mitigating factor</i>, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.” Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978).</p>
<p id="76c49a55-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Cases subsequent to <i>Lockett</i> extended this principle. In Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982), the defense offered in mitigation the fact that the defendant, who was 16 years old at the time of the offense, had a history of beatings by a harsh father and serious emotional disturbance. The Oklahoma statute permitted consideration of “any mitigating circumstances,” but the sentencing judge ruled that, while the defendant’s youth was relevant in mitigation, the troubled family background and emotional disturbance were not relevant as a matter of law. The Court held that the evidence of Eddings’s background could not be ruled irrelevant and that the sentencer must give some consideration to it. The Court said that “a consistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false consistency.” 455 U.S. at 112. In Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986), the Court held it impermissible to exclude evidence regarding the defendant’s good behavior in jail while awaiting trial, despite the dissent’s argument that such evidence had little probative value given the special incentives for good behavior under the circumstances.</p>
<p id="76c49a56-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The <i>Woodson</i>-<i>Lockett</i> line of cases eventually led to a partial invalidation of both the Florida and the Texas statutes that had been upheld in 1976 in <i>Proffitt</i> and <i>Jurek</i>, respectively. In Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393 (1987), the Court held that Florida’s statute was deficient because it, like the Ohio statute invalidated in <i>Lockett</i>, precluded the sentencer from considering mitigating factors not specified in the statute. In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989), the Court held that the Texas statute violated the requirement of individualized sentencing because it precluded adequate consideration of Penry’s particular mitigating evidence—which concerned his mental retardation and abused childhood. The only place for consideration of such evidence in the Texas scheme was in relation to the question whether “the defendant would pose a continuing threat to society through future criminal acts of violence.” See p. 573, footnote 68 supra. On <i>that</i> question, Penry’s evidence was far more likely to be considered aggravating than mitigating. The Court ruled that because the Texas scheme prevented the jury from considering Penry’s mental retardation and abused background as <i>mitigating</i> factors, it <span title="576" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-576">p. 576</span>precluded a “reasoned moral response to the defendant’s background, character, and crime.” Id. at 328.</p>
<p id="76c49a57-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">At the same time that the Court requires broad allowance for mitigating evidence, it has also held that prosecutors are entitled to balance that evidence by introducing victim impact testimony. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 822 (1991), p. 109 supra. Some studies suggest that the inclusion of victim impact evidence makes jurors more likely to return a sentence of death. See, e.g., Jerome Deise &amp; Raymond Paternoster, More Than a “Quick Glimpse of the Life”: The Relationship Between Victim Impact Evidence and Death Sentencing, 40 Hastings Const. L.Q. 611 (2013).</p>
<p id="76c49a58-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Question:</i> Was the Court correct to broadly allow both mitigating evidence and victim impact evidence? If not, which should be curtailed and why?</p>
<p id="76c49a59-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>3. The central tension in the Supreme Court’s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.</i> The Court’s approach to mitigating evidence seems to flow naturally from its 1976 decision in <i>Woodson</i>, but it is in obvious tension with the <i>Furman</i> and <i>Gregg</i> goals of confining and structuring the sentencing decision. Can the two principles be harmonized? A majority of the Court has always assumed so, but two justices gave up, with markedly different results.</p>
<p id="76c49a5a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Scalia, concurring in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), lamented that <i>Woodson</i> and <i>Lockett</i> “completely exploded whatever coherence the notion of ‘guided discretion’ once had.” Id. at 661. He refused any attempt to reconcile the commands of individualization and guided discretion: “To acknowledge that ‘there perhaps is an inherent tension’ between [the <i>Woodson</i>-<i>Lockett</i>] line of cases and the line stemming from <i>Furman</i>
 . . . is rather like saying that there was perhaps an inherent tension between the Allies and the Axis Powers in World War II.” Id. at 664. He concluded that the only possible response was to jettison the requirement of individualized sentencing because it bore no relation to the text of the Eighth Amendment. “<i>Woodson</i> and <i>Lockett</i>
 . . . have some claim to my adherence because of the doctrine of stare decisis. [But s]tare decisis cannot command the impossible. Since I cannot possibly be guided by what seem to me incompatible principles, I must reject the one that is plainly in error. . . . Accordingly, I will not, in this case or in the future, vote to uphold an Eighth Amendment claim that the sentencer’s discretion has been unlawfully restricted.” Id. at 672-673.</p>
<p id="76c49a5b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Justice Blackmun, dissenting from the Court’s denial of certiorari in Callins v. Collins, 510 U.S. 1141 (1994), agreed with Justice Scalia that the tension between the commands of individualized sentencing and guided sentencing was constitutionally intolerable, but he reached a different conclusion about how to handle the conflict (id. at 1144-1153):</p>
<div class="epub-blockquote">
<p id="76c49a5c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Experience has taught us that the constitutional goal of eliminating arbitrariness and discrimination from the administration of death can never be achieved without compromising an equally essential component of fundamental fairness—individualized sentencing.</p>
<p id="76c49a5d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is tempting, when faced with conflicting constitutional commands, to sacrifice one for the other or to assume that an acceptable balance between <span title="577" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-577">p. 577</span>them already has been struck. In the context of the death penalty, however, such jurisprudential maneuvers are wholly inappropriate. The death penalty must be imposed “fairly, and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.” Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 112 (1982). . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c49a5e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored—indeed, I have struggled—along with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the Court’s delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved, . . . I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c4c16f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The theory underlying . . . 
<i>Lockett</i> is that an appropriate balance can be struck between the <i>Furman</i> promise of consistency and the <i>Lockett</i> requirement of individualized sentencing. . . . While one might hope that providing the sentencer with as much relevant mitigating evidence as possible will lead to more rational and consistent sentences, experience has taught otherwise. It seems that the decision whether a human being should live or die is so inherently subjective—rife with all of life’s understandings, experiences, prejudices, and passions—that it inevitably defies the rationality and consistency required by the Constitution.</p>
</div>
<p id="76c4c170-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are Justices Scalia and Blackmun right that there is no possible reconciliation of <i>Furman</i> and <i>Lockett</i>? For one close consideration of the tension and an attempt to resolve it, see Scott E. Sunby, The <i>Lockett</i> Paradox: Reconciling Guided Discretion and Unguided Mitigation in Capital Sentencing, 38 UCLA L. Rev. 1147 (1991). Professor Sunby argues (id. at 1207) that death penalty administration does not pose an “all-or-nothing [choice] between discretion or no discretion,” and that the Court can continue to seek a middle ground between the position of Justice Scalia (which entails overruling <i>Lockett</i>) and that of Justice Blackmun (which entails overruling <i>Gregg</i>).</p>
<p id="76c4c171-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">More recently, Justice Breyer (in an opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg) has highlighted a different irreconcilable tension he believes the Court’s case law creates: Detailed procedural review is necessary to ensure reliability and fairness in administration of the death penalty, but this process creates “excessively long periods of time that individuals typically spend on death row” in dehumanizing conditions and this delay undermines the penological goals of the death penalty by undermining deterrence and “attenuat[ing] the community’s interest in retribution.” Glossip v. Gross, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2764-2769 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting). As a result, he believes it “highly likely” that the death penalty is now unconstitutional and has urged full briefing on that question. Id. at 2776-2777. Is he right that this tension is also irreconcilable?</p>
<p id="76c4c172-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In a separate opinion, Justice Scalia challenged this view, pointing out that the conditions of confinement could be modified to address the claim of dehumanization. As for the penological goals, Justice Scalia cited studies showing a deterrent effect and questions Justice Breyer’s claim that society’s interest in retribution “can be served almost as well by a sentence of life in prison without parole.” Id. at 2769. Justice Scalia argued that “whether the death penalty and <span title="578" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-578">p. 578</span>life imprisonment constitute more-or-less equivalent retribution is a question far above the judiciary’s pay grade.” Id. at 2748 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>

<i>4. Other concerns.</i> Justice Stevens, a necessary fifth vote to reinstate the death penalty in <i>Gregg</i> and the companion cases, changed his views about the death penalty before leaving the bench, but he did not rely on the tension between <i>Gregg</i> and <i>Lockett.</i> Instead, he pointed to his concerns that death-qualified juries are biased in favor of convictions, that the risk of error in capital cases is greater because of the disturbing facts, that application of the death penalty is discriminatory, and that the sentence is irrevocable. These factors led him to conclude that the death penalty does not survive a cost-benefit analysis. Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 84-86 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice Breyer echoed these concerns in greater detail in his 40-page dissenting opinion in <i>Glossip</i>. If they are correct that these factors exist, are they—either alone or in combination—sufficient to strike down the death penalty as unconstitutional? Justice Scalia sharply disagreed with Justice Stevens in <i>Baze</i> and with Justice Breyer in <i>Glossip</i>. He argued that Justice Stevens had failed to prove why the death penalty in particular was problematic, because disturbing facts and discriminatory sentencing are not limited to death penalty cases. Similarly, he argued, any analysis that found fault with death-qualifying juries must necessarily extend to the whole system of challenges for cause and peremptory strikes. Regardless, Justice Scalia concluded, parsing the social benefits and costs of the death penalty is beyond the scope of the Court’s authority and is best left to legislatures. Id. at 87-93 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). In response to Justice Breyer, he wrote that “[b]y arrogating to himself the power to overturn [the Framers’ decision to leave it to the people to decide whether or not to have capital punishment], Justice Breyer does not just reject the death penalty, he rejects the Enlightenment.” <i>Glossip</i>, supra, at 2750.</p>
<p id="76c4c174-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Are the problems outlined by Justices Stevens and Breyer unique to the death penalty? If not unique, do these flaws nonetheless require greater judicial involvement because they are present to a greater degree or because of what is at stake in a capital case? Are they sufficiently demonstrated to justify overturning capital punishment as a categorical matter (as opposed to addressing the problems in a more targeted way), or would such a remedy overstep the judiciary’s role in our constitutional system, as Justice Scalia suggests?</p>

<i>5. The method of execution.</i> In the past, states used a variety of methods to execute individuals, including hanging, the firing squad, and the electric chair. Today, the dominant method of execution is lethal injection using a three-drug protocol where the first drug used acts as a sedative to induce unconsciousness, the second drug acts as a paralytic agent to inhibit movement, and the third drug induces cardiac arrest. Until roughly 2009, states used sodium thiopental as the first drug in the protocol, and the Supreme Court upheld the use of that drug against an Eighth Amendment challenge that it posed too <span title="579" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-579">p. 579</span>great a risk of misuse, which in turn could result in significant pain for the defendant. <i>Baze</i>, supra.</p>
<p id="76c4c176-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Having failed in their constitutional challenge, anti-death penalty advocates successfully pressured the lone American manufacturer of sodium thiopental to stop making the drug. When states turned to pentobarbital as the replacement, anti-death penalty advocates similarly pressured the manufacturer of that drug to stop selling it for use in executions. States next turned to midazolam. When Oklahoma used the drug in the execution of Clayton Lockett, he was writhing in pain, attempting to lift his head, and clenching his teeth after the sedative was supposed to have taken effect, leading state officials to halt the execution. (Lockett died of a heart attack a short time later.)<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN120B3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N120B3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">69</a></span> In the wake of Lockett’s botched execution, defendants brought an Eighth Amendment challenge alleging that the use of midazolam created too great a risk of severe pain. The Supreme Court rejected the argument in a 5–4 decision, with the majority finding that the challengers had failed “to satisfy their burden of establishing that any risk of harm was substantial when compared to a known and available alternative method of execution.” Id. at 2738. The majority reasoned that, because “it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional, it necessarily follows that there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out.” Id. at 2732-2733 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Justice Sotomayor’s dissent criticized the majority for requiring petitioners to identify an alternative method of execution, arguing that a “barbarous” method of execution “does not become less so just because it is the only method currently available.” Id. at 2795 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).

<p id="76c4e88f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law’s requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes. Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct. Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants. Presumably for these reasons, in the 13 years since we decided Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989) [upholding the constitutionality of capital punishment for mentally retarded offenders], the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges have deliberated over the question whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal. The consensus reflected in those deliberations informs our answer to the question presented by this case: whether such executions are “cruel and unusual punishments” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>

 . . . In [1986], the public reaction to the execution of a mentally retarded murderer in Georgia apparently led to the enactment of the first state statute prohibiting such executions. In 1988, when Congress enacted legislation reinstating the federal death penalty, it expressly provided that a “sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded.” In 1989, Maryland enacted a similar prohibition. . . .

<p id="76c536bc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Much has changed since then. . . . In 1990, Kentucky and Tennessee enacted statutes similar to those in Georgia and Maryland, as did New Mexico in 1991, and Arkansas, Colorado, Washington, Indiana, and Kansas in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, when New York reinstated its death penalty, it emulated the Federal Government by expressly exempting the mentally retarded. Nebraska followed suit in 1998. . . . [I]n 2000 and 2001 six more States—South Dakota, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, and North Carolina—joined the procession.

<p id="76c55dd0-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders. . . . Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55dd1-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution. First, there is a serious question as to whether either justification that we have recognized as a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retarded offenders. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 183 (1976) identified “retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders” as the social purposes served by the death penalty. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55dd2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to retribution . . . the severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability of the offender. Since <i>Gregg</i>, our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes. . . . If the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55dd3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">With respect to deterrence . . . the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable—for example, the diminished ability to understand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses— . . . also make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information. . . .

<span title="583" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-583">p. 583</span>The reduced capacity of mentally retarded offenders provides a second justification for a categorical rule making such offenders ineligible for the death penalty. The risk “that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty,” Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978), is enhanced, not only by the possibility of false confessions, but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation. . . . Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes. As <i>Penry</i> demonstrated, moreover, reliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury. Mentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution.</p>
<p id="76c55dd5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of “the legislatures that have recently addressed the matter” and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal. . . . [W]e therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution “places a substantive restriction on the State’s power to take the life” of a mentally retarded offender. . . .

<p id="76c55dd8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court . . . miraculously extracts a “national consensus” forbidding execution of the mentally retarded, from the fact that 18 States—less than <i>half</i> (47%) of the 38 States that permit capital punishment (for whom the issue exists)—have very recently enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded. . . . Our prior cases have generally required a much higher degree of agreement before finding a punishment cruel and unusual on “evolving standards” grounds. In <i>Coker</i>, we proscribed the death penalty for rape of an adult woman after finding that only one jurisdiction, Georgia, authorized such a punishment. In <i>Enmund</i>, we invalidated the death penalty for mere participation in a robbery in which an accomplice took a life, a punishment not permitted in 28 of the death penalty States (78%). . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55dd9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court attempts to bolster its embarrassingly feeble evidence of “consensus” with the following: “It is not so much the number of these States that is significant, but the <i>consistency</i> of the direction of change.” (emphasis added). But in what other direction <i>could we possibly</i> see change? Given that 14 years ago all the death penalty statutes included the mentally retarded, any change <span title="584" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-584">p. 584</span>(except precipitate undoing of what had just been done) was <i>bound to be</i> in the one direction the Court finds significant enough to overcome the lack of real consensus. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55dda-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Even less compelling (if possible) is the Court’s argument that evidence of “national consensus” is to be found in the infrequency with which retarded persons are executed in States that do not bar their execution. . . . 
<i>If</i> execution of the mentally retarded is “uncommon”; and if it is not a sufficient explanation of this that the retarded constitute a tiny fraction of society (1% to 3%); then surely the explanation is that mental retardation is a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor at sentencing, <i>Penry.</i> For that reason, even if there were uniform national sentiment in <i>favor</i> of executing the retarded in appropriate cases, one would still expect execution of the mentally retarded to be “uncommon.” . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55ddb-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">But the Prize for the Court’s Most Feeble Effort to fabricate “national consensus” must go to its appeal (deservedly relegated to a footnote) to the views of assorted professional and religious organizations, members of the so-called “world community,” and respondents to opinion polls. . . . [T]he views of professional and religious organizations and the results of opinion polls are irrelevant. Equally irrelevant are the practices of the “world community,” whose notions of justice are (thankfully) not always those of our people. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c55ddc-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Beyond the empty talk of a “national consensus,” the Court gives us a brief glimpse of what really underlies today’s decision: pretension to a power confined <i>neither</i> by the moral sentiments originally enshrined in the Eighth Amendment (its original meaning) nor even by the current moral sentiments of the American people. “ ‘[T]he Constitution,’ the Court says, ‘contemplates that in the end <i>our own judgment</i> will be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.’ ” . . . The arrogance of this assumption of power takes one’s breath away. And it explains, of course, why the Court can be so cavalier about the evidence of consensus. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c584ed-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court gives two reasons why the death penalty is an excessive punishment for all mentally retarded offenders. First, the “diminished capacities” of the mentally retarded raise a “serious question” whether their execution contributes to the “social purposes” of the death penalty, viz., retribution and deterrence. (The Court conveniently ignores a third “social purpose” of the death penalty—“incapacitation of dangerous criminals and the consequent prevention of crimes that they may otherwise commit in the future,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 183, n.28 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). But never mind; its discussion of even the other two does not bear analysis.) Retribution is not advanced, the argument goes, because the mentally retarded are <i>no more culpable</i> than the average murderer, whom we have already held lacks sufficient culpability to warrant the death penalty. . . .

</p>
<p id="76c584ef-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">As for the other social purpose of the death penalty that the Court discusses, deterrence: That is not advanced, the Court tells us, because the mentally retarded are “less likely” than their non-retarded counterparts to “process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and . . . control their conduct based upon that information.” . . . [T]he Court does not say that <i>all</i> mentally retarded individuals cannot “process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and . . . control their conduct based upon that information”; it merely asserts that they are “less likely” to be able to do so. But surely the deterrent effect of a penalty is adequately vindicated if it successfully deters many, but not all, of the target class. . . .

The Supreme Court has placed some limits on the states, however. In Hall v. Florida, 134 S.

The same year that the Court initially condoned execution for intellectually disabled offenders in <i>Penry</i>, it also allowed the execution of defendants older than 15 but younger than 18 at the time of their offenses. Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989). When the Court overruled <i>Penry</i> in <i>Atkins</i>, many predicted—correctly, it turned out—that <i>Stanford</i> would no longer survive.</p>

<i>3. Post</i>-Atkins <i>proportionality cases.</i> <b>
<i>(a)</i>
</b> <b>
<i>Juveniles.</i>
</b> Three years after <i>Atkins</i>, the Court overruled <i>Stanford</i>, holding that the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for defendants who were juveniles at the time of their offenses. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005). The Court relied on the methodology of <i>Atkins</i> to find a new societal consensus against the execution of juvenile offenders. The Court found objective indicia of a national consensus in the rejection of the juvenile death penalty in a substantial number of states, the infrequency of its use where it remained on the books, and the consistency in the trend toward abolition of the practice.</p>
<p id="76c584f8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court also relied upon common knowledge (what “any parent knows”) and “scientific and sociological studies” to establish that “juvenile offenders cannot, with reliability, be classified among the worst offenders.” Id. at 569. The Court noted “the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles,” that juveniles “are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,” and that the personality traits of juveniles are “more transitory, less fixed.” Id. at 569-570. The Court concluded that “[o]nce the diminished culpability of juveniles is recognized, it is evident that the penological justifications for the death penalty [retribution and deterrence] apply to them with lesser force than to adults.” Id. at 571.</p>
<p id="76c584f9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court discussed, in detail, international law and practice, a factor its <i>Atkins</i> opinion had mentioned only briefly, in footnote 21. The Court <span title="587" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-587">p. 587</span>stressed that “the United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile death penalty,” (id. at 575) that international human rights covenants had repudiated the juvenile death penalty, and that the United Kingdom in particular had long rejected it. The Court concluded, “It does not lessen our fidelity to the Constitution or our pride in its origins to acknowledge that the express affirmation of certain fundamental rights by other nations and peoples simply underscores the centrality of those same rights within our own heritage of freedom.” Id. at 578.</p>
<p id="76c584fa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Three dissenters, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, rejected both the outcome and the methodology of the <i>Simmons</i> majority: “The Court reaches this implausible result by purporting to advert, not to the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment, but to ‘the evolving standards of decency’ of our national society . . . [which it determines by reference to] the subjective views of five Members of this Court and like-minded foreigners.” Id. at 608. Justice O’Connor dissented on a narrower ground. She accepted the Court’s “evolving standards” methodology but argued that no new societal consensus had emerged on the propriety of the juvenile death penalty.</p>
<p id="76c5ac0b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Is the proportionality analysis performed by the Court in <i>Simmons</i> and <i>Atkins</i> persuasive? Do other Eighth Amendment principles, such as the requirements to guide discretion and assure consideration of mitigating evidence, preclude the execution of juveniles? See Carol Steiker &amp; Jordan Steiker, Defending Categorical Exemptions to the Death Penalty: Reflections on the ABA’s Resolutions Concerning the Execution of Juveniles and Persons with Mental Retardation, 61 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 89 (1998).</p>
<p id="76c5ac0c-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Child rape. </i>In Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008), the Court overturned a statute authorizing the death penalty for the rape of a child under the age of 12. The Court followed the blueprint of <i>Simmons</i> and <i>Atkins.</i> The Court also found it significant that child rape occurs more often than first-degree murder; thus to allow the death penalty for child rape could not “be reconciled with our evolving standards of decency and the necessity to constrain the use of the death penalty.” Id. at 439.</p>
<p id="76c5ac0d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Why is the high incidence of child sex offenses an argument <i>against</i> the death penalty? Why shouldn’t states be permitted to use aggravating factors to reduce the number of child rape cases that would qualify for death? The Court’s view was that jurors could not be trusted to balance aggravating factors against mitigating factors in this context because the crime “in many cases will overwhelm a decent person’s judgment.” Id. at 439. Is that prediction realistic? If so, does it cast doubt on the jury’s ability to balance these factors in <i>any</i> capital murder case?</p>
<p id="76c5ac0e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>4. Methodological questions. </i>
<b>
<i>(a) Societal consensus?</i>
</b> In both <i>Atkins</i> and <i>Simmons</i>, the justices disagreed on how to evaluate the indicia of an emerging societal consensus. In considering whether legislative change has led to a new consensus narrowing the permissible scope for the death penalty, how should the Court count states that have abolished the death penalty entirely? How should the Court count states that have called for a moratorium on <span title="588" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-588">p. 588</span>executions? Should we count the federal government as one jurisdiction out of 51? Justice Thomas has argued that a federal law permitting a punishment in a given circumstance should automatically refute any claim that there is a national consensus against that punishment, no matter the tally in the states. Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 107 (2010) (Thomas, J., dissenting). For a critique of this argument, see Rachel E. Barkow, Categorizing <i>Graham</i>, 23 Fed. Sent’g Rep. 49, 52 (2010).</p>
<p id="76c5ac0f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Should the Court consider indicia of societal consensus other than domestic legislation? Does statistical evidence of decreasing executions indicate societal rejection of the death penalty? See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 433-434 (2008). Is the Court justified in considering foreign law and international human rights conventions? See Youngjae Lee, International Consensus as Persuasive Authority in the Eighth Amendment, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 63 (2007).</p>
<p id="76c5ac10-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) The role of expert opinion.</i> How should the Court assess the judgment of experts? In <i>Hall</i>, the majority relied on the fact that, contrary to the Florida law at issue, medical experts do not take IQ scores as conclusive evidence of intellectual capacity. Justice Alito, writing for himself and three others, criticized the majority because “what counts are our society’s standards—which is to say, the standards of the American people—not the standards of professional associations, which at best represent the views of a small professional elite.” Id. at 2005. Is Justice Alito correct that a subset of society is the wrong benchmark for Eighth Amendment purposes? Or should the Court’s decisions reflect the current state of expert knowledge in a field, even if uninformed popular views may be otherwise?</p>
<p id="76c5ac11-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) The Court’s independent judgment.</i> In <i>Atkins</i> and <i>Simmons</i>, the Court portrayed proportionality analysis as a two-step process: first, determination of the national consensus, and second, the Court’s own assessment of penological justifications. If society has not reached a consensus against the death penalty in a given category of cases, but the Court nonetheless concludes that sound penological justifications are lacking, why should the Court’s own analysis control? Conversely, if there is an overwhelming societal consensus against executing intellectually disabled or juvenile offenders, should the Court’s “own judgment” that there are good penological reasons for that practice suffice to render it permissible in the one state that dissents from the otherwise uniform national and international view?</p>
<p id="76c5ac12-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>5. Future applications.</i> Are there other <i>categories of defendants</i> who should be exempted from the death penalty? What about those with serious mental illness who do not meet the legal standard for a complete defense of insanity? See Bruce J. Winick, The Supreme Court’s Evolving Death Penalty Jurisprudence: Severe Mental Illness as the Next Frontier, 50 B.C. L. Rev. 785 (2009); Christopher Slobogin, What <i>Atkins</i> Could Mean for People with Mental Illness, 33 N.M. L. Rev. 293 (2003). Note that serious mental illness can be considered an aggravating factor from the perspective of a person’s <span title="589" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-589">p. 589</span>future dangerousness. From the perspective of retribution (or deterrence), how would you analyze the creation of a categorical exemption for offenders who have serious mental illness?</p>
<p id="76c5ac13-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Are there <i>crimes</i> other than murder for which death can be a proportionate punishment? In <i>Kennedy</i>, the Court reserved judgment on whether “offenses against the State”—a list that included, according to the Court, “treason, espionage, terrorism and drug kingpin activity”—would merit the death penalty even when they did not involve the taking of life. 554 U.S. at 437.</p>
<p id="76c5d224-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">How should questions of “consensus” and penological justification be assessed for each of these crime and offender categories? Instead of adopting categorical exclusions, does it make more sense to place a cap on the number of capital cases prosecutors can bring, thereby forcing them to choose the worst cases? See Adam M. Gershowitz, Imposing a Cap on Capital Punishment, 72 Mo. L. Rev. 73 (2007).</p>
<p id="76c5d225-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>6. The relevance of the risk of wrongful conviction.</i> The recent spate of DNA and other exonerations of those on death row has led to a heightened concern about the rate of wrongful convictions in capital cases, see pp. 561-563 supra. Can such concerns render capital punishment unconstitutional in some categories of cases? The Court in <i>Atkins</i> supported its case for exempting intellectually disabled defendants from the death penalty on the ground that they face a higher likelihood of wrongful conviction. Could a similar rationale help justify eliminating the death penalty for mentally ill defendants who also may have trouble providing meaningful assistance to counsel?</p>
<p id="76c5d226-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Do concerns with wrongful convictions render the death penalty unconstitutional in all cases? Justice Breyer has suggested the answer may be yes. He cites studies showing that approximately 4 percent of those sentenced to death are innocent. He posits that capital cases might be more prone to errors than non-capital cases because they involve particularly heinous facts, intense pressure for convictions, and death-qualified jurors. <i>Glossip</i>, supra, at 2757-2759. In response, Justice Scalia argues that the heinous facts and intense pressure for convictions would still exist if the punishment were life without parole instead of the death penalty. Justice Scalia claims that, if anything, capital defendants are better off because of “endless legal assistance from the abolition lobby (and legal favoritism from abolitionist judges), while the lifer languishes unnoticed behind bars.” More fundamentally, Justice Scalia argues that the death penalty cannot be unconstitutional when it is explicitly contemplated in the Constitution’s text in the Fifth Amendment, which provides that “[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,” and that “no person shall be deprived of life . . . without due process of law”. Id. at 2747.</p>
<p id="76c5d227-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Who has the better of the argument? What is the force of Justice Scalia’s textual argument? Note that the language of the Fifth Amendment includes not only a reference to capital punishment, but also a reference to severe corporal punishment in the Double Jeopardy Clause (“nor shall any <span title="590" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-590">p. 590</span>person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”). Is it obvious that these references establish the constitutionality of death and amputation (or other severe bodily injury) as a form of punishment? If not, then is it plausible to read the Constitution’s Due Process, Equal Protection, and Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clauses as limiting the circumstances in which government is permitted to subject offenders to loss of life or limb?</p>

<p id="76c5f93f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey, a black man, was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of murder in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, on October 12, 1978. McCleskey’s convictions arose out of the robbery of a furniture store and the killing of a white police officer during the course of the robbery. The evidence at trial indicated that McCleskey and three accomplices planned and carried out the robbery. All four were armed. . . . During the course of the robbery, a police officer, answering a silent alarm, entered the store through the front door. [Two shots] struck the officer. One hit him in the face and killed him. At trial, the State introduced evidence that at least one of the bullets that struck the officer was fired [by McCleskey].</p>
<p id="76c5f940-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The jury convicted McCleskey of murder [and] found two aggravating circumstances to exist beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a peace officer engaged in the performance of his duties. . . . McCleskey offered no mitigating evidence. The jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. . . . The court followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced McCleskey to death. [T]he Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed. . . .

<p id="76c5f941-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[After state court challenges, McCleskey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.] His petition raised 18 claims, one of which was that the Georgia capital sentencing process is administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In support of his claim, McCleskey proffered a statistical study performed by Professors David C. Baldus, George Woodworth, and Charles Pulaski (the Baldus study) that purports to show a disparity in the imposition <span title="591" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-591">p. 591</span>of the death sentence in Georgia based on the race of the murder victim and, to a lesser extent, the race of the defendant. The Baldus study is actually two sophisticated statistical studies that examine over 2,000 murder cases that occurred in Georgia during the 1970s. The raw numbers collected by Professor Baldus indicate that defendants charged with killing white persons received the death penalty in 11% of the cases, but defendants charged with killing blacks received the death penalty in only 1% of the cases. The raw numbers also indicate a reverse racial disparity according to the race of the defendant: 4% of the black defendants received the death penalty, as opposed to 7% of the white defendants.</p>
<p id="76c5f942-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Baldus also divided the cases according to the combination of the race of the defendant and the race of the victim. He found that the death penalty was assessed in 22% of the cases involving black defendants and white victims; 8% of the cases involving white defendants and white victims; 1% of the cases involving black defendants and black victims; and 3% of the cases involving white defendants and black victims. . . .

<p id="76c5f949-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<span title="592" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-592">p. 592</span>Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving “the existence of purposeful discrimination.” [T]o prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, McCleskey must prove that the decision-makers in <i>his</i> case acted with discriminatory purpose. He offers no evidence specific to his own case that would support an inference that racial considerations played a part in his sentence. Instead, he relies solely on the Baldus study. . . . McCleskey’s claim that these statistics are sufficient proof of discrimination, without regard to the facts of a particular case, would extend to all capital cases in Georgia, at least where the victim was white and the defendant is black.</p>
<p id="76c6205a-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . McCleskey challenges decisions at the heart of the State’s criminal justice system. . . . Because discretion is essential to the criminal justice process, we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we would infer that the discretion had been abused. . . . Accordingly, we hold that the Baldus study is clearly insufficient to support an inference that any of the decisionmakers in McCleskey’s case acted with discriminatory purpose.</p>
<p id="76c6205b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey also suggests that the Baldus study proves that the State as a whole has acted with a discriminatory purpose. He appears to argue that the State has violated the Equal Protection Clause by adopting the capital punishment statute and allowing it to remain in force despite its allegedly discriminatory application. But “ ‘[d]iscriminatory purpose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” For this claim to prevail, McCleskey would have to prove that the Georgia Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute <i>because of</i> an anticipated racially discriminatory effect. In Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), this Court found that the Georgia capital sentencing system could operate in a fair and neutral manner. There was no evidence then, and there is none now, that the Georgia Legislature enacted the capital punishment statute to further a racially discriminatory purpose. . . .

Discretion in the criminal justice system offers substantial benefits to the criminal defendant. Not only can a jury decline to impose the death sentence, it can decline to convict, or choose to convict of a lesser offense. . . . Similarly, . . . a prosecutor can decline to charge, offer a plea bargain, or decline to seek a death sentence in any particular case. Of course, “the power to be lenient [also] is the power to discriminate,” K. Davis, Discretionary Justice 170 (1973), but a capital-punishment system that did not allow for discretionary acts of leniency “would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.” Gregg v.

<p id="76c64776-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Two additional concerns inform our decision in this case. First, McCleskey’s claim, taken to its logical conclusion, throws into serious question the principles that underlie our entire criminal justice system. The Eighth Amendment is not limited in application to capital punishment, but applies to all penalties. Thus, if we accepted McCleskey’s claim that racial bias has impermissibly tainted the capital sentencing decision, we could soon be faced with <span title="594" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-594">p. 594</span>similar claims as to other types of penalty. Moreover, the claim that his sentence rests on the irrelevant factor of race easily could be extended to apply to claims based on unexplained discrepancies that correlate to membership in other minority groups, and even to gender. . . . Also, there is no logical reason that such a claim need be limited to racial or sexual bias. If arbitrary and capricious punishment is the touchstone under the Eighth Amendment, such a claim could—at least in theory—be based upon any arbitrary variable, such as the defendant’s facial characteristics, or the physical attractiveness of the defendant or the victim,<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12465_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12465_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">44</a></span> that some statistical study indicates may be influential in jury decisionmaking. As these examples illustrate, there is no limiting principle to the type of challenge brought by McCleskey. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c64778-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Second, McCleskey’s arguments are best presented to the legislative bodies. . . . Legislatures also are better qualified to weigh and “evaluate the results of statistical studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of approach that is not available to the courts,” Gregg v. Georgia, supra. . . . Despite McCleskey’s wide ranging arguments that basically challenge the validity of capital punishment in our multi-racial society, the only question before us is whether in his case the law of Georgia was properly applied. We agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that this was carefully and correctly done in this case.</p>
<p id="76c64779-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Accordingly, we affirm. . . .

<p id="76c6477b-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">It is important to emphasize at the outset that the Court’s observation that McCleskey cannot prove the influence of race on any particular sentencing decision is irrelevant in evaluating his Eighth Amendment claim. Since Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), the Court has been concerned with the <i>risk</i> of the imposition of an arbitrary sentence, rather than the proven fact of one. . . . As Justice O’Connor observed in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 343 (1985), a death sentence must be struck down when the circumstances under which it has been imposed “creat[e] an unacceptable <i>risk</i> that ‘the death penalty [may have been] meted out arbitrarily or capriciously’ or through ‘whim or mistake’ ” (emphasis added). This emphasis on risk . . . reflects the fact that concern for arbitrariness focuses on the rationality of the system as a whole, and that a system that features a significant probability that sentencing decisions are influenced by impermissible considerations cannot be regarded as rational. . . . McCleskey’s claim does differ, however, in one respect from these earlier cases: it is the first to base a challenge not on speculation about how a system <i>might</i> operate, but on empirical documentation on how it <i>does</i> operate. . . . 
</p>

<span title="595" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-595">p. 595</span>The Baldus study . . . distinguishes between those cases in which (1) the jury exercises virtually no discretion because the strength or weakness of aggravating factors usually suggests that only one outcome is appropriate; and (2) cases reflecting an “intermediate” level of aggravation, in which the jury has considerable discretion in choosing a sentence. McCleskey’s case falls into the intermediate range. In such cases, . . . just under 59 percent—almost 6 in 10—defendants comparable to McCleskey would not have received the death penalty if their victims had been black. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c6477d-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The statistical evidence in this case . . . relentlessly documents the risk that McCleskey’s sentence was influenced by racial considerations. This evidence shows that there is a better than even chance in Georgia that race will influence the decision to impose the death penalty: a majority of defendants in white-victim crimes would not have been sentenced to die if their victims had been black. . . . In determining the guilt of a defendant, a state must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Surely, we should not be willing to take a person’s life if the chance that his death sentence was irrationally imposed is <i>more</i> likely than not. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c6477e-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey’s claim is not a fanciful product of mere statistical artifice. For many years, Georgia operated openly and formally precisely the type of dual system the evidence shows is still effectively in place. . . . By the time of the Civil War, a dual system of crime and punishment was well established in Georgia. The state criminal code contained separate sections for “Slaves and Free Persons of Color” and for all other persons. [Justice Brennan here cited numerous instances in which the Georgia Penal Code had provided more severe punishments for crimes committed by blacks and for crimes (especially rape) committed against white victims.]</p>
<p id="76c66e8f-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . Citation of past practices does not justify the automatic condemnation of current ones. But it would be unrealistic to ignore the influence of history in assessing the plausible implications of McCleskey’s evidence.</p>
<p id="76c66e90-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
 . . . The Court . . . declines to find McCleskey’s evidence sufficient in view of “the safeguards designed to minimize racial bias in the [capital sentencing] process.” In Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 226, the Court rejected a facial challenge to the Georgia capital sentencing statute, describing such a challenge as based on “simply an assertion of lack of faith” that the system could operate in a fair manner. Justice White observed that the claim that prosecutors might act in an arbitrary fashion was “unsupported by any facts.” . . . 
<i>Gregg</i> bestowed no permanent approval on the Georgia system. It simply held that the State’s statutory safeguards were assumed sufficient to channel discretion without evidence otherwise. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c66e91-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court next states [its] fear that recognition of McCleskey’s claim would open the door to widespread challenges to all aspects of criminal sentencing. [T]o reject McCleskey’s powerful evidence on this basis is to ignore both the qualitatively different character of the death penalty and the particular repugnance of racial discrimination. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c66e92-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Finally, the Court justifies its rejection of McCleskey’s claim by cautioning against usurpation of the legislatures’ role in devising and monitoring criminal <span title="596" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-596">p. 596</span>punishment. . . . Those whom we would banish from society or from the human community itself often speak in too faint a voice to be heard above society’s demand for punishment. It is the particular role of courts to hear these voices, for the Constitution declares that the majoritarian chorus may not alone dictate the conditions of social life.</p>
<p id="76c66e93-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">[I]t has been scarcely a generation since this Court’s first decision striking down racial segregation, and barely two decades since the legislative prohibition of racial discrimination in major domains of national life. These have been honorable steps, but we cannot pretend that in three decades we have completely escaped the grip of an historical legacy spanning centuries. Warren McCleskey’s evidence confronts us with the subtle and persistent influence of the past. His message is a disturbing one to a society that has formally repudiated racism, and a frustrating one to a Nation accustomed to regarding its destiny as the product of its own will. Nonetheless, we ignore him at our peril, for we remain imprisoned by the past as long as we deny its influence in the present. . . .

<p id="76c66e95-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court today seems to give a new meaning to our recognition that death is different. Rather than requiring “a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination,” California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 998-999 (1983), the Court relies on the very fact that this is a case involving capital punishment to apply a <i>lesser</i> standard of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. . . . 
</p>
<p id="76c66e96-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A criminal defendant alleging an equal protection violation must prove the existence of purposeful discrimination. He may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination “by showing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.” Batson v. Kentucky, 106 S. Ct., at 1721. Once the defendant establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the prosecution to rebut that case. “The State cannot meet his burden on mere general assertions that its officials did not discriminate or that they properly performed their official duties.” Ibid. The State must demonstrate that the challenged effect was due to “ ‘permissible racially neutral selection criteria.’ ” Ibid. . . .

<p id="76c66e97-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">McCleskey . . . demonstrated that it was more likely than not that the fact that the victim he was charged with killing was white determined that he received a sentence of death—20 out of every 34 defendants in McCleskey’s midrange category would not have been sentenced to be executed if their victims had been black. [T]he race of the victim is more important in explaining the imposition of a death sentence than is the factor whether the defendant was a prime mover in the homicide.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN12512_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N12512_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">9</a></span> Similarly, the race-of-victim factor is nearly as crucial as the statutory aggravating circumstance whether the <span title="597" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-597">p. 597</span>defendant had a prior record of a conviction for a capital crime.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN1251C_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N1251C_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">10</a></span>
 . . . In sum, McCleskey has demonstrated a clear pattern of differential treatment according to race that is “unexplainable on grounds other than race.”</p>
<p id="76c695aa-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s explanations for its failure to apply this well-established equal protection analysis to this case are not persuasive. . . . I do not believe acceptance of McCleskey’s claim would eliminate capital punishment in Georgia. [I]n extremely aggravated murders the risk of discriminatory enforcement of the death penalty is minimized. . . . Moreover, the establishment of guidelines for Assistant District Attorneys as to the appropriate basis for exercising their discretion at the various steps in the prosecution of a case would provide at least a measure of consistency. The Court’s emphasis on the procedural safeguards in the system ignores the fact that there are none whatsoever during the crucial process leading up to trial. As Justice White stated for the plurality in <i>Turner v. Murray</i>, I find “the risk that racial prejudice may have infected petitioner’s capital sentencing unacceptable in light of the ease with which that risk could have been minimized.” 106 S. Ct., at 1688. I dissent.</p>

 . . . This sort of disparity is constitutionally intolerable. It flagrantly violates the Court’s prior “insistence that capital punishment be imposed fairly, and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.” Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 112 (1982).</p>
<p id="76c695ad-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Court’s decision appears to be based on a fear that the acceptance of McCleskey’s claim would sound the death knell for capital punishment in Georgia. If society were indeed forced to choose between a racially discriminatory death penalty (one that provides heightened protection against murder “for whites only”) and no death penalty at all, the choice mandated by the Constitution would be plain. But the Court’s fear is unfounded. One of the lessons of the Baldus study is that there exist certain categories of extremely serious crimes for which prosecutors consistently seek, and juries consistently impose, the death penalty without regard to the race of the victim or the race of the offender. If Georgia were to narrow the class of death-eligible defendants to those categories, the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory imposition of the death penalty would be significantly decreased, if not eradicated. . . . [S]uch a restructuring of the sentencing scheme is surely not too high a price to pay. . . .

<i>2. The nature of the racial discrimination. (a) The race of defendants and victims.</i> In the period before <i>Furman</i> and the Court’s regulation of the death penalty, there was widespread evidence that black defendants were disproportionately targeted for capital punishment. Between 1930 and 1967, 54 percent of those executed were black, and of the 455 men executed for rape in that period, 90 percent were black. In the post-<i>Furman</i>, post-<i>Gregg</i> period, in contrast, 56 percent of those executed were white. Charles Lane, The Death Penalty and Racism, The American Interest, Nov.-Dec. 2010.</p>
<p id="76c6bcc2-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">A noteworthy feature of the Baldus study and subsequent research is that the race of the defendant, standing alone, does not appear to be a driving force in whether prosecutors seek a capital sentence. See, e.g., Isaac Unah, Choosing Those Who Will Die: The Effect of Race, Gender, and Law in Prosecutorial Decision to Seek the Death Penalty in Durham County, North Carolina, 15 Mich. J. Race &amp; L. 135 (2009). Empirical studies find large effects based on the race of the victim, as cases involving white victims are far more likely to lead to capital charges. But within the category of cases with white victims, the Baldus study found that, after controlling for relevant variables, black defendants were 10 percent more likely to receive a death sentence than white defendants.</p>
<p id="76c6bcc3-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(b) Local demographics.</i> One possible explanation for the racial disparity is that local prosecutors might not seek the death penalty as often in black-on-black homicides because those crimes typically take place in localities with large black populations. Survey data show that blacks are the one demographic group in the United States that largely opposes the death penalty. Lane, supra. Thus, in jurisdictions with large black populations, prosecutors’ charging decisions may reflect what they believe to be the community sentiment about capital punishment. Theodore Eisenberg’s study of county-level data in five states found that capital sentences for black-on-black homicides decreased as the percentage of blacks in a county’s population increased. Eisenberg thus concluded that “minority community skepticism about the justness of the death penalty is a contributing factor to low death sentence rates” when murder victims are black. Theodore Eisenberg, Death Sentence Rates and County Demographics: An Empirical Study, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 347, 370 (2005).</p>
<p id="76c6bcc4-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> If imposition of the death penalty varies based on community support, does that negate claims that it is “infected” with racial bias? Is prosecutorial bias distinguishable from community bias? As elected officials, do prosecutors have a responsibility to respond to their electorates’ preferences?</p>
<p id="76c6bcc5-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(c) Predicting the jury’s attitude.</i> Prosecutors also may be anticipating how the victim-offender racial configuration may affect what a prospective jury is likely to do, taking into account what the racial composition of that jury <span title="599" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-599">p. 599</span>is likely to be. For example, one study found that the death penalty is three times more likely in a black defendant/white victim case that has five or more white male jurors than in one that has fewer such jurors. See William J. Bowers et al., Death Sentencing in Black and White, 3 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 171 (2001). The study also found a life sentence to be “twice as likely for a defendant who draws a black male juror than for the one who fails to do so.” Id.</p>
<p id="76c6bcc6-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">Another source of disparity comes from the process of “death qualifying” juries. In capital cases, jurors can be struck for cause if they oppose capital punishment in all cases. As a result, death-qualified juries are more likely to be male, white, and politically conservative. Brooke Butler, The Role of Death Qualification in Capital Trials Involving Juvenile Defendants, 37 J. Applied Soc. Psychol. 549 (2007). A recent empirical study of death-qualified jurors in six of the most active death penalty states found that they hold stronger implicit racial biases than jury-eligible citizens do. Justin D. Levinson et al., Devaluing Death: An Empirical Study of Implicit Racial Bias on Jury-Eligible Citizens in Six Death Penalty States, 89 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 513, 573 (2014).</p>
<p id="76c6bcc7-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i> Should the process of death qualification be eliminated on these grounds? What other mechanisms can ensure that juries are free from racial bias without eliminating death qualification? Imagine you are a defense attorney questioning prospective jurors during voir dire. What types of questions would you ask if you were seeking to uncover implicit racial bias? How effective are the questions likely to be in rooting out bias?</p>
<p id="76c6bcc8-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(d) Electoral politics.</i> In three death penalty states—Alabama, Delaware, and Florida—judges are permitted to override a jury sentence and make the final decision on whether a defendant will get the death penalty. A report found that in Alabama, 92 percent of judge overrides consisted of judges overruling jury verdicts of life to impose the death penalty, and that judge overrides account for 21 percent of the state’s death row. Equal Justice Initiative, The Death Penalty in Alabama 4 (2011). Additionally, while only 35 percent of murders in Alabama involved white victims, 75 percent of the life-to-death overrides involved white victims. Id. at 18. The report also found that judges frequently tout their willingness to impose the death penalty during judicial election campaigns as evidence of their tough-on-crime mentality, with some judges airing campaign commercials that remind voters of their performance in specific cases. Id. at 14-15.</p>
<p id="76c6e3d9-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">The Supreme Court recently considered the Florida scheme of judicial override and held it unconstitutional. Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616 (2016). Under Florida law, the maximum sentence a capital felony may receive based on the jury’s decision to convict is life imprisonment. Id. at 620. In order for a death sentence to be imposed, the sentencing judge then conducts an evidentiary hearing before a jury. After that hearing, the jury “renders an ‘advisory sentence’ of life or death without specifying the factual basis of its recommendation.” Id. But “[n]otwithstanding the recommendation of a majority of the jury, the court, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating <span title="600" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-600">p. 600</span>circumstances, shall enter a sentence of life imprisonment or death.” Id. If the court decides to impose a death sentence, it must specify the reasons for its decisions. The Supreme Court concluded that this scheme violated the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, because the jurors, not the judge, must find the aggravating facts necessary to impose a death sentence. Based on the analysis in <i>Hurst</i>, the Delaware Supreme Court also recently concluded that its state capital sentencing regime also violates the Sixth Amendment. Rauf v. State, 2016 WL 4224252 (Del. Aug. 2, 2016). Alabama is thus the last state standing that currently has this model, but its constitutionality is in doubt in light of <i>Hurst</i>.</p>
<p id="76c6e3da-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>(e) Other local influences.</i> A study in Georgia found that prosecutors in counties with the fewest murder cases sought death about twice as often as prosecutors in counties with the highest volume of murder cases. Bill Rankin et al., A Matter of Life or Death, Atlanta J. Const., Sept. 22, 2007.</p>
<p id="76c6e3db-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">
<i>Questions:</i>  If one justification for the death penalty is deterrence, wouldn’t we expect to see the opposite pattern? Why would communities with fewer murder cases be more likely to support the death penalty? If the various factors discussed above explain the disparities, does that lessen the cause for concern or heighten it?</p>

<i>3. Post</i>-McCleskey <i>legislative initiatives.</i> Critics of the result in <i>McCleskey</i> have sought to overturn the decision by enacting national legislation requiring states to demonstrate that their enforcement of the death penalty is racially neutral. A provision to this effect was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives as part of the Crime Control Act of 1994, but the House-Senate conference committee deleted it from the bill. See N.Y. Times, July 29, 1994, at A1, A9.</p>
<p id="76c6e3dd-c127-11e6-83b1-4922b55cb34e" class="cc-wrapper epub-text-para  ">In 1998, Kentucky became the first state to allow capital defendants to challenge their prosecutions using statistical evidence of racial discrimination. The Kentucky Racial Justice Act (KRJA), Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§532.300-.309, requires capital defendants to raise challenges to the prosecutor’s charging decision prior to trial. The Act allows for the consideration of statistical evidence of discrimination in capital charging practices, but also requires a defendant to “state with particularity how the evidence supports a claim that racial considerations played a significant part in the decision to seek a death sentence in his or her case.” The defendant bears the burden of establishing by “clear and convincing evidence” that race was “the basis” of the prosecutor’s decision to seek the death penalty. As of 2015, there were no reported reversals of capital convictions based on violations of the KRJA, though there is some reason to believe that the Act may have influenced the charging and plea-bargaining behavior of prosecutors.

Stat. §§15A-2010 to -2012, passed in 2009, allows defendants to use statistical evidence of racial <span title="601" class="cc-font-xxsmall cc-pagenum-begin epub-pageBreak " epub:type="pagebreak" aria-hidden="true" id="page-601">p. 601</span>discrimination to challenge not only charging decisions, but also the use of race in jury selection and the jury’s decision to impose the death penalty. See Seth Kotch &amp; Robert P. Mosteller, The Racial Justice Act and the Long Struggle with Race and the Death Penalty in North Carolina, 88 N.C. L. Rev. 2031, 2117 n.381 (2010). Once a defendant produces statistically significant evidence of a pattern of racial discrimination, the burden shifts to the government to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a nonracial explanation for the defendant’s sentence. If a defendant prevails with statistical evidence, the death sentence is vacated and the defendant is resentenced to life without parole. Is the North Carolina statute more likely to be effective in reducing racial disparities than the Kentucky law? How <i>should</i> a statute be structured in order to minimize racial bias without imposing unmanageable litigation burdens in every capital case?</p>

<i>4. The Model Penal Code.</i> In October 2009, the American Law Institute (ALI) withdrew §210.6, the death penalty provision of the MPC, “in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment.”<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN125E1_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N125E1_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">72</a></span> While the ALI refused to formally endorse or oppose the continued use of the death penalty, Carol Steiker and Jordan Steiker have noted the significance of the ALI action:</p>

The past ten years have seen similar expressions of skepticism from lawmakers and judges confronted with concrete evidence about the administration of the American death penalty. But even though the skepticism is not new, it likely carries distinctive weight when voiced by the very body that invested its labor and prestige in the effort to craft such instructions.<span class="epub-footnotenum cc-font-xsmall"><a id="ftN125F3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a" href="#note-N125F3_12a19b87-b83f-11e6-af1c-27ceea4ed07a">73</a></span>

This is not an insignificant achievement. So, while death penalty opponents rue the Court’s failure to regulate death more severely, I doubt that there is one experienced capital defense lawyer in this country who would rather return to the pre-<i>Furman</i> era. Perhaps not even many prosecutors would want to return to the days before <i>Furman</i>, when such an unguided power of life and death rested in their hands.</p>

Vigilante, 608 A.2d 425, 430 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1992). Under this standard, then, the jury apparently is required to consider the reaction of a “reasonable” person who had experienced those prior abuses.</p>

 . . . The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive functioning. It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.</p>

For example, several organizations with germane expertise have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a mentally retarded offender, [citing <i>amicus</i> briefs for the American Psychological Association and the American Association of Mental Retardation]. In addition, representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United States, reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist traditions, have filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> brief explaining that even though their views about the death penalty differ, they all “share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified.” Moreover, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly disapproved, [citing <i>amicus</i> brief for the European Union]. Finally, polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is wrong. Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have addressed the issue.</p>

<i>Atkins</i> uses the term “mentally retarded persons” as do many state laws, but because of the negative connotations associated with the term “retarded,” Congress passed a federal law known as Rosa’s Law, 124 Stat. 2643 (2010), to amend federal laws that had used the term “retarded” to instead refer to “individuals with intellectual disability.” We follow that same practice.</p>

Baldus argued in his testimony to the District Court that the effects of racial bias were more striking in the mid-range cases. “[W]hen the cases become tremendously aggravated so that everybody would agree that if we’re going to have a death sentence, these are the cases that should get it, the race effects go away. It’s only in the mid-range of cases where the decision makers have a real choice as to what to do. If there’s room for the exercise of discretion, then the [racial] factors begin to play a role.” Under this model, Baldus found that 14.4% of the black-victim mid-range cases received the death penalty, and 34.4% of the white-victim cases received the death penalty. According to Baldus, the facts of McCleskey’s case placed it within the mid-range.</p>

Accordingly, those issues are before us. As did the Court of Appeals, we assume the study is valid statistically without reviewing the factual findings of the District Court. . . .

In an analysis of this type, obviously one cannot say that we can say to a moral certainty what it was that influenced the decision. We can’t do that.”</p>

As Professor Baldus confirmed, the system sorts out cases where the sentence of death is highly likely and highly unlikely, leaving a mid-range of cases where the imposition of the death penalty in any particular case is less predictable.</p>

 . . . The dissent repeatedly emphasizes the need for “a uniquely high degree of rationality in imposing the death penalty.” [Yet,] no suggestion is made as to how greater “rationality” could be achieved under any type of statute that authorizes capital punishment. [T]he dissent’s call for greater rationality is no less than a claim that a capital-punishment system cannot be administered in accord with the Constitution. . . .
