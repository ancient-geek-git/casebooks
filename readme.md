## Offline versions

To get a copy of the ebook, go to the green button in the top right & click on "download zip". Unzip the file. You should see an html file for the whole book, a folder called "chapters" that contains each section of the book as its own html file, and a few other files/folders that will help your browser style the book's appearance and insert images.
Double-clicking on any html file will likely open it in your default browser; if that doesn't work, you can drag an html file into a browser window. Voila!

### Caution

If you rename files, especially the file of the whole book, the links in the TOC and Index files will break.
The book's appearance will change if you move the html files into a different place on your computer than the folder containing the css file and images folder.

## About

This is a  collection of patched together html e-books. It's meant to allow students to access their textbooks in a browser without needing to use the distracting interface that the big textbook publishers force on students. With this version, you can print as much as you want, edit the text to make corrections or add context the authors left out,\* access the book offline from unlimited devices, and keep it indefinitely without worrying that a company will cut off your access to the text.

These html files are also hopefully easier to use than a scanned pdf of the book. An html file of the entire casebook is thousands of times smaller than an equivalent pdf file. These files will hopefully make a high quality digital casebook accessible to students without access to a fast internet connection or high-powered computer.

Clicking on footnotes and other navigation links within the document will jump you to the referenced section. There are also separate TOC and Index files in the chapters folder; clicking on a page number hyperlink from one of these files will first open the html of the whole book and then. after a short pause, jump to the page you selected.  

No annotation toolsâ€”that's a feature you would have to get from the publishers' websites.


\* *I.e., by editing the html files directly. There's no special tools needed: instead of opening the file with your browser, just open it with a text editor, like TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on PC. Be warned the file may look overwhelming at first, and you'll want to google html rules about how to format the text or objects you want to add.
If you are familiar with html, you can easily supplement the casebook by inserting diagrams, pictures, notes, colored tabs to help you find a section, etc.*
