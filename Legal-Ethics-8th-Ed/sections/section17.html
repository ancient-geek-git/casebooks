      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This Chapter explores tactics in adversarial litigation—when the aim of seeking every advantage for one’s client may collide with a lawyer’s other (sometimes greater, sometimes lesser) obligations to the legal system and to society as a whole.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc335223461" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732262" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733251" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369195" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340486811" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861399" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922259" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218964" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756382" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908241" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908515" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Frivolous Litigation and Improper Filings</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One aspect of adversarial litigation involves the selection of cases to file. A key question is the following: When, exactly, is a case <span style="font-style: italic;">such</span> a longshot that even <span style="font-style: italic;">filing</span> the claim entails a breach of the lawyer’s professional obligations? The answer is provided, mostly, by <a id="dabmci_b1aa42d0b5734b88b9fd78c1fb16fbcc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which requires lawyers to certify that their filings are not frivolous or harassing, and permits courts to sanction lawyers who violate its prohibitions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Initially enacted in 1938, <a id="dabmci_ca634a55ae8b4bb4867c5c97df3efe94" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 was, for decades, close to a dead letter: Between 1950 and 1983, fewer than sixty cases involving <a id="dabmci_f0f32414f2a44e65af9794b1b8b33b8d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 sanction motions were reported. Then, in 1983, seeking to “streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses,” the Federal Rules Advisory Committee expanded <a id="dabmci_9063727322da4e3391c4b4c1dcd76e9d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 to give it sharper teeth and a longer reach.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.754" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.754" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> Among other things, it made sanctions for frivolous filings mandatory rather than discretionary (so judges were obliged to sanction lawyers in certain situations) and clarified courts’ authority to impose a wide range of sanctions, including costs and attorneys’ fees, payable to the aggrieved party. The effort worked. From 1983 through 1993, a whopping 7,000 sanctions decisions were reported.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.755" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.755" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> Further, evidence suggests that, consistent with the Advisory Committee’s goals, the 1983 version of the rule induced lawyers to engage in a more rigorous pre-filing investigation of claims and also tamped down on certain exaggerations and blanket denials.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.756" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.756" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But that is not the end of the story. The beefed-up version of <a id="dabmci_13c02fb030b3403eaea84a1d1083f726" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 not only worked, it arguably worked far too well—and ultimately, a provision created to curb adversarial excesses morphed into a new source of them. Research reveals that the 1983 version of the Rule incentivized wasteful satellite litigation, exacerbated tensions between counsel, impaired relationships between counsel and clients, deterred <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page336" class="pagebreak" title="336">336</span>lawyers from pursuing novel legal theories, and chilled even meritorious litigation. Worse, most studies suggest that the 1983 version of <a id="dabmci_5ebe71ee35554615ad28be944566296a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 was biased. As compared to their defense-side counterparts, individual plaintiffs were more often the target of <a id="dabmci_78faebba0cf649098b7a8b1738e7b691" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 motions, and judges imposed sanctions on plaintiffs at unusually high rates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.757" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.757" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> Plaintiffs seeking relief for civil rights violations and employment discrimination bore the brunt of this “reform.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In response to these and other difficulties, <a id="dabmci_9cebca4f785c4ae9b1032fe14b8a9992" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 was again amended in 1993, creating the provision in place today. The core of the amended <a id="dabmci_38ac5c0f5dcc4cb092502a01c4602679" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 reads:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.758" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.758" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Part (c), which addresses sanctions, provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that <a id="dabmci_7993fbd901724518a65e8a703f583234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page337" class="pagebreak" title="337">337</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Stepping back, <a id="dabmci_06fb585c2e2c47b3aa3b2b0e3de034b4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 is directed at three abuses of the litigation process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element32" />presenting a pleading, written motion, or other paper <span style="font-style: italic;">for an improper purpose</span> (subsection 1);</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element33" />presenting a pleading, written motion, or other paper that is <span style="font-style: italic;">unwarranted by law</span> or by a <span style="font-style: italic;">nonfrivolous argument</span> for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law (subsection 2); and</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element34" />presenting a pleading, written motion, or other paper that makes or denies <span style="font-style: italic;">factual claims</span> without adequate support and without conducting an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances (subsections 3 and 4).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Typically, an adversary will move for <a id="dabmci_2e6a1f06f9484ae3b2acfe1f0444e788" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 sanctions, but a court can also impose sanctions on its own initiative. Several other features of <a id="dabmci_cd149c61a9f744a18f7643985e2dd796" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 are also worth highlighting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element35" />Unlike the 1983 version of the Rule, sanctions are now discretionary. Courts need not sanction lawyers who run afoul of <a id="dabmci_5d64546542fd4a5699bdca6ba9ad7cca" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element36" />The Rule is aimed at deterrence, rather than punishment or compensation. Specifically, subsection (c)(4) provides: “A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.”</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element37" />Subsection (b)(2) (quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>) requires that pleadings be warranted by law or by “a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.” The word nonfrivolous<span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> the Committee Notes explain, makes it clear that the standard is objective, so attorneys’ sincere but unreasonable beliefs in the plausibility of their claims will not suffice. This eliminates the so-called “empty head, pure heart” defense.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span id="Element38" />Subsection (b)(3) (quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>) permits so-called “fishing expeditions,” where a plaintiff alleges wrongdoing without much evidence, as long as the factual contentions that need support are specifically identified. According to the Advisory Committee, this latitude is necessary because “sometimes a litigant may . . . need discovery . . . to gather and confirm the evidentiary basis for the allegation.” If evidentiary support is not obtained after a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery, however, the party may not persist with the unsupported factual allegation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.759" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.759" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> </li>

When a party seeks to move for sanctions, this safe harbor gives the party and attorneys <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page338" class="pagebreak" title="338">338</span>against whom sanctions are to be sought twenty-one days to withdraw or correct the challenged paper without adverse consequences. Sanctions can only be imposed if the challenged claim, defense, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected within the prescribed period.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.760" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.760" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></li>

Sanctions for inaccurate or abusive discovery responses are instead available through <a id="dabmci_228295785d0d47f6b3212c35718409e9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(g) and 37 (discussed in more detail in Part C.1. below).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The language of <a id="dabmci_ce6ff4feacbc4f699e0f023d2a8300bc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 parallels and partially replicates the language of Rule 3.1,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>titled “Meritorious Claims and Contentions.” Rule 3.1 explicitly enjoins a lawyer from “frivolous” actions, and defines frivolity in language nearly identical to <a id="dabmci_193f846841ab4d80a0244df175818ae2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11: “A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.” Comment 2 to Rule 3.1 adds the following:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. What is required of lawyers, however, is that they inform themselves about the facts of their clients’ cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients’ positions. Such action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes that the client’s position ultimately will not prevail. The action is frivolous, however, if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One empirical question underlying both <a id="dabmci_2a7e648de96a4e51a1322fde0ac9f068" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and Rule 3.1 is: How big of a problem is frivolous litigation? Many suggest that frivolous claims clog our courts. But the empirical evidence on this point is thin—and, if anything, tends to point in the opposite direction. A survey by the Federal Judicial Center found that 85 percent of U.S. District Court judges reported that “groundless litigation” was either “no problem” or was a small or very <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page339" class="pagebreak" title="339">339</span>small problem. Only 3 percent of judges reported that it was a large or very large problem.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.761" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.761" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As noted, there is substantial overlap between <a id="dabmci_e8da6b4b21764e6eb5bbb65cc2a43bb6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and Model Rule 3.1 This begs the question: Is a <a id="dabmci_a50152c477764777a98e73836fad227c" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 violation automatically a violation of professional ethics as well? <span style="font-style: italic;">Should</span> every <a id="dabmci_a28d8f1d0fcd4377a25ce4e047295394" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 sanction be accompanied by a disciplinary referral? Currently, in exceptional circumstances, judges will impose <a id="dabmci_4e0aeaf9ce3d4ff192373d871a7807fd" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions and, in the same breath, refer the matter to the appropriate grievance committee. But such referrals are very rare.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.762" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.762" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> And, in the absence of an explicit referral, disciplinary action based on frivolous litigation is exceptional; most bar disciplinary agencies rely on the courts, where the litigation is pending, to deal with abuse.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.763" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.763" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> Is this deference justified?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />It is not always obvious what constitutes a frivolous claim. As one commentator has put it: “Frivolous litigation . . . is difficult to define and almost impossible to observe, and it defies all attempts at simple explanation.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.764" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.764" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Reflecting this uncertainty, the “frivolous claim” label has been attached to a range of litigation.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Some believe litigation is “frivolous” if it is objectively unlikely to succeed.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.765" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.765" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> Still others reserve the label for only those suits that are spectacularly farfetched. Adopting this definition, Judge Frank Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit has explained: “Something is frivolous only when (a) we’ve decided the very point, and recently, against the person asserting it, or (b) 99 of 100 practicing lawyers would be 99% sure that the position is untenable, and the other would be 60% sure it’s untenable.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.766" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.766" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> Similarly, the <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><span style="font-style: italic;">estatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span> suggests: “A frivolous position is one that a lawyer of ordinary competence would recognize as so lacking in merit that there is no substantial possibility that the tribunal would accept it.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.767" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.767" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> Finally, still others attach the “frivolous” label to any suit with a negative expected value—that is, a suit that may be objectively meritorious but where the expected value of the court award is smaller than the plaintiff’s transaction costs of obtaining the award.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.768" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.768" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> Adopting this view, some commentators would say that a complaint that seeks damages that are less than the minimum costs of going to trial necessarily runs afoul of <a id="dabmci_bd8ddcea2a55471eb866f93cf69301eb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. The justification for reading the rule to bar such negative expected value suits would be that the plaintiff is using the court, a scarce <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page340" class="pagebreak" title="340">340</span>public resource, merely to harass the defendant.

Consider the implications for overburdened courts and underfinanced opponents.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In this regard, note Professor Monroe Freedman’s comments on the landmark case, <span style="font-style: italic;">MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co</span>., a mainstay of any Torts curriculum:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Justice Cardozo noted that nine out of ten, and perhaps even more, of the cases taken to the New York Court of Appeals during his time on that bench were “predetermined,” their fate “preestablished” by “inevitable laws” from the moment of their filing. <span style="font-style: italic;">MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co</span>. appears to be a perfect example. In 1908, the Court of Appeals of New York had reaffirmed the long-established rule that a consumer cannot recover against the manufacturer of a product for negligence. Not long thereafter, MacPherson, who had been injured while driving a car with a defective wheel, sued the Buick Motor Company for negligent manufacture. Surely, MacPherson’s case was one of those that Cardozo called “predetermined.” The result of MacPherson’s appeal, however, was Cardozo’s most celebrated torts opinion, reversing long-established law by allowing a consumer to sue a manufacturer for a defective product, and demonstrating the creative common-law judging for which he has been so highly regarded.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">. . . [T]he <span style="font-style: italic;">MacPherson</span> decision imposed liability on [a defendant] who would almost certainly not have been liable if anyone but Cardozo had been stating and analyzing the prior case law. At the time of filing the complaint, however, MacPherson’s lawyer could not have known that Cardozo would choose to reverse a century of unbroken precedent that had only recently been reaffirmed. Much less could he have known that Cardozo would be able to carry a majority of the court with him. Without that frivolous-appearing complaint, however, Cardozo could not have changed the common law of manufacturer’s liability as he did.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.773" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.773" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As noted above, <a id="dabmci_02d1aaa0a85b4ad1b14ded3a3366e478" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 permits certain fishing expeditions. But clearly, there is some point to forbidding such expeditions. A striking example is <a id="dabmci_f33d411700284b6b9ef3b97809cee280" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass’n</span>, 365 F. Supp. 975, 982–83 (E.D. Pa. 1973), in which a group of homeowners sued <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page342" class="pagebreak" title="342">342</span>mortgage lenders over an allegedly improper method of mortgage collection. To learn which lenders employed this method, plaintiffs’ lawyers named as defendants all 177 mortgage brokers listed in the Philadelphia telephone book, provoking a sanction under the older version of <a id="dabmci_eb1141909e9247f794e72859f69bdb78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">To most commentators and courts, a categorical prohibition on fishing expeditions is excessively harsh, particularly as applied to actions where a plaintiff is required to show that the defendant had a particular motive, knew or was aware of certain facts, or engaged in a conspiracy. Very often, that crucial evidence exists only in the defendant’s own mind or files and can be found only through discovery after a complaint has been filed. For this reason, as noted above, <a id="dabmci_c3c73e3febf54252800a2662949b17b1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 requires attorneys to certify, not that their “factual contentions have evidentiary support,” but rather, “if specifically so identified,” that the allegations “will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.” <a id="dabmci_8f87e692debb4b18a9d40f89b0b5308b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3). </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Per <a id="dabmci_f9806083de234ceeaf44cfc7cdcfde25" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b), each filing must also be preceded by “an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.” Again to borrow from the example above, since a lawyer must perform a reasonable inquiry prior to filing, a lawyer can be sanctioned if she sues 177 mortgage brokers if a reasonable inquiry would have made it clear that most of those brokers did not engage in the challenged conduct. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">How do you know whether an inquiry was or was not “reasonable?” Courts generally consider, among other things, whether the filing was time-sensitive, whether the information came just from the client and, if so, whether there were reasons to doubt the client’s veracity, and whether other information was available (either through readily-available witnesses or public documents) to support or belie the client’s assertions. As one court has put it: “When the attorney can obtain the information necessary to certify the validity of the claim in public fashion and need not rely solely on the client, he must do so.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.775" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.775" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> Thus, for example, in <a id="dabmci_cdec968830034b5daa004b3b905aa407" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Van Berkel v. Fox Farm &amp; Road Machinery</span>, 581 F. Supp. 1248 (D. Minn. 1984), the client told the lawyer he had been injured on September 6, 1977. In reality, the client had been injured in 1976, and the client’s claim was time-barred. But relying on the client’s recollection, the lawyer filed suit after the statute of limitations had run. After dismissing the claim, the court imposed <a id="dabmci_5406db701db847998f0f4d2087800d17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 sanctions because the attorney had neglected to obtain the client’s medical records, which were readily available and would have revealed the correct date of the client’s injury.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.776" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.776" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2017 (<a id="dabmci_a4ae90c160a741d49789ee1f3633651d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.R. 720, <a id="dabmci_3b1746a6f4c449fe906d85a4898939e3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />S. 237) is a bill that has been pending in Congress in various forms for many years, though it has not yet been enacted into law. Designed to decrease frivolous litigation by making sanctions under <a id="dabmci_673f8abe7e884492b5eebd7314180fc6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 mandatory rather than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page343" class="pagebreak" title="343">343</span>discretionary, the bill would also remove the current twenty-one-day safe harbor and make monetary sanctions the required penalty for a violation—essentially returning the rule to its pre-1993 form, but on steroids. The Chamber of Commerce supports the legislation, arguing that the current <a id="dabmci_eeb1b9ddf7b34433b73e1435ec386f66" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 “rewards the gamesmanship of unscrupulous attorneys who are able to file baseless claims without fear of recourse.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.777" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.777" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> Further, the Chamber warns: “Without true consequences being imposed on parties who make meritless legal claims, innocent businesses will continue to be threatened with the reality that paying off baseless claims is often cheaper than litigation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.778" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.778" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> Adds Cary Silverman, a partner in the law firm Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon: Under the current system, there is “nothing to lose by filing a frivolous case, whether it is a result of shoddy legal research, lack of supporting facts, a shotgun approach to naming defendants, a laughable legal theory, or something more nefarious.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.779" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.779" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would up the <a id="dabmci_457c9b18c3ba4d0d858a4d61326860b0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ante, imposing serious penalties on such filers. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Critics of this legislation, including Public Citizen and many academics, respond that the bill would infringe upon judicial discretion, chill meritorious litigation, exacerbate incivility, spur costly satellite litigation, and tilt the playing field further in favor of well-heeled litigants.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.780" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.780" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> They also note that federal judges overwhelmingly oppose the amendment and are fine with <a id="dabmci_d2e15ec85a0045d89419325e9241db91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 as it is. A 2005 survey conducted by the Federal Judicial Center found that 80 percent of U.S. district court judges share the view that “<a id="dabmci_114c2da8d04a4d1a8b1208e4cf89077e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands,” while 87 percent of surveyed judges prefer the current rule to the 1983 version.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.781" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.781" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Finally, some point out that the current pleading threshold—which requires claims to have evidentiary support and not be filed for an improper purpose—efficiently screens meritless cases prior to discovery, while the existing statutory regime for sanctions adequately punishes attorneys who persist with baseless cases.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.782" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.782" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span></p>

Federal Rule 30(d) authorizes sanctions against any <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page344" class="pagebreak" title="344">344</span>person who “impedes, delays, or frustrates” a deposition. <a id="dabmci_1e478c11c2fb4c46a7b7ea02675dc02d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Federal Rules 16 and 26 seek to deter abuse through judicial management of pretrial proceedings. Finally, under its inherent power, a court may also impose stiff penalties for bad faith litigation conduct, even in the absence of other formal authority. <a id="dabmci_e2e2bd420c7e4d488081ab4da819117f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Chambers v.

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are a partner in a small firm that handles real estate cases, including landlord-tenant cases, some on a pro bono basis. In one eviction matter that your firm is handling pro bono, an associate presents pleadings for your signature. Your client is two months delinquent in his rent. Your client insists he should not have to pay rent because of the landlord’s many building code violations. Unfortunately, however, there is a well-established line of authority that holds that building code violations are not a defense in suits for eviction, when (as here) rent has not been paid.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Still, your associate has prepared a general denial to the landlord’s eviction complaint and has requested a jury trial. This defense strategy, commonly employed in legal aid offices, will delay the proceeding for sixty days. During that sixty-day period, your client can save up enough for a security deposit and the first month’s rent on another apartment. Your state code of civil procedure contains a rule identical in wording to <a id="dabmci_4886f016d2bc4896be17ea1edd5ffea7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. Do you sign the pleading?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Now assume you have signed the pleading and, after procedural wrangling, the trial court finds, as expected, that the landlord’s building code violations are not a defense to your client’s failure to pay rent. You believe that the chances that an appellate court would overrule that determination are minimal (less than 1 percent), but the appointment of two new judges leaves a slight glimmer of hope. Notwithstanding these long odds, your client would like to pursue the appeal because during the pendency of the appeal, he will be able to use the back-rent he officially owes his now-former landlord. He also hopes that the strategy will impose some appropriate costs on a landlord who is unwilling to repair major apartment defects. Do you file the appeal?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In another paying case, your client has vacated an expensive apartment in a luxury building. The landlord has unjustifiably withheld the $6,000 security deposit, and the client wishes to sue for the deposit’s return. The security deposit is over the limit for small claims court.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You explain to your client that, even though she is likely to win if the case goes to trial, your fee and litigation expenses will cost her considerably more than she can ever hope to recover. She insists that she nevertheless wishes to proceed since, in her words, “I’m right and he’s wrong and I’m going to prove it in public. It’s worth it to see him squirm <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page345" class="pagebreak" title="345">345</span>in court. And besides, other tenants are getting jerked around by him, too, and somebody needs to do something about that.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Your associate drafts the complaint but appends a memo raising concerns that, because the case is clearly a financial loser for the client, the judge will view it either as harassment or as a nuisance suit designed to extract an unjustified settlement. The associate warns that, in either eventuality, the firm may be sanctioned under the state’s version of <a id="dabmci_e6b83009dbc94038ac50c3702cb7cbbb" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. Do you file the complaint?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the case directly above, now suppose you are the landlord’s lawyer. The complaint has been filed, and you immediately see it is a losing proposition for the plaintiff.

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are an associate in a midsize firm, defending a physician in a multi-million-dollar medical malpractice case. The physician, it is alleged, perforated the plaintiff’s esophagus during a routine medical procedure. Before the trial begins, the partner supervising the case tells you to file a pretrial motion seeking to preclude the opposing counsel’s “emotional displays” during the trial. The partner has already drafted the motion, which states: “Counsel for the Plaintiff has a proclivity for displays of anguish in the presence of the jury, including crying.” Counsel’s “predicted flood of tears,” the motion continues, could be nothing more than “a shrewdly calculated attempt to elicit a sympathetic response” from the jury.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.784" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.784" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Opposing counsel is female; she is, in fact, one of the only female lawyers in the country who represents plaintiffs in such high-stakes medical malpractice litigation. You do not know whether or not she actually has cried at previous trials, but the partner explains that that’s not the point. He tells you: “No matter what, even if the judge denies the motion, it’ll knock her off balance—and it’ll plant in the judge’s mind that she’ll deploy her feminine wiles to get what she wants. He’ll watch her like a hawk and we’ll get a leg up.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Do you file the motion? Why or why not? If you do file the motion, are you subject to sanctions pursuant to <a id="dabmci_a87a1d94b767463bacaf72e0ee0633b7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Just as lawyers may not initiate frivolous litigation or lodge improper filings, lawyers have affirmative obligations to tribunals—and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page346" class="pagebreak" title="346">346</span>even to third persons. This Part explores these obligations. The first Section considers Rule 3.3(a)(2)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.3(a)(2)&quot; " />, which imposes on counsel an obligation to disclose certain contrary authority to the court. The second Section then considers two interlocking provisions—Rules 3.3(a)(1)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.3(a)(1)&quot; \s &quot;3.3(a)(1)&quot; \c 16 " /> and 4.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;4.1&quot; " />—which curtail lawyers’ ability to make false statements, both in and out of court.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">When must a litigant highlight contrary authority that her opposing counsel has missed? Rule 3.3(a)(2)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;3.3(a)(2)&quot; " /> addresses that question and states: </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does a lawyer’s failure to disclose adverse legal authority <span style="font-style: italic;">necessarily</span> also violate <a id="dabmci_56ad66bdbbb34dc3861fceec7db3b4ce" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11? Even if not, <a id="dabmci_e1ee56889f664bd3aa7a3cea6c704787" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and Rule 3.3(a)(2) violations often go hand-in-hand. That is because the former requires that a legal position be warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the law’s extension, modification, or reversal—and if a lawyer’s statement of the law is deceptive because it fails to account for contrary authority, the lawyer might be in the unenviable position of having violated both <a id="dabmci_ce54f99e56674184a18e348280c7ca17" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and Rule 3.3 (and also, sometimes, Rule 3.1).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.786" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.786" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />It is well established that a lawyer need not cite all potentially adverse legal authority; she must just cite legal authority that is “directly adverse.” What qualifies? According to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span>: “In most jurisdictions, such legal authority includes all decisions with holdings directly on point, but it does not include dicta.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.787" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.787" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Is the line between a case holding and mere dicta always clearly delineated? A prominent case puts it this way: “This duty of candor includes the obligation . . . to disclose legal authorities that the court should, in fairness, consider when making its decision.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.788" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.788" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> For its part, the Hazard and Hodes treatise on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Law of Lawyering</span> states: “The more unhappy a lawyer is that he found an adverse precedent, the clearer it is that he must reveal it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.789" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.789" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Notice that Rule 3.3(a)(2) refers to a “tribunal.” According to the terminology section of the Rules, the word “tribunal” “denotes a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration proceeding or a legislative body, administrative agency or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.790" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.790" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Rule 3.3(a)(2) is silent on out-of-court dealings, and commentators have divided on what is required.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.791" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.791" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One commentator has described the obligation imposed by Rule 3.3(a)(2) as “the most noteworthy example of the Code’s subordination of the interests of the client and the lawyer in favor of those of the judicial system.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.792" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.792" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> Do you agree?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The obligation to disclose contrary authority is one area where many believe that the ethics rules overlap with prudent practice. Judge Stanley Sporkin, who sat for fifteen years on the D.C. District Court, put it this way: “If you try to spin a court by hiding a key decision that goes against you, the chances are the judge will find out about the decision either from your adversary or from a law clerk. At that point, your credibility is zero.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.793" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.793" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> Others note that if you identify a contrary precedent, you have the opportunity to explain why it is distinguishable—and your stock, in the court’s eyes, is apt to rise.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.794" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.794" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> If you fail to identify the contrary precedent, a judge will often just assume you are incompetent—or, worse, evasive.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc36218971" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756389" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908522" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />False Representations</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition to the obligation to highlight contrary authority, Rule 3.3 also provides: “(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly (1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer.” Recall from the discussion above, “tribunal” is a term of art. Defined in Rule 1.0(m), it “denotes a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration proceeding or a legislative body, administrative agency or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When statements are made outside of a tribunal, Rule 4.1 applies. Titled “Truthfulness in Statements to Others,” Rule 4.1 provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page348" class="pagebreak" title="348">348</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure is prohibited by Rule 1.6 [governing confidentiality].</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">A Comment to the Rule further explains:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Statement of Fact. This Rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation, certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact. Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a transaction and a party’s intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a claim are ordinarily in this category, and so is the existence of an undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal would constitute fraud. Lawyers should be mindful of their obligations under applicable law to avoid criminal and tortious misrepresentation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 4.1 took center stage recently in the case <a id="dabmci_c85926ad85b94f8391d26c1ae89dc72e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Azar v.

The case’s factual and procedural history is convoluted but very important: Jane Doe, aged seventeen, entered this country unaccompanied and without documentation in early September 2017, whereupon she was seized by federal immigration officials and confined in Texas. While in custody, Doe learned that she was pregnant, and she chose to terminate her pregnancy.

Casey</span>, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), immigration authorities neither gave her access to that medical procedure, nor released her from custody.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.795" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.795" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ACLU took up Doe’s case and, soon thereafter, sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in a D.C. District Court, contending that certain named governmental officials were imposing an “undue burden” on her right to privacy by continuing to detain her, in contravention of <span style="font-style: italic;">Casey</span>. On October 18, 2017, the district court granted the ACLU’s motion, finding, among other things, that Doe was likely to succeed on the merits and would suffer irreparable injury without the TRO. Accordingly, the district court ordered governmental officials to allow Doe to leave the immigration facility the following day (October 19) for the pre-abortion counseling mandated by Texas law and further ordered that, after receiving this counseling, Doe should be permitted to have an abortion on either <a id="dabmci_6e87b29500594c4380b6dc1fd1edd840" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />October 20 or 21, 2017. This staggering was necessary to comply with Texas law: In Texas, women seeking abortions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page349" class="pagebreak" title="349">349</span>must obtain counseling at least twenty-four hours in advance of the procedure from the same physician who will perform the procedure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.796" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.796" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Subsequently, in Texas, Doe received that necessary counseling from a doctor—hereinafter, the “first doctor”—and, back in D.C., the government appealed the TRO to the D.C. Circuit. After hearing argument, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit sided with the government and vacated the portion of the district court’s order that had allowed the abortion procedure. In a rare move, the D.C. Circuit then took the case en banc, however, and it reversed the panel’s determination. <a id="dabmci_25759833b7494a1b96f8b4ef760aec80" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Garza v.

      <p class="TextParagraph">After en banc review, the case made its way back to the district court. On October 24, 2017, the district court issued an amended TRO, again preventing the government from interfering with Doe’s abortion and specifying that the procedure should happen “promptly and without delay.” With the amended TRO in hand, that night, Doe went back to the clinic to obtain counseling again, this time from a second doctor, since everyone believed the first doctor (who had provided counseling almost a week before) was unavailable. However, because that second doctor was <span style="font-style: italic;">also</span> unavailable at that late hour, Doe’s lawyer (truthfully, based on the information then available) informed the government’s counsel that Doe had rescheduled her clinic appointment to the following morning, October 25 at 7:30 a.m., with the abortion to follow twenty-four hours after that, on the 26th. Doe’s counsel further represented, in an e-mail sent at 6:28 p.m.: “as soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.797" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.797" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But then came a surprise: After that correspondence, Doe’s lawyer learned that the first doctor, who provided the initial counseling on October 19th,<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>might be available. Accordingly, Doe’s legal team moved up the next day’s appointment to 4:15 a.m. Around 9:30 p.m., Doe’s guardian ad litem notified the shelter staff and the government’s lawyer that Doe’s appointment had been changed to that early-morning hour. Though the shelter staff apparently “wonder[ed] . . . whether the nature of the appointment also might have changed”—in other words, whether an abortion might be performed—Doe’s lawyer did not say (or even know for sure).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.798" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.798" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> It turned out that the first doctor <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> become available, and since he had already provided the statutorily-mandated pre-abortion counseling, he could—and, in fact, did—perform an abortion. To sum up, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page350" class="pagebreak" title="350">350</span>as David Cole, the National Legal Director for the ACLU told the government by letter:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">We [the ACLU] did not become aware, until late in the evening of October 24, that it might be possible for the physician who had counseled Ms. Doe on October 19 to return to the clinic to perform the abortion on the morning of October 25. It was not clear until the morning of October 25 that he would in fact be able to do so.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.799" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.799" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Meanwhile, although the government was aware of the peculiar time of Doe’s 4:15 a.m. clinic appointment on October 25, the government insisted it continued to believe that no abortion could be obtained until the 26th at the earliest. Under that misapprehension, the government did not file an emergency stay with the Supreme Court. Of course, once the abortion was obtained, any opportunity to file a stay or otherwise prevent the procedure was lost. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Subsequently, the government, through the Solicitor General, filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court contending that the ACLU lawyer’s silence on the evening of October 25th amounted to an unethical “misrepresentation” by omission, tantamount to affirmatively lying about the purpose of the visit. In the Solicitor General’s words:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[I]n light of the extraordinary circumstances of this case, the government respectfully submits that this Court may wish to issue an order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against respondent’s counsel—either directly by this Court or through referral to the state bars to which counsel belong—for what appear to be material misrepresentations and omissions to government counsel designed to thwart this Court’s review.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.800" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.800" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">According to the Solicitor General:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Ms. Doe’s representatives may have been free to say nothing about the timing of her procedure. But they could not make repeated representations to the government (and the courts) about that procedure’s timing, know that the government was relying on those statements, act to render the statements false, and then say nothing to correct the falsehood. That is not conduct becoming members of the Bar of this Court.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.801" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.801" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Solicitor General seized particularly on the 6:28 p.m. email and further suggested that the ACLU had a duty to notify opposing counsel of clinic developments. It asserted:</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The government’s recitation of events shows that: (1) Ms. Doe’s counsel made a series of <span style="font-style: italic;">accurate</span> statements concerning the availability of, and logistics surrounding, Ms. Doe’s ability to obtain an abortion; (2) some government personnel may have incorrectly <span style="font-style: italic;">assumed</span> that Ms. Doe could not obtain an abortion before October 26, even though she was legally entitled to obtain an immediate abortion, and had received state-mandated counseling on October 19; (3) some government lawyers may have <span style="font-style: italic;">believed</span> that Ms. Doe’s counsel would advise them if facts changed; and (4) Ms. Doe’s counsel did not take affirmative steps to notify the government that the doctor who provided the counseling on October 19 agreed to come back to the clinic. The government’s suggestion that this might amount to sanctionable misconduct is not supported by legal authorities regarding attorney conduct, is not remotely justified by the disciplinary cases it cites, and is contrary to counsel’s respective ethical duties.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.803" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.803" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In an unsigned, per curiam decision, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the underlying legal issue: the constitutionality of the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s policy regarding pregnant minors who seek abortions. In the course of that opinion, the Court did not resolve the question of whether the ACLU violated any ethical rules, and provided: </p>

On the one hand, all attorneys must remain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page352" class="pagebreak" title="352">352</span>aware of the principle that zealous advocacy does not displace their obligations as officers of the court. Especially in fast-paced, emergency proceedings like those at issue here, it is critical that lawyers and courts alike be able to rely on one another’s representations.

      <p class="TextParagraph">This on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand paragraph, coupled with the many months it took for the Court to decide on the petition for certiorari, strongly suggests that the Justices could not agree about the ethics issue, nor whether the Court should take steps against ACLU’s lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.805" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.805" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Did the ACLU err in failing to notify the government that, because of the first doctor’s sudden and unexpected availability, Doe would be able to obtain an abortion on October 25th? Does it matter that the ACLU sent the e-mail at 6:28 p.m. to the government’s counsel that “as soon as we understand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let you know”? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Would such notification have been consistent with Doe’s lawyer’s duty of zealous representation? Would such notification have been consistent with Doe’s lawyer’s duty of confidentiality, as set forth in Rule 1.6 and discussed in Chapter 6? In the Texas version of Rule 1.6, a lawyer must not knowingly reveal confidential information to anyone “other than the client, the client’s representatives, or the members, associates, or employees of the lawyer’s law firm,” and a lawyer also shall not “[u]se confidential information of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client consents after consultations.” Texas Disciplinary Rules of Prof’s Conduct R. 1.05(b)(1) &amp; (2). For purposes of the Rule, “confidential information” is defined broadly to include both privileged information and “all information relating to a client or furnished by the client . . . acquired by the lawyer during the course of or by reason of the representation of the client.” <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. R. 1.05(a). </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Was such notification mandated by Rule 4.1, as the Solicitor General insists? What, exactly, does Rule 4.1 require? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If you had been Jane Doe’s lawyer, what would you have done? As you consider the question, recognize that time was of the essence: Doe was already sixteen-weeks pregnant, and abortion becomes illegal in Texas after week twenty.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are in the middle of a mediation concerning a contract dispute. Last year, the state’s highest court issued a ruling concerning when the statute of limitations on this type of claim accrues. Interpreting that ruling, you think a lower court might well find that your client’s claim is time-barred. Over the course of the mediation, it becomes clear that your opposing counsel and the mediator are both ignorant of that decision. Unaware of the statute of limitations issue, which might reduce your claim to rubble, they think you have a better case than you actually have. Must you clear up the confusion? Should you?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />All the facts above are true, but now in the mediation you say, in a moment of frustration: “Listen, folks, if we can’t settle, we’re happy to go to trial. This case is a slam dunk!” Now have you crossed a line?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="_Toc335732269" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Another impermissible adversarial tactic involves discovery abuse. Civil discovery is governed by four rules. The first is Rule 3.4, titled: Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel. It provides that a lawyer “shall not”:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary value. A lawyer shall not counsel or assist another person to do any such act; . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />in pretrial procedure, make a frivolous discovery request or fail to make reasonably diligent efforts to comply with a legally proper discovery request by an opposing party. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, Rule 3.2 states that a lawyer shall make “reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the client’s interests.” The comment cautions: “Realizing financial or other benefit from otherwise improper delay in litigation is not a legitimate interest of the client.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Third, <a id="dabmci_13882e507c0947f8a1e66a2a1d09e301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 offers a detailed set of discovery requirements, entitling parties to broad discovery. Under <a id="dabmci_d5f8443ed4b64d5ab3379c3f1022b0ba" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 26(b), parties are entitled to “obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case.” “Information . . . need not be admissible as evidence, in order to be discoverable.” Further, under <a id="dabmci_e4fe135a83954470a02ebf3a52e63ff7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 26(g), every disclosure must be signed by at least one attorney of record—and by signing the discovery response, an attorney certifies “that to the best of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page354" class="pagebreak" title="354">354</span>the person’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry” that each disclosure was “complete and correct as of the time it is made” and that every discovery request, response, or objection is:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(i)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(ii)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(iii)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.</p>
      <a id="dabmci_1fe0c3657c8c456a8eef19331bbf6220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 26(g)(3) then provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">If a certification violates this rule without substantial justification, the court, on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or both. The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the violation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rounding out the regulatory architecture, <a id="dabmci_fb578c4e62c5456781c6ab72e90fede1" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 authorizes motions to compel and declares that if a party fails to obey an order compelling discovery, a court may impose appropriate sanctions on the lawyers and parties involved. <a id="dabmci_819979edd2a24a3db6941d0cdb0dbd21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Fed. R. Civ. P. 30 governs depositions and specifies, per (d)(2), that a district court “may impose an appropriate sanction—including the reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred by any party—on a person who impedes, delays, or frustrates the fair examination of the deponent.”</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the primary purposes of discovery, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, is to assure “[m]utual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties [that] is essential to proper litigation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.806" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.806" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> It is instructive to compare this characterization with a Chicago litigator’s candid description of the aims of discovery: “The purpose of discovery . . . is to give as little as possible so [your opponents] will have to come back and back and maybe will go away or give up.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.807" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.807" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Civil discovery is intended to enhance the search for truth and to eliminate surprises by facilitating parties’ access to facts in the possession of their adversaries. But, as the litigator’s cynical description indicates, the discovery process is too often abused for tactical reasons, and many litigators agree with then-federal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page355" class="pagebreak" title="355">355</span>judge Marvin E. Frankel that discovery has become an occasion for “beating plowshares into swords”—turning a mechanism intended to control adversarial excess into an adversarial weapon in its own right.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.808" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.808" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Discovery abuse can take many forms: everything from unnecessary, duplicative depositions of every potential witness; to corporate defendants’ production of deponents who know too little; to extended colloquies and speaking objections that disrupt depositions’ pace and flow; to canned and scattershot interrogatory requests; to cagey and evasive interrogatory responses; to the “file dump” of irrelevant documents (in the hope that incriminating filings remain buried); to unjustified assertions of the attorney-client privilege; to the decision simply to bury responsive information once it comes to light internally. An example of the last type of abuse occurred, prominently, in the matter below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The facts of <span style="font-style: italic;">Qualcomm Inc. v. Broadcom Corp</span>. are somewhat convoluted. In 2005, Qualcomm initiated an intellectual property suit against Broadcom based on Broadcom’s manufacture of <a id="dabmci_c60c9741bfb14fd294443486b93dcb83" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.264-compliant products, which, Qualcomm claimed, violated two of its patents. Broadcom responded that Qualcomm had waived its right to enforce the patents by participating in the Joint Video Team (JVT), the standards setting body that created the <a id="dabmci_58a7cb73894341b0a53d1ab31ea6de91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.264 standard. Thus, central to the dispute was <span style="font-style: italic;">whether</span> Qualcomm had participated in the JVT, as participation would preclude it from bringing its patent claims.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During discovery, Broadcom sought information concerning Qualcomm’s participation in, and communications with, the JVT. For example, as early as January 23, 2006, Broadcom served the following document requests:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">All documents given to or received from a standards setting body or group that concern any standard relating to the processing of digital video signals . . . [and]</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">All documents concerning any Qualcomm membership, participation, interaction, and/or involvement in setting any standard relating to the processing of digital video signals that pertains in any way to any Qualcomm Patent. </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Broadcom also requested similar information via interrogatories and in depositions. In response to Broadcom’s request for JVT documents, Qualcomm stated, “Qualcomm will produce non-privileged relevant and responsive documents describing QUALCOMM’s participation in the JVT, if any, which can be located after a reasonable search.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As the case progressed, and even through trial, Qualcomm repeatedly denied that it participated in the JVT during the relevant period. <span style="font-style: italic;">But</span>, while preparing Qualcomm witness Viji Raveendran to testify at trial, Qualcomm attorney Adam Bier discovered an August 6, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page356" class="pagebreak" title="356">356</span>2002 email to viji@qualcomm.com welcoming her to the avc_ce mailing list—a list of JVT participants. (Of course, the email’s presence on Raveendran’s computer undercut Qualcomm’s key argument that it had not participated in the JVT during the relevant period.) Several days later, attorney Bier and witness Raveendran searched Raveendran’s laptop and discovered twenty-one separate JVT team emails, none of which Qualcomm had produced in discovery. The Qualcomm trial team decided not to produce these newly-discovered emails. Nor did Qualcomm’s trial team conduct any investigation to determine whether there were more incriminating emails that also had not been produced.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This all came spilling out during Raveendran’s trial testimony. On direct, Qualcomm attorney Lee Patch pointedly did not ask Raveendran any questions that would reveal that she had received the twenty-one emails from the avc_ce mailing list; instead, he asked whether she had “any knowledge of having read” any emails from the avc_ce mailing list. But on cross-examination, Broadcom asked the right question, and Raveendran was finally forced to admit that she had received these incriminating emails. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Broadcom.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Following trial, Qualcomm initially continued to dispute the relevance and responsiveness of the twenty-one Raveendran emails and also resisted Broadcom’s efforts to determine the scope of its discovery violation. However, on April 9, 2007, Qualcomm’s General Counsel finally admitted that Qualcomm had <span style="font-style: italic;">thousands</span> of relevant unproduced documents and that the company’s review of these documents “revealed facts that appear to be inconsistent with certain arguments that [counsel] made on Qualcomm’s behalf at trial and in the equitable hearing following trial.” Thereafter, Qualcomm searched its email archives and located more than 46,000 documents, which had been requested but not produced in discovery.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ultimately, the trial judge granted Broadcom’s Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees pursuant to <a id="dabmci_8aaa519893484e5ca57bbf65a00e8e4e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />35 U.S.C. § 285, finding by clear and convincing evidence that Qualcomm’s misconduct justified Qualcomm’s payment of all fees and costs, ultimately calculated at roughly $8.6 million. (<a id="dabmci_79cabe7b430c49b299dd3ce94c1ea092" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Section 285 provides: “The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.”) The order below focused on the outside attorneys, who were also complicit.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">At the conclusion of trial, counsel for Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”) made an oral motion for sanctions after Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) witness Viji Raveendran testified about <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page357" class="pagebreak" title="357">357</span>emails that were not produced to Broadcom during discovery. The trial judge, United States District Court Judge Rudi M. Brewster, referred the motion to this Court. . . . Having considered all of the written and oral arguments presented and supporting documents submitted, and for the reasons set forth more fully below, the Court GRANTS IN PART. . . . Broadcom’s motion for sanctions against Qualcomm, REFERS TO THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA six attorneys, and SANCTIONS Qualcomm and six of its retained lawyers. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextFlush">DISCUSSION</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Federal Civil Rules authorize federal courts to impose sanctions on parties and their attorneys who fail to comply with discovery obligations and court orders. <a id="dabmci_de7ce3b7dad94b67804ed7705886a829" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 37 authorizes a party to file a motion to compel an opponent to comply with a discovery request or obligation when the opponent fails to do so initially. If such a motion is filed, the rule requires the court to award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party unless the court finds the losing party’s position was “substantially justified” or other circumstances make such an award unjust. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Federal Rules also provide for sanctions against individual attorneys who are remiss in complying with their discovery obligations:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[e]very discovery request, response or objection made by a party . . . shall be signed by at least one attorney [and] [t]he signature of the attorney . . . constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, response, or objection is: consistent with the rules and law, not interposed for an improper purpose, and not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive.</p>
      <a id="dabmci_2f0065b0dcf340848137d39f9b0bba4a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
      <p class="TextFlush">Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(2). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition to this rule-based authority, federal courts have the inherent power to sanction litigants to prevent abuse of the judicial process. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As summarized above, Broadcom served interrogatories and requested documents relating to Qualcomm’s participation in the JVT. Qualcomm responded that “Qualcomm will produce non-privileged relevant and responsive documents describing QUALCOMM’s participation in the JVT, if any, which can be located after a reasonable search.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite these responses, Qualcomm did not produce over 46,000 responsive documents, many of which directly contradict the non-participation argument that Qualcomm repeatedly made to the court and jury. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court’s review of Qualcomm’s declarations, the attorneys’ declarations, and [the trial court’s] orders lead this Court to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page358" class="pagebreak" title="358">358</span>inevitable conclusion that Qualcomm intentionally withheld tens of thousands of decisive documents from its opponent in an effort to win this case and gain a strategic business advantage over Broadcom. Qualcomm could not have achieved this goal without some type of assistance or deliberate ignorance from its retained attorneys. Accordingly, the Court concludes it must sanction both Qualcomm and some of its retained attorneys. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The next question is what, if any, role did Qualcomm’s retained lawyers play in withholding the documents? The Court envisions four scenarios. First, Qualcomm intentionally hid the documents from its retained lawyers and did so so effectively that the lawyers did not know or suspect that the suppressed documents existed. Second, the retained lawyers failed to discover the intentionally hidden documents or suspect their existence due to their complete ineptitude and disorganization. Third, Qualcomm shared the damaging documents with its retained lawyers (or at least some of them) and the knowledgeable lawyers worked with Qualcomm to hide the documents and all evidence of Qualcomm’s early involvement in the JVT. Or, fourth, while Qualcomm did not tell the retained lawyers about the damaging documents and evidence, the lawyers suspected there was additional evidence or information but chose to ignore the evidence and warning signs and accept Qualcomm’s incredible assertions regarding the adequacy of the document search and witness investigation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Given the impressive education and extensive experience of Qualcomm’s retained lawyers, the Court rejects the first and second possibilities. It is inconceivable that these talented, well-educated, and experienced lawyers failed to discover through their interactions with Qualcomm any facts or issues that caused (or should have caused) them to question the sufficiency of Qualcomm’s document search and production. Qualcomm did not fail to produce a document or two; it withheld over 46,000 critical documents that extinguished Qualcomm’s primary argument of non-participation in the JVT. . . . Given the volume and importance of the withheld documents, the number of involved Qualcomm employees, and the numerous warning flags, the Court finds it unbelievable that the retained attorneys did not know or suspect that Qualcomm had not conducted an adequate search for documents.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court finds no direct evidence establishing option three. Neither party nor the attorneys have presented evidence that Qualcomm told one or more of its retained attorneys about the damaging emails or that an attorney learned about the emails and that the knowledgeable attorney(s) then helped Qualcomm hide the emails. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Thus, the Court finds it likely that some variation of option four occurred; that is, one or more of the retained lawyers chose not to look in the correct locations for the correct documents, to accept the unsubstantiated assurances of an important client that its search was sufficient, to ignore the warning signs that the document search and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page359" class="pagebreak" title="359">359</span>production were inadequate, not to press Qualcomm employees for the truth, and/or to encourage employees to provide the information (or lack of information) that Qualcomm needed to assert its non-participation argument and to succeed in this lawsuit. These choices enabled Qualcomm to withhold hundreds of thousands of pages of relevant discovery and to assert numerous false and misleading arguments to the court and jury. This conduct warrants the imposition of sanctions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.809" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.809" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court finds that each of the following attorneys contributed to Qualcomm’s monumental discovery violation and is personally responsible: James Batchelder, Adam Bier, Kevin Leung, Christopher Mammen, Lee Patch, and Stanley Young (“Sanctioned Attorneys”).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Attorneys Leung, Mammen and Batchelder are responsible for the initial discovery failure because they handled or supervised Qualcomm’s discovery responses and production of documents. The Federal Rules impose an affirmative duty upon lawyers to engage in discovery in a responsible manner and to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” to determine whether discovery responses are sufficient and proper. In the instant case, a reasonable inquiry should have included searches using fundamental terms such as JVT, avc_ce or <a id="dabmci_f37b973fe56d4da2887a86b61ad04748" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.264, on the computers belonging to knowledgeable people such as Raveendran. . . . As the post-trial investigation confirmed, such a reasonable search would have revealed the suppressed documents. . . .<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.810" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.810" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Attorneys Bier, Mammen and Patch are responsible for the discovery violation because they also did not perform a reasonable inquiry to determine whether Qualcomm had complied with its discovery obligations. When Bier reviewed the August 6, 2002 email welcoming Raveendran to the avc_ce email group, he knew or should have known that it contradicted Qualcomm’s trial arguments and he had an obligation to verify that it had been produced in discovery or to immediately produce it. If Bier, as a junior lawyer, lacked the experience <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page360" class="pagebreak" title="360">360</span>to recognize the significance of the document, then a more senior or knowledgeable attorney should have assisted him. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Similarly, when Bier found the 21 emails on Raveendran’s computer that had not been produced in discovery, he took the appropriate action and informed his supervisors, Mammen and Patch. Patch discussed the discovery and production issue with Young and Batchelder. While all of these attorneys assert that there was a plausible argument that Broadcom did not request these documents, only Bier and Mammen actually read the emails. Moreover, all of the attorneys missed the critical inquiry: Was Qualcomm’s document search adequate? If these 21 emails were not discovered during Qualcomm’s document search, how many more might exist? The answer, obviously, was tens of thousands. If Bier, Mammen, Patch, Young or Batchelder had conducted a reasonable inquiry after the discovery of the 21 Raveendran emails, they would have discovered the inadequacy of Qualcomm’s search and the suppressed documents. . . . Finally, attorneys Young, Patch, and Batchelder bear responsibility for the discovery failure because they did not conduct a reasonable inquiry into Qualcomm’s discovery production before making specific factual and legal arguments to the court. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Patch was an integral part of the trial team—familiar with Qualcomm’s arguments, theories and strategies. He knew on January 14th that 21 avc_ce emails had been discovered on Raveendran’s computer. Without reading or reviewing the emails, Patch participated in the decision not to produce them. Several days later, Patch carefully tailored his questions to ensure that Raveendran did not testify about the unproduced emails. And, after Broadcom stumbled into the email testimony, Patch affirmatively misled the Court by claiming that he did not know whether the emails were responsive to Broadcom’s discovery requests. . . . Batchelder also is responsible because he was the lead trial attorney and, as such, he was most familiar with Qualcomm’s important arguments and witnesses. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For all of these reasons, the Court finds that these attorneys did not conduct a reasonable inquiry into the adequacy of Qualcomm’s document search and production and, accordingly, they are responsible, along with Qualcomm, for the monumental discovery violation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As set forth above, the Sanctioned Attorneys assisted Qualcomm in committing this incredible discovery violation by intentionally hiding or recklessly ignoring relevant documents, ignoring or rejecting numerous warning signs that Qualcomm’s document search was inadequate, and blindly accepting Qualcomm’s unsupported assurances that its document search was adequate. The Sanctioned Attorneys then used the lack of evidence to repeatedly and forcefully make false statements and arguments to the court and jury. As such, the Sanctioned Attorneys violated their discovery obligations and also may have violated their ethical duties. To address the potential ethical violations, the Court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page361" class="pagebreak" title="361">361</span>refers the Sanctioned Attorneys to The State Bar of California for an appropriate investigation and possible imposition of sanctions. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In a subsequent order, U.S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster vacated Magistrate Judge Major’s sanction judgment vis-à-vis the attorneys, so that the attorneys could assert a self-defense exception to the attorney-client privilege and justify their conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.811" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.811" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span> On remand, after considering this new (now non-privileged) evidence, Magistrate Judge Major issued a new order on April 2, 2010, resolving the affair.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.812" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.812" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">In this 2010 order, Magistrate Judge Major found that the outside counsel exhibited poor judgment, but not bad faith, and concluded that sanctions against the attorneys were inappropriate. Ultimately, she attributed the breakdown to three “fundamental failures”: (1) counsel failed to understand how Qualcomm’s computer system was organized; (2) there had been “an incredible breakdown in communication”; and (3) no one took charge to ensure that the necessary discovery had been conducted, and no one sought to smoke out potentially contradictory evidence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.813" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.813" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>All of these failures were exacerbated by an “incredible lack of candor on the part of the principal Qualcomm employees.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.814" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.814" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> Indeed, Magistrate Judge Major found: “The remand proceedings have clarified that a number of Qualcomm employees, including legal counsel, knew that Qualcomm had analyzed the <a id="dabmci_5b785fda28c64a70adca2eb7406b80b5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />H.264 standard and had attended JVT meetings during the relevant time period and yet no one informed Responding Attorneys.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.815" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.815" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The turn-about took over two years, during which 1.6 million documents were reviewed and large sums were spent.

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Would you add any additional lessons to the list above?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The six sanctioned lawyers belonged to a “boutique” forty-lawyer Silicon Valley intellectual property firm. They included two named partners, two other partners, and two associates, including a junior associate. How blameworthy were the lawyers after discovering the August 6, 2002 email to Raveendran welcoming her to the avc_ce mailing list? Were the associates more or less culpable than the partners? If you had been attorney Leung, who apparently requested a more thorough document search after the first incriminating document was discovered, what would you have done after your request was denied?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The most junior lawyer involved in the maelstrom was Adam Bier, a self-described “baby lawyer.” Bier had graduated from NYU Law School in 2004, just a few years before the Qualcomm matter came to a head. In an interview, he provided the following advice to young associates:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Always be cognizant of the discovery status of everything you come across, even if you’re not involved in discovery. This is really an area with a lot of land mines in the era of electronically-stored information. When you do come across stuff you haven’t seen before, document it, and document when you bring it to the attention of others. . . .<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.819" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.819" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Under the rules, does the fact that Adam was a subordinate lawyer shield him from liability? See Rule 5.2, which discusses the responsibilities of a “subordinate lawyer.”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many suggest that discovery abuse is endemic. But how serious is the discovery abuse problem, really? The evidence is mixed and equivocal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.820" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.820" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span> For <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page363" class="pagebreak" title="363">363</span>example, a Harris Poll of federal judges reports that, while only 3 percent think there are “no” problems with civil discovery, only 33 percent think that there are “a lot” of problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.821" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.821" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> The most systematic studies find that serious discovery abuse is mostly confined to a small minority of cases, particularly high-stakes matters in large legal communities that lack informal sanctions and significant judicial oversight.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.822" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.822" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are an associate in a firm representing Fisons, a drug manufacturer, in a products liability case. Fisons marketed a drug, Somophyllin, used to treat viral infections. Unfortunately, an excess of its active ingredient, theophylline, caused the plaintiffs’ infant daughter to have seizures, which caused catastrophic, permanent, brain damage. The plaintiffs sued their daughter’s pediatrician, who prescribed the drug, and Fisons, the manufacturer. The daughter’s pediatrician then cross-claimed against Fisons.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In pursuit of his cross-claim, the pediatrician’s attorney initially sought discovery from Fisons of all documents related to Somophyllin as well as theophylline. Your firm objected on the ground that the request was “overly broad, unduly burdensome, harassing, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” But you did agree to turn over all documents “regarding” Somophyllin.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Late in discovery, you come across documents relating to theophylline toxicity in a file for <span style="font-style: italic;">another</span> drug, which Fisons also markets. You bring these documents to the attention of your supervising partner, and he tells you he does not believe that the documents need to be disclosed, because the plaintiffs did not move to compel production of documents other than those concerning Somophyllin. How should you proceed?</p>

There, a smoking-gun document on toxicity finally came to light when a whistleblower within the company sent it to the defendant-pediatrician, after nearly three years of discovery. The letter, dated June 30, 1981, indicated that the drug company was aware of “life-threatening theophylline <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page364" class="pagebreak" title="364">364</span>toxicity” in children who received theophylline and stated that prescribing physicians needed to understand that theophylline can be “capricious.” Later documents, uncovered once digging began, stated that the current recommended dose evidenced “poor clinical judgment,” noted that the toxicity reports were not reported in the journal read by prescribing physicians, and concluded that those physicians may not be aware of the “alarming increase in adverse reactions such as seizures, permanent brain damage and death.” One memo in particular concluded that the “epidemic of theophylline toxicity provides strong justification for our corporate decision to cease promotional activities with our theophylline line of products.” In fact, Fisons continued to promote and sell theophylline long after the date of the memo. None of these incriminating documents were turned over in the course of litigation.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Given the way defense counsel Bogle &amp; Gates had chosen to narrow and then interpret the discovery requests, the Washington Supreme Court concluded: “It appears clear that no conceivable discovery request could have been made by the doctor that would have uncovered the relevant documents.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.823" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.823" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span> In the court’s view, Bogle &amp; Gates deserved to be sanctioned because the firm’s responses were evasive, “misleading,” and “contrary to the purposes of discovery.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.824" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.824" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In a subsequent proceeding to determine the amount of sanctions to be imposed, Bogle &amp; Gates had fourteen prominent (and likely well-compensated) experts testify on its behalf, including Professor Geoffrey Hazard, Jr., who was, the nation’s most well-known legal ethics commentator at the time. These experts testified that interpreting discovery requests narrowly and technically to avoid turning over inculpating documents was “typical” and “proper”; indeed, several claimed that it was required by lawyers’ “ethical obligation to zealously represent their clients.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.825" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.825" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">If the legal ethics experts were correct about normal practice, how should that affect litigators’ decisions and courts’ interpretation of discovery rules? Consider the observation of Robert Aronson, a Seattle law professor who supported sanctions, that “there were kids out there dying because [Fisons’s lawyers and managers] were hiding information so they could win a lawsuit.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.826" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.826" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Ultimately, Bogle &amp; Gates settled the sanctions case for $325,000, one of the highest penalties ever reported at the time. The underlying litigation was settled for $6.9 million. The case prompted a cover story in <span style="font-style: italic;">The American Lawyer</span> (April 1994) titled “Sleazy in Seattle.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Two years after <span style="font-style: italic;">Fisons</span>, a federal judge again sanctioned Bogle &amp; Gates for a similar discovery violation. Representing Subaru of America, Bogle &amp; Gates responded to a discovery request by claiming that certain records did <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page365" class="pagebreak" title="365">365</span>not exist. When later depositions showed that they did, in fact, exist, Bogle &amp; Gates was ordered to pay the other side’s legal fees.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.827" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.827" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> In 1999, Bogle &amp; Gates dissolved, for unrelated reasons.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are a managing partner in a firm representing a plaintiff construction company in a products liability case. Your client alleges defects in the defendant’s steel manufacturing process which, if proven, could expose the corporation to extensive liability in subsequent suits by other customers. Accordingly, the defendant is waging a war of attrition in the hopes of convincing your client and other potential plaintiffs that their costs in trying the case would exceed any likely recovery. To that end, the defendant has:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />made repeated requests to extend the date for compliance with subpoenas, refused your good faith requests to reschedule depositions, and produced an ostensibly “misfiled” document only when confronted by a reference to the document in an inadvertently disclosed attachment; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />responded to discovery requests by bombarding you with every remotely relevant document and, in one instance, referring you to thousands of pages of material that contained only one reference of even tangential relevance.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers for your firm have determined that the court is unlikely to impose meaningful sanctions for such conduct and have decided instead to respond in kind. The trial team has:</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />reminded witnesses that “I don’t recall” is a response that generally avoids the risks of disclosure or prosecution for perjury; and</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The client has now objected to the escalating costs of discovery and accused your firm of meter-running. They insist that you reduce your own fees substantially. How should your firm proceed? Should you have handled discovery differently?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">If your firm now moves for sanctions and opponents respond with a cross-motion for sanctions, how should the court rule? What further facts would be relevant to the court’s decision? In determining whether you or your opponents have engaged in sanctionable practices, should it matter who “started it”?

      <p class="TextParagraph">A lack of lawyer civility has long been a matter of concern. According to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[S]ometimes attorney conduct crosses over from rude to downright scandalous. Two lawyers from prominent New York firms recently turned a deposition into an actual brawl. And attorneys have been spotted exchanging invectives and even engaging in shoving matches in front of various court clerks’ offices, an image that recalls the description of modern-day litigation as ice hockey in business suits. A sitting federal judge, who may deserve a medal, became so exasperated with a pair of lawyers in a case before him that he wrote an order noting. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">If there is a hell to which disputatious, uncivil, vituperative lawyers go, let it be one in which the damned are eternally locked in discovery disputes with lawyers of equally repugnant attributes. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Most of us probably never encounter such outrageous conduct. I would hope that it is not that often that lawyers encounter even ordinary discourtesy. . . . We have lost sight of a fundamental attribute of our profession, one that Shakespeare described in<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Taming of the Shrew</span>. Adversaries in law, he wrote, “[s]trive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.” In contemporary practice, however we speak of our dealings with other lawyers as war—and too often we act accordingly.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.828" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.828" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Courts, bar committees, and litigants have taken a number of steps to address the incivility Justice O’Connor laments. Such approaches are discussed below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Others, however, believe that self-interest is the best check on incivility in the profession. For example, attorney Bartlett H. McGuire has written:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Some clients and many litigators . . . believe that a Rambo approach pays off, and in some cases that is doubtless true. In my view, however, there are also many instances in which the Rambo approach is counterproductive for both the client and the lawyer. My view is based on the following considerations:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Overly aggressive litigators tend to make claims and charges they cannot sustain. When they do so, their credibility is eroded and their good points tend to get lost. Once a judge, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page367" class="pagebreak" title="367">367</span>jury or adversary has lost confidence in a person’s representations, even correct statements are discounted or subject to the most rigorous scrutiny. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Judges exchange views about litigators who appear before them, and other lawyers talk among themselves. Accordingly, if a lawyer’s credibility is eroded in one matter, his or her statements will receive critical scrutiny in unrelated matters. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Since most lawsuits ultimately settle, it is important to maintain reasonable and cordial lines of communication with the other side. Abusing or harassing your adversary makes negotiating settlements extremely difficult. An angry adversary will often refuse to negotiate, or will demand more favorable terms than one who has been treated fairly. This is true of parties as well as attorneys. Mistreating the opposing party at a deposition, or accusing him of lying, can make a prompt and reasonable settlement impossible to achieve. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">When a lawyer loses credibility, engages in <span style="font-style: italic;">ad hominem</span> attacks, provokes adversaries into retaliation, misses out on a favorable settlement, or engages in unnecessary discovery, the client is the ultimate loser. For this reason, many clients shy away from retaining Rambo litigators. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Lawyers refer business to adversaries whom they respect and like. Clients give new business to adversaries who demonstrate that they are both skillful and reasonable to work with. Lawyers who are viewed as unreasonable and unpleasant, by contrast, lose rather than gain clients from this kind of comparison shopping. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Litigation, like any other activity, is simply more fun if you are not always snarling at your adversary, and being snarled at in return.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.829" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.829" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861414" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218983" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756401" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908534" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Civility Codes</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Seeking to further promote civility, in recent years, at least thirty-nine states have adopted “codes of civility.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.830" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.830" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> These codes serve as aspirational guidelines that attorneys “should” follow. Generally, these codes contain the following main precepts:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1) recognize the importance of keeping commitments and of seeking agreement and accommodation with regard to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page368" class="pagebreak" title="368">368</span>scheduling and extensions; (2) be respectful and act in a courteous, cordial, and civil manner; (3) be prompt, punctual, and prepared; (4) maintain honesty and personal integrity; (5) communicate with opposing counsel; (6) avoid actions taken merely to delay or harass; (7) ensure proper conduct before the court; (8) act with dignity and cooperation in pre-trial proceedings; (9) act as a role model to the client and public and as a mentor to young lawyers; and (10) utilize the court system in an efficient and fair manner.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.831" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.831" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A few states have gone further and amended their oaths, sworn by new lawyers, to include a pledge of civility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.832" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.832" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span> For example, since 2003, the Lawyer’s Oath sworn by admittees of the South Carolina Bar has contained the following pledge: “To opposing parties and their counsel, I pledge fairness, integrity, and civility, not only in court, but also in all written and oral communications.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.833" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.833" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, and actually putting teeth in these words, in South Carolina—as well as in a small smattering of states—a violation of the civility oath is a basis for professional discipline.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.834" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.834" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> Most other states, however, do not back up their codes or oaths with discipline. The California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism, for instance, clearly state in the introduction:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="TextParagraph">These voluntary Guidelines foster a level of civility and professionalism that exceed the minimum requirements of the mandated Rules of Professional Conduct as the best practices of civility in the practice of law in California . . . . [T]hey are not to be used as an independent basis for disciplinary charges by the State Bar or claims of professional negligence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.835" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.835" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861415" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218984" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756402" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908535" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Are civility codes, as some contend, “uneasy bedfellows” with ethical rules requiring zealous pursuit of a client’s interest?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.836" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.836" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> In what ways are they similar to, and different from, the Model Rules?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page369" class="pagebreak" title="369">369</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some suggest that bar civility codes too often punt on contentious choices, providing, for example, that a lawyer should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element45" />“be a vigorous and zealous advocate on behalf of [a] client while recognizing that, as an officer of a court, that excessive zeal may be detrimental to many clients’ interests as well as to the proper functioning of our system of justice”;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element46" />“attempt to avoid bullying, intimidating[,] or sarcastic questioning of witnesses except as reasonably proper under circumstances reasonably related to trial tactics.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.837" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.837" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In critics’ view, civility codes that merely exhort lawyers not to be bullies unless bullying is “proper” unnecessarily duck the difficult but crucial issue, which is identifying precisely when zeal, bullying, or intimidation crosses the line of impropriety.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.838" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.838" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span> Is that criticism fair, or do civility codes do as much as possible to strike a balance between appropriate and overly zealous advocacy?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One scholar has recently written:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The time for mandatory civility has long come, and all state bars should follow the lead of the few jurisdictions that made civility mandatory. Simply suggesting that attorneys follow civility guidelines does not adequately alter attorney behavior. Systemic behavior change will more likely occur when civil behavior is required and negative consequences accompany the failure to adhere to the required behavior in appropriate cases. Accordingly, if the legal profession truly wants to reduce unnecessary legal costs and provide greater respect for, and confidence in, the legal system and those who safeguard it, then each state bar should make civility mandatory by using specific civility rules.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.839" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.839" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">On the other hand, some suggest that <span style="font-style: italic;">enforceable</span> civility codes are deeply problematic. Such codes, in critics’ view, are too subjective to provide a reasonable basis for professional discipline, invariably chill rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, are duplicative of other rules of ethics and civil procedure, and inhibit zealous advocacy.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.840" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.840" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span> In addition, one commentator argues that civility codes reflect an “upper-middle-class view of professional conduct,” and that the “prestige hierarchy, patterns of deference, and the [civility codes] drafters’ patrician notions of civility suggest that the behavior of lawyers will be perceived differently along different class lines.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.841" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.841" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span> Do you agree? Given these competing considerations, would you support or oppose a mandatory civility code, backed by sanctions?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page370" class="pagebreak" title="370">370</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the following case that arose under South Carolina’s rule. A South Carolina lawyer representing a client in an acrimonious divorce case sent opposing counsel, “Attorney Doe,” an email stating that he had heard that the attorney’s daughter had been detained for purchasing heroin and cocaine. The email continued:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Does this make you . . . bad parents? This incident is far worse than the allegations your client is making. I just thought it was ironic. You claim that this case is so serious and complicated. There is nothing more complicated and serious than a having a child grow up in a high class white family with parents who are highly educated and financially successful and their child turning out buying drugs from a crack head at night. . . . Think about it. Am I right?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The South Carolina Supreme Court rejected the emailing lawyer’s claim that the oath he took pledging “fairness, integrity and civility, not only in court, but also in all written and oral communications” was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, and ultimately found that the lawyer had violated that oath. The court also found that the email was prejudicial to the system of justice and could “only inflame the passions of everyone involved . . . and undermine a lawyer’s ability to objectively represent his or her client.” In light of the attorney’s remorse, however, the court imposed only a private letter of caution.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.842" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.842" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> Was the incident handled appropriately?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In July 2017, one of President Trump’s lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz, came under scrutiny for incivility. A stranger had sent Mr. Kasowitz an e-mail calling on him to resign from his post as the president’s personal lawyer. Said the individual:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">I believe it is in your best interest and the long-term interest of your firm for you to resign from your position advising the President re. pending federal legal matters. No good can come of this and, in fact, your name may be [sic] turn out to be a disparaging historical footnote to the presidency of DJT.<a id="OLE_LINK51" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="OLE_LINK52" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Kasowitz responded to the individual by sending four profanity-laced and threatening e-mails within thirty-three minutes. One provided: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">And you don’t know me, but I will know you</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">How dare you send me an email like that</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">I’m on you now. You are fucking with me now </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Let’s see who you are </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Watch your back, bitch.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">To that, the individual responded, “Thank you for your kind reply. I may be in touch as appropriate.” Two minutes later, Kasowitz replied: “You are such a piece of shit. Call me. Don’t be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you don’t call, you’re just afraid. Call me.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.843" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.843" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span> Five minutes later, Kasowitz <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page371" class="pagebreak" title="371">371</span>added: “I’m Jewish. I presume you are too. Stop being afraid. Call me. Or give me your number and I will call you. I already know where you live, I’m on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.844" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.844" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> Soon thereafter, Kasowitz apologized, saying this his response was “inappropriate.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.845" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.845" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does Kasowitz’s conduct constitute a violation of Model Rule 8.4? If the South Carolina civility code happened to apply here (under Rule 8.5, it admittedly does not), would the South Carolina rule encompass this conduct? Is this the kind of misconduct that <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> trigger disciplinary activity?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Social media posts are not known for civility and some lawyers have come to grief for their vulgar or threatening posts. One lawyer’s obscenity-laced Facebook message to his client’s ex-husband (and litigation adversary) began, “You pissed off the wrong attorney.” He called the ex-husband “pond scum,” threatened to rape him, and concluded: “I’ve got you in my sights now.” The result: The lawyer was arrested and indicted for felony intimidation. He claimed that he was merely trying to signal that the ex-husband could expect an aggressive defense.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.846" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.846" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Joyce Nanine McCool, a Louisiana lawyer, was disbarred after circulating an online petition asking people to pressure two judges on behalf of her client, in a case she believed was a miscarriage of justice. She tweeted: “Judges are supposed to know shit about . . . the law . . . aren’t they. And like evidence and shit? Due process? [link to online petition].” Presciently, she then tweeted: “I am SO going 2 have 2 change jobs after this . . . ! I’m risking sanctions by the LA supreme court.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.847" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.847" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Notably, while McCool was disbarred, it was not for crudeness or incivility—at least not explicitly. She was charged with improper ex parte communication with the judges, disseminating false and misleading information, and prejudicing the administration of justice (because both judges recused themselves as a result of her social media campaign). Yet the tweets’ incivility figured into the Louisiana Supreme Court’s analysis. The court described McCool’s “social media blitz” as “nothing more than an orchestrated effort to inflame the public sensibility,” and added that causing the judges to recuse themselves, while “not as blatantly offensive as the blitzing itself . . . nevertheless prejudiced the administration of justice by causing undue delays.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.848" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.848" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> Explaining why she recused herself, one of the judges testified, “A Judge is a human being also . . . I’ve never been one to run away from doing what I’ve been called to do, but this was just more than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page372" class="pagebreak" title="372">372</span>I could bear. . . . [I]t just would not stop.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.849" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.849" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span> One Louisiana justice dissented from McCool’s disbarment because, in his view, criticizing judges is constitutionally protected speech. He favored suspension for a year and a day, based on McCool’s false statements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.850" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.850" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Obviously, these are unusual cases. But colorful, memorable, and often crude expressions are not unusual on social media. Posters may believe that nothing else will get their posts noticed and their tweets re-tweeted. Should standards of civility make allowances for the exaggeration and crudeness of social media expression?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.851" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.851" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span></p>

        </span>
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps;"> Middlebrooks, District Judge.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This Cause came before the Court upon Plaintiff’s Amended Verified Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs, filed November 4, 1999. The Court has reviewed the pertinent portions of the file and is otherwise fully informed in the premises.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextHeadFlush">I. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“Let’s kick some ass,” Marvin Kurzban said loudly to his client, Anthony Lee, and his co-counsel, Ira Kurzban. I had taken the bench, and Court was in session. Opposing counsel and their client representatives were seated across the aisle. The jury was waiting to be called into the courtroom. Mr. Kurzban’s comment was suited more to a locker room than a courtroom of the United States, and the conduct of Plaintiff’s counsel that followed disrupted the adversary system and interfered with the resolution of a civil dispute.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The trial of this case lasted approximately fourteen days. The jury found that American Eagle Airlines had subjected Mr. Lee to a racially hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . . As compensation, the jury awarded Mr. Lee $300,000. In addition, the jury awarded Mr. Lee $650,000 in punitive damages. . . . This motion seeking attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to <a id="dabmci_983d46436e804493badf106c4f74f5be" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />42 U.S.C. § 1988 followed.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As the prevailing party in a Title VII action, the Plaintiff now seeks $1,611,910.50 in attorney’s fees. This request presents the question of whether unprofessional and disruptive conduct of counsel which prolongs the proceedings and creates animosity which interferes with the resolution of a cause can be considered in determining an award of attorney’s fees. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextHeadFlush">II. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Findings of Fact Pertaining to Misconduct by Counsel</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Discovery in this case was rancorous from the beginning. As is often the case, counsel for both sides contributed to the lack of civility. The tone of depositions was harsh, witnesses were treated with discourtesy, and discovery disputes were abundant. The transcripts of the depositions in this case are weighted down with bitter exchanges between the lawyers. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Testimony at the evidentiary hearing reflected that this uncivil conduct also continued during conversations between counsel. The testimony of a young lawyer formerly with the Defendant’s counsel’s law firm was particularly poignant. This lawyer testified that during telephone conversations with Ira Kurzban, she was hung up on, told that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page374" class="pagebreak" title="374">374</span>she had only been assigned to work on the case because she was African-American, and wrongly accused of misrepresentations. She testified that her experience with opposing counsel in this case was a factor in her decision to leave her litigation practice.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This testimony was not only powerful and credible, but it also reflects the corrosive impact this type of unprofessional behavior can have upon the bar itself. A litigation practice is stressful and often exhausting. Unprofessional litigation tactics affect everyone exposed to such behavior and the ripple effect of incivility is spread throughout the bar.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The trial began. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing reveals that Mr. Kurzban’s “Let’s kick some ass” comment was not an aberration. A client representative of the Defendant, a lawyer for American Airlines, testified that she and others were subjected to a barrage of comments out of the hearing of the Court and jury which she likened to trash talk at a sporting event. Local counsel for the Defendant was called a “Second Rate Loser” by Marvin Kurzban. She testified that each day as court began, Marvin Kurzban would say, “Let the pounding begin.” In front of defense counsel’s client, Mr. Kurzban would ask, “How are you going to feel when I take all of your client’s money?” When walking out of the courtroom, Marvin Kurzban would exclaim, “Yuppies out of the way.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[The judge then proceeds to detail numerous additional examples of misbehavior by Marvin and Ira Kurzban, including eye rolling, flailing arms, speaking with a witness during a break after being warned not to, looking upward at the ceiling when their objections were overruled, making belligerent comments to opposing counsel, and insulting the court reporter. Apparently too, when the judge admonished him for laughing at one adverse ruling, “Ira Kurzban then listed a litany of complaints about rulings which he stated should result in a mistrial.” The judge added: “When offered a mistrial, the Plaintiff declined.”]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During a cross-examination concerning how much time the witness spent on various shifts, Marvin Kurzban held a file towards the witness and asked:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Marvin Kurzban: I have your personnel file (indicating). How many times did you have to work between 1992 and 1994, sir? Do you think it was more than a handful of times?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After an objection, and out of the presence of the jury, I asked Mr. Kurzban for the witness’s personnel file. He responded:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Marvin Kurzban: Actually, we do have Mr. Blades’s personnel file, when it was produced among all the other personnel files in Miami of the people. I don’t know if that box is here or I left it in the office. I think the personnel files that we were given by counsel is in the office.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The Court: So it wasn’t in the folder that you picked up and carried to the stand?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page375" class="pagebreak" title="375">375</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Marvin Kurzban: No it wasn’t, Your Honor.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The Court: You said, “Mr. Blades, we have your personnel file here!”</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextFlush">* * *</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The Court: You believe it is permissible to pick up a file from your desk, carry it to the witness stand and tell the witness “Mr. Blades, we have your personnel file,” and then begin questioning him? You believe that’s appropriate court examination?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Marvin Kurzban: I do, on hostile witnesses; on cross-examination, I believe that I’m entitled to have that witness believe I’m going to question him on something whether or not I have that in my hand or not. Yes, I do. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Mr. Kurzban insisted that he had the personnel file back at his office. He was asked to produce it and he responded that he would the following day. The file was never produced.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the end of the trial, defense counsel Connor approached Ira Kurzban and offered his hand in congratulations. Mr. Kurzban refused to shake his hand. The trial ended much like it had begun.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the evidentiary hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel were unrepentant, attacking opposing counsel and accepting no responsibility for their own actions. They argued that the perceived misconduct was only a matter of style and the exercise of first amendment rights. In keeping with that “style,” Marvin Kurzban ended the hearing with the proclamation that he had called his opponent a loser, but not a second-rate loser because, “I don’t rate losers.” Mr. Kurzban’s testimony reflects that he has no clue about what it means to be a lawyer.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">III. Analysis</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Courts presiding over civil rights actions may, in their discretion, award the prevailing party a “reasonable attorney’s fee (including expert fees)” as part of its costs. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Courts determining attorney’s fee awards begin by determining the “lodestar”: the product of the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation and a reasonable hourly rate for the attorney’s services. This lodestar may then be adjusted for the results obtained.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“A reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar service by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation.” . . . As explained more fully in the findings of misconduct, contained in Section II, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, the conduct of Ira Kurzban and Marvin Kurzban both during and prior to trial was very troubling. In my estimation, the manner in which a lawyer interacts with opposing counsel and conducts himself before the Court is as indicative of the lawyer’s ability and skill as is mastery of the rules of evidence. Upon review of the trial transcripts and the evidence presented <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page376" class="pagebreak" title="376">376</span>during the evidentiary hearing on attorney conduct and based on observations at trial, I find that the conduct of Ira Kurzban and Marvin Kurzban in the litigation of this case fell far below acceptable standards, especially in light of the $300 hourly rate the attorneys claim. Accordingly, I find “special circumstances” justifying a departure from counsels’ requested rates: Ira Kurzban shall be awarded $150 per hour for his pretrial work and $0 for his trial work; Marvin Kurzban’s rate for this action is $0. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I believe that this reduction in attorney fees is an appropriate response to the conduct by Plaintiff’s counsel in this case, but I am not convinced it will deter future misconduct. I frankly considered denying fees altogether but while I have reviewed many of the depositions, I did not observe everything that happened during the pretrial phase of the case. The reduction in attorneys’ fees based upon misconduct of counsel is therefore approximately $358,423.20. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Based on the foregoing we award Plaintiff $312,324.63 in fees and costs. Furthermore, because of the misconduct of counsel which occurred in this case, a copy of this order shall be sent to the Florida Bar and the Peer Review Committee for the Southern District of Florida for any action deemed appropriate.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Notice that in <span style="font-style: italic;">American Eagle</span>, the judge awards the Kurzbans $312,324.63 in fees and costs, and “fines” them (in the form of a fee-reduction) $358,423.20. Was the fee reduction excessive? Did Judge Middlebrooks abuse his discretion when he held that “the manner in which a lawyer interacts with opposing counsel and conducts himself before the Court is . . . indicative of the lawyer’s ability and skill” and therefore cut back the Kurzbans’ hourly rate because of their uncivil behavior?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Among the instances of “incivility” that the judge details are several remarks the Kurzbans made during trial about the judge’s bias against them. The opinion notes that the Kurzbans did not pursue a mistrial on account of judicial bias. If attorneys believe that a judge is behaving in a biased manner but do not wish to ask for a mistrial—perhaps because they believe that they are persuading the jury—what should they do? Are the Kurzbans being punished for standing up for their client? Does civility require lawyers to act as though they agree with a judge’s unfavorable rulings? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Was it misconduct for Marvin Kurzban to pretend that papers in his hand were a witness’s personnel file when in fact they were not? If so, what sanction would be appropriate? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Kurzbans claimed that their “perceived misconduct was only a matter of style and the exercise of first amendment rights.” Is this correct? Would non-binding civility codes do anything to restrain the kind of conduct that Judge Middlebrooks found objectionable here?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page377" class="pagebreak" title="377">377</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Judges have little to say about defendant’s fees. In light of that asymmetry, does <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee v. American Eagle</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Airlines</span> disadvantage civil rights plaintiffs, who must often rely on the court for fees? More generally, is this a case in which small-firm plaintiffs’ lawyers, who may believe they have to fight harder for clients to make up for resource and reputational deficits, are treated unfairly relative to big-firm counterparts?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2019, nearly two decades after <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Marvin Kurzban was permanently (and voluntarily) disbarred for two instances of “discourteous and unprofessional” conduct in a medical malpractice case. In the first, Kurzban posed questions to a witness implying that opposing counsel had fabricated evidence. The questions led to a mistrial. The judge sanctioned Kurzban, requiring him to pay all legal fees in the case. Then, in the retrial, Kurzban made “<span style="color: #333333; background-color: #FFFFFF;">an inappropriate comment as to not wanting to engage in a ‘cat fight’ which appeared targeted toward opposing counsel and the judge, both of whom are female.”</span><span style="color: #333333; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.854" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.854" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider <a id="dabmci_545a74e924b3410c86320db8c9e0085d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;First City Bankcorporation of Texas, Inc., In re&quot; \s &quot;A;O;47;dabmci_545a74e924b3410c86320db8c9e0085d_1;I08e1a2e879ca11d99c4dbb2f0352441d;;0;F;In re First City Bankcorporation of Texas, Inc., 282 F.3d 864 (5th Cir. 2002)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">In re First City Bankcorporation of Texas, Inc</span>., 282 F.3d 864 (5th Cir. 2002). There, a “zealous” lawyer referred to opposing counsel as a “stooge,” a “puppet,” a “deadhead,” and an “underling who graduated from a 29th tier law school.” The bankruptcy court in which the case was originally heard imposed a $25,000 sanction for this conduct. Appealing before the Fifth Circuit, the lawyer argued that his behavior was an appropriate trial tactic, which gave him the upper hand in settlement negotiations. If you had been on that Fifth Circuit panel, would you have upheld the $25,000 penalty?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In a bellwether trial defending Merck, the maker of Vioxx (a pain reliever that caused strokes and heart attacks), defense attorney Diane P. Sullivan repeatedly violated the trial judge’s orders. She reportedly showed the jury evidence that she had been warned not to show, implied information that was not true, and made arguments she had been advised not to make. The trial judge, Carol Higbee, ultimately said, in exasperation: “You don’t accept my rulings.” But Sullivan apparently was not moved; the disobedience continued throughout the trial.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.855" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.855" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> Later, the plaintiffs’ lawyer complained to Judge Higbee: “You set down the rules for us.

      <p style="margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Still, the strategy seemed to work. Sullivan received a favorable verdict for Merck.

      <p class="TextFlush">Order on Motion to Continue</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This matter is currently set for trial commencing June 14, 2011. Defendants seek a brief continuance, noting that one of their counsel, Bryan Erman, along with his wife, is expecting their first child due on July 3. Given the proposed length of trial and the famous disregard that newborns (especially first-borns) have for such schedules, and given that the trial is scheduled in Kansas City while the new Erman’s arrival is scheduled in Dallas, Defendants move this Court for a continuance.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This in itself would not be remarkable, but in reviewing the motion the Court was more than somewhat surprised to read that “Plaintiffs have refused to agree to continue the trial setting and have indicated that they intend to oppose this Motion.” Well, every party is entitled to file an opposition to a motion, and hoping that perhaps Defendants had mischaracterized the vigor of Plaintiffs’ opposition, we have eagerly awaited Plaintiffs defense of its opposition. The Memorandum in Opposition arrived yesterday, and it was, sadly, as advertised.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">First, Plaintiffs make a lengthy and spirited argument about when Defendants should have known this would happen, even citing a pretrial conference occurring in early November as a time when Mr. Erman “most certainly” would have known of the due date of his child, and even more astonishingly arguing that “utilizing simple math, the due date for Mr. Erman’s child’s birth would have been known on approximately Oct. 3, or shortly thereafter.” For reasons of good taste which should be (though, apparently, are not) too obvious to explain, the Court declines to accept Plaintiffs’ invitation to speculate on the time of conception of the Ermans’ child.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Further, Plaintiffs assert that there are currently five attorneys from two different firms on Defendants’ signature block. While the Court might be inclined to agree with Plaintiffs that this seems like a plethora of attorneys, it can’t help but note that, entered and active on behalf of Plaintiffs in this case, are also five attorneys, from three different firms; so perhaps Plaintiffs are ill equipped to argue that Defendants have too many attorneys.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, Plaintiffs argue that surely Mr. Erman will have sufficient time to make it from the Kansas City trial to the Dallas birth, even helpfully pointing out the number of daily, non-stop flights between the two cities; and in any event complain of the inconvenience of this late <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page379" class="pagebreak" title="379">379</span>requested continuance. Certainly this judge is convinced of the importance of federal court, but he has always tried not to confuse what he does with who he is, nor to distort the priorities of his day job with his life’s role. Counsel are encouraged to order their priorities similarly. Defendants’ Motion is <span style="font-weight: bolder;">GRANTED</span>.

But more recently it has attempted to modify its reputation by requiring outside counsel to:</p>

Make reasonable responses to discovery requests. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The agreement goes on to say: “Sanctions for discovery violations will not be tolerated and may result in the immediate termination of Outside Counsel.”<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.859" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.859" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span> Is this window dressing or a meaningful constraint on the tactical choices of outside counsel?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are an attorney defending a client in a contentious product liability action. The plaintiff’s lawyer, a solo practitioner who has been difficult to deal with in the past, calls and asks you to stipulate to moving the hearing date on a summary judgment motion because her grandfather has just passed away. Though she will be back in town by the hearing date, she will be away the week prior to the hearing attending her grandfather’s funeral. With your consent, the lawyer would like to file an unopposed motion to move the hearing date, but if not, she will be forced to file a motion on her own.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This summary judgment hearing is critical to the case, and you know, too, that if the hearing is held at the originally scheduled time, your opposing counsel will likely be flustered and inadequately prepared, improving your client’s odds. You also know that a court is unlikely to grant the motion without your consent, since the opposing counsel technically can attend the hearing. Finally, your client is really eager to have this case concluded; you believe your client will be somewhat prejudiced if the summary judgment hearing is heard a few weeks later than currently scheduled.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.860" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.860" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the most common dilemmas in criminal and civil trials involves witness preparation, a practice forbidden in most countries. Marvin Frankel summarizes the process as follows:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The [adversary] contest by its very nature is not one in which the objective of either side, or of both together, is to expose “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">That the quoted words, from the witness’s oath, are not meant quite literally may be seen from more than one perspective. Consider the lawyer’s major work of interviewing and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page381" class="pagebreak" title="381">381</span>“preparing” witnesses, including the client who plans to take the stand. . . . [E]very lawyer knows that the “preparing” of witnesses may embrace a multitude of other measures, including some ethical lapses believed to be more common than we would wish. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Moving away from palpably unsavory manifestations, we all know that the preparation of our witnesses is calculated, one way and another, to mock the solemn promise of the whole truth and nothing but. To be sure, reputable lawyers admonish their clients and witnesses to be truthful. At the same time, they often take infinite pains to prepare questions designed to make certain that the controlled flow of truth does not swell to an embarrassing flood. “Don’t volunteer anything,” the witnesses are cautioned. The concern is not that the volunteered contribution may be false. The concern is to avoid an excess of truth, where the spillover may prove hurtful to the case. . . .<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.861" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.861" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Above, Frankel teases out the fact that preparing witnesses can assist, as well as subvert and distort, truth-finding processes. It can help nervous, shy, unsophisticated, or reticent individuals testify effectively. Skillful coaching can also help witnesses avoid annoying mannerisms, suspicious hesitations, unduly technical language, rambling answers, and prejudicial phrasing. But once that coaching crosses a narrow and often blurry line, it is broadly (and properly) condemned as unethical.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An interesting historical case study on the rationale and risks of witness preparation emerged in a <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Law Journal</span> exchange on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the famous Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire. That disaster, in which 146 young, mostly immigrant women burned to death, became a turning point in the struggle for protective labor legislation. It also resulted in a celebrated criminal prosecution of the factory owners for violation of safety statutes. After poignant testimony from one of the victims, defense counsel requested that she repeat her narrative. When she provided an almost verbatim repetition, the lawyer asked about one word she had used in her first but not second account. After repeating the testimony silently to herself, moving her lips slightly in the process, the witness confirmed that she had erroneously omitted the word. After briefly changing the subject, counsel then repeated the strategy with similar results. The obviously rehearsed nature of the victim’s testimony helped to undermine the credibility of the prosecution’s case and to secure an acquittal. A <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Law Journal</span> article commending the defense counsel’s performance provoked an angry letter to the editor in response. Its authors noted that many women <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page382" class="pagebreak" title="382">382</span>who testified in the case needed rehearsing; they spoke little or no English and were traumatized by the fire and court proceedings.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.862" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.862" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So, how should a lawyer draw the line between proper and improper preparation? Regrettably, the Model Rules offer little guidance. As Professor Charles Silver has put it: “Everyone knows that it is wrong to ask a witness to lie. What is not known is how far a lawyer can properly push a witness short of that.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.863" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.863" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The closest authority on point is Rule 3.4(b), which advises that “[a] lawyer shall not . . . counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely.” And Rule 8.4(c), of course, specifies that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to “engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.864" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.864" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span> The <a id="dabmci_82405dee987c4d8fb72c5db50088e2af" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers</span> § 116, cmt. b offers a somewhat more detailed analysis. Entitled “Interviewing and Preparing a Prospective Witness,” it provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[Proper preparation] may include the following: discussing the role of the witness and effective courtroom demeanor; discussing the witness’s recollection and probable testimony; revealing to the witness other testimony or evidence that will be presented and asking the witness to reconsider the witness’s recollection or recounting of events in that light; discussing the applicability of law to the events in issue; reviewing the factual context into which the witness’s observations or opinions will fit; reviewing documents or other physical evidence that may be introduced; and discussing probable lines of hostile cross-examination that the witness should be prepared to meet. Witness preparation may include rehearsal of testimony. A lawyer may suggest choice of words that might be employed to make the witness’s meaning clear. However, a lawyer may not assist the witness to testify falsely as to a material fact.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The Reporters’ Note acknowledges: “The . . . Comment on witness preparation is supported by relatively sparse authority but, it is believed, by the uniform practice of lawyers in all jurisdictions.”</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate witness preparation? Does the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> <a id="dabmci_83e8a64d1a5f489fbd8e9f7b193ebb66" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 116 strike the right balance? Of coaching, one court famously explained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">While a discreet and prudent attorney may very properly ascertain from witnesses in advance of the trial what they in fact do know, and the extent and limitations of their memory, as a guide to his own examinations, he has no right, legal or moral, to go further. His duty is to extract the facts from the witness, not to pour them into him; to learn what the witness does know, not to teach him what he ought to know.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Matter of </span><a id="dabmci_1fb70af8712b4f07a2bbf4b46301a385" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Eldridge</span>, 82 N.Y. 161, 171 (1880). Is that view realistic? Alternatively, the U.S. Supreme Court has advised: “An attorney must respect the important ethical distinction between discussing testimony and seeking improperly to influence it.” <a id="dabmci_4b786831495b4e9ba5bf735398848cc6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Geders v.

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A preliminary draft of the Model Rules included a provision that would have prohibited lawyers from giving advice that they could “reasonably foresee will aid a client in giving false testimony.” Would you favor adoption of such a rule?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A longstanding dispute has centered on the technique of counseling the client about the law before inquiring about the facts. An example would be for a lawyer to say, in a slip-and-fall case: “Now, you could only recover if the material on which you slipped had been there for a long time and showed signs of grit and dirt. Now, can you describe the material on which you fell? Was it pristine or was it gritty and dirty?” Some defend the practice:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[I]t is not the lawyer’s function to prejudge his client as a perjurer. He cannot presume that his client will make unlawful use of his advice. . . . There is a natural predisposition in most people to recollect facts, entirely honestly, in a way most favorable to their own interest. . . . Before he begins to remember essential facts, the client is entitled to know what his own interests are. . . . To decide otherwise would . . . penalize the less well-educated defendant.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.865" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.865" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Others disagree. In critics’ view, it is asking too much to provide a reason to lie and then ask for the truth. It is “hard enough to get essential facts without supplying a motive to distort them.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.866" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.866" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span> What’s your view? Should a lawyer ever start an inquiry by summarizing the law? If so, under what circumstances?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While common in the United States, witness preparation is forbidden in most countries. Indeed, according to the Pre-Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC), witness preparation would be “either <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page384" class="pagebreak" title="384">384</span>unethical or unlawful in jurisdictions as different as Brazil, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Scotland, Ghana, England and Wales and Australia.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.867" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section17.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.867" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Would the United States be better off if we, too, banned witness preparation entirely? What would be gained and what would be lost?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You represent a defendant in a case involving an expert scientific witness from Switzerland. He has never participated in a legal proceeding before and is quite nervous. His English, although perfectly adequate, is heavily accented and requires careful attention to follow. When you prepare him for testifying, he gives cautious, heavily qualified, “two-handed” answers (“on the one hand . . . ; on the other hand”). He frequently uses technical jargon which he cannot explain clearly, or even correctly (as you know from your own preparations for the case, which included carefully studying textbooks on the scientific issues). When you repeat questions, he occasionally gives different answers the second time around.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />During preparation, can you remind him of the correct definitions of technical concepts and rehearse him until he is able to explain them clearly?</p>

Similarly, Rule 37(a) authorizes sanctions against a party or attorney only if a motion to compel is filed; Rule 37(b) authorizes sanctions against a party or an attorney if the party fails to comply with a discovery order; and, Rule 37(c) only imposes liability upon a party for the party’s failure to comply with various discovery obligations. Under a strict interpretation of these rules, the only attorney who would be responsible for the discovery failure is Kevin Leung because he signed the false discovery responses. However, the Court believes the federal rules impose a duty of good faith and reasonable inquiry on all attorneys involved in litigation who rely on discovery responses executed by another attorney. . . . The facts of this case also justify the imposition of sanctions against these attorneys pursuant to the Court’s inherent power.</p>

If Leung was unable to get Qualcomm to conduct the type of search he deemed necessary to verify the adequacy of the document search and production, then he should have obtained the assistance of supervising or senior attorneys. If Mammen and Batchelder were unable to get Qualcomm to conduct a competent and thorough document search, they should have withdrawn from the case or taken other action to ensure production of the evidence. . . .</p>
