      <p class="TextParagraph">As we saw in the last chapter, lawyers function within a system of market regulation that is designed to protect the public against abusive practices but also has the effect of limiting who can provide legal services and affecting how much legal services cost. Within this system, the default rule is that clients pay for their lawyers’ services. In an unequal society, this means that people and organizations with greater resources will have more access to law. This chapter explores how the legal profession, and society more broadly, have responded to the challenge of inequality in the distribution of legal services. It begins in Section A by examining the often-heard claim that there are too many lawyers and too much litigiousness. Section B then addresses the opposite problem—of inadequate access to lawyers by low- and moderate-income people. Finally, Section C, explores various mechanisms for redistributing legal services to those with insufficient resources to afford them in the private marketplace. It examines the right to counsel movement, subsidized legal services, public interest law, pro bono and low bono service, alternative dispute resolution, and technology and efforts simplify legal processes.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">(Ed. 1858).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the muddy streets are muddiest, near that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation: Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln’s Inn Hall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Never can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire too deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds, this day, in the sight of heaven and earth.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here—as here he is—with a foggy glory round his head, softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a large advocate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page862" class="pagebreak" title="862">862</span>with great whiskers, a little voice, and an interminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an afternoon, some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be—as here they are—mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on slippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running their goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words, and making a pretense of equity with serious faces, as players might. On such an afternoon, the various solicitors in the cause, some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a fortune by it, ought to be—as are they not?—ranged in a line, in a long matted well (but you might look in vain for Truth at the bottom of it), between the registrar’s red table and the silk gowns, with bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits, issues, references to masters, masters’ reports, mountains of costly nonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting candles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it would never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their colour, and admit no light of day into the place; well may the uninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in the door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect, and by the drawl languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it, and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the Court of Chancery; which has its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire; which has its worn-out lunatic in every madhouse, and its dead in every churchyard; which has its ruined suitor, with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress, borrowing and begging through the round of every man’s acquaintance; which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right; which so exhausts finances, patience, courage, hope; so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart; that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give—who does not often give—the warning, “Suffer any wrong that can be done you, rather than come here!”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor’s court this murky afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three counsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before mentioned? There is the registrar below the Judge, in wig and gown; and there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy-purses, or whatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning; for no crumb of amusement ever falls from JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE (the cause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The short-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of the newspapers, invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page863" class="pagebreak" title="863">863</span>means. The parties to it understand it least; but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit. The little plaintiff or defendant, who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled, has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps, since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the Court, perennially hopeless.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good that has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke in the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out of it. . . . The last Lord Chancellor handled it neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he observed, “or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr. Blowers”—a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and purses.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How many people out of the suit, Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt, would be a very wide question. From the master, upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes; down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerk’s Office, who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery-folio-pages under that eternal heading; no man’s nature has been made the better by it. In trickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under false pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never come to good. The very solicitors’ boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle, Mizzle, or otherwise, was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it, but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother, and a contempt of his own kind. Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise, have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter, and see what can be done for Drizzle—who was not well used—when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and sharking, in all their many varieties, have been sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page864" class="pagebreak" title="864">864</span>the outermost circle of such evil, have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong, it was, in some offhand manner, never meant to go right.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Thus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?” says the Chancellor, with a slight smile.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Eighteen of Mr. Tangle’s learned friends, each armed with a little summary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a pianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places of obscurity.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">“We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,” says the Chancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come to a settlement one of these days.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">For additional perspectives, consider the following quotations. The first is by Russian novelist and historian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Western society has chosen for itself the organization best suited to its purposes and one I might call legalistic. The limits of human rights and rightness are determined by a system of laws; such limits are very broad. . . . If one is right from a legal point of view, nothing more is required, nobody may mention that one could still not be entirely right, and urge self-restraint or a renunciation of these rights, call for sacrifice and selfless risk; this would simply sound absurd. Voluntary self-restraint is almost unheard of; everybody strives toward further expansion to the extremes of the legal frames. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">But a society with no other scale but the legal one is also less worthy of man. A society based on the letter of the law and never reaching any higher fails to take advantage of the full range of human possibilities. The letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society. Whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relationships, this creates an atmosphere of spiritual mediocrity that paralyzes man’s noblest impulses.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1924" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1924" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The second, by former President George W. Bush, at a gathering in 2003:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">We’re a litigious society; everybody is suing, it seems like. There are too many lawsuits in America. . . . People who have got a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page865" class="pagebreak" title="865">865</span>claim, a legitimate claim, must have a hearing in our courts. . . . And they deserve a court that is uncluttered by junk and frivolous lawsuits.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1925" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1925" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Finally, consider the views of television personality and former journalist, John Stossel:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Even when the lawyers do help their clients, they hurt everyone else because fear of their lawsuits takes away many good things: swimming pools, playgrounds, and gymnastic programs close because liability is so expensive. . . . Companies that started work on a safer asbestos substitute, an AIDS vaccine, and a Lyme disease vaccine gave up the research because any work in those areas risked stirring up the lawyers. The liability risk was too great.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1926" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1926" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As the above quotes suggest, concerns about litigiousness and the legalization of American society are by no means new. The last three centuries have witnessed countless variations on the themes fictionalized by Charles Dickens and highlighted by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, George W. Bush, and John Stossel. It has been often asserted and widely assumed that America has had “too much law and too little justice,” and that lawyers are, in large part, to blame.<a id="_Ref34118522" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1927" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1927" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet, as the continuity of such critiques suggests, such concerns have done little to discourage the nation’s investment in legal process. Indeed, the history of Solzhenitsyn’s denunciation of legalism provides an ironic illustration of our cultural ambivalence toward legalization. When some of his admirers sought to republish the address in a volume of commentary, Solzhenitsyn initially withheld permission and threatened legal action. In the abstract, the “letter of the law” may have seemed too “cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society,” but in his own case, Solzhenitsyn (as well as his adversaries) apparently found it of some use.<a id="_Ref34209078" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1928" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1928" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> It also bears note that former President George W. Bush, who long complained about “too many lawsuits,” owed his 2000 election to one.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page866" class="pagebreak" title="866">866</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most complaints about American “hyperlexis” involve four related claims. Critics assert that we have too many lawyers, too much litigation, too much law, and too much legal expense. Each of these assertions is explored below.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861717" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219264" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756668" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908802" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Too Many Lawyers</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Since the Colonial era, Americans have complained about the number of lawyers and have blamed lawyers for the nation’s proliferation of laws and lawsuits. As one op-ed in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Boston Globe</span> complained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">With almost 1.3 million lawyers—more by far than any other country, and more as a percentage of the national population than almost all others—the United States is choking on litigation, regulation, and disputation. Everything is grist for the lawyers’ mills.<a id="_Ref34118460" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1929" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1929" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Yet, this criticism, and others like it, tend to rely on misleading assumptions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">First, the facts are often wrong. One widely repeated assertion is that America has 70 percent of the world’s lawyers, but that’s widely off the mark. Informed estimates put the figure somewhere between a quarter and a third, which is roughly the United States’ share of the world’s Gross National Product.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1930" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1930" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> Furthermore, cross-cultural comparisons can be misleading since they fail to reveal the number of practitioners in other countries who are not licensed members of the bar but nevertheless perform tasks that, in this country, are largely reserved for lawyers. In Germany, for example, in-house counsel do not belong to the bar, and are not counted as members of the legal profession. Likewise, in Japan, a large number of individuals receive formal legal training and perform legal functions but are not considered “lawyers” because they are not permitted to act as courtroom advocates. These workarounds were fashioned because, until recently, Japan imposed quotas that artificially curtailed attorney supply. Further, it’s revealing that, over the past decade, Japan has taken steps specifically to <span style="font-style: italic;">boost</span> its number of licensed lawyers to counter what Japanese officials see as a damaging shortfall in legal assistance, particularly in rural areas.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1931" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1931" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Similarly, the frequent criticism that lawyers never “make the pie grow larger [but] only decide how to carve it up,” is catchy—but ultimately inaccurate.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1932" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1932" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> As a description of American attorneys’ role in corporate planning, regulatory compliance, civil liberties litigation, or criminal defense, the pie metaphor seems somewhat lacking—“pie in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page867" class="pagebreak" title="867">867</span>sky,” as Professor David Luban has put it.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1933" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1933" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> An engineer’s product has value only if it can be developed, protected, and marketed within a complex network of legal relations. Contracts, patents, trade secrets, securities laws, and health and safety regulations may all be implicated. Lawyers who sue to protect an engineer’s intellectual property rights aren’t just “dividing the pie”; they are also enforcing a system of incentives that reward innovation and thereby make the pie larger.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861718" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219265" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756669" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908803" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Too Many Lawsuits</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Claims about America’s hair-trigger litigiousness are equally problematic. According to recent polls, 87 percent of American voters believe that there are “too many lawsuits filed in America,” and 86 percent believe that there is an “increasing tendency for Americans to threaten legal action and lawsuits when things go wrong.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1934" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1934" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Both conceptions are unsupported by evidence. For starters, experts generally agree that current litigation rates are not exceptionally high, either as compared to prior eras or as against many other Western industrialized nations not known for contentiousness. Per capita court filings in the U.S. are in the same range as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, England, Denmark, and Israel.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1935" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1935" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> Nor is it clear that filing rates are an accurate measure of cultural combativeness or legal hypochondria. Roughly 98 percent of American litigation occurs in state courts, where uncontested divorces account for a high proportion of the caseload. Such cases hardly constitute a major drain on judicial resources; many family court hearings last less than five minutes.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1936" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1936" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Tort cases, such as medical malpractice and product liability claims, trigger perhaps the greatest criticism. But rather than experiencing any “litigation explosion,” these cases are declining by basically every measure. According to data gathered by the National Center for State Courts, in 2015, fewer than two in 1000 people filed tort lawsuits; in 1993, the comparable figure was ten per 1000. It’s a stunning decline, which represents, in the words of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall Street Journal</span>, a “nationwide ebb in lawsuits, which confounds the public perception of courts choked with tort claims.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1937" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1937" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> Damages for prevailing plaintiffs are also down. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, between 1992 and 2005, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page868" class="pagebreak" title="868">868</span>median jury tort award decreased a dramatic 54 percent, from $71,000 to $33,000, in inflation-adjusted dollars.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1938" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1938" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So too, across the system, trials are declining, leading to what many call the “vanishing trial.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1939" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1939" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span> According to a recent summary: </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">In 1938, trials resolved roughly 20 percent of civil cases in federal court. By 1990, only 4.3 percent of federal civil filings reached trial. By 2000, a mere 2.2 percent did. And, most recently, in 2016, the civil trial rate was halved again. Over the past twenty years, between 1997 and 2016, the number of civil trials in the nation’s federal courts dropped 62 percent. Another way to look at it: Federal courts conducted half as many civil trials in 2016 than they did in 1962, even while disposing of over five times as many civil cases.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">At the state level, where the vast majority (perhaps 98 percent) of civil litigation takes place, trial rates are lower still. The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) reports that, in 2016, the percentage of civil cases resolved by jury trial ranged from .05 percent to .50 percent in the twenty-four jurisdictions studied. In these states, as on the federal level, the trend is sharply downward: From 2000 to 2009, for example, the percentage of state civil jury trials dropped a stunning 47.5 percent.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Zeroing in on individual jurisdictions reveals a picture that is particularly stark. The entire state of West Virginia saw twenty-one federal civil trials (bench and jury) in 2016. Wyoming saw eight. Alaska saw three. And Vermont saw two. The story in states is similar. In Iowa in 2014, for example, there were thirteen counties where no trial verdicts were entered whatsoever, and there were sixty-one counties with three or fewer jury verdicts (whether in civil or criminal cases).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1940" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1940" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Meanwhile, it’s commonly said that Americans sue one another “at the drop of a hat.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1941" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1941" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span> But evidence suggests otherwise. Again looking at the tort system, overall, only about 10 percent of injured Americans seek any kind of redress when accidentally injured, only 4 percent hire an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page869" class="pagebreak" title="869">869</span><span style="color: #000000;">attorney, and only about 2 percent of injury victims actually sue.</span><span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1942" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1942" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> More than 80 percent of injured Americans never even consider claiming.</span><span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1943" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1943" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000;">Within some areas, most notably medical malpractice, rates of lawsuit initiation are even lower.</span>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #000000; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;">
          <a id="ftnb.1944" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1944" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #000000;"> As Professor Tom Baker put it, after evaluating several studies that compared litigated cases to hospital evaluations of medical error: “The vast majority of eligible patients do not sue. The idea that Americans are suit-happy, litigation-crazy, and ready to rumble in the courts is one of the more amazing myths of our time. It grows stronger with each piece of the by now overwhelming research showing that it is simply not true.”</span>
        <span style="color: #000000;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1945" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1945" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="color: #000000;">The frequently cited “evidence” for America’s supposed undue litigiousness tends to rely on unrepresentative examples—disputes that are too big for courts, disputes that are too small, and disputes that shouldn’t be disputes at all—or examples that have been made to look silly, but actually aren’t. </span>A textbook illustration involves the classic McDonald’s “hot coffee” case, which to most journalists served as an all-purpose indictment of the legal profession and legal process: An avaricious lawyer paraded a petty incident before an out-of-control jury and extracted an absurd recovery. Newspaper editorials, radio talk shows, and magazine commentaries replayed endless variations on the theme summarized by the national Chamber of Commerce: “Is it fair to get a couple of million dollars from a restaurant just because you spilled hot coffee on yourself?”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On closer examination, the question no longer looks rhetorical. The case which ignited such a media firestorm arose because on February 27, 1992, a seventy-nine-year-old woman named Stella Liebeck suffered acutely painful third-degree burns on her inner thighs when 180-degree coffee from McDonald’s spilled from a Styrofoam cup. As a result of the spill, Ms. Liebeck went into shock, spent eight days in the hospital, and received skin grafts. Only after McDonald’s refused to reimburse her medical expenses did she bring suit. At trial, jurors learned of 700 other burn cases involving McDonald’s coffee during the preceding decade. They also learned that, although medical experts had warned that such high temperatures were causing serious injuries, the corporation’s safety consultant had dismissed the complaints as “trivial.” In addition, at the time Liebeck initiated her suit, McDonald’s coffee was served hotter than that at comparable restaurants and a full thirty degrees hotter than the coffee brewed from home brewing machines. Physicians testified that, at the lower temperature of other restaurants’ coffee, Ms. Liebeck’s burns <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page870" class="pagebreak" title="870">870</span>would not have been nearly as severe. Further, although the jury’s award (of roughly $2.8 million) was large in some commentators’ eyes, the award was not arbitrary. The jury’s punitive damages award represented two days of coffee sales revenues, and the judge reduced the judgment to $640,000. To avoid an appeal, the plaintiff then settled the case for a smaller undisclosed sum.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ms. Liebeck brought her suit because, she said, “I want them to bring the temperature down so that other people will not go through the same thing I did<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>” Fulfilling her wish, apparently as a result of Ms. Liebeck’s actions, the lids of McDonald’s coffee cups began to carry the clear warning “Hot! Hot! Hot!,” and the temperature of the coffee sold in at least some McDonald’s restaurants dropped down to safe levels.<a id="_Ref34118438" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1946" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1946" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">That is not to discount the problem of meritless or vastly exaggerated damage claims and the personal and financial costs they impose. Yet as is clear from the discussion of the McDonald’s case, as well as the discussion of frivolous cases in Chapter 7, the boundary between vindictiveness and vindication is often difficult to draw, and disproportionate media coverage of large recoveries distorts public perceptions.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1947" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1947" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">A related concern is that American society in general and business in particular suffer from too much law, which is too complicated, too costly, and too often ineffective.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1948" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1948" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> Part of the concern about “too much law” relates to litigation’s expense. Over four-fifths of surveyed Americans believe that litigation is too costly. And it is true: Lawsuits are an undeniably expensive way to resolve disputes. According to the Federal Judicial Center, pursuing an action in federal court costs plaintiffs a median of $15,000, including attorneys’ fees.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1949" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1949" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> Other research shows defense costs are also high and climbing fast.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1950" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1950" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> These costs, typically called “transaction costs,” impose substantial burdens on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page871" class="pagebreak" title="871">871</span>plaintiffs and defendants alike. In automobile accident cases, for example, nearly 50 percent of the payments by insurance companies are consumed prior to reaching the plaintiff.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1951" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1951" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> In certain other tort cases, the transaction costs may be even higher, on the order of 60 percent.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1952" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1952" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> Such problems have sparked a wide variety of reform proposals, some of which are considered in the materials on nonlawyer services in Chapter 13, Market Regulation, and also in Section C below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the same time, part of the concern about “too much law” relates to that the view, shared by approximately two-thirds of Americans, that lawsuits are damaging the country’s economy.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1953" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1953" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> This belief is harder to validate. In assessing the concern, it is important to separate two related but distinct questions. First, are the total costs of legal liability a threat to American economic health? Second, do the total costs of legal liability outweigh the benefits?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although we lack reliable assessments of the total costs of civil liability, some informed calculations are available for the tort system. Most notably, a recent and sophisticated study by Professor Frank Cross, which relied on data collected by the Chamber of Commerce and the Pacific Research Institute, attempted to discern the relationship between substantive tort law and economic growth. Comparing the economic growth of states with particularly pro-defendant and particularly pro-plaintiff tort laws, Professor Cross concluded: “Contrary to conventional wisdom, the evidence shows no negative economic effects with more plaintiff-friendly tort law.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1954" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1954" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Pro-plaintiff tort laws, in other words, did not drag down state economies.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So too, many critics of the costs of legalization fail to acknowledge associated benefits. For example, commentators often complain that products cost too much or unnecessary medical tests are performed because of liability expenses. John Stossell in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> asserts that “every football helmet costs $100 more because of lawsuits,” and that some “financially strapped schools no longer have football programs.” “The kids play in the streets. Is that safer?,” Stossell wonders.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1955" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1955" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> But what he doesn’t wonder is how many students play other sports that are safer, or how many serious head injuries have been avoided due to helmet redesign. In commenting on the frequency of business litigation noted earlier, another <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> op-ed put the question: “Are these statistics a confirmation of America’s vicious, tail-chasing lawsuit crisis? Or are they a vote of high confidence in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page872" class="pagebreak" title="872">872</span>judicial system as a means of enforcing contracts, safeguarding intellectual property, and stopping fraud?”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1956" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1956" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A related concern about the expense of litigation is that undue risks of liability and excessive insurance premiums cause businesses not to distribute valuable products and, particularly in the medical sphere, force doctors to shift their practice locations, change their specialties, or order unnecessary tests. Yet, the extent of this problem is also overstated. In the medical malpractice realm, for example, only about 3 percent of doctors’ revenue goes to cover malpractice premiums, an amount not self-evidently excessive or likely to cause major career changes.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1957" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1957" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Further, though many believe that excessive malpractice liability causes physicians to flee particular states or curtail their practices, that, too, is not clear. Many researchers have attempted to discern a link between tort liability and physician supply, but, even after years of analysis, there is scant evidence that tort liability causes physicians to retire early, relocate, or restrict their practices.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1958" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1958" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> Likewise, though it does seem that “defensive medicine” (instances when physicians, concerned about liability, test or treat despite the lack of medical necessity) is widespread, physician conduct tends to be more affected by the perceived, as opposed to the real, liability risk.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1959" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1959" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> Finally, while product withdrawals have sometimes been a major problem, as in the case of Bendectin to alleviate morning sickness, in other instances litigation has resulted in the removal of major safety risks. Obvious examples include the tragedies prevented or mitigated because of litigation concerning Firestone Tires, flammable pajamas, cigarettes, opioids, faulty ignition switches on certain GM automobiles, and Dalkon Shield IUDs.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1960" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1960" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In cases involving social justice issues rather than product safety, determining whether litigation is cost-justified is doubly difficult, as any assessment requires complex and contested value judgments. As Professor Lawrence Friedman puts it: </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page873" class="pagebreak" title="873">873</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[T]he benefits [of legal claims] . . . , are often quite intangible and immeasurable: social justice, expanded opportunities for women and minorities, expansion of civil liberties, fair procedures within institutions, limits on government. Who would deny that these are significant gains? Whether they are worth the costs is a question that models and equations cannot answer.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1961" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1961" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Furthermore, to the extent we <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have “more” law now, as compared to previously—or in the United States, as compared to other industrialized societies—that is not necessarily a bad thing. Many believe that recent increases in the reach and volume of law reflect broader cultural needs. As societies become more technologically sophisticated and as patterns of life become more interdependent, the necessity of legal regulation becomes correspondingly greater. In many Western industrialized countries, improvements in the standard of living have led to increased expectations about the role of legal and governmental institutions in maintaining that standard. So, for example, industrial accidents, discriminatory and harassing conduct, and inadequacies in social services that were once accepted as a matter of course now prompt demands for remedial action. Throughout the last century, many societies have increased their expectations for what Professor Friedman calls “Total Justice.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1962" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1962" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> The sense is that individuals should be protected from an increasing array of harms and should be compensated for injuries and injustices that have not been prevented.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Additionally, as commentators since Alexis de Tocqueville have noted, the United States has always placed more reliance on law and courts to solve social problems than most other societies. Americans traditionally have distrusted centralized power and have checked its exercise through a system of privately initiated lawsuits and judicial review. This culture’s individualist ideology places a high priority on civil rights and liberties. Litigation offers protection for fundamental values such as freedom of speech, due process, privacy, religious liberty, and equal opportunity that are central to our cultural heritage. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Privately-financed lawsuits are also a financially attractive way to enforce public mandates and provide social safety nets without spending taxpayer dollars. Much of this nation’s environmental, antitrust, securities, consumer, intellectual property, anti-fraud, and antidiscrimination regulation and enforcement occurs, not via public bureaucracies (as it does elsewhere) or even through government-initiated litigation. It occurs, rather, through the decentralized, privately funded efforts of public interest attorneys and plaintiffs’ lawyers. The same can be said of important conservative victories in recent years, such as rollbacks of affirmative action and the establishment of constitutional <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page874" class="pagebreak" title="874">874</span>gun rights. As political scientist Robert Kagan notes, in the United States, “demands for total justice and regulatory protections have been filtered through a political culture that mistrusts ‘big’ government and resists high taxes . . . [and a] political system that lacks strong national law enforcement, regulatory, medical care and welfare bureaucracies.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1963" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1963" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In a society in which legal services are distributed through the private market, access to lawyers depends on one’s ability to pay. Because individuals’ ability to pay varies dramatically with income, those with more resources are able to afford more justice than those with fewer. Research has shown that big business tends to be the biggest consumer of legal services. In their famous study of Chicago lawyers, John Heinz and his colleagues found that large corporate clients consumed nearly one-third of total legal effort in 1995.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1964" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1964" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How do those without significant resources pay for lawyers? As we will discuss below, the United States (and other countries) has developed a variety of mechanisms to redistribute legal services to the “have-nots”—including state subsidies, fee-shifting, and pro bono (and low bono) service. But these mechanisms are widely viewed as insufficient in providing access to lawyers for all those at the bottom of the income scale (and many in the middle, too). Accordingly, access to justice proponents have also argued for changes in the market for legal services (reducing barriers so nonlawyers can provide legal advice) and the legal system (reducing complexity and bureaucracy) that could more effectively address the legal needs of low- and middle-income Americans. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In theory, access to justice is difficult to oppose. Most agree on the scope of the problem.

      <p class="TextParagraph">For over a half-century, the federal government has subsidized some lawyers to provide free representation to the poor in non-criminal matters. The federal Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the umbrella organization that supports free legal services to the poor by lawyers in neighborhood-based offices. As part of its mission, LSC conducts research to document the “justice gap”—that is, the gap between the legal needs of the poor and the availability of lawyers to meet those needs. The excerpt that follows details its most recent findings.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">9, 16, 21–22, 29–31, 41, 44 (2017).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The phrase “with liberty and justice for all” in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance represents the idea that everyone should have access to justice, not just those who can afford legal representation. In criminal cases, legal assistance is a right. Americans accused of a crime are appointed legal counsel if they cannot afford it. As a general matter, however, there is no right to counsel in civil matters. As a result, many low-income Americans “go it alone” without legal representation in disputes where they risk losing their job, their livelihood, their home, or their children, or seek a restraining order against an abuser. This “justice gap”—the difference between the civil legal needs of low-income Americans and the resources available to meet those needs—has stretched into a gulf. State courts across the country are overwhelmed with unrepresented litigants. In 2015, for example, an estimated 1.8 million people appeared in the New York State courts without a lawyer. And we know that 98% of tenants in eviction cases and 95% of parents in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page876" class="pagebreak" title="876">876</span>child support cases were unrepresented in these courts in 2013. Comparable numbers can be found in courts across the United States. This study explores the extent of the justice gap in 2017, describing the volume of civil legal needs faced by low-income Americans, assessing the extent to which they seek and receive help, and measuring the size of the gap between their civil legal needs and the resources available to address these needs. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A family income below 125% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) corresponds to $30,750 per year or less for a family of four. Based on recent estimates from the Census Bureau, nearly one in five Americans (19%) have family incomes below 125% of FPL. This comes to about 60 million people, including approximately 19 million children (0–17 years), 35 million adults aged 18–64 years old, and 6.4 million seniors (65+ years). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Seventy-one percent of low-income households have experienced at least one civil legal problem in the past year. Many of these households have had to deal with several issues. Indeed, more than half (54%) faced at least two civil legal problems and about one in four (24%) has faced six or more in the past year alone. The civil legal problems these Americans face are most often related to basic needs like getting access to health care, staying in their homes, and securing safe living conditions for their families. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[C]ivil legal problems related to health and to consumer and finance issues affect more households than any other type of issue. Health issues, for example, affect more than two in five (41%) low-income households. The most common problems in this area include having trouble with debt collection for health procedures (affecting 17% of households), having health insurance that would not cover medically needed care or medications (17%), and being billed incorrectly for medical services (14%). Over one-third (37%) of low-income households have experienced consumer and finance problems in the past year. These issues typically follow from not being able to make payments for debt or utilities on time. The most common issues in this area include difficulties with creditors or collection agencies (affecting 16% of households), having utilities disconnected due to nonpayment or a billing dispute (14%), and having problems buying or paying for a car, including repossession (8%). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Low-income Americans report seeking the help of a legal professional for only 20% of their problems. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Low-income Americans say they have received or expect to receive as much legal help as they need for 69% of the problems where they sought professional legal help. While this is a promising result, it is important to remember that they seek professional legal help for only 20% of their problems. Additionally, some respondents indicate that they tried to get professional legal help but were unable to do so. Taking all of this together, we find that low-income Americans receive inadequate or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page877" class="pagebreak" title="877">877</span>no professional legal help for 86% of their civil legal problems in a given year.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">People are most likely to seek professional legal help for problems related to children and custodial issues and wills and estates. Low-income Americans seek such help for 48% of their civil legal problems related to children and custody and for 39% of their problems related to wills and estates. Of all the civil legal problems . . . , the ones in these categories are more obviously “legal.” Issues relating to children and child custody, for example, usually have to be decided or approved by a judge. Similarly, issues dealing with wills and estates involve legal paperwork and often lawyers as well. While civil legal problems related to health issues and consumer and finance issues are the most commonly experienced problems among low-income Americans, they are not the problem areas most likely to get attention from a legal professional. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[P]eople seek professional legal help for only 18% of their civil legal problems related to consumer and finance and for only 11% of those related to health. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">People who seek the help of a legal professional rely on various sources. They most often turn to legal aid organizations (30% of problems), paid private attorneys (29%), and social or human services organizations (24%). They go to volunteer attorneys 11% of the time and to disability service providers 10% of the time. Finally, low-income Americans reach out for help through legal hotlines for 8% of their civil legal problems. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Low-income Americans do not seek professional legal help for 78% of the civil legal problems they face in a given year. When someone does not seek such help, they turn to other resources about half of the time (for 54% of problems for which professional legal help is not sought). They speak with others who are not legal professionals (commonly friends and family members) for 33% of these problems, search for information online for 13% of these problems, or take both of these actions for 8% of these problems. When people search for information online, they often search for legal information about procedures to resolve a specific civil legal problem, legal rights on specific issues, or how to get legal assistance<span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">. . . .</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 2017, LSC grantees will provide some form of legal assistance for an estimated 999,600, or 59%, of eligible problems presented by low-income Americans. . . . </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We find that between 62% and 72% of all eligible problems brought to LSC grantees either receive no legal assistance or receive a level of assistance that is not expected to fully address the client’s legal needs. That corresponds to an estimated 1.1 to 1.2 million eligible civil legal problems expected to go unserved or underserved in 2017 alone. The 62% figure underestimates the problems unserved or underserved. It treats “served, but extent pending” problems as being “served fully.” Conversely, the 72% figure is an overestimation, treating “served, but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page878" class="pagebreak" title="878">878</span>extent pending” problems as “served, but not fully.” In reality, the rate will fall somewhere in between. A lack of available resources accounts for the vast majority of eligible civil legal problems that go unserved or underserved. Civil legal problems that are unserved or underserved due to limited resources account for the vast majority of the problems that do not receive the assistance necessary to fully address the client’s needs. . . . Overall, we estimate that insufficient resources account for between 85% and 97% of all unserved or underserved eligible problems, representing 53% to 70% of all eligible problems. This corresponds to an estimated range of about 900,000 to 1.2 million problems for which the assistance necessary to meet the legal needs of low-income Americans cannot be provided due to a lack of resources. </p>
      <p class="Center3emDash">———</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other legal needs studies add texture to this general picture. In Rebecca Sandefur’s 2014 study for the American Bar Foundation of a random sample of Americans in a middle-sized city, she found:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[T]wo-thirds . . . reported experiencing at least one of 12 different categories of civil justice situations in the previous 18 months. For the whole sample, the average number of situations was 2.2. . . . The most commonly reported kinds of situations involved bread and butter issues with far-reaching impacts: problems with employment, money (finances, government benefits, debts), insurance and housing. Poor people were more likely to report civil justice situations than were middle-income or high-income people. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to report such situations than Whites.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">People reported that almost half (47%) of the civil justice situations they experienced resulted in a significant negative consequence such as feelings of fear, loss of income or confidence, damage to physical or mental health, or verbal or physical violence or threats of violence. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Typically people handled these situations on their own. For only about a fifth (22%) of situations did they seek assistance from a third party outside their immediate social network, such as a lawyer, social worker, police officer, city agency, religious leader or elected official. When people who did not seek any assistance from third parties outside their social circles were asked if cost was one barrier to doing so, they reported that concerns about cost were a factor in 17% of cases. A more important reason that people do not seek assistance with these situations, in particular assistance from lawyers or courts, is that they do not understand these situations to be legal.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1969" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1969" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page879" class="pagebreak" title="879">879</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Many experts believe that legal needs studies understate the total problem. Most surveys do not include accidental injuries that the contingent fee system leaves unaddressed.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1970" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1970" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>These surveys also leave out collective problems with which public interest groups are concerned (e.g., environmental risks, consumer safety protections, school financing, or voting rights). A focus only on individual grievances can deflect attention from the structural forces that may prevent larger problems’ recognition and redress.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These surveys also raise broader questions about how much “naming, blaming, and claiming” we want to encourage and how much we are prepared to invest in that enterprise.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1971" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1971" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span> Sandefur argues that because most justice problems do not actually present “legal needs” (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>., they do not require lawyers and the legal system to resolve), the focus on expanding access to lawyers is misplaced: </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="TextParagraph">Focusing on existing programs that deliver legal services and on court cases will never provide a picture of all of the other civil justice activity that never makes it to the justice system—and that is the majority of civil justice activity. Practically speaking, it would be impossible for the nation’s existing courts, administrative agencies, and other forums that resolve disputes to process the estimated more than one hundred million justice problems that Americans experience every year. There is no reason to want them to.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1972" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1972" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">As this suggests, although there is broad agreement that the quality of justice one receives should not depend on his or her ability to pay, there is little consensus on an alternative. Although some commentators argue for “equal access,” such claims raise the question R. H. Tawney once posed about equal opportunity generally: It is unclear what would terrify supporters more, “the denial of the principle or the attempt to apply it.” Given the broad range of problems that could be considered legal, and the wide disparity of skills among lawyers, any serious attempt to equalize access would require massive public subsidies. More modest demands to expand, if not fully equalize, access usually skirt the sticky points. How much are we prepared to pay? How do legal services compare with other demands on our collective resources? As Marc Galanter has questioned, “is the utopia of access to justice a condition in which all disputes are fully adjudicated?”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1973" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1973" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 22.5pt;" class="TextParagraph">Moreover, access to the justice system will not necessarily bring disadvantaged parties closer to justice in a substantive sense. “Poor <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page880" class="pagebreak" title="880">880</span>peoples’ courts” that handle family, landlord/tenant, small claims, and minor criminal proceedings are often overburdened and understaffed.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1974" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1974" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> And in many contexts, the “haves” are often <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> likely to come out ahead, given other advantages apart from lawyers, such as the resources to take risks, tolerate delay, structure transactions in light of potential disputes, and lobby for the reversal of unfavorable legal decisions.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1975" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1975" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Consider Richard Abel’s arguments for equalizing the distribution of legal services, which is followed by David Luban’s analysis of equal justice under law. Is that ideal a realistic societal aspiration? What would be its policy implications? Can it even be defined?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc451861723" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219270" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756674" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908808" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Richard L. Abel, “Legal Services”</p>
      <p class="FileLine">Handbook of Applied Sociology 417–21 (M. Micklin &amp; M. Olsen, eds., 1981).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Equality in the distribution of legal services has a value beyond that of enhancing the welfare of the unrepresented or underrepresented. The very integrity of the U.S. legal system as an adversary system depends upon equal representation of all parties. The legitimacy of contemporary law rests on the assumption that optimally efficient allocations of scarce resources are produced by parties who freely negotiate with each other on the basis of equal information about the law and equal competence to use it. The adversarial model of litigation—whether in a civil action or a criminal prosecution—is grounded upon the belief that factual truth and fidelity to substantive and procedural rules are best achieved by partisan struggle between equal opponents, which at a minimum means opponents who are equally represented. Moreover, the theory of democratic pluralism assumes that all citizens are equally able to influence the making and application of laws. Given the influence of lawyers in U.S. politics, that assumption requires equal representation by lawyers before both the legislature and the executive at all levels of government.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics will argue that access to justice is a concept with no real meaning because the level of access to lawyers that justice requires is impossible to specify. Does access mean every nonfrivolous litigable case should have a lawyer funded by the government? Such a notion raises two problems. First, it implies a higher level of access than even the wealthiest purchasers of legal services enjoy. Even wealthy clients have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page881" class="pagebreak" title="881">881</span>limited budgets and must pick and choose which cases to litigate. Second, the concept of a “litigable case” is inherently indeterminate. The point at which a dispute breaks through from the informal to the formal legal system depends in part on the cost of legal services; no dispute is intrinsically litigable or not. If lawyers were cost-free, then perhaps even extremely trivial disputes would migrate into the formal system. This hardly seems like a desirable state of affairs. Increasing the supply of free lawyers would undoubtedly drive up demand, so “access to justice” becomes a receding target.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Perhaps “access” ideally entails that every cost beneficial case should have a lawyer. Here, too, the concept is indeterminate: whether a case is cost beneficial depends on how expensive a lawyer is. Maybe a better approach is that every case that would be cost beneficial for a litigant to bring if the lawyer were charging normal market rates should have a lawyer. But this neglects the possibility that although the litigation is cost beneficial to the plaintiff, the total social costs of providing formal justice outweigh the benefit. Alternatively, access to justice could be defined in terms of access for any matter that concerns a significant interest of the litigant. This, however, seems too restrictive: surely, poor people should be able to use the formal system to redress grievances even if they do not involve major rights violations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The definitional questions become even more vexing once we realize that lawyers can be useful for many law-related problems that do not involve litigation. A great many poor person’s problems can be solved by a legally knowledgeable, articulate person making a few phone calls. But if the criterion of access means that everyone can obtain legal services whenever the services would be useful, we confront the fact that a good lawyer is an extremely useful person: a good lawyer is shrewd, adept at navigating the waters of institutional life, and prudent. Most of us could use one almost all the time, and this ideal of full access raises the nightmarish vision of everyone with their own personal general counsel accompanying them through daily life.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The conclusion of these arguments is that the ideal of access to justice—embodied most famously in the motto “Equal Justice Under Law” emblazoned on the Supreme Court building—threatens to land us on unacceptable slippery slopes under even the most plausible interpretations. But it is possible to cut those Gordian knots. Even if precise specification of equal justice under law eludes us, we know what equal justice is not. Creating legal institutions that can be navigated only by people with lawyers violates any meaningful interpretation of “equal justice under law” if large segments of the population cannot obtain a lawyer. Because lawyers are expensive, market-based distribution of legal services would exclude at least forty million people from access to legal institutions, and it follows that market-based distribution of legal services violates the equal-access ideal. . . . Our current system of subsidized legal services for the poor, however, is nearly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page882" class="pagebreak" title="882">882</span>indistinguishable from market-based distribution: it leaves 95 percent of poor people’s legal needs unaddressed. . . . Whatever the definition of access to justice turns out to be, we are nowhere near it. And so any cutback or restriction in legal services from the little we do now represents a step in the wrong direction.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is your view on the distribution of legal services? Does the adversary system presuppose that all parties have access to effective assistance of counsel? What, if any, reforms would you propose?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many more people take no action in response to legal problems in this country, as compared to the citizens of other comparable nations. For example, one survey reported that, in the United States, 38 percent of poor and 26 percent of middle-income individuals took no action in response to a legal problem, compared with 5 percent in England and 10 percent in the Netherlands.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1976" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1976" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> Why do you suppose that is? How does that fact comport with the view of the United States as an “overlawyered” society?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does the ideal of access to justice have a determinate meaning? In its 2009 study of legal needs, the LSC stated that “[a]s a first, critical goal, there must be enough funding to serve all of those currently seeking help from LSC-funded programs. This requires a doubling of LSC funds and a doubling of the state, local and private funds that also support LSC grantees. The long-term goal must be to develop resources sufficient to meet the civil legal needs of all eligible low-income persons.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1977" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1977" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Would that recommendation meet the standard endorsed by Luban or Abel?

      <p class="TextParagraph">The unequal distribution of legal services, discussed above, exists alongside a long-discussed but much-contested right to legal services, at least for certain problems. It is this right to legal services we now explore.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In this country, demands for access to legal assistance have drawn on a number of constitutional provisions: the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel for criminal defendants, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process clauses, and the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under early English common law, defendants in felony prosecutions (except for treason) were not allowed to have legal representation at trial. The Sixth Amendment was intended to eliminate that prohibition in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page884" class="pagebreak" title="884">884</span>federal cases; twelve of the original thirteen states also eliminated it in their courts. It was not, however, until the mid-20th century that courts began interpreting constitutional guarantees to <span style="font-style: italic;">require</span> counsel for criminal defendants who could not afford it. Prior to that, some federal and state statutes authorized appointment of counsel in capital trials, and courts sometimes asserted inherent authority to appoint counsel with or without compensation in other felony cases. But such appointments often occurred only after arraignment, when 70 to 80 percent of defendants had already pleaded guilty and others had made incriminating statements to the police.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1981" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1981" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the 1930s, the inadequacies of this system began to attract greater judicial concern. In the notorious Scottsboro case, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of two indigent black defendants who were accused of raping white women and afforded only pro forma legal representation. The Court reasoned that a state’s failure to provide adequate legal assistance could violate the due process clause under certain circumstances. Writing for the majority, Justice Sutherland noted that the “right to be heard would in many cases be of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.” <a id="dabmci_968bcd798bb24aa4bd44223f381b1d58" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Powell v. Alabama</span>, 287 U.S. 45, 68–69 (1932). Several years later, the Court interpreted the Sixth Amendment to mandate counsel for indigent defendants in federal criminal cases. <a id="dabmci_a183f1db73f5471a89f7520afb180097" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson v. Zerbst</span>, 304 U.S. 458 (1938).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Over the next several decades, the Court overturned a number of state court convictions on due process grounds where defense attorneys were not provided and where the proceedings were complicated, the penalties were severe, or the defendants were particularly ill-equipped to represent themselves due to youth, illiteracy, or unfamiliarity with the English language. Under <a id="dabmci_0e67b006f5ed4eec9026f54ae44d01fc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Betts v. Brady</span>, 316 U.S. 455, 462 (1942), the test was whether “fundamental fairness” demanded counsel’s assistance. Finally, in 1963, in response to a prisoner’s handwritten <span style="font-style: italic;">in forma pauperis</span> petition, the Supreme Court held that any indigent defendant in a state felony proceeding was entitled to an attorney. <a id="dabmci_0433d5b2269e40c9a4bf6b7da47db361" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Gideon v. Wainwright</span>, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963). It seemed an “obvious truth” that the ideal of insuring that “every defendant stands equal before the law . . . cannot be realized if the poor man charged with a crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.” The Court subsequently extended the guarantee of court-appointed counsel to juveniles, <span style="font-style: italic;">In re </span><a id="dabmci_a08919be309349caa05c50596bf0d2b3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Gault</span>, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), and to defendants charged with misdemeanors or given suspended sentences if the ultimate disposition could result in incarceration, <a id="dabmci_f7de639a306947d9bb3b5939a165f176" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Argersinger v.

Shelton</span>, 535 U.S. 654 (2002). In other proceedings involving the possibility of imprisonment, such as probation revocation hearings, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page885" class="pagebreak" title="885">885</span>Court left decisions about appointment of counsel to be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Under those standards, a majority of Justices found no reversible error because, the Court concluded, the assistance of counsel would not have made a “determinable difference.” Given the state’s strong factual case and the absence of “troublesome” issues of law, the failure to provide a lawyer did not make the procedure “fundamentally unfair.” <a id="dabmci_88c49b75ea4d41fc8c411bbd2a754877" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 32, 33.</p>

Rogers</span>, 564 U.S. 431 (2011), the Supreme Court held that counsel was not constitutionally required for civil contempt proceedings that resulted in imprisonment. The case involved an indigent father, Michael Turner, who was held in contempt five times for non-compliance with support obligations. On the fifth occasion, at which the mother and father were both unrepresented by counsel, the judge asked Turner if there was anything he wanted to say about why he was still $5,728.76 behind in his payments. Turner responded that, of his $50-a-week support order, he had tried to pay “a little bit here and there” but had gotten “back on dope,” and then was laid up for two months with a broken back. At the time of the hearing, he was “off the dope” and apologetic for his past conduct. He concluded: “I just hope you give me a chance. I don’t know what else to say. I mean, I know I done wrong and I should have been paying and helping her and I’m sorry.” <a id="dabmci_8c475ae4943e4ddd8576ebd20697db21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 437. The judge found Turner to be in “willful contempt” and sentenced him to twelve months in the local detention center unless he was able to pay. While serving his sentence, Turner appealed with the help of a pro bono lawyer and claimed that he been unconstitutionally denied a right to counsel.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Writing for himself and four other Justices (Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan), Justice Breyer applied the framework of <a id="dabmci_d3e3933db31145dfbd324e0082b673b2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page886" class="pagebreak" title="886">886</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Mathews</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">v. Eldridge</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Lassiter </span>to determine what due process required. In the majority’s view, the nature of the “private interest that will be affected” militated strongly in favor of counsel because of the “loss of personal liberty” that was at stake. <a id="dabmci_e17315aed28c40d69f0fc6e669ca30af" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 445. However, two other factors—the risk of an erroneous decision and the nature of countervailing interests—cut against. In particular, the Court reasoned that the risk of error could be minimized by alternative procedural safeguards such as:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to statements and questions about his financial status . . . ; and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><a id="dabmci_c326a46a15d7423391038ce37d72b1a2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 447–48. The majority also emphasized a countervailing interest in avoiding an “asymmetry of representation” that would occur if the defendant had counsel, but the mother did not. That could “make the proceedings less fair overall, increasing the risk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family of the support it is entitled to receive.” <a id="dabmci_2a80ff03638f45e8a6c842c2db47158e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 447.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In balancing these interests, the Court held that, in general, the “Due Process Clause does not <span style="font-style: italic;">automatically</span> require the provision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent individual who is the subject of a child support order.” <a id="dabmci_df086d88b4c44f50bfdc3749f78e2002" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 448. However, in the absence of counsel, the Court ruled, the state must provide alternative procedures that ensure a “fundamentally fair” determination of the critical questions at issue. On the facts of Turner’s specific case, the Court held that, because Turner had neither counsel nor the benefit of an alternative procedure, and the lower court did not make specific findings about his ability to pay, his incarceration violated due process.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Responses to the decision were mixed. Some were highly critical. Georgetown Professor Peter Edelman, who chaired the District of Columbia’s Access to Justice Commission, told the <span style="font-style: italic;">ABA Journal</span>, “I don’t think the Court understands what it’s like to go into court without a lawyer. It would be good for the whole lot of them to go spend the day in landlord-tenant court and see if they have the same view.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1982" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1982" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> By contrast, Professor Benjamin Barton believed that it was “helpful that the court recognized that a lawyer is not the solution to every civil problem,” and that alternative procedures might be more cost effective.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1983" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1983" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court’s unwillingness to recognize a right to counsel in civil matters has attracted criticism on several grounds. One line of critique <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page887" class="pagebreak" title="887">887</span>challenges the results in cases such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Lassiter</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Turner </span>under the Court’s own analytical framework. From this perspective, the rationale for subsidized legal assistance seems particularly strong in cases like <span style="font-style: italic;">Lassiter</span>, where crucial interests are at issue, legal standards are imprecise and subjective, proceedings are formal and adversarial, and resources between the parties are grossly imbalanced.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1984" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1984" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Some commentators have argued for the broader recognition of a right to counsel in civil cases affecting fundamental rights. Under this line of analysis, access to legal assistance is necessary for access to the legal system; access to the legal system is necessary to realize equality before the law; and equality before the law is necessary to the legitimacy of our form of government.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1985" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1985" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> As the Supreme Court has itself recognized, the right to “sue and defend” is a right “conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government.” <a id="dabmci_6603725a45ef44018b1cf116a5b59357" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Chambers v.

In 2016, California put into force a 2009 state law establishing publicly funded counsel for poor litigants in cases about housing, child custody, conservatorship, and guardianship. In 2016, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that parents have a right to counsel in adoption cases. . . . By 2018, eighteen right-to-counsel bills had been acted in fourteen states, and an additional eighty-four were pending in Congress and state legislatures.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1991" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1991" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, some commentators have expressed concerns about the movement’s aims.<a id="_Ref34145975" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1992" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1992" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span> Could the right to counsel be kept within economically manageable limits? In a country that has declined to ensure adequate housing or health care for all its residents, should law be a higher priority? Suppose parties had a right to counsel, but, as is true in indigent criminal defense, legal assistance programs had nowhere close to adequate funding? Under such circumstances, if clients were unwilling to accept quick settlements, the programs would be unable to provide meaningful representation. As the history of legal services here and abroad makes clear, a right to legal counsel coupled with inadequate resources for implementation produce the illusion rather than the reality of effective assistance.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In response to such concerns, some commentators have noted that many European nations have recognized rights to legal services that are limited through eligibility criteria, sliding fee scales, and restrictions on fees recoverable by subsidized counsel. As discussion in Section C, Part 2 notes, legal aid programs in this country also screen cases to stay within their limited budgets. Similar standards could be established for a broadened right to civil legal assistance, or at least a right in certain categories of civil cases where crucial interests are at issue and the claimant has a reasonable chance of prevailing. </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is your view of <span style="font-style: italic;">Turner v. Rogers</span>? If alternative procedures had been available, how effectively could defendants like Turner represent themselves? In establishing priorities for allocating free legal assistance, should lawyers consider the potential unfairness of having only one party aided by counsel?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page889" class="pagebreak" title="889">889</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Would you support a Civil <span style="font-style: italic;">Gideon</span>? If so, how would you define the types of proceedings in which counsel would be required? The ABA called for a right to counsel to protect “basic human needs.” How should that term be defined? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How much would it cost to fulfill the right to counsel? Brito states that the “ABA estimates that a right to civil counsel when basic human needs are at stake would cost approximately $4.2 billion in current dollars, or about 1.5 percent of total U.S. expenditures on lawyers.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1993" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1993" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> On the other side of the equation, however, many studies suggest that providing attorneys for poor people can actually <span style="font-style: italic;">save</span> money by preventing legally-induced harms that force people to turn to public assistance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1994" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1994" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span> Along these lines, the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel estimated that the New York City law requiring counsel for indigent persons in housing cases would save $320 million through reduction in shelter expenses and avoidance of homelessness-related expenditures involving law enforcement and emergency medical care.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1995" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1995" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> Other studies have similarly found that investments in counsel yield positive economic returns by reducing costs associated with homelessness and domestic violence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1996" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1996" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> If the evidence shows that providing counsel is a cost-effective investment, why don’t more jurisdictions do it? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Even if there is a positive return on investment, providing lawyers to those in need would require a substantial up-front cost. How should that cost be financed? Recommendations include: raising court filing fees with exemptions for low-income litigants; dedicating unclaimed payments from class action recoveries; and authorizing courts to impose financial penalties on defendants found liable for certain categories of consumer fraud or other misconduct. Other possibilities include imposing a “pay or play tax” on law firms that do not meet pro bono targets, or levying fines on lawyers for disciplinary violations.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1997" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1997" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span> Would you support any of these proposals? How politically feasible are they? Are there other ways to finance the right to counsel? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As the <span style="font-style: italic;">Turner</span> Court suggests, the debate surrounding individuals’ right to counsel is in part a debate about the degree to which having legal assistance affects case outcomes. On this issue, the evidence is mixed. As discussed above, most people with legal problems do not take them to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page890" class="pagebreak" title="890">890</span>lawyers, and even when cases do go to court, many people appear pro se.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1998" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1998" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> Represented litigants are more likely to win, but “the observed difference in case outcomes between attorney-represented and unrepresented members of the public varies widely across different kinds of civil justice problems and different studies of lawyers’ impact.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1999" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1999" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">In a series of randomized trials, a team of researchers tried to empirically assess the impact of representation in different contexts. One much-discussed study tracked persons seeking assistance from the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau (HLAB) in their appeals of initial rulings that they were ineligible for unemployment insurance. In this study, one group of claimants was offered representation by HLAB, while a control group was not. Surprisingly, the authors found that “an offer of HLAB representation had no statistically significant effect on the probability that a claimant would prevail, but . . . the offer did delay the adjudicatory process.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2000" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2000" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span> By contrast, a study of eviction proceedings in state court found that represented clients prevailed twice as often as those merely provided with self-help training.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2001" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2001" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> Yet a third study of eviction proceedings in housing court found little difference in outcome between clients with truncated legal representation and those receiving full representation.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2002" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2002" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> In all these studies, the researchers were unable to conclusively identify what caused the results. They argued strongly, however, that randomized trials of the kind they used to conduct these studies are the only reliable method for evaluating legal aid programs, and that evaluations using less rigorous methods are nearly worthless.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you think it would be sound policy to discontinue subsidies for legal representation in unemployment insurance appeals cases based on the results of the first HLAB study? Should funders tie support of legal services organizations to rigorous outcome studies? Such studies are costly and difficult to conduct, and for understandable (though not especially laudable) reasons, some organizations have refused to allow outsiders to conduct randomized studies of their effectiveness. Randomized studies also have their own problems that critics have suggested undermine their utility. In particular, since they only measure the impact of an <span style="font-style: italic;">offer</span> of legal representation, they do not account for the fact that many of those turned away in the randomized trial end up finding a lawyer elsewhere—thus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page891" class="pagebreak" title="891">891</span>confounding evaluation of outcomes. In light of the difficulty of empirical evaluation of lawyer impact, what should policymakers do?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Although efforts to establish a right to legal counsel in civil cases have been unsuccessful thus far, there has been a long tradition of philanthropic and governmental support for providing free legal services to the poor.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2003" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2003" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> By the turn of the 20th century, legal assistance programs were operating in about half-a-dozen cities, with funding from private charity and municipal subsidies. Program leaders generally viewed their mission as promoting social stability rather than social change. By demonstrating that justice was accessible through established means, many legal aid supporters hoped to undercut support for socialism, anarchism, and other left political movements. Efforts to attract funding, however, met with limited success. In 1919, Reginald Heber Smith’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Justice and the Poor</span> reported a total of some forty organizations throughout the country, with only sixty-two full-time attorneys and a combined budget of less than $200,000. Many programs also had highly restrictive policies. Only the “deserving poor” were eligible for assistance and only for what lawyers considered “deserving” cases.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2004" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2004" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ABA subsequently appointed Smith to head its Standing Committee on Legal Aid, which began providing modest assistance to local offices. Bar leaders supported assistance on the grounds that it reassured the public of the fairness of legal institutions and increased respect for lawyers. However, many leaders also opposed substantial government funding because of concerns about the “socialization” of legal practice. By 1963, some 250 offices were providing civil legal services with a combined annual budget that amounted to less than two-tenths of one percent of the nation’s total annual expenditures for legal services and funded only 400 lawyers, about one for every 120,000 poor Americans.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2005" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2005" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">With the Johnson Administration’s War on Poverty came a major influx of governmental aid and a new reformist vision. In 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) began allocating the first federal funds for civil legal assistance programs, and a cadre of lawyers joined their staffs. In addition to traditional services, OEO programs encouraged a focus on law reform and political organizing. The consequences were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page892" class="pagebreak" title="892">892</span>quickly apparent, as legal aid offices achieved significant victories on consumer, welfare, housing, health, and related issues.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These victories, however, triggered a political backlash. Unhappy with its law reform efforts, the Nixon administration sought to dismantle the federal program. While it did not wholly succeed, it did manage to significantly restrict its activities. To provide greater political insulation for poverty law offices, Congress in 1974 established the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), with board members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. To gain support from critics, the authorizing legislation prohibited Corporation-funded attorneys from engaging in lobbying, political organizing, and representation in certain controversial areas such as school desegregation, abortion, and military service. Under the new LSC charter, earlier OEO rhetoric of “law reform” and “social change” was also absent; emphasis had shifted to the more neutral goal of enhancing “access to justice.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Further restrictions followed. The Reagan administration failed in its initial efforts to dissolve LSC, but subsequently succeeded in reducing its budget and restricting its permissible activities. Recipients of government funds could not, for example, represent most unauthorized immigrants, pursue cases involving gay rights, or initiate class actions except under very limited circumstances.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Beginning in the mid-1990s, the LSC also mandated that legal services programs must engage in a process of statewide planning to develop a comprehensive, integrated delivery system. Longstanding programs were no longer presumptively entitled to renewal of their funding. Rather, the LSC invited competitive bids and evaluated candidates based on their capacity to maximize access of eligible clients to timely, effective, and appropriate legal services.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2006" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2006" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 1996, Congress again restricted the LSC’s activities and reduced its budget by about a third to under $300 million. Among the most controversial of the 1996 restrictions Congress imposed on LSC funding recipients are set out below.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One important but subtle point about the restrictions set forth in § 504(a), excerpted above, is that they do not simply forbid legal services providers from using LSC funds for prohibited activities. By its terms, § 504(a) prevents organizations engaging in these activities from receiving LSC funds, and thus, in effect, prohibits recipients of LSC grants from engaging in prohibited activities even if they use funds from non-LSC sources (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, individual donations, foundation grants, or state and local government funds). This restriction is known as the “program integrity” rule.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the wake of the 1996 Act, a number of lawsuits were filed challenging many of its restrictions. <a id="dabmci_d7080137e15e4828bcf23a8efa78bf19" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez</span>, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), was brought by lawyers working for New York City LSC grant recipients, their clients, and contributors to their organizations. The plaintiffs challenged various restrictions, including <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page894" class="pagebreak" title="894">894</span>the program integrity rules, on due process and First Amendment grounds. They argued that the restrictions unduly burdened the lawyer-client relationship and that they imposed unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of LSC grants. Finally, they challenged some of the restrictions by arguing that they discriminated against certain lawyer speech based on viewpoint. The court of appeals rejected all the challenges except the last one. While the court upheld the restriction on welfare-reform activities, because it banned lobbying and reform litigation on any side of the issue (and thus was viewpoint neutral), it struck down one provision of subsection (a)(16) that was “inescapably viewpoint-biased.” That provision permitted representation of welfare claims in suits for benefits only if they did not challenge a rule that led to the denial of benefits. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed in a 5–4 decision. In its decision, the Court stated: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The LSC and the United States . . . in effect ask us to permit Congress to define the scope of the litigation it funds to exclude certain vital theories and ideas. The attempted restriction is designed to insulate the Government’s interpretation of the Constitution from judicial challenge. The Constitution does not permit the Government to confine litigants and their attorneys in this manner. We must be vigilant when Congress imposes rules and conditions which in effect insulate its own laws from legitimate judicial challenge. Where private speech is involved, even Congress’ antecedent funding decision cannot be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the government’s own interest.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although the court of appeals in <span style="font-style: italic;">Velazquez</span> invalidated one funding restriction, dealing with welfare reform, it upheld the other restrictions, and legal aid grantees did not appeal that ruling. The Ninth Circuit rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the “program integrity” rules in <a id="dabmci_defd2af9dd394ac998d95d1e8a8a10db" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Legal Aid Society of Hawaii v.

As stated above, the program integrity rules require LSC-funded organizations to maintain physical and financial separation from any “legally separate entity” pursuing activities prohibited by LSC regulations—essentially requiring legal aid organizations to maintain two offices, one funded by the LSC and the other with non-LSC funds. The question presented in the Hawaii case was whether those rules were unconstitutional conditions in violation of <a id="dabmci_ce8e18f075c144399c7998bfd8967072" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Rust v.

Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Rust v. Sullivan</span>, 500 U.S. 173 (1991). <span style="font-style: italic;">Rust</span> involved a challenge to federal regulations forbidding medical providers who received federal funds from counseling patients about abortion. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Rust</span> Court held that these regulations did not impose unconstitutional conditions on receipt of the funds, because Congress may legitimately refuse to use federal funds to advocate or promote abortion. Similarly, in the Hawaii case, the court concluded that there was no constitutional violation because a legal services group was “not compelled to accept a subsidy from the LSC.” <a id="dabmci_01557b65d55f4a7bbf64d18cd0c654a8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />145 F.3d at 1028. Therefore, any problems the restrictions caused for an LSC-funded attorney were a “<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">consequence of that attorney’s decision to accept full-time employment with a LSC funded organization. If an attorney wishes to engage in prohibited activities, the attorney could work part-time at an unrestricted organization in certain circumstances or engage on his own time in restricted activities that do not involve the outside practice of law, such as lobbying.” </span><a id="dabmci_eee483854478495ebe16921cc0c88426" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Id</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">. at 1029</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">. </span></p>

        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Does it seem right to you that lawyers should have to go to these lengths to work around the restrictions? The alternative would be to permit an LSC-funded organization to maintain one office but ensure that lawyers only engage in non-LSC activities with earmarked non-LSC funds. Would this be feasible? </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The program integrity restriction, in fact, led some recipients to split their organizations; one part continues to receive LSC funds while the other part declines the funds in order to engage in restricted activities. The result has been that these offices purchase duplicate equipment and hire duplicate staff, with less money available to serve clients.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2011" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2011" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a> </span>Are such restrictions justified? Why or why not? </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Critics of the decisions sustaining the LSC restrictions raise several concerns:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">It is, of course, true that legal aid clients are no worse off as a result of the restrictions than they would have been if the government had never provided funding. But that is often true in cases where the Supreme Court has found unconstitutional conditions; the point of the doctrine is to require the government to respect constitutional rights if it chooses to provide assistance. Once Congress decides to subsidize certain attorney-client relationships, it should not be permitted to undermine their effectiveness. Foreclosing strategies like class actions, requests for attorneys’ fees, or legislative advocacy often has that effect. In many jurisdictions, no non-federally funded organizations are available to pursue restricted activities.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Moreover, contrary to courts’ implication, the attorney-client relationship has long been recognized to serve crucial First Amendment values of expression and association. Current LSC restrictions undercut those values and compromise lawyers’ ethical obligations to serve their clients’ best interests. For example, it is generally advantageous for plaintiffs with similar claims to pursue them as class actions, since such collective efforts offer broader relief, higher stakes and visibility, and generate greater bargaining leverage. By foreclosing such strategies, LSC restrictions impair lawyers’ ethical obligations to provide effective representation and to exercise independent professional judgment about what that representation requires.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2012" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2012" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree? How might defenders of the restrictions respond?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Do the above limits undermine ethical representation by LSC recipients? Do any of these restrictions raise constitutional concerns analogous to those underlying the Supreme Court’s ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Velazquez</span>? Consider the following issues.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Section 504(a)(7) forbids LSC recipients from filing class actions, even if they believe that a class action will best serve the interests of their clients. Does this place recipients in violation of any ethical rules, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element107" />Rule 1.8(f)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.8(f)&quot; \s &quot;1.8(f)&quot; \c 16 " />: “A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless . . . (1) the client gives informed consent; [and] (2) there is no interference with the lawyer’s independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship . . . ”;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: disc; text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span id="Element108" />Rule 5.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.4(c)&quot; \s &quot;5.4(c)&quot; \c 16 " />: “A lawyer shall not permit a person who . . . employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer’s professional judgment in rendering such legal services”?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Alternatively, does Rule 1.2 permit LSC lawyers to limit the scope of representation in accordance with the federal restrictions? Rule 1.2(c) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page897" class="pagebreak" title="897">897</span>provides that a “lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent.” When would client consent to the restrictions be necessary? If low-income clients have no alternative source of legal assistance, how meaningful is their consent? Would these ethical rules even apply, given that the federal legislation prohibits LSC-funded lawyers from taking on certain types of cases in the first instance?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">While the legislation imposing the 1996 restrictions was pending, the ABA issued a Formal Opinion discussing the ethical issues they raise. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> <a id="dabmci_5a5e638bd1f540c38a6a7cb490de6bb3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Formal Opinion 96–399 (1996). The Opinion concluded that legal services lawyers must significantly limit their representation, withdrawing from some cases, declining others, or warning potential clients, in order to maintain their federal funding, but that none of these limitations violates the Model Rules. Do you agree with this assessment?<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2013" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2013" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Legal aid attorneys inevitably confront a dilemma both in the initial selection of cases and in the determination of how much time and expense should be spent on any particular matter. On the one hand, to limit client assistance to only predefined “targeted” areas identified by the program is to ignore the immediate, personal aspects of the lawyer-client relationship that are basic to providing legal or any other social service. On the other hand, to provide full representation for each client would require either a staggering increase in available legal services or a system of triage in which most will go without service in order that a few may get what they need.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2014" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2014" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span> How should this tradeoff be resolved? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In a classic article, Professor Stephen Wexler argued:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Poor people are not just like rich people without money. . . . In so far as the law is concerned, [financially secure individuals] lead harmonious and settled private lives. . . . Poor people do not lead settled lives into which the law seldom intrudes; they are constantly involved with the law in its most intrusive forms. For instance, poor people must go to government officials for many of the things which not-poor people get privately. . . . [P]oor people are always bumping into sharp legal things. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Poverty will not be stopped by people who are not poor. . . . And poor people can stop poverty only if they work at it together. The lawyer who wants to serve poor people must put his skills to the task of helping poor people organize themselves. . . . If all the lawyers in the country worked full time, they could not deal with even the articulated legal problems of the poor. And even if <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page898" class="pagebreak" title="898">898</span>somehow lawyers could deal with those articulated problems, they would not change very much the tangle of unarticulated legal troubles in which poor people live.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2015" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2015" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">In addition to organizing the poor, Wexler advocates informing them of their legal rights, and training lay advocates. Do you agree? If Wexler is right, what follows from his analysis about the structure of civil legal aid programs?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Picking up on the points made by Wexler, some commentators have questioned legal aid’s quality of representation and its strategies for client involvement and empowerment. In their view, the landmark litigation victories that many lawyers seek may have little concrete effect, given the post-judgment power relations of the parties, the difficulties of enforcement, and the possibility of legislative reversal. Research on poverty lawyering has also identified problems of professional dominance that disempower clients, particularly when advocates are of different class, race, and ethnic backgrounds. As Anthony Alfieri puts it: “What do progressive lawyers give to subordinated people? The conventional answer is rights. . . . What do progressive lawyers take from subordinated people? The answer is dignity: the values of independent action and speech.”<a id="_Ref34146290" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2016" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2016" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In response to concerns about the undue dominance of lawyers, supporters of legal aid argue it is not clear that poverty lawyers are any more disempowering than nonlawyer organizers or other representatives who claim to speak on behalf of marginalized groups.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2017" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2017" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span> To mitigate the potential for disempowerment, legal aid proponents recommend that poverty lawyers should target their resources and give priority to widely shared problems and collaborative, community-based responses. Clients should also have a meaningful voice in decisions about the allocation of resources, and programs should engage in systematic evaluation of their cost-effectiveness.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2018" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2018" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span> By focusing on educational projects, self-help assistance, and aid to local organizations, legal services offices also can aid low-income groups not only in resolving individual problems but also in developing skills to address the structural causes of poverty.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Unless and until legal assistance is more widely available, are changes needed in adversarial norms? For example, should ethical codes include provisions such as those appearing in an earlier draft of the Model Rules that would have prohibited lawyers appearing against pro se opponents from “unfairly exploiting . . . ignorance of the law or the practices of the tribunal,” and “procur[ing] an unconscionable result”?<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2019" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2019" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span> After vigorous bar opposition, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page899" class="pagebreak" title="899">899</span>that provision was replaced with requirements in Rule 4.3 that lawyers dealing with an unrepresented adversary simply avoid implications that they are disinterested and make reasonable efforts to correct misunderstandings concerning their role. Are such requirements sufficient?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Though many applaud the LSC—and other providers of services for the poor—others criticize these services. Conservatives have made varied arguments against legal aid. Reacting against the legal services program’s early law reform agenda, some have complained that the program has been insufficiently responsive to poor people’s routine but pressing needs in order to pursue goals of greater interest to poverty lawyers, while others have asserted it is unfair to force taxpayers to subsidize indigent representation. Free-market defenders have objected to legal aid on the ground of efficiency. According to commentators such as Richard Posner, providing legal services in-kind rather than through income transfers encourages clients to overuse free services and forces lawyers to make often inaccurate judgments about which needs are most acute.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2020" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2020" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> Others claim that legal aid hurts the communities it purports to help. These critics charge that legal services lawyers encourage welfare dependency and broken homes through their divorce and government benefits work. They similarly suggest that defending deadbeat or dangerous tenants against eviction imposes costs on other non-litigious tenants in the form of increased rents and safety risks;<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2021" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2021" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span> and that preventing schools from expelling abusive students or enforcing sanitary ordinances against the homeless hurts poor communities, not the attorneys who claim to protect them. From this perspective, legal services “liberators” seldom confront the daily consequences of their advocacy; “abstract compassion” is the luxury of litigators who can “live in neighborhoods with more . . . coffee houses than drug dealers” and who can shield their own children from the educational disruption they perpetuate for others.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2022" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2022" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Defenders of legal aid counter these critiques with a number of points. To argue that it is unfair to force taxpayers to subsidize legal services for indigent clients overlooks the multibillion-dollar subsidy already provided for non-indigent clients through tax deductions for legal services as business expenses. To assume that cash transfers to the poor would be more effective than direct provision of services ignores problems such as lack of information and collective needs that legal aid programs are meant to address. Moreover, at current governmental funding levels, which provide legal aid programs with less than $10 annually for every person below the poverty line, converting the LSC budget to income transfers scarcely seems promising.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2023" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2023" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> Similarly, proponents challenge critics’ complaint that poverty lawyers pursue politically driven lawsuits and hollow courtroom victories instead of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page900" class="pagebreak" title="900">900</span>individual client needs. About 80 percent of legal services cases involve matters that are handled short of litigation; most of these cases involve relatively uncomplicated family, landlord/tenant, income maintenance, and consumer matters.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2024" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2024" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Defenders further argue that many criticisms are really objections not to legal representation per se, but to the underlying rights being vindicated, with lawyers’ help. It is, moreover, by no means clear that all of the cases critics cite reflect counterproductive advocacy. Opponents generally assume that the costs of defending such lawsuits will all be passed on to other poor people. But whether the landlord will in fact raise honest tenants’ rent because legal aid lawyers successfully fight evictions or force landlords to undertake expensive improvements depends heavily on context and local market conditions. Whether such consequences would be offset by other benefits is equally unclear, particularly since it appears that the cases that make it to trial are meritorious.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2025" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2025" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span> Understaffed legal services offices have no reason to spend substantial scarce resources litigating the “marginal” or meritless cases that critics’ arguments invoke. In addition, as with the right to counsel discussed above, there is a growing literature arguing in favor of the cost-effectiveness of legal aid based on the multiplier effects of stabilizing the housing, jobs, and health care of low-income people, alongside reductions in public welfare costs.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2026" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2026" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> Finally, while acknowledging certain limitations of legal aid as a redistributive device, defenders emphasize its role in monitoring the fairness of existing redistributive programs and in enforcing recognized entitlements. For many impoverished clients, legal services are the only way to meet fundamental needs in areas such as medical care, housing, education, protection from domestic violence, and hazardous working conditions. </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Among the report’s recommendations were: simplification of legal forms and proceedings, self-help support services in every courthouse, trained non-lawyer facilitators in libraries and social service offices, additional web-based and telephone assistance, further outreach to vulnerable populations, changes in bar ethical rules to encourage more “unbundled” limited scope representation by lawyers in private practice, and increased funding through mandatory minimum contributions from attorneys and unclaimed damages in class actions. Other possibilities include a tax on legal revenues and a sliding fee scale for clients who can afford to pay something but not the full cost of assistance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2030" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2030" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How would you evaluate these recommendations? Would a mandatory financial or hourly pro bono contribution from private attorneys make sense in light of the material on pro bono in Section C.4? What other strategies might you consider?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Your federally funded legal aid office, after its appraisal of client needs, has decided to target most of its available resources to housing reform, which it believes to be the most pressing issue facing the poor in its city. The office hopes to launch lawsuits attacking both the deteriorating condition of public housing stock and the semi-official tolerance of racial discrimination in public housing admissions. Lawyers also hope to work with a neighborhood organization seeking innovative ways to finance new housing projects, and to block developments that will reduce affordable residential units or increase environmental hazards.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For this reason, the office now turns away almost all prospective clients with non-emergency legal needs unrelated to housing. In addition, clients are now chosen partly on tactical grounds. For example, the office does not accept clients seeking admission to public housing if a family <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page902" class="pagebreak" title="902">902</span>member has a history of violence. Once a client is accepted for representation, however, your office will handle non-housing-related legal problems as well, because you and the other attorneys believe that only in this way can you achieve an acceptable attorney-client relationship.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The mother of a teenage boy with mental illness has asked your program to represent her in efforts to place her son in a special educational program. The boy has been expelled from public school twice as a result of assaults on classmates. The mother insists that the incidents were provoked by racist comments (the boy is Latino). After learning the reason that your office cannot handle her case, she returns and indicates that she has now applied for admission to public housing. Other attorneys report similar experiences, and express discomfort about the possibility that the office’s targeting policy is too manipulative toward would-be clients.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Related concerns have surfaced about caseload restrictions. Some potential clients have questioned the meaning and appropriateness of the ban on representing families with a history of violence, since it penalizes “innocent” as well as “guilty” members. A local women’s group has also complained about the office’s refusal to handle divorce and domestic violence cases. In its view, the lawyers’ interest in cutting-edge litigation and community development work has come at the expense of poor women who remain ineligible for benefits and trapped in abusive relationships because of the absence of legal assistance. Another community group proposes broadening the kinds of cases the office will accept, but conditioning assistance on clients’ willingness to provide a specified amount of community service, such as helping with neighborhood cleanup and renovation or providing services to disabled elderly residents.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The staff and board of the office are meeting to reconsider caseload priorities. What is your recommendation?<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2031" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2031" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">While legal services practitioners have focused on representing individual clients, “public interest lawyers” have focused on changing social policy in ways that address the problems facing broad classes of underrepresented people or interests. In this sense, public interest law has sought to advance “access to justice” though social reforms that widely affect the quality of people’s lives.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although the term “public interest law” is fairly new, the concept has its roots in earlier social movements including legal services for the poor, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page903" class="pagebreak" title="903">903</span>civil liberties, and civil rights.<a id="_Ref34147541" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2032" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2032" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span> The growth of an organized civil liberties movement began during World War I, when a small group of pacifists founded the American Union Against Militarism. It eventually spun off an organization that became the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Activities quickly broadened to include free speech and eventually to reproductive rights and anti-discrimination strategies. So too, America’s first major civil rights organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was founded in the early twentieth century by a small number of liberal activists. A brutal 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois prompted a group of predominantly white reformers to form an association that would focus on racial discrimination.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2033" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2033" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> In 1939, the association spun off the NAACP Legal Defense Fund as a separate organization. Over the next several decades, the Fund orchestrated a systematic legal campaign against racial segregation and subordination. In the process, the Fund broadened its agenda to include related issues such as death penalty litigation. Other organizations, including the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the National Lawyers Guild, joined in the effort. These civil rights and civil liberties organizations served as models for other legal reform associations.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2034" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2034" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a rise in political activism, together with a large increase in foundation founding, gave birth to new “public interest” legal groups. Judicial and legislative initiatives further encouraged this development. Test-case litigation became a more effective strategy as courts began liberalizing doctrines regarding ripeness, standing, and sovereign immunity, and as Congress began authorizing fee awards to “prevailing parties” in certain civil rights, consumer, and environmental cases.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under the definition put forth by the Council for Public Interest Law (now the Alliance for Justice, a coalition of liberal public interest organizations), such organizations qualified as “public interest” if they were tax-exempt nonprofit groups that employed at least one attorney and devoted at least 30 percent of their total resources to the legal representation of previously unrepresented interests on matters of public policy.<a id="_Ref34147516" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2035" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2035" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span> By that definition, in the 1960s, there were approximately <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page904" class="pagebreak" title="904">904</span>twenty-three public interest organizations with less than fifty full-time attorneys in the entire nation. By the 1990s, there were over 200 organizations with more than 1,000 lawyers, and by 2006 (the most recent year for which data is available), under a more inclusive definition that encompassed government-funded legal services, there were over 1,000 organizations with annual budgets ranging from a few hundred thousand to over a hundred million dollars.<a id="_Ref34212430" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2036" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2036" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span> In addition, a substantial number of private firms that did not qualify for tax-exempt status devoted a major portion of their work to public interest representation. Although the percentage of lawyers engaged in full-time public interest work is quite low, under 2 percent, their influence is amplified by partnerships with private practitioners working for no fees or reduced fees.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2037" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2037" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">114</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, conservative legal organizations also formed to broaden the interests represented—and to contest the definition of public interest law. Groups such as the Washington Legal Foundation, the Rocky Mountain Legal Foundation, the Center for Equal Opportunity, and the Southwestern Legal Foundation have waged often successful campaigns against affirmative action, gun control, restrictions on property rights, small-business regulation, and—perhaps ironically—subsidized legal services for the poor.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2038" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2038" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span> The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, for example, has litigated high-profile challenges to the Affordable Care Act on behalf of religious objectors, including a landmark victory in <a id="dabmci_8c02a2bb4cd14999860f1ae05ad349d8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Burwell v.

Although these organizations operate with tax-exempt status, they often fall outside the Alliance for Justice’s definition because they take some positions that are already well-represented by business interests.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2039" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2039" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span> However, they qualify under definitions that are more inclusive, which encompass any group that seeks to use law in the service of social causes.<a id="_Ref34147687" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2040" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2040" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The appropriate role and meaning of public interest law are matters of longstanding dispute. The conventional justification for public interest law rests on the failure of current political and market structures to take adequate account of the concerns of unorganized, diffuse, or subordinate groups. Where transaction costs in organizing are high, and parties have inadequate resources or small individual stakes in representation, the rationale for public interest advocacy is greatest. Yet this rationale raises as many issues as it resolves. Surely underrepresentation does not of itself qualify a legal position as being “in the public interest.” For example, few individuals would apply that label to an organization of pedophiles who sought to eliminate prohibitions on child sexual abuse. If the concept of the public interest presupposes some reference to widely shared values or socially defensible criteria, how should these be determined? In the absence of adequate funding for full representation, who should decide which interests should be heard and how loudly? On what basis should such decisions be made? To whom are public interest lawyers accountable? Consider those issues in light of the following excerpts.</p>

        <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">As conservatives challenged the meaning of public interest law from the right, critics on the left challenged its practice and offered new theories to supplant what many viewed as the outmoded and politically ineffective model of litigation-centered reform embodied in the conventional definition of public interest</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As the critiques of public interest law have made clear, it is not possible to define “external benefits” or “underrepresentation” in an absolute sense that is applicable across different contexts and over time. But this does not necessarily lead to the extreme relativistic point—that the “public interest” in public interest law is simply in the eye of the beholder—that some conservative critiques of public interest law would suggest. In this vein, it is worth recalling that a key force behind the early mobilization of conservative public interest law organizations was the Chamber of Commerce, which—urged on by soon-to-be-Justice Louis Powell—sought to counter the rising influence of liberal groups in court by promoting conservative counterparts that would appropriate the form and label of public interest law. The manipulation of terms for the advantage of powerful groups does not mean that such terms apply equally by virtue of mere invocation. Rather, it should cause us to scrutinize the labels more carefully.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Toward this end, [I would] reframe the core element of contemporary public interest law in terms of <span style="font-style: italic;">relative disadvantage</span>. Public interest law, as a category of practice, would thus be used to describe legal activities that advance the interests and causes of constituencies that are disadvantaged in the private market or the political process <span style="font-style: italic;">relative to more powerful social actors</span>. Disadvantage, in this sense, relates to the resources (money, expertise, social capital) that a constituency may mobilize to advance individual or collective group interests. I draw attention to the relative nature of a constituency’s disadvantage since disadvantage is, at bottom, deeply situational—shaped by power inequality between rival constituencies. This framing suggests that it is possible to identify the constituencies served by different organizations, in different cases, and then to assess the power differential between them. It does not claim that this is calculation is easy—or even always possible. But it does point toward a metric—power—that can provide a basis for distinguishing which among competing causes might legitimately lay claim to the public interest.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The first type of disadvantage is basic market inequality, in which individuals, despite suffering a legal harm, are blocked from legal redress because <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">they are too poor to pay for a lawyer (and there are no viable contingency or fee-shifting arrangements available</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">). P</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">ublic interest law responds to this type of</span> disadvantage by providing no-cost or low-cost services to expand the entry of the<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>poor<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>i<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">nto </span>the<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>legal<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>system<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> on an </span>individual<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">, </span>case<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">-by-</span>case<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>basis<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">. Call </span>this<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> the</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">access dimension</span> of public interest law. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page907" class="pagebreak" title="907">907</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Market inequality maps onto, although it is not always coextensive with, forms<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> of </span>political<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>inequality<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>as<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> we</span>l<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">l, </span>which<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>leads<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> to the </span>second<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> (and more</span> controversial) type of disadvantage: that of social groups or constituencies hindered in advancing collective interests through political channels. Several forms of such structural disadvantage continue to exist, despite important social gains, including disadvantage based on poverty, minority status, discrimination, and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">impediments to collective </span>action<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">. Members of disadvantaged </span>groups<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> have historic</span>all<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">y</span> used American-style public interest law, particularly court-based litigation, to leverage policy gains that could not be effectively achieved through majoritarian politics. Thus, in the U.S. context, classic areas of public interest litigation have included welfare rights litigation on behalf of the poor, civil rights litigation on behalf of communities of color, and environmental and consumer litigation on behalf of those diffuse interests. Call this the <span style="font-style: italic;">policy dimension</span> of public interest law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A key feature of these types of public interest law activities is that, unlike<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>standard access lawyering, they are oriented toward the enforcement and reform<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>of laws and institutions that affect broad social groups. Accordingly, they<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> inev</span>itably clash with adversaries who hold different policy views: civil libertarians <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">versus defenders of re</span>li<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">gious </span>rights<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">; environmenta</span>li<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">sts versus developers;</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">consumer</span> advocates versus business interests. Groups on both sides of these policy disputes deploy law to advance their aims. Which is public interest law? Focusing on relative disadvantage would frame the policy dimension of public <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">interest law as encompassing advocacy on behalf of constituencies who seek to</span> mobilize law to make up for their relative lack of political power to move policy <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">in </span>legislative<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>arenas<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">. </span>This<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>calculus<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> would </span>require<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> look</span>i<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">ng at the </span>nature<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> and</span> depth of a group’s disadvantage vis-à-vis those against whom that group seeks to mobilize. This, in turn, would require attending to deeply entrenched and persistent forms of inequality based on poverty, race, national origin, gender, sexual identity<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">, a</span>n<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">d other </span>grounds<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">.

      <p class="TextParagraph">From this vantage point, public interest law would as a general matter<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> include </span>groups<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>seeking<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> to </span>use<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>legal<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>means<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> to challenge corporate or</span> governmental policies and practices. This definition would encompass activities on both sides of the political spectrum that legitimately advance disadvantaged interests, but exclude lawyering on behalf of existing structures of power. It does not, in the end, suggest that all claims asserted by less powerful groups necessarily advance a normative conception of the public interest to which all segments of society <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">sho</span>uld<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;"> </span>subscribe<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">.

      <p class="TextParagraph">[Cummings and NeJaime detail the two-decade long effort by LGBT movement lawyers at Lambda Legal, the ACLU, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) to keep the issue of same-sex marriage out of the courts because of concern that the results of a positive legal case would be put to the public in a ballot initiative that advocates believed they could not win. After San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome began issuing marriage licenses in 2004, Christian Right groups led by the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) sued to block the marriages and the case wound up in the California Supreme Court, which issued a sweeping decision (<span style="font-style: italic;">In re Marriage Cases</span>) affirming the constitutional right under state law of same-sex couples to marry. As anticipated, however, opponents of same-sex marriage put the issue to the voters, who narrowly passed Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution to limit marriage to unions of heterosexual couples. The California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8.]</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page909" class="pagebreak" title="909">909</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Immediately thereafter,] another lawsuit was announced—not by movement lawyers, but by legal elites, and ideological opposites: Ted Olson, who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 recount and then served as his solicitor general, and David Boies, a prominent trial lawyer who represented Al Gore in the 2000 recount. On May 27, 2009 (the day after the Strauss court ruling), Olson and Boies announced that they had filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of two California same-sex couples, arguing that Proposition 8 violated the federal equal protection and due process guarantees. The case was orchestrated by Los Angeles political strategist Chad Griffin, who had worked on Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and then ran a foundation for filmmaker and liberal political activist Rob Reiner. A mutual friend put Olson in touch with Griffin, who selected the plaintiffs and set up the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) to fund the litigation. Olson’s firm, Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, agreed to take the case on a “hybrid” fee arrangement in which it would donate the first $100,000 worth of services and then collect “flat fees for the various stages,” ultimately amounting to millions of dollars. Olson then brought in Boies. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For movement lawyers, the decade of advocacy around the issue of marriage equality in California ended in irony: excluded from the “trial of the century” they had so vigorously fought to oppose, and forced to focus on the political work of reversing Proposition 8, which they had so clearly seen and attempted to avert. It was not a decade without movement miscues, but the overarching story was one of movement lawyers struggling to protect their incrementalist agenda from being derailed by activists and other lawyers who wanted to move faster, on one hand, and marriage equality opponents, on the other. In the end, that strategy was only a partial success. The movement’s comprehensive domestic partnership victory was overshadowed by Proposition 8. <a id="dabmci_c123209bafe343e8aa26cb81862f09ed" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Perry v.

Yet in the end, while their work continues in other crucial venues, movement lawyers have been largely relegated to the sidelines in <a id="dabmci_f07dc210212246f183f3b87cdceb968f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Perry</span>, watching the seemingly inexorable march of marriage equality toward the Supreme Court—hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Constructing the Agenda: The Path to Marriage</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . . Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, there was intense debate within the LGBT community about whether embracing marriage meant assimilating to heterosexual norms, with some prominent marriage critics arguing that the LGBT community should stand for diverse family arrangements. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In California, the marriage debate played out in the contest over the meaning of domestic partnership and its relationship to marriage. Although advocates generally viewed marriage as a long-term movement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page910" class="pagebreak" title="910">910</span>goal and worked assiduously toward its achievement, there was genuine disagreement about whether marriage should be the exclusive objective, supplanting other legal statuses such as domestic partnership. This disagreement was evident in the initial push to pass a statewide domestic partnership registry . . . in 1999. Although some marriage advocates had already begun to view domestic partnership as a “stepping stone” toward marriage, others saw domestic partnership as an end in itself—a distinct system of legal protections that would make sense for those for whom marriage was undesirable or inapplicable. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Outside the movement, the ferocity of opponents’ efforts to deny marriage rights to lesbians and gay men had the effect of heightening its importance as the ultimate symbol of LGBT equality. . . . Because same-sex marriage opponents were actively staking out marriage as the right to be denied, the LGBT rights movement responded by turning more of its attention to marriage. In addition, . . . marriage was becoming the focal point of legal and political struggle whether movement lawyers wanted it or not. Accordingly, advocates embraced marriage, in part, as a way of seizing control of the issue, shaping the terms of the debate, and maximizing opportunities for success.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">External funding considerations also influenced the primacy of marriage. As marriage equality emerged as a powerful national issue, philanthropic foundations began directing increasing resources for marriage-related advocacy, which allowed LGBT rights organizations to devote more attention to the issue.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Controlling the Tactics: Litigation Triggers and Movement Responses</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . .Contemporary social struggles often feature opposing movements reacting to one another. The California marriage equality movement, opposed by a well-organized and well-funded Christian Right countermovement, is an illustrative case. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Marriage Cases</span>, ADF acted only after San Francisco Mayor Newsom unilaterally decided to issue marriage licenses. ADF thus seized upon an opportunity that, from the vantage point of movement lawyers, was unpredictable and unwanted. Movement lawyers therefore found themselves litigating marriage equality at a time they did not choose and in a procedural posture they did not desire—although once Newsom made the decision, the lawyers expressed support and sought to use it strategically to promote public education around the legitimacy of marriage for same-sex couples. While lawyers had, up to that point, succeeded in controlling the affirmative litigation agenda, Newsom’s unforeseen decision undercut that control and set off a chain of events that led to three California Supreme Court decisions: the first enjoining Newsom’s issuance of marriage licenses, the second declaring a right to marry for same-sex couples, and the third upholding Proposition 8. While the movement lawyers successfully litigated the issue of marriage equality at the California Supreme Court, their earlier strategic decision <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page911" class="pagebreak" title="911">911</span>regarding timing in California proved correct: The judicial victory was quickly taken away by constitutional amendment. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Just as movement lawyers could not prevent Newsom from issuing marriage licenses, they ultimately could not control private lawyers willing to represent constituents eager to litigate. Preventing private lawyers from filing suits inconsistent with movement lawyer goals has been a long-standing issue across different litigation campaigns. Historically, the concern has been about nonmovement lawyers, lacking the sophistication and big-picture perspective, taking cases for a fee that could result in negative precedent undermining the impact litigation campaign. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, the second instance of private attorney intervention—the<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><a id="dabmci_7734f7a571ad412ea00a1159164ee78f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Perry</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>case—was much different. There, control over litigation strategy was wrested not by smaller-scale private attorneys, as in . . . [earlier cases,] but by legal titans (and large-firm attorneys) Olson and Boies, acting at the behest of an activist client with the resources to pay for the best counsel money could buy and the hubris to disregard the collective judgment of the movement lawyers. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Beyond (But Not Without) Litigation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . . There are two important implications of [the California example]. First, the California marriage equality case suggests that the scholarly focus on litigation as the social reform vehicle-of-choice for movement lawyers is outmoded. Contemporary legal advocacy in the marriage context does not fit the top-down, litigation-centric framework developed to address the civil rights campaign of the mid-twentieth century. This finding should make us rethink the appropriateness of the conventional emphasis on litigation in other advocacy contexts and investigate the degree to which the multidimensional model of advocacy. . . . To the extent that lawyering in other fields embraces multidimensionality, it should reinforce the rejection of theories that focus exclusively on litigation in favor of a more nuanced scholarly approach.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However—and this is the second point—it is important to emphasize that moving beyond the focus on litigation is not to diminish its importance as a movement strategy. . . . It may well be of limited efficacy by itself, but when strategically deployed in tandem with organizing, political advocacy, and public education campaigns, it is an important tool. . . . And, as the affirmative litigation in Vermont and Massachusetts highlights, it was not simply that movement lawyers disdained litigation, but instead that they held a well-researched view that in the California context it would produce negative movement results if used prematurely. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Even if one credits this progress, a distinct criticism of the movement still remains: that the focus on achieving marriage as a legal right—waged by relatively well-off, mostly white, elite-educated lawyers in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page912" class="pagebreak" title="912">912</span>relatively well-resourced organizations—may have had the effect of de-radicalizing the movement and narrowing the field of possible alternatives within the broader arena of LGBT activism. This is a legitimate concern—outside the domain of backlash—that we cannot address systematically here; however, we do offer two observations. First, there is evidence that the push for marriage created some political space for alternatives like domestic partnership, which were made to appear more moderate by comparison. This may not be precisely what critics of marriage have in mind, but it suggests that there might be some broader benefits of the marriage equality movement. Second, the critique of rights-based strategies must always be evaluated in light of the question: As opposed to what? In the LGBT rights context, it is worth asking what alternatives were politically possible and how the marriage equality movement interacted with, and potentially negated, those options.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is the debate over the meaning of “public interest law” important? What turns on whether legal organizations are able to claim that label? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the excerpt above, Cummings argues for a definition of public interest law that turns on the “relative disadvantage” of the constituency on whose behalf legal claims are made. Is that a helpful reframing? Does evaluating public interest law in relation to power differentials between competing social groups help clarify which groups are worthy of support? What other ways might you frame what counts as public interest law?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2041" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2041" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">118</a></span> </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In reflecting on movement lawyering, Susan Carle and Scott Cummings note that “even within a particular social movement, there are conflicts over how to frame the ultimate movement goals and which strategies to pursue. . . . Movement lawyers have to make representational choices in the context of these disagreements and thus inevitably take sides in intra-movement debates over what ends to pursue and the appropriate means for doing so.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2043" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2043" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span> From this perspective, lawyers seeking to weigh into social <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page913" class="pagebreak" title="913">913</span>movement efforts invariably confront difficult questions: “What does it mean to represent a movement? Who has organizational or individual standing to speak legitimately on a movement’s behalf? How do lawyers select among conflicting movement viewpoints about goals and strategies? And what happens when there is only a weak or even nonexistent movement infrastructure?”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2044" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2044" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span> How would you answer these questions? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As the debate around the same-sex marriage highlighted, public interest litigation raises concerns from all points on the political spectrum. Conservative objections build on a long tradition of challenges to judicial activism, but they also direct particular opposition to public interest lawyers and lawsuits. Legal strategies that avowedly aim at restructuring institutions or redistributing resources have drawn fire on the ground that courts lack the competence or accountability for such a role. According to this line of criticism, such efforts invite rule by self-appointed representatives of the “public interest” who do not in fact reflect its concerns, and an “imperial judiciary” that does not have the necessary training, institutional familiarity, and enforcement mechanisms.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2045" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2045" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Such arguments have prompted responses on several levels. As defenders of public interest advocacy note, it is not inconsistent with democratic principles for the public to delegate certain functions to non-majoritarian processes. Such a delegation is particularly appropriate to protect the needs of “discrete and insular minorities,” or diffuse majorities that lack resources to organize in a political system increasingly captive to well-financed interests.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2046" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2046" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span> Courts can play a critical role in enforcing constitutional principles that other branches of government fail to vindicate.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Moreover, judicial oversight is not necessarily inconsistent with democratic authority. Public interest work often focuses on lobbying or on legal strategies designed to enforce the legislative intent underlying statutory guarantees. In many contexts, public interest organizations increase accountability in governmental policymaking by providing review that is otherwise absent. For example, such groups provide a crucial check against the capture of agencies by the groups to be regulated. Elected representatives often lack the time, information, and technical expertise to supervise implementation of statutory mandates. Where courts face similar limitations in public interest litigation, they can rely on special masters or broker settlements that take account of all the interests at issue, and involve participants in the monitoring effort.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2047" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2047" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While conservative critics worry that public interest law vests too much power in lawyers and courts, progressives worry that it takes attention away from more effective political mobilization. From their perspective, activist attorneys have placed too much emphasis on litigation and formal rights and have diverted efforts from the political organizing necessary to make such rights meaningful. In a landmark discussion of this issue, Harvard professor and longtime legal services activist Gary Bellow argued:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[T]he problem of unjust law is almost invariably a problem of distribution of political and economic power; the rules merely reflect a series of choices made in response to these distributions. If a major goal . . . is to redistribute power, it is debatable whether the judicial process is a very effective means toward that end. . . . There is generally not much doctrinal judicial basis for adequately dealing with such problems, and lawyers find themselves developing cases whose outcomes are peripheral to the basic issues that these problems raise. Secondly, “rule” change, without a political base to support it, just doesn’t produce any substantial results because rules are not self-executing; they require an enforcement mechanism.<a id="_Ref34147705" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2048" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2048" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Too often, public interest lawyers lack resources to monitor compliance with test-case decrees and some defendants, particularly governmental institutions (such as prisons, schools, or mental hospitals), lack funds for adequately implementing judicial remedies. Decisions that lack public support are also vulnerable to statutory reversal or judicial retrenchment. According to this line of argument, the achievement of formal rights and procedural justice may leave intact a system that is substantively unjust. Public interest lawyers, it is claimed, continue to place undue reliance on doctrinal “victories” because their funding, credibility, and professional reputations depend on such visible achievements and because neither their professional nor personal backgrounds adequately equip them for grassroots organizing. In too many cases, attorneys do not empower clients to create the political and organizational structures necessary to challenge their subordination but instead only minister to its symptoms.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2049" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2049" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In responding to such concerns, defenders of public interest lawyers have emphasized that litigation is not their sole focus. Much law reform activity serves multiple purposes and often helps raise public awareness, increase political leverage, mobilize communities, or broker internal reform efforts.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2050" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2050" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span> In recent decades, the increasing conservatism of the courts and stricter notice and standing requirements have prompted most public <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page915" class="pagebreak" title="915">915</span>interest groups to rely less on litigation and more on lobbying, education, organizing, counseling, economic development, and related community-lawyering strategies. For many underrepresented groups, litigation has functioned most often as a threat that confers bargaining leverage in out-of-court settings, or as a catalyst for political action and organizing efforts. Bellow himself often acknowledged the strategic potential of litigation, and commentators such as Anthony Alfieri and Scott Cummings have documented its importance as a background threat and organizing tool in community development struggles.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2051" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2051" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> In short, effective public interest advocates have learned to rely on multiple strategies that focus on long-term change and that enlist and empower clients in the struggle to achieve it.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A final set of concerns raised by public interest law involves issues of conflicts and accountability. The more unorganized the class, the fewer the constraints on counsel. In critics’ view, lawyers who lack accountability become indistinguishable from the government official whose policy they often challenge. As one has put it: “How are [these attorneys] to succeed where government has failed? Bigger experts? Bigger hearts?”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2052" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2052" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span> In what sense can these lawyers claim to be more representative of the public than elected officials?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Two of the trustees of your environmental organization have asked you to challenge their city’s plans to construct a baseball stadium on the only site that planners believe is economically feasible. The proposed stadium is necessary to attract a major league team, but its construction on that site would threaten crucial wetlands and an endangered wildlife habitat. If you file suit, you may be able to cause sufficient expense and delay to convince the team’s owners to relocate in another city. Although you share the trustees’ objections to the proposed development, you worry about the effects of opposition on the city’s racial minorities and on your group’s reputation as elitist and insensitive to such concerns. Various civil rights coalitions support the stadium as a way to increase inner-city jobs, expand tax revenues, build morale, and assist minority-owned businesses. Under the proposed plans, minority contractors, vending services, and professional firms (including lawyers, engineers, and architects) would receive a substantial share of the work connected with the stadium.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When you raise your concerns with your organization’s board, the two trustees respond that your organization’s mission is to protect environmental interests; it is up to the civil rights coalitions to address <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page916" class="pagebreak" title="916">916</span>minority needs. As one individual puts it, “[W]ildlife has fewer and fewer places to go and paving over wetlands is an unacceptable way of providing cheap development sites.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2053" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2053" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span> The legal staff of your organization, however, feels that this is the wrong development plan to resist, and that they should spend scarce resources fighting toxic plant sites where their mission would be aligned with minority communities and other environmental justice organizations.

      <p class="TextParagraph">The public interest law and legal services models, explored above, have been built around full-time staff lawyers who devote themselves exclusively to their cause. These models have long been supplemented by another in which private lawyers, who spend most of their time representing paying clients, volunteer a portion of their time to provide free services to clients or causes in need.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyer voluntarism has deep professional roots. One primary way that “learned professions,” including law and medicine, distinguish themselves from business is by emphasizing their commitment to public service. Thus, the ABA Committee on Professionalism entitled its widely-publicized report <span style="font-style: italic;">“ . . .</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">In the Spirit of Public Service.”</span><a id="_Ref34148248" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2054" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2054" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span> The American bar has a longstanding tradition of providing assistance <span style="font-style: italic;">pro bono publico</span> (“for the public good”)—or “pro bono” for short. This concept encompasses work provided free or for a reduced fee (also referred to as “low bono”) for a wide range of organizations and individuals, including poor people, nonprofit organizations, bar associations, civic groups, and friends, relatives, or personal employees of lawyers or their clients.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Although the bar has long supported pro bono in principle, its commitment in practice has been less consistent. As the readings below note, a wide gap remains between the rhetoric and reality of pro bono service. According to the most recent ABA survey, just over half of American lawyers performed pro bono service. Of those who did, the average lawyer provided over sixty-five hours of direct pro bono service to persons of limited means (or organizations that support them) per year.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> Other research has shown that the distribution of pro bono hours is bimodal with private lawyers in solo practice and the largest firms (over 250 lawyers) doing the most.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 6.1 provides that a lawyer “should aspire to render at least (50) hours of pro bono publico legal services per year” and should provide a “substantial majority” of such services to “persons of limited means” or to organizations that assist such individuals. But the Comment to this Rule makes clear that it “is not intended to be enforced through disciplinary process.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Efforts by some courts and bar leaders to require a minimum contribution of assistance have provoked broad resistance. The ABA Ethics 2000 Commission rejected proposals to make pro bono work mandatory and recommended simply that Rule 6.1 include a statement in the Comment that “[e]very lawyer has a professional responsibility to provide services to those unable to pay.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Reform efforts at the state level have followed a similar pattern. According to ABA data, by 2017, sixteen states had a version of Rule 6.1 suggesting fifty hours, eighteen specified no amount, nine specified between twenty and thirty hours, two had other standards (with Virginia asking lawyers to devote 2 percent of professional time), while six did not adopt any pro bono rule.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2057" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2057" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">134</a></span> Some states suggested a specific financial contribution, ranging from $250 to $750 or 1 percent of taxable income. Others encouraged contributions without specifying an amount, and a third group did not suggest any financial contribution. Seven states (Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, and New Mexico) required lawyers to report their pro bono contributions, eight rejected mandatory reporting, and eleven had voluntary reporting systems. Of states with mandatory reporting, compliance rates ranged from between 35 to 99 percent.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2058" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2058" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">135</a></span></p>

Rhode, Access to Justice</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;" class="FileLine">145–84 (2004).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The provision of assistance “pro bono publico” often expresses what is most admirable in the legal profession. But not often enough. Over the course of their careers, many lawyers contribute hundreds of unpaid hours to causes that would otherwise be priced out of the justice system. Some lawyers also give significant financial support to legal services <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page918" class="pagebreak" title="918">918</span>programs. Yet the majority do not. Most lawyers make no contributions, and the average for the bar as a whole is less than half an hour a week and fifty cents a day. Moreover, much of what passes for “pro bono” is not aid to the indigent or public interest causes, but either favors for friends, family, or clients, or cases where fees turn out to be uncollectible. The bar’s pro bono commitments are, in short, a reflection of both the profession’s highest ideals and its most grating hypocrisies. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How best to reduce the gap between professional ideals and professional practice has been the subject of longstanding debate but little data. To help fill the void, the discussion that follows reviews findings from my own recent study: the first comprehensive national survey of the factors that influence lawyers’ pro bono work. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rationale for Pro Bono Responsibilities</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The rationale for pro bono work rests on two central claims. One involves the value to society of addressing unmet legal needs. A second justification involves the value to lawyers, individually and collectively, of such charitable contributions. The first argument begins from the premise that access to legal services is a fundamental interest. That claim . . . is that inadequate legal assistance jeopardizes individual rights, compounds other social inequalities, and undermines America’s commitment to procedural fairness and social justice.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A second rationale for pro bono service rests on the benefits to those who provide it. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Studies of the legal profession, including findings from my own survey, similarly confirm the benefits of charitable involvement. Particularly for young attorneys, pro bono work can provide valuable training, contacts, trial experience, and leadership opportunities. Through volunteer projects, lawyers can develop new areas of expertise and demonstrate marketable skills. Involvement in community groups, charitable organizations, high visibility litigation, and other public interest activities is a way for attorneys to expand their perspectives, enhance their reputations, and attract paying clients. Pro bono work also enables individuals to express the commitments to social justice that often motivated them to choose legal careers in the first instance. ABA surveys consistently find that lawyers’ greatest dissatisfaction with their practice is a lack of “contribution to the social good.” Volunteer work can provide that contribution.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So too, pro bono activity serves the interests of legal employers and the legal profession generally. Strong public service programs can produce tangible, although hard to quantify, organizational benefits in terms of retention, recruitment, reputation, morale, and job performance. Pro bono contributions also can enhance the reputation of lawyers as a group. In one representative survey, which asked what could improve the image of lawyers, the response most often chosen was their provision of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page919" class="pagebreak" title="919">919</span>free legal services to the needy; two-thirds of those surveyed indicated that it would improve their opinion of the profession.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For all these reasons, the vast majority of surveyed lawyers believe that the bar <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> provide pro bono service. However, the vast majority also oppose <span style="font-style: italic;">requiring</span> such service. The most common objection is that it is unfair to make the profession satisfy a public obligation. If access to law is a societal value, then society as a whole should bear its cost. The poor have fundamental needs for food and medical care, but we do not require grocers or physicians to donate their help in meeting those needs. Why should the responsibilities of lawyers or their employers be greater?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One answer is that the legal profession has a monopoly on the provision of essential services. . . . Some pro bono contribution is not unreasonable to expect from lawyers in return for their privileged status. Nor would it be unfair to expect comparable contributions from other professionals who have similar monopolies over provision of critical services.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">An alternative rationale for imposing special obligations on lawyers stems from their historic role as officers of the court and their special role in our governance structure. As a prominent New York bar report explained, much of what lawyers do “is about providing <span style="font-style: italic;">justice</span>, [which is] . . . nearer to the heart of our way of life . . . than services provided by other professionals. The legal profession serves as indispensable guardians of our lives, liberties and governing principles. . . .” Because lawyers occupy such a central role in our justice system, there is also particular value in exposing them to how that system functions, or fails to function, for the have-nots. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A second cluster of objections to pro bono responsibilities rests on moral grounds. To many lawyers, requiring pro bono service seems an infringement of their own rights, and a form of “involuntary servitude” or latent fascism. Other commentators view “compulsory charity” as a contradiction in terms. From their perspective, requiring assistance undermines its moral significance and compromises altruistic commitments. Drawing on studies of helping behavior, some critics argue that individuals are more likely to provide sustained and quality service if they are doing so voluntarily than if they are fulfilling a requirement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There are problems with each of these claims, beginning with the assumption that pro bono service is “charity.” Rather, as the preceding discussion suggested, pro bono work is not simply a philanthropic exercise; it is also a professional responsibility. The effect that some minimum service requirement would have on overall pro bono participation is difficult to gauge. Critics have produced no evidence that voluntary assistance has declined in the small number of jurisdictions where courts now appoint lawyers to provide uncompensated representation. . . . Asking lawyers to make a modest contribution of service, along the lines that bar ethics codes suggest, generally between a half an hour to an hour a week, hardly constitutes “servitude.” And <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page920" class="pagebreak" title="920">920</span>those who find it unduly burdensome could substitute a financial contribution.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The stronger arguments against pro bono obligations involve pragmatic rather than moral concerns. Many opponents who support such obligations in principle worry that they would not prove efficient in practice. A threshold problem involves defining the services that would satisfy a pro bono requirement. If the definition is broad, and encompasses any unpaid legal work, then experience suggests that poor people will not be the major beneficiaries; most work will help friends, relatives, middle-class non-profit organizations, and deadbeat clients. By contrast, if a pro bono requirement is limited to the low-income individuals given preferred status in some bar association’s aspirational standards, then that definition would exclude many crucial public interest contributions, such as work for civil rights, civil liberties, or environmental organizations. Any compromise effort to permit some but not all charitable groups to qualify for pro bono credit would bump up against charges of political bias.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A further objection to mandatory pro bono requirements is that lawyers who lack expertise or motivation to serve under-represented groups will not offer cost-effective assistance. In opponents’ view, corporate lawyers who dabble in poverty cases will often provide unduly expensive or incompetent services. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">From critics’ perspective, requiring attorneys to contribute minimal services of largely unverifiable quality cannot solve the problem of unequal access to justice. Worse still, such minimal mandates may divert attention from more productive ways of addressing unmet needs. Preferable strategies would include those proposed in earlier chapters, such as simplification of legal procedures, expanded subsidies for poverty law programs, greater assistance for pro se litigants, and fewer restrictions on provision of routine legal services by nonlawyers.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These are significant concerns, but they are not nearly as conclusive as critics suggest. It is certainly true that some practitioners lack many of the skills necessary to serve those most in need of assistance. But, as law professor Michael Millemann notes, the current alternative is scarcely preferable: “Assume that after four years in college, three years of law school, and varying periods of law practice some lawyers are ‘incompetent’ to help the poor. . . . All this despairing assumption tells us is that the poor are far less competent to represent themselves, and do not have the readily available access to attaining competency that lawyers have.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In any event, multiple strategies are available to reduce the likelihood of incompetent assistance and undue enforcement burdens. One is to allow lawyers to buy out their required service by making an equivalent financial contribution to a legal aid program. Another option is to permit lawyers in organizations to satisfy their obligations collectively by designating certain individuals responsible for fulfilling <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page921" class="pagebreak" title="921">921</span>the hourly responsibilities of all their colleagues. A further possibility is to give continuing legal education (CLE) credit for time spent in training for pro bono work, and to rely on the same kind of honor system used in enforcing CLE requirements for pro bono obligations as well. Many voluntary public interest projects have effectively equipped participants through relatively brief educational workshops, coupled with well-designed manuals and accessible backup assistance. Bar associations could also provide free malpractice insurance for pro bono cases, supported by membership dues, that would cover practitioners who satisfied certain quality-related conditions. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Only through experience with mandatory pro bono initiatives will it be possible to gauge their relative costs and benefits. Yet rather than encouraging such requirements, the organized bar has remained firmly wedded to an aspirational approach. And that approach has left a wide gap between the rhetoric and reality of bar pro bono commitments. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Influences on Pro Bono Work: An Empirical Analysis of Workplace Factors</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The objective of the empirical study summarized here was to provide the first broad-scale data about the personal characteristics, educational experiences, and workplace policies that influence pro bono participation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Taken together, the data collected and reviewed for this study make clear that financial considerations are neither decisive nor unimportant in explaining pro bono contributions. As is true with altruistic behavior generally, economic ability does not determine charitable involvement. Rather, the most powerful influences are a sense of satisfaction and obligation, together with the professional benefits or costs associated with pro bono work. Yet some of these benefits and costs are influenced by external factors, particularly workplace policies. Even seemingly personal motivations, such as the satisfaction that lawyers experience from pro bono involvement, may be in part a function of the opportunities, training, and support that their employers provide or fail to provide. So too, the negative pro bono experiences that some lawyers reported may reflect a mismatch between their interests or expertise and the volunteer options readily available. Certain adverse reactions to clients also may indicate a lack of understanding or “cultural competence” in dealing with low-income individuals. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Not only could well-designed workplace programs affect satisfaction with pro bono work, they also could reduce the costs of pursuing it. Yet as the survey findings make clear, most programs leave much to be desired. . . . Only a quarter of the employers fully counted pro bono work toward billable hours. Fewer than a third counted a certain number of hours (20 percent) or a certain kind of work (10 percent). Such findings are consistent with other recent survey data, and signal a priority structure that undermines public service commitments. . . . In effect, pro bono work was permissible only if it occurred “outside the normal work <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page922" class="pagebreak" title="922">922</span>hours.” Given what passes for “normal” in many firms, the price of public service is often prohibitive.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other limitations on pro bono participation arise from workplace practices concerning resources, rewards, and recognition. Only about half of the surveyed workplaces (57 percent) subsidized all the costs of pro bono matters. . . . Only 10 percent of surveyed lawyers indicated that their organizations valued such work as much as billable hours. About a fifth (18 percent) believed that pro bono contributions were not viewed as important, and almost half felt they were negatively viewed (44 percent). . . . Over a third of surveyed lawyers noted that their organizations’ informal reward structures were at odds with formal policies supporting pro bono work. Some attorneys volunteered comments that were highly critical: firm leaders simply paid “lip service” to pro bono work for purposes of recruiting or self-image; others “encouraged pro bono on the surface but [provided] . . . no incentive to do it.” . . .</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As the debate over mandatory pro bono underscores, the provision of free services by busy law firm lawyers raises questions about how firms monitor the quality of pro bono representation. The following excerpt <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page923" class="pagebreak" title="923">923</span>suggests that firms may do too little to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and impact of their pro bono activities.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc451861742" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219288" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756692" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908826" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Scott Cummings and Deborah L. Rhode,<span> </span>“Pro Bono: Quantity over Quality”</p>
      <p class="FileLine">National Law Journal, July 19, 2010.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A fundamental difficulty [in evaluating pro bono] involves the dominance of ranking systems that use hourly rates as the sole measure of performance, [which risks] diverting attention from quality and social impact. [In our survey of law firm pro bono counsel, n]one of our surveyed firms had formal mechanisms for gauging satisfaction among nonprofit organizations that referred or co-counseled cases. Nor did any firms engage in systematic analysis of the cost-effectiveness and social impact of their efforts.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This was not for lack of concern. Pro bono counsel cared deeply about their programs’ impact on stakeholders, and many were interested or engaged in preliminary efforts to develop more systematic evaluation frameworks. Yet structural barriers proved to be significant. Many counsel expressed frustration with the powerful influence of the current quantitative ranking structure [of publications like the <span style="font-style: italic;">American Lawyer</span>], while some also had legitimate concerns about evaluation criteria, and worried about the lack of clear metrics, resources, and expertise. [The result is that] many programs seem to operate on the assumption that any unpaid service is a good in itself, and that its value need not be questioned unless someone actually complains. Yet this reactive approach is better suited to commercial practice, where dissatisfied clients can vote with their feet, than to charitable settings where recipients of aid may lack the knowledge or sense of entitlement to express concerns.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How best to improve evaluation of pro bono efforts is a complicated question, but our study suggests some possibilities worthy of consideration. One possibility is to expand the criteria for assessing pro bono programs. Our findings suggest several possibilities. Firms could make greater efforts to evaluate stakeholder satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and social impact. Ranking systems could be developed to take account of these efforts. . . . Finally, more attention should center on enlisting lawyers in broader social justice initiatives. Pro bono work, although crucial, is no substitute for a full-service system of delivering aid to underrepresented constituencies. Law firm lawyers, however committed, collectively lack the time, expertise, resources, and freedom from conflicts of interest necessary to ensure adequate access to justice.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Would it be possible to ensure reasonable levels of competence and compliance under a mandatory pro bono system? Are there strategies for increasing voluntary contributions that might be preferable?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Esther F. Lardent, as president of the Pro Bono Institute, warned that mandatory systems make a “very small dent in a very large problem.” In her estimation, the costs of training participants, administering referrals, and monitoring performance were likely to exceed the benefits:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Unfortunately, the end product of a successful campaign for a mandatory pro bono program probably will fail to meet the original goals of the program’s proponents. Experience demonstrates that the political compromises involved in securing approval of such a program will result in a definition of pro bono service so broad that it encompasses activities already undertaken by virtually all lawyers. All lawyers will be in compliance, yet no additional services to address unmet legal needs will be provided. . . . Mandatory pro bono will not increase services, enhance professionalism, or improve the performance of existing pro bono programs.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2060" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2060" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">137</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you agree? How would Deborah Rhode respond? Do differences in the context of lawyers’ practices call for different requirements? Should they be imposed by legal employers rather than the bar and should more efforts focus on evaluating their quality?<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2061" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2061" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">138</a></span> If Lardent is right, should the advocates of increased legal services for the poor focus on changing the political climate within the bar? Should they push for a pro bono reporting requirement? Or should they concentrate on ways to increase funding for existing legal assistance programs and to reduce the need for lawyers? Which is most likely to make a difference in the long run?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Rhode’s excerpt notes, critics of mandatory pro bono believe that minimum requirements, such as fifty hours a year provided by counsel unfamiliar with problems of indigents, would be a grossly inadequate response to current levels of unmet legal needs. The failure of most programs to monitor quality compounds these concerns.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Others point out, however, that voluntary programs are open to similar objections and raise a further problem. The wider the disparity between lawyers’ rhetorical and actual commitment to public service, the more vulnerable the profession becomes to charges of hypocrisy. In 2014, only about a quarter of the 200 largest law firms had more than 50 percent of attorneys providing more than 20 hours of pro bono assistance a year.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2062" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2062" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">139</a></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page925" class="pagebreak" title="925">925</span>After the election of Donald Trump, there was a spike in pro bono in these firms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2063" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2063" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">140</a></span> In 2017, nearly 50 percent of lawyers in the largest firms reported doing at least 20 hours of pro bono work and the average annual pro bono hours per lawyer was nearly 60—a figure that roughly held steady in 2018.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2064" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2064" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a></span> Despite these figures, some argue that pro bono “aspirations” enhance the bar’s self-importance and entitlement to special status without the inconvenience of significant sacrifice on the part of most practitioners. How would supporters of the current Rule respond to this objection? How would you?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should the ABA require that law schools establish adequate pro bono programs as a condition of accreditation? How should “adequacy” be defined? Should students’ participation in pro bono be mandatory? Consider the objection shared by many students: “I advocate volunteerism and try to do my part, but I would resent being told how to manifest my charity. Most important, I would resent the law school judging the merit of my charity choices.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2065" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2065" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">142</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should pro bono requirements be imposed upon law faculty in schools that impose such requirements on students? At Tulane, architects of a mandatory student pro bono program felt that the faculty, “for academic freedom reasons, would not buy into imposing [a pro bono requirement] on themselves.” At the University of Pennsylvania, professors approved what is now a “highly regarded student program, but were split on mandating pro bono for themselves. That part of the proposal died.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2066" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2066" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">143</a></span> Some suggest that it is hypocritical for faculty to require the student body to do as they say, not as they do. Do you agree? Consider that issue in light of the rationale for pro bono in law schools in Chapter 16, Section B.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should the bar require reporting of pro bono hours and financial contributions? Data on their effectiveness is mixed.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2067" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2067" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">144</a></span> Should law firms require service or financial contributions? Should governments demand pro bono contributions by any outside attorneys they hire? Note that some localities and other nations take this tack.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should the bar compel applicants to demonstrate that they have provided a threshold amount of pro bono service as a condition of admission? <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page926" class="pagebreak" title="926">926</span>In 2012, Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman of the New York Court of Appeals announced the adoption of a new rule requiring all applicants to the New York bar to have performed 50 hours of pro bono in order to gain admission. What is the rationale for requiring law students to perform pro bono in order to become lawyers but exempting lawyers, after admission, from any requirement? Particularly given the significant cost of law school, do you think it is fair to make students do uncompensated work (on top of all the other requirements) in order to gain admission? Does the fact that the New York bar permits clinical work and externships (for which students get academic credit) to count toward the fifty-hour requirement undermine its purpose or make the requirement more justifiable?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Given the findings in the Cummings and Rhode study discussed above, do you think that firms should invest more time and money in evaluation? The effective altruism movement, associated with prominent ethicist Peter Singer, advocates the use of evidence-based analysis to do the most good with available resources. What could law firms do better to promote the effective distribution of their pro bono resources? One problem in determining the costs and benefits of pro bono is that law firms deploy a calculus that factors in benefits <span style="font-style: italic;">to the firms</span>. This calculus can skew the allocation of pro bono resources toward projects that firm lawyers find gratifying rather than basing the allocation on an objective analysis of how firms could make the most impact in society.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2068" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2068" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">145</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While liberal critiques of pro bono tend to focus on the problems of inadequate quantity and quality reviewed above, some conservatives take aim at the purported liberal bias of big-firm pro bono. As one commentator put it: “<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">In the guise of altruistic-sounding ‘pro bono publico’ programs . . . , the country’s largest—and richest—law firms deploy the equivalent of </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">thousands </span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">of full-time attorneys and paralegals </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">gratis </span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">each year in a myriad of quixotic liberal crusades, smugly convinced that their labors improve society.”</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2069" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2069" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">146</a></span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Research on pro bono suggests that firms direct most of their pro bono hours to routine cases involving the legal problems of the poor. When firms do cause-oriented pro bono, it tends to be on behalf of organizations associated with liberal causes, like the ACLU, reprising the debate over what counts as lawyer service in the public interest.</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2070" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2070" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">147</a></span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Do you think it is problematic for law firms to get involved in representing groups on contentious issues of social policy?</span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> </span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Despite the problems with pro bono at large law firms, the amount of pro bono provided by big-firm lawyers has grown significantly over the past two decades, owing in part to the creation of structures inside firms to facilitate intake, placement, and monitoring. Seeking to extend those models to other contexts, supporters of pro bono have attempted to strengthen pro <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page927" class="pagebreak" title="927">927</span>bono culture in corporate in-house legal departments. In the late 1990s, the Pro Bono Institute teamed up with the Association for Corporate Counsel to create the Corporate Pro Bono Challenge, which asks in-house legal departments to encourage 50 percent of their legal staff to engage in pro bono work. Since its inception, the number of Challenge signatories has more than tripled to over 175 legal departments nationwide.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2071" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2071" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">148</a></span> Nonetheless, in-house lawyer pro bono participation remains relatively weak. According to the <span style="font-style: italic;">After the JD</span> study, only 42 percent of mid-career in-house lawyers do pro bono, contributing eighteen hours per year on average<span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">—</span>the lowest of any lawyers in the private sector.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2072" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2072" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">149</a></span> In explaining these low numbers, in-house lawyers cite the lack of pro bono opportunities that match their transactional skill set, as well as restrictive bar licensing rules impeding them from engaging in multijurisdictional pro bono practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2073" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2073" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a></span> Should the bar do more to promote in-house lawyer pro bono service or is this an area in which resources could be better spent elsewhere?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The model of pro bono service in which lawyers volunteer to work on pre-screened cases without an expectation of any fee, while an important part of the American professional tradition, has gained prominence over the past quarter-century in relation to the growth of large law firms, which have the resources and excess capacity to mobilize volunteer hours. In contrast, lawyers in solo and small-firm practice have long engaged in “low bono” work, in which they discount their services for clients unable to pay market rates. In the low bono model, discounting may happen in advance of the representation, with the lawyer and client agreeing on below-market rates based on the client’s ability to pay, or it may happen after the fact, when a lawyer writes down fees because of the client’s financial distress.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2074" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2074" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">151</a></span> Low bono work is recognized by the ABA in Rule 6.1 as a form of “voluntary pro bono publico service,” albeit one with lower status than service that is entirely free. The rule states that while a “substantial majority” of a lawyer’s pro bono hours should be targeted “without fee or expectation of fee” to “persons of limited means” or organizations that work on their behalf, a lawyer may also provide additional services at a “substantially reduced fee.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Because of the critical role that solo and small firms often play in communities as a point of contact with the legal system, low bono advocates have promoted investment in “community-embedded law practices” as a way to expand access to justice. As <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">Luz Herrera has suggested, such practices can “serve as first responders to systemic injustices and routine personal legal problems. Their presence contributes to community development by helping community members understand their legal rights and responsibilities.”</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2075" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2075" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">152</a></span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Given that most lawyers in the United States still practice in solo and small-</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page928" class="pagebreak" title="928">928</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">firm settings, low bono proponents argue that supporting those lawyers to extend the reach of their low bono work could make a significant impact in bridging the justice gap. What is your view? Given the economic marginality of many solo and small firms, how realistic is it to think they can make significant contributions to serving poor clients? What could law schools and the bar do to support community-embedded lawyers who seek to play such a role?</span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">11.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In addition to voluntary pro bono, courts have long exercised power to appoint lawyers to represent indigent individuals in both criminal and civil cases. Rule 6.2 instructs a lawyer not to “seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except for good cause,” including the likelihood that the representation will result in violations of the Rules or other law, impose “an unreasonable financial burden,” or lead to impaired assistance because of the lawyer’s repugnance for the client or cause. Rule 1.16(c) also forbids a lawyer who has undertaken representation to withdraw from a case pending before a tribunal without the tribunal’s permission.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The duty to represent indigent individuals without a fee has been traced back to Roman and medieval ecclesiastical traditions, as well as to a path breaking English statute enacted in 1495, which provided for the appointment of “learned Councell and attorneys” to represent paupers in all courts of record. It is unclear, however, how often courts actually made such appointments, and equally unclear to what extent appointed attorneys had to serve without compensation.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2076" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2076" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">153</a></span> Evidence concerning the appointment power in this country is similarly sketchy.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2077" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2077" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">154</a></span> Most experts, however, see no constitutional bar to courts exercising of their inherent authority over the practice of law in order to require reasonable amounts of service.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Some lawyers have challenged courts’ power to make involuntary appointments on the ground such appointments violate the Fifth Amendment’s takings clause. Most courts have rejected this claim, although a few have interpreted takings clauses in state constitutions to prevent uncompensated court appointments. For example, in <a id="dabmci_c1c15d56791e4ce5be6573c92dd57a56" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Scheehle v.

Justices of the Arizona Supreme Court</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">, 508 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2007)</span></a>, the Ninth Circuit upheld an Arizona rule authorizing superior courts to appoint active members of the bar to serve as arbitrators for two days a year in the courts’ mandatory arbitration system for cases involving no more than $65,000. In the appellate panel’s view, the economic impact of the required service was negligible, and there was no showing that it significantly interfered with the complaining lawyer’s legal work. Accordingly, the deprivation was not significant enough to call for compensation.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">An applicant for admission to practice law may justly be deemed to be aware of the traditions of the profession which he is joining, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page929" class="pagebreak" title="929">929</span>to know that one of these traditions is that a lawyer is an officer of the court obligated to represent indigents for little or no compensation upon court order. Thus, the lawyer has consented to, and assumed, this obligation.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The U.S. Supreme Court has never spoken directly to the issue. But, in dicta and in one summary dismissal, it has implied that uncompensated court appointment is permissible, at least in criminal cases. <a id="dabmci_ab6e8436019c47f290cd2f02a52206f8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ex Parte Sparks</span>, 368 So. 2d 528 (Ala. 1979), the Alabama Supreme Court upheld an assignment system for indigent criminal defense, and the United States Supreme Court summarily dismissed an appeal, <a id="dabmci_4d06054f03754db7bc5aa0f517f26fd4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />444 U.S. 803 (1979). And in earlier cases, the Court concluded that attorneys, as “officers of the court” are “bound to render service when required.” <a id="dabmci_e844e5db77d04cff8407fd555cbd33b5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Powell v. Alabama</span>, 287 U.S. 45, 73 (1932).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What do you make of the above authority? Is it justifiable to appoint lawyers to represent a client for little or no pay? What if the case requires a large investment of time to do competently? Is there a danger that the lawyer won’t invest the necessary time and the appointing court won’t call the lawyer on it?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">12.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A practical wrinkle with the above appointments is that lawyers who are required to provide services for grossly inadequate fees have little incentive to defend a case zealously. In some instances, statutory ceilings on compensation have resulted in rates as low as $2.00 an hour. Yet as Chapter 8 on criminal defense and Chapter 3 on malpractice note, the constitutional standards for assessing attorneys’ performance remain notoriously lenient.

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><a id="_Toc340487143" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369527" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733583" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732654" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335223791" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />In this Part, we consider the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, in addressing the problem of inadequate access to legal representation. ADR has been around for centuries. Beginning in the late 1960s, however, such procedures began to attract greater attention. A broad range of factors fueled interest in these alternatives: dissatisfaction with the expense, delays, and contentious nature of adjudication; concerns about undue litigiousness; worries about inadequate and unequal access to justice; desires for increased client control and community empowerment; heightened interest in preserving relationships and exploring root causes of problems; and perceived inadequacies in other family, religious, and community institutions for addressing grievances.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2078" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2078" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">155</a></span> In its current form, ADR seeks to encompass <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page930" class="pagebreak" title="930">930</span>more than just alternatives to litigation; it also aims to address different kinds of disputes through cost-effective processes.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2079" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2079" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">156</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Advocates of ADR support “fitting the forum to the fuss.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2080" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2080" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">157</a></span> Their premise is that different types of disputes and dispute resolution procedures have distinctive characteristics and should be matched accordingly. Lon Fuller, a pioneering theorist of ADR, argued that adjudication is appropriate for cases involving fundamental rights or unsettled legal principles, but that other procedures might be more suitable for routine matters, for parties with ongoing relationships, or for grievances that affect multiple stakeholders and do not lend themselves to principled win-lose decisions.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2081" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2081" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">158</a></span> Building on that approach, many proponents refer to ADR as “appropriate” rather than “alternative” dispute resolution.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the most abstract level, most supporters of alternative dispute resolution share certain common objectives. They join in what former Chief Justice Burger summarized as the true goals of the legal profession: “to gain an acceptable result in the shortest possible time with the least amount of stress and at the lowest possible cost to the client.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2082" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2082" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">159</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Few quarrel with this premise, but what constitutes “acceptable” remains contested and these goals do not always push in the same direction. Conflicts often arise between cost and quality, and between parties’ desire for private, mutually acceptable outcomes and societal interests in transparent and publicly accountable decisionmaking. Increasingly too, debates have arisen as to whether individuals’ consent to route disputes into alternative forums is sufficiently authentic and also whether certain kinds of ADR, most notably forced arbitration, strip litigants of court access while systematically favoring particular (and often, particularly well-heeled) litigants. These controversies are explored in more detail below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Still, this swirling criticism has not stunted ADR’s extraordinary growth. The number of mediations and arbitrations conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), a non-profit association, tripled during the 1990s, and the AAA now resolves thousands of disputes each year, including many big-ticket disputes involving billions of dollars. Meanwhile, federal courts are required to offer ADR, virtually every state court offers it, and many mandate submission to mediation as a precondition to obtaining a trial date.<a id="_Ref34148807" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2083" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2083" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">160</a></span> Efforts to expand ADR have, in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page931" class="pagebreak" title="931">931</span>recent years, received a powerful boost by federal legislation, as both the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 explicitly endorse ADR, reflecting Congress’s belief that alternative dispute resolution “has the potential to provide a variety of benefits, including greater satisfaction of the parties, innovative methods of resolving disputes, and greater efficiency in achieving settlements.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2084" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2084" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">161</a></span> ADR has also found a staunch supporter in the U.S. Supreme Court, which through a series of recent judgments has made it much easier for corporations to route disputes with their customers to alternative, rather than traditional, tribunals.<a id="_Ref34211086" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2085" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2085" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">162</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">What constitutes a good outcome may also depend on the nature of the process. But in general, assessments turn on whether the process reflected values such as neutrality, confidentiality, transparency, and cost effectiveness; whether parties were treated with dignity; whether parties were able to express themselves and their positions; and whether a mutually-agreeable and/or equitable solution was reached.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2087" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2087" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">164</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page932" class="pagebreak" title="932">932</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Popular alternative dispute resolution structures include:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Arbitration.</span> In arbitration, parties voluntarily submit their dispute to a neutral decisionmaker, often an attorney, law professor, or a retired judge or industry professional. Sometimes, both parties make an informed and voluntary decision to submit their dispute to arbitration. At other times, in what is commonly known as “mandatory” or “forced arbitration,” a consumer, patient, client, nursing home resident, or employee “consents” to arbitration as a condition of a standardized “take it or leave it” contract, in which the arbitration clause is buried in the fine print. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Regardless of how consent to arbitration is obtained, procedures are generally the same. The arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement of the contending parties from a list of professionals (though, in the case of forced arbitration, the contract typically specifies the arbitration firm that must be used and the location where the arbitration will take place). Compared to judges or juries, arbitrators have greater discretion. Arbitrators’ judgments are usually final; review is available only in limited circumstances and generally only for procedural irregularities. Arbitrators are not required to follow precedent or abide by the principles of<span style="font-style: italic;"> stare decisis</span>. The process is private, and decisions are often sealed and are not given any kind of precedential or preclusive effect. Common procedural safeguards (such as limits on the admission of certain types of potentially unreliable evidence) generally do not apply.<a id="_Ref34148886" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2088" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2088" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">165</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Private Adjudication.</span> Some statutes and rules of court permit referral of cases to privately selected and compensated adjudicators, often retired judges. Under such referral programs, sometimes labeled “rent-a-judge,” the private adjudicator’s decision is entered as the judgment of the court. Unlike an arbitrator’s award, this judgment is normally appealable.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Summary Jury Trial.</span> Under this procedure, lawyers give a summary of their trial presentation to a jury, usually without witnesses or exhibits. The jury then renders a verdict that is not binding, although the jurors are not informed of this fact before reaching their decision. This verdict can assist parties as they evaluate their claims and negotiate a reasonable settlement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Mini-Trials.</span> Mini-trials, or “structured settlement” negotiations, offer opportunities for lawyers to present an abbreviated version of their case to a decisionmaking panel. In one common variation, the panel includes a neutral advisor and executives of the opposing party. The aim is to enable the parties to hear a forceful presentation of their adversary’s case. After the neutral advisor predicts what would happen if the case were litigated, the principals attempt to negotiate a settlement. In some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page933" class="pagebreak" title="933">933</span>mini-trials, the neutral advisor will render an advisory opinion only if the parties initially fail to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Mediation.</span> Mediation, explored more fully in Chapter 12, Section B, is an informal process in which a neutral mediator, selected by the parties, helps them resolve a dispute or structure a transaction. Ordinarily, the mediator facilitates, but does not impose, a solution. Parties usually go to mediation voluntarily, often in the midst of litigation. However, some jurisdictions require mediation for certain types of cases, such as child custody disputes. Distinctions are often drawn between “evaluative mediation,” in which the mediator suggests an appropriate settlement range in light of the legal and factual strength of parties’ claims, and “facilitative mediation,” in which the mediator helps the parties to find a solution that reflects their underlying interests and maximizes opportunities for joint gains. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Community-Based Dispute Resolution.</span> Neighborhood justice centers, citizen complaint bureaus, and other community-based centers function either as free-standing institutions or as court-affiliated agencies. These organizations typically receive referrals from courts, prosecutors, police officers, or other community agencies, as well as walk-in clients. Professional mediators or volunteers with mediation training handle a variety of disputes, including landlord-tenant, family, and neighbor relations. Some jurisdictions have also established specialized “holistic,” “therapeutic,” or “community” courts to deal with problems like domestic violence, homelessness, or mental illness; some problem-solving courts also address misdemeanors such as prostitution and low-level drug possession. Judges in these proceedings receive special training and partner with other social service providers to offer comprehensive treatment. By employing mediation and other alternative dispute resolution techniques, these courts seek to engage parties in productive, collaborative problem solving.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2089" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2089" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">166</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Early Neutral Evaluation or Expert Evaluation.</span> Used both in private dispute resolution and court-annexed programs, this technique involves reliance on an experienced attorney or technical expert to evaluate a case. After summary presentations by counsel and the parties, the evaluator assesses the issues in dispute in an effort to facilitate settlement negotiations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Online Dispute Resolution.</span> Online dispute resolution began in the 1990s as a way to handle disputes involving electronic commerce. Traditional methods were inadequate for a number of reasons: parties were geographically distant; complicated issues of jurisdiction and choice of law arose; and judgments were difficult to enforce. Online ADR filled the gap, and its low cost and accessibility became attractive for other <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page934" class="pagebreak" title="934">934</span>disputes. By 2010, there were over 150 sites, in all areas of the world, and eBay alone was resolving six million disputes annually.<a id="_Ref34149761" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2090" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2090" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">167</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Recent technological innovations are providing an increasing array of online dispute resolution processes. They include: (a) online e-mail or instant messaging negotiation or mediation, such as services to resolve controversies over online auction purchases; (2) interactive blind bids, in which lawyers for a plaintiff and a defendant who have already agreed on liability can negotiate monetary damage amounts until their bids converge close enough for the computer to create a settlement; and (3) ad hoc jury panels that allow parties with small claims to post arguments and evidence online and to respond directly to the panel’s questions; and e-mediation, described in Chapter 12 Section B.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2091" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2091" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">168</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Debates over ADR—Particularly Forced Arbitration</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="_Toc340487149" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369533" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733589" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732660" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335223797" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />These varied dispute resolution processes have sparked an equally varied set of critiques. Somewhat paradoxically, many of the same criticisms leveled at litigation-based strategies have also been directed at more informal alternatives. Critics claim that some ADR processes do not result in the substantial savings in time or cost that their proponents sought to achieve. One reason is that court-annexed processes often resolve disputes that would have otherwise settled without trial. Thus, though arbitration has been promoted as a way to avoid the adversarialism, delay, and expense of trial, binding arbitration is now sometimes described in similar terms—as “judicialized,” “formal,” “time-consuming,” and “subject to hardball advocacy.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2092" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2092" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">169</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other criticisms have an equally paradoxical quality: ADR is criticized for being both too available and not available enough. Some commentators complain that options such as rent-a-judge or mini-trials are affordable only by the wealthy. Such a market-based structure institutionalizes “legal apartheid”—convenient, speedy justice for the haves and cumbersome, inefficient processes for the have-nots. By creating a two-track system, alternative dispute procedures also may reduce pressure to reform the judicial system that makes such alternatives necessary. Critics also claim that low-cost community ADR procedures can do more to defuse than to resolve conflict. For example, by individualizing grievances shared by many community residents—such as complaints by tenants against a large landlord—such procedures deflect attention from common problems and the collective efforts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page935" class="pagebreak" title="935">935</span>necessary to address them. By expanding “access to justice” for these individual claims, dispute resolution reforms may foster the illusion that “justice” has been done when underlying problems remain unsolved.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Another group of critics, meanwhile, complains that ADR, and particularly forced arbitration, is too often imposed on middle- and low-income consumers, patients, clients, nursing home residents, and employees and that it too often offers skewed outcomes. Over half of private sector nonunion employees (about 60 million workers) are subject to mandatory arbitration, up from 2 percent in 1992, and no other country uses such processes so extensively in consumer and employment contexts.<a id="_Ref34148999" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2093" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2093" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">170</a></span> The Supreme Court has upheld such arbitration requirements, even those barring class-wide claims and collective actions, which makes litigation of most individual cases prohibitively expensive, and encourages powerful parties to impose arbitration clauses.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2094" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2094" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">171</a></span> Problems are especially likely to arise in systems that pit repeat players against one-shot, individual participants. This is so because, as a California judge bluntly notes: “arbitrators have an economic reason to decide in favor of the repeat players.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2095" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2095" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">172</a></span> Even arbitrators concede that this concern is real. Said one Los Angeles arbitrator: “Why would an arbitrator cater to a person they will never see again?”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2096" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2096" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">173</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Empirical evidence does suggest that, particularly when it comes to forced arbitration, repeat players, who typically draft one-sided arbitration clauses, and often select and pay arbitrators, have the upper hand and achieve better outcomes than in similar litigated cases.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2097" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2097" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">174</a></span> For example, a Public Citizen study of arbitration proceedings in California found that businesses won nearly 94 percent of cases.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2098" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2098" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">175</a> </span>Likewise, the U.S. Government’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently found that financial corporations win 93 percent of claims they bring against consumers in arbitration.<a id="_Ref34149065" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2099" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2099" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">176</a></span> And a massive study of 25,000 arbitrations concluded in 2015 by the<span style="font-style: italic;"> New York Times</span>, found that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page936" class="pagebreak" title="936">936</span>roughly two-thirds of consumers contesting credit card fees failed in their arbitration attempts.<a id="_Ref34149697" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2100" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2100" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">177</a></span> Mandatory arbitration clauses can also force individuals to forgo their claims because the process is prohibitively expensive in light of the potential gains. Many clauses require individual consumers to pay substantial up-front fees to subsidize the arbitration, as well as to shoulder high travel costs, because the company can pick the forum, and often uses a distant corporate headquarters.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2101" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2101" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">178</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The CFPB study also casts doubt on the authenticity of client consent. It found that more than 75 percent of consumers surveyed did not know whether their contract with their financial service provider subjected them to a forced arbitration clause, while fewer than 7 percent of covered consumers realized that the clause eliminated their ability to sue in court.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2102" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2102" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">179</a></span></p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Of forced arbitration, U.S. District Court Judge William G. Young, a Reagan appointee, has stated: “This is among the most profound shifts in our legal history . . . . Ominously, business has a good chance of opting out of the legal system altogether and misbehaving without reproach.”<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2103" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2103" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">180</a></span> Similarly, in a letter last year to the CFPB, sixteen state attorneys general warned that “unlawful business practices” could flourish, if arbitration clauses, coupled with class action bans, were broadly permitted.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2104" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2104" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">181</a></span> How serious is that concern?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />By contrast, Andrew J. Pincus, a partner at Mayer Brown in Washington who has represented companies that include binding arbitration clauses in their consumer contracts, has said that class actions yield little relief for plaintiffs. According to Mr. Pincus: “Arbitration provides a way for people to hold companies accountable without spending a lot of money.” What might be some barriers to such accountability? According to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> New York Times</span> review referenced above, between 2010 and 2014, only 505 consumers—nationwide—went to arbitration to resolve a dispute of $2,500 or less. The same review found that Verizon, which has more than 125 million subscribers, faced only 65 consumer arbitrations in those five years; Time Warner Cable, with 15 million customers, faced seven; and Sprint, with 57 million subscribers, faced six.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2105" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2105" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">182</a></span> If those numbers undercut Mr. Pincus’s optimistic assertion, what implications follow?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page937" class="pagebreak" title="937">937</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the following excerpt from the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> arbitration review:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Deborah L. Pierce, an emergency room doctor in Philadelphia, was optimistic when she brought a sex discrimination claim against the medical group that had dismissed her. Respected by colleagues, she said she had a stack of glowing evaluations and evidence that the practice had a pattern of denying women partnerships.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">She began to worry, though, once she was blocked from court and forced into private arbitration.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Presiding over the case was not a judge but a corporate lawyer, Vasilios J. Kalogredis, who also handled arbitrations. When Dr. Pierce showed up one day for a hearing, she said she noticed Mr. Kalogredis having a friendly coffee with the head of the medical group she was suing. During the proceedings, the practice withheld crucial evidence, including audiotapes it destroyed, according to interviews and documents. Dr. Pierce thought things could not get any worse until a doctor reversed testimony she had given in Dr. Pierce’s favor. The reason: Male colleagues had “clarified” her memory.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">When Mr. Kalogredis ultimately ruled against Dr. Pierce, his decision contained passages pulled, verbatim, from legal briefs prepared by lawyers for the medical practice, according to documents.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">“It took away my faith in a fair and honorable legal system,” said Dr. Pierce, who is still paying off $200,000 in legal costs seven years later.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2106" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2106" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">183</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Dr. Pierce could not appeal, because arbitration rulings are typically final. What rights would Dr. Pierce have had in court that she did not have once the case was routed to arbitration?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The above excerpt raises questions about arbitrators’ ethics. Currently, ADR professionals are not held to a uniform set of ethical standards.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2107" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2107" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">184</a></span> And, some arbitrators have engaged in deeply questionable conduct. For example, in one arbitration, the arbitrator went to a basketball game with the company’s lawyers the night before the proceedings began. In another, the arbitrator and defense company lawyer went to lunch together in the midst of the proceeding.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2108" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2108" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">185</a></span> Should arbitrators be held to uniform standards and be required to demonstrate objectivity or certain minimum qualifications for practice? If so, how should these standards and qualifications be developed and enforced? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is there an even greater need for ethical guidance for online dispute resolution (ODR) than other forms of ADR? Because it is a relatively new <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page938" class="pagebreak" title="938">938</span>development and is generally not affiliated with courts or professional organizations, ODR is largely unregulated.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2109" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2109" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">186</a></span> Although efforts have been made to develop and compile best practice guidelines, they have had little demonstrable impact.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2110" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2110" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">187</a></span> Does that suggest a need for external regulation? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In 2015, the Council of Europe’s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights passed a draft resolution calling on Council of Europe member states to:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[M]ake voluntary ODR procedure available to citizens in appropriate areas; raise public awareness of the availability of such procedures and create incentives for choosing them including by promoting the extrajudicial enforcement of ODR decisions and by enhancing the knowledge of legal professionals about ODR . . . . ensure that parties engaging in ODR procedures retain the right to access a judicial appeal procedure . . . . [and] undertake to develop common minimum standards that ODR providers will have to comply with in order to ensure, inter alia, that their procedures do not unfairly favor regular users over one-time users, and to strive to establish a common system of accrediting ODR providers satisfying these standards.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2111" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2111" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">188</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Does that resolution provide a desirable model for the United States? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to some corporate lawyers, it’s “malpractice” to not include an arbitration clause in consumer contracts.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2112" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2112" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">189</a></span> By contrast, critics of forced arbitration argue that it is a violation of bar ethical standards for lawyers to draft and attempt to enforce mandatory arbitration clauses that are so one sided that courts would find them violative of due process.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2113" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2113" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">190</a></span> Do you agree with either of these positions? If so, what arguments would you make in support? Under what, if any circumstances, would you be willing to draft a mandatory arbitration clause? </p>

Concerned about such channeling, thirty-four U.S. Senators asked the federal government to deny Medicare and Medicaid funding to nursing homes that employ arbitration clauses. In a September 2015 letter, these Senators noted:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The decision to admit yourself or a loved one to a long-term care facility can be difficult. Unfortunately, families often have limited <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page939" class="pagebreak" title="939">939</span>choices due to cost and location constraints. Yet, long-term care facilities sometimes force and often encourage potential residents and their families to waive their legal rights before any harm has occurred and to agree to a dispute resolution forum that may be biased in favor of the facility. One signed, pre-dispute arbitration decisions are binding, with a very limited right to appeal an arbitrator’s decision. Given the consequences of this decision, pressuring potential residents to make an on-the-spot decision about whether they want to arbitrate any potential future dispute is unfair to residents and their families during the overwhelming and paperwork-intensive nature of the long-term care facility admission process.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2114" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2114" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">191</a></span></p>

The defendant has proposed to resolve the issue through a confidential arbitration proceeding. You are reluctant to agree because you have already incurred most of the costs necessary to try the case, and you believe that your client could generate a larger award from a jury than from an arbitrator (which would mean a larger fee for you). Moreover, the potential adverse publicity of such a verdict might prompt a generous settlement.

      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are a lawyer for the United States Agency for International Development. The Agency has recently come under criticism by U.S. women’s rights organizations for sponsoring a mediation program in Nicaragua that includes domestic violence cases. Although a local feminist cooperative has supported the program, some observers are concerned that the program’s emphasis on harmony and individual solutions may perpetuate victimization, as well as undercut broader political efforts. Given the widespread opposition to mandatory mediation of domestic violence cases in the United States, women’s rights groups argue that American tax dollars should not subsidize such initiatives abroad. By contrast, supporters of the Nicaraguan program, although sensitive to its disadvantages, believe that it is often preferable to litigation, given the geographic inaccessibility of courts for much of the country, and the costs for victims who bring formal complaints. From supporters’ perspective, the United States should support local understandings of appropriate conflict resolution, not impose its own <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page941" class="pagebreak" title="941">941</span>standards.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.2120" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section24.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2120" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">197</a></span> How would you advise the Agency to proceed?

Consumers joined that community whenever they “liked” a product on Facebook, signed up for e-mail alerts, or obtained online coupons. All members of the company’s “community” would, henceforth, be forced to submit all disputes with General Mills to binding arbitration.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> highlighted this move in a series of articles, and many consumer groups vocally criticized General Mills for what they considered to be an improper curtailment of legal rights.

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Given the scale of the access to justice problem, even the most stalwart supporters of increasing the supply of lawyers for low-income people recognize that will never be enough. Moreover, as we discussed earlier, many legal problems experienced by poor people do not require lawyers but instead can be effectively resolved by individuals empowered with legal knowledge to navigate streamlined justice systems. A key component of expanding access to justice is therefore making it easier for people to achieve justice on their own terms. This Section introduces strategies to facilitate access to justice </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10.5pt;">without</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> lawyers under the rubric of “innovation,” which is a term embraced by the ABA to promote a suite of reforms to reduce barriers to self-help and increase reliance on nonlawyer assistance. In reality, innovation is a complex and sometimes controversial idea encompassing very different types of changes: from greater use of technology, like online programs and apps, to schemes to create more qualified nonlawyers and courthouse facilitators.</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="HiddenHyperlink">A key focus of the innovation movement is on using technology to better support pro se litigants, who are often marginalized by judges who view them as “not worth the time.”</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="HiddenHyperlink"> This is a significant problem since, in courts that handle housing, bankruptcy, small claims, and family matters, parties without attorneys are often now the rule rather than the exception. Estimates suggests that as many as two-thirds of the litigants in state courts are proceeding pro se. In more than three-fourths of all civil trial cases in the United States, at least one party does not have a lawyer.</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="HiddenHyperlink">Moving beyond information provision, there are (as mentioned in the preceding section on ADR) additional efforts to leverage technology to help resolve legal disputes. For example, lawyers have created online portals that allow people to file for “quickie divorces” and resolve other straightforward disputes without incurring the expense of meeting face-to-face with a lawyer.</span>

      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="HiddenHyperlink">Another significant challenge to nonlawyer assistance is regulatory. Again, as discussed in Chapter 13, many state bars have not supported incursions on the professional monopoly. Confronting this resistance, in 2019, the ABA’s Center for Innovation drafted a proposal to the House of Delegates that “encourages U.S. jurisdictions to consider regulatory innovations that have been adopted or are under review in a growing number of state supreme courts and that are also under study by state and local bar associations, such as the authorization and regulation of new categories of legal services providers.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="HiddenHyperlink"> The proposal also calls for other types of regulatory “innovation,” including revisiting Rule 5.4’s prohibition on fee-sharing with nonlawyers, which it argues “impedes the development of innovative legal service delivery models, especially those that require the active involvement of other kinds of professionals, such as technologists, or that need substantial outside capital to succeed.”</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span class="HiddenHyperlink">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is your view on how much courts and the bar should rely on nonlawyer navigators and other types of nonlawyer assistants to shoulder the burden of helping low-income litigants? A recent study suggests that Washington’s high-profile attempt to build a sustainable pipeline of limited license legal technicians (LLLTs) to support pro se litigants has met with little success, both because the cost of training has proven too high to entice law schools into the program, and because LLLTs who have gained licenses have nonetheless struggled to generate fees large enough to sustain their practice. Other studies raise questions about the effectiveness of nonlawyer assistance. One study based on 5000 unemployment insurance appeal hearings and interviews found that, while experienced nonlawyers can help parties navigate common court procedures and understand basic substantive legal concepts, they are not equipped to challenge judges on contested issues of substantive or procedural law in individual cases, advance novel claims, or advocate for law reform.</span>

Critics of the current innovation movement fault it for being led by “legal-aid and court-administration groups driven by their own views about what will best engage the community,” and instead promote a participatory design model that “involves actively consulting and collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders in a system to understand their perspectives and incorporate their priorities into system innovation.”</span>
