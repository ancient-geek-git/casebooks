      <p class="TextParagraph">Most lawyers today work in organizational settings and most lawyers’ clients are also organizations. This structure of practice complicates ethical decisionmaking because lawyers are subject to institutional pressures, incentives, and customs that may sometimes conflict with their personal values or the Rules that govern attorney conduct. The materials that follow focus on two different types of ethical challenges in organizational settings. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The first constellation of ethical challenges arises when a lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">represents an organization as a client</span>. As we saw in the last chapter, organizational representation presents complex questions about to whom the lawyer is ultimately accountable and what the lawyer should do when she uncovers unethical or even illegal conduct by actors within the organization. We treat this issue in three parts. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Part A examines the lawyer’s general duties when she is representing any organization (private or public), focusing on obligations to report misconduct to higher levels of authority within an organizational structure and what, if any, opportunities exist to report misconduct to outside parties. This discussion highlights the difficult judgments lawyers must make in determining what constitutes wrongful conduct, identifying who the appropriate decisionmakers are to address it, and evaluating what remedial steps are in the best interest of the organizational client. In these contexts, lawyers may differ with client managers over how to define misconduct and how to ultimately address it. How much deference should an attorney give to the ethical and legal judgments made by the client’s management team? When can, should, or must an attorney blow the whistle on her own client to prevent harm? As these questions suggest, lawyers for organizations may face tough ethical choices, particularly on those occasions when protecting client confidences may implicate them in client wrongdoing. Part B explores specific ethical issues that arise when lawyers represent private organizational clients, which include for-profit and nonprofit corporate entities. As we will see, depending on the type of client and the regulatory context, lawyers representing private companies are subject special to requirements to identify and potentially report corporate misconduct that complement, and in some ways go beyond, what the professional rules require. This Part also highlights distinctions between the roles of outside and in-house counsel, the latter of whom face unique ethical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page624" class="pagebreak" title="624">624</span>pressures by virtue of being employed by their client. Part C then turns to look at the distinctive challenges faced by government lawyers who are entrusted with representing public agencies and the public at large. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The second set of ethical challenges arises when a lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">works within an organization</span>, such as a law firm, in which there are many lawyers with different levels of seniority and expertise. In such a context, what are the senior lawyers’ obligations to supervise and monitor junior lawyers’ work? And how much should a junior lawyer defer to judgments made by his or her supervisor? We explore these questions in Part D.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861601" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219146" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756554" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908271" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908687" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732464" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />General Principles of Representing an Organization</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On its face, the rule governing organizational representation is elegantly simple. Rule 1.13(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(a)&quot; " /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>makes clear that when lawyers represent an organizational client, they represent the organization itself “acting through its duly authorized constituents.” This means that a lawyer for any type of group—whether it be a Fortune 500 company, government agency, university, small business, or nonprofit community organization—ultimately is charged with serving that group’s best interests as defined and conveyed by those in charge.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet the simplicity of this rule is deceptive on two levels. First, it is not always clear who in an organization qualifies as its “duly authorized constituents” from whom the lawyer is supposed to take her direction. For instance, lawyers for a corporation often take their cues from high-level managers, who may have delegated authority to act on the company’s behalf. But those managers may disagree among themselves about the appropriate course of action, may hold views about the representation that differ from those of the board members, to whom the managers have to answer, or may misunderstand what the best interest of the corporation actually are.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1361" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1361" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> In the public sector, the organizational hierarchy may be even less clear, such that lawyers for government agencies lack strong guidance about how to resolve ambiguous mandates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1362" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1362" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> Lawyers for organizational clients must take care in these complex relational settings to ensure that their instructions have been vetted by, and represent the definitive view of, the client’s ultimate decisionmakers and that the lawyer’s advice is being properly conveyed to those in charge. Even when the lawyer takes these steps, there are difficult questions about how much the lawyer should simply defer to client representatives or probe more deeply into the nature of the organization’s decisionmaking process.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1363" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1363" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page625" class="pagebreak" title="625">625</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The second complexity arises when a lawyer for an organizational client finds out that someone inside the organization is involved in misconduct that might harm or be attributed to the client itself. In complex organizations, it is not uncommon to discover that someone, somewhere has engaged in action that is wrongful and that could endanger either the organization itself or third parties. Again, these types of situations are often not clear-cut. Lawyers’ assessments of legal risk may differ from those of their clients’ representatives. As we saw in Problem 4 in Chapter 10, a client may wish to proceed with a course of conduct that is technically illegal but unlikely to be detected and punished. Even when violations are serious and unambiguous, lawyers’ duty of confidentiality may restrict the degree to which they may report the misconduct outside the client entity. And, though withdrawal under Rule 1.16 is often an option, as we discuss below, particularly for lawyers who work as in-house counsel (and even for lawyers at outside firms) the negative professional consequences of withdrawal may be so grave that it is an option of last resort. In these situations, what <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> and what <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> a lawyer do?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861602" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756555" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908688" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Requirements of Rule 1.13</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.13<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13&quot; " /> provides two mechanisms for reporting internal organizational legal violations. Rule 1.13(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.13(b)&quot; \s &quot;1.13(b)&quot; \c 16 " /> provides for mandatory (though conditional) “reporting up” the organizational chain of command. Rule 1.13(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)&quot; " /> provides for permissive “reporting out” after the process set forth in (b) has been followed and additional requirements have been met. Specifically, Rule 1.13(b) states as follows:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee or other person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to act or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation to the organization, or a violation of law that reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and that is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the organization. Unless the lawyer reasonably believes that it is not necessary in the best interest of the organization to do so, the lawyer shall refer the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted by the circumstances to the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Rule mandates that a lawyer who uncovers illegal conduct that threatens injury to the client must, if warranted, report the matter all the way up the ladder to the “highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.” However, a number <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page626" class="pagebreak" title="626">626</span>of conditions must be satisfied before this duty is triggered. First, a lawyer must have actual knowledge of a legal violation. Second, that violation must be “likely to result in substantial injury to the organization.” Third, the lawyer must conclude that reporting up is in the organization’s “best interest.” The rules offer no guidance on how a lawyer is to determine the nature of a “substantial injury” or what constitutes the client’s “best interest” in this context.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Then, beyond this mandatory reporting obligation, Rule 1.13(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)&quot; " /> <span style="font-style: italic;">permits</span> a lawyer to report illegal activity to persons or entities outside of the organization—but only if certain requirements are satisfied. It states that if:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />despite the lawyer’s efforts in accordance with paragraph (b) the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization insists upon or fails to address in a timely and appropriate manner an action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of law, and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation whether or not Rule 1.6 permits such disclosure, but only if and to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial injury to the organization.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">Under Rule 1.13(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)&quot; " />, then, a lawyer must: (1) have complied with the reporting up requirements of section (b); (2) determine that the action at issue is “clearly a violation of law” (a higher standard than in (b)); and (3) reasonably believe that “the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization.” Even then, disclosure is permitted “only if and to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial injury to the organization.” In other words, any disclosure under Rule 1.13(c) must be narrowly tailored solely to prevent organizational injury.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, section (d) prohibits any reporting out otherwise permitted by (c) “relating to a lawyer’s representation of an organization to investigate an alleged violation of law, or to defend the organization or an officer, employee or other constituent associated with the organization against a claim arising out of an alleged violation of law.” Accordingly, if a lawyer is hired to conduct an internal investigation into corporate wrongdoing, any information about illegal activity gained through that investigation may not be disclosed under Rule 1.13(c). The theory behind this exception is that permitting disclosure would undermine a company’s incentive to investigate and take steps to rectify wrongdoing and comply with law. Critics of this exception suggest that it allows cynical organizations to label representations as “investigations” merely to prevent damaging information from being disclosed.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page627" class="pagebreak" title="627">627</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Note that Rule 1.13<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13&quot; " /> does not affect a lawyer’s ability to disclose confidential information under an exception to Rule 1.6. Recall that the Rule 1.6 exceptions are designed to prevent third parties from harm. By contrast, the Rule 1.13 disclosure regime authorizes “loyal” disclosures in order to prevent injury to the client.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ABA approved the current Rule 1.13 framework in 2003 after a contentious debate. The controversy followed outrage over the failure of lawyers to more aggressively contest illegal conduct at Enron and other companies. Prior to those 2003 amendments (which created the client fraud exceptions to Rule 1.6 examined in Chapter 6), a lawyer for an organizational client was only required to “proceed as reasonably necessary in the best interests of” the client—a vague standard that offered little guidance. The new Model Rule standards were prompted by pressure outside the ABA—and, in fact, the ABA only voted to create Rule 1.13’s reporting framework after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted, and only after SEC rules implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposed similar duties on lawyers for publicly listed corporations. We examine those rules below.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861603" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219148" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756556" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908689" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Reporting up and out</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The case study of the Ford Pinto that follows raises a serious but not uncommon problem: An automobile manufacturer markets a car with knowledge of undisclosed safety risks. More recent examples include General Motors’ sale of cars with faulty ignition switches that would suddenly turn the car off and disable occupants’ airbags and Volkswagen’s marketing of purportedly low-emissions vehicles that were, in fact, secretly equipped with “defeat devices” to fool emissions testers. These cases raise questions of what the lawyers knew, when they knew it, and whether they actively engaged in fraudulent conduct, sat quietly in the face of serious wrongdoing, or alternatively, properly complied with their internal reporting obligations. They also raise the question of whether lawyers, if they did know of illegal conduct, should have taken steps to reveal it publicly. The Ford Pinto case is a dramatic example of what is at stake in these situations.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The shockers came on three successive days, October 13, 14 and 15, 1979, in three successive front-page <span style="font-style: italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> headlines:</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">OCTOBER 13 FORD IGNORED PINTO FIRE PERIL, SECRET MEMOS SHOW</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">OCTOBER 14 HOW FORD PUT A PRICE TAG ON AUTOS’ SAFETY</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page628" class="pagebreak" title="628">628</span>
      <p class="TextFlush">OCTOBER 15 U.S. OFFICIAL SEES COVER-UP IN FORD SAFETY TEST POLICY</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course, everyone knew about the celebrated exploding Pinto long before that time. In February 1978, a California jury had awarded $125 million—later reduced to $6.6 million by a judge—to a teenager who had suffered horrendous burns in a Pinto accident. By the summer of 1978, the macabre gag line “Shut up or I’ll back my Pinto into you” was circulating. And the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span>’s research was initiated because a grand jury in Indiana had indicted Ford for reckless homicide in the burning deaths of three teenage women whose 1973 Pinto had exploded after being struck from behind by a van on August 10, 1978.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The secret internal Ford memos revealed in the first two <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> articles made it all worse. They seemed to show a level of foreknowledge and coldblooded calculatedness on Ford’s part that appalled many readers.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The first day’s memos showed that Ford engineers knew that Pinto gas tanks would be pierced by bolts when struck from behind at speeds as low as 21 m.p.h. This would allow gasoline to leak out, so that any spark, caused, for example, by metal scraping over pavement, would explode the fuel supply. Other memos discussed several modifications in the Pinto design that would make it safer. These were rejected on the grounds that they cost too much money (various figures were cited, ranging from $5.08 to $11 per car), and because some would decrease trunk space.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to the first <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> article, a Ford memo of November 10, 1970 commented that government-proposed fuel tank safety standards “are too strict and come too soon. Ford executives list lesser standards that the Department of Transportation ‘can be expected to buy’ as alternatives.” A “confidential” memo dated April 22, 1971 recommended that one of the safety devices not be installed until 1976, to save Ford $20.9 million. Another “confidential” memo of October 26, 1971 stated that no additional “fuel system integrity” changes would be made until “required by law.” As a result of lobbying by the auto industry, the more stringent legal requirements did not go into effect until 1977; the 1977 Pinto was designed to meet the new requirements. Ford, faced with a government investigation, voluntarily recalled 1.5 million 1971–76 Pintos and Bobcats; as it happened, however, the recall notice was not sent out until twelve days after the Indiana accident.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These memos, in short, indicated that Ford engineers and executives were aware of Pinto’s design problem, and that instead of repairing it, they acted deliberately to avoid regulatory and financial consequences to the company. . . . [Another document contained a cost/benefit analysis in which, according to media accounts, Ford concluded that “[s]aving 180 people from burning to death and another 180 from suffering serious burns in car fires each year would not be worth the cost of adding $11 per car in safety improvements.”] The document was prepared by Ford as an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page629" class="pagebreak" title="629">629</span>argument to the federal government against a higher safety standard. According to a Ford spokesman, “who uttered a profanity when a <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> reporter mentioned the study to him,” the government itself had established the dollar value assigned to death and injury by the study. The government, however, claimed that these numbers had been prepared for an entirely different purpose, a federal study of the loss to the national economy brought about by traffic accident injuries. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ford was acquitted of reckless homicide in the Indiana trial. The defense was able to prevent 280 of the 300 Ford documents from being introduced as evidence. It argued that after the recall was initiated, federal regulations actually prevented Ford from notifying Pinto owners of the dangerous gas tank, and thus Ford was not legally reckless. But the key to the defense lay in the facts of the Indiana case. The young women’s car was struck by a van moving fifty m.p.h., enough to rupture the fuel tank on any comparable car. The prosecution argued that the Pinto was moving between fifteen and thirty-five m.p.h. when struck (so that the relative speed of the crash was between fifteen and thirty-five m.p.h.). The defense, interviewing possible witnesses as far away as Costa Rica, turned up two hospital employees who reported a deathbed conversation with one of the victims, who said she had stopped the car. Prosecutor Michael Cosentino’s grisly attempt to impugn this testimony—by arguing that since the victim’s lips were totally burned off, she could not possibly have articulated the word “stopped”—failed, and Ford was acquitted of murder.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span>, Ford engineers had known since 1968 that fuel tanks in the position of the Pinto’s were liable to rupture “at very low speed,” and discussions of how to deal with the problem in Pintos had been going on since at least 1970. Yet until the lawsuits began, the public had no inkling of the matter. And the consequences were severe: the company itself could estimate how many people would be immolated in their Pintos. During 1976 and 1977 alone “thirteen Pintos—more than double the number that might be expected in proportion to their numbers—were involved in fiery rear-end crashes resulting in deaths” while the VW Rabbit and Toyota Corolla suffered none. Some might say that it is a mistake to dwell on the particulars: it makes our reactions too emotional. On the contrary, I think that in problems such as these we cannot afford to forget the three teenagers who perished in a one-thousand-degree fire. And, if the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span> stories are accurate, Ford knew precisely what it was doing. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[In particular,] [a]ccording to former Ford executive Harley Copp, the lawyers [in Ford’s legal department] “definitely knew” what was in those documents. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[A]ssuming that the facts of the case are as the newspapers stated them, did Ford do anything immoral?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This question sounds absurd. If allowing innocent people to be immolated for no other reason than cold, cold cash isn’t immoral, what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page630" class="pagebreak" title="630">630</span>is? Only one thing, we might answer: doing a study on it first and then covering up the whole horrible process.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite this understandable reaction, there is another way to look at the matter. What was it that Ford did? It traded off cost for safety. But that is what car manufacturers must always do. Safety costs money, and people may not be willing to pay the price. Hence, the cheaper, in both senses, car. ([Ford executive Lee] Iacocca introduced the Pinto to break into the under-two-thousand-pounds-and-two-thousand-dollars market.) Government regulations set minimum safety standards, but after these were met, the marketplace sets the level of safety. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Pinto’s gastank was punctured at twenty-one m.p.h. collisions. For $6.65 extra, it would have withstood thirty m.p.h. But it still would have gone at forty. For more money, it would have stood up to fifty-five (Pinto would then have resembled an armored half-track). But no car is totally safe, and thus they will all generate their grotesque cost-benefit analyses. Indeed, a standard test of negligent design in tort law is simply that the risk of the design outweighs the benefits . . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This brings us to the second part of the response. To a sophisticated reader, Ford’s cost-benefit study is nothing to get excited about. First of all, that number of deaths is simply an actuarial statistic and does not by any means show a callous attitude toward human life, any more than does a similar study by your insurance company or by the manufacturer of the safest car money can buy. Every car has a small but calculable probability of burning you to death. Multiply a tiny probability by millions of cars and you will get a body count like Ford’s. One hundred and eighty deaths out of 12.5 million vehicles translates into the statistic that the gastank Ford was using increased your chance of death by one in seventy thousand over the safer alternative. That doesn’t sound as bad as actually writing down the number of deaths; nevertheless, mathematically the numbers are equivalent. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Nor is that two hundred thousand dollars per death figure beyond the pale of humanity. Personal injury lawyers use formulas for computing the value of a wrongful death: it’s just one of the things that must be done to compensate, as far as possible, for irreversible losses. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">So, at any rate, goes the argument. It says that Ford was not doing anything improper or out of the ordinary: it just got caught with a lot of embarrassing memos that made for good copy but really signified nothing.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861605" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219150" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756558" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908691" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One important question raised by the Pinto case is how the Ford lawyers should have treated the internal cost-benefit memos. If we assume the lawyers knew about the memos, and we seek to evaluate their conduct under the current version of Rule 1.13, we confront two issues. The first is whether the company’s decision to leave the gastank in the rear of the vehicle would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page631" class="pagebreak" title="631">631</span>have constituted a “violation of law that reasonably might be imputed to” Ford that would have thus triggered an obligation to report up. Recall that the Pinto met then-current safety standards. Does the possibility of tort or even criminal liability for injuries caused by the exploding gastank count as a known legal violation under Rule 1.13(b)? The second issue is, if Ford’s decision about the gastank constituted a legal violation, was it likely to result in “substantial injury” to the company in light of Ford’s own cost-benefit analysis? Would lawyers have been able to defer to that analysis in deciding not to report their concerns to higher ups—to say that there was no likelihood of substantial injury to the company since it had already concluded that the benefits of the tank placement outweighed the costs?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another question raised by the Pinto case is: Did the company’s cost-benefit analysis rely on the right estimates? The “right” estimate of the value of human life is notoriously hard to calculate. Global variation in estimates of the value of life range from $70,000 to $16.3 million.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1364" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1364" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> In the United States, federal agencies operate with figures generally ranging from roughly $6 to $9 million—but tort awards for wrongful death are typically a fraction of that, and even agency estimates tend to shift with the political winds.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1365" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1365" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> At the time of the Ford Pinto collision described in the text, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration placed the value of human life at roughly $200,000.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1366" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1366" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> Did that make $200,000 the “right” estimate?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to tort expert Gary Schwartz’s research, the Pinto’s overall safety record during the relevant period was quite “respectable,” in part because only 1 percent of all traffic crashes resulted in fires and only 4 percent of accident fatalities occurred in fire crashes. However, because of its gastank placement, the Pinto did perform comparatively poorly in rear-end collisions.<a id="_Ref32222903" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1367" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1367" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> Does that alter your analysis?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider Gary Schwartz’s claim that cases like the Pinto reflect a “two cultures problem,” referring to the way economists think about policy issues and the way laypeople think about the value of life. On the one hand, we expect both governmental and corporate decisionmakers to consider cost-benefit tradeoffs when setting safety standards or evaluating design alternatives. Indeed, most states’ product liability laws <span style="font-style: italic;">require</span> such an evaluation. On the other hand, when we are dealing not with statistics and probabilities but with identifiable victims, the prospect of trading cash for lives offends deeply felt moral values.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Many have debated how the tort system should respond to this ambivalence. However one resolves that question in general, and however <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page632" class="pagebreak" title="632">632</span>one assesses Ford’s conduct in particular, the point that bears emphasis here is that lawyers counseling corporations need to consider the practical, informational, and ethical limitations of cost-benefit analysis. Such considerations are crucial for attorneys, not only in their own comfort-level with a decision, but in predicting their clients’ potential legal liabilities and the public relations consequences of various decisions. Given such considerations, was the conduct of Ford Motor Company in the Pinto case wrong? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Although it is commonly assumed that Ford’s decisionmakers relied on the cost-benefit memo described above, a later study of the Pinto case concludes that the engineers responsible for the fuel tank design and the initial refusal to recall decision were unaware of the memo.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1368" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1368" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span> Does that matter?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume that Ford’s lawyers knew of the memos described in the Luban excerpt. Assume as well that the memos established knowledge of a legal violation “that reasonably might be imputed” to Ford that was “likely to result in substantial injury” to the corporation. Would it have been in the company’s best interest for the lawyers to report up? Suppose that Ford’s lawyers tried but failed to obtain internal review of management’s safety decisions. Would the lawyers have been permitted to disclose the relevant facts to a government agency or consumer organization? In this regard, was there a clear violation of law “reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization”? Would disclosure have prevented that injury?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Recall that, under Rule 1.6(b)(1), a lawyer may reveal information “to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.” Given the numbers in Ford’s cost-benefit analysis—180 anticipated deaths and 180 serious burns out of a total of 12.5 million vehicles—should a lawyer conclude that marketing the Pinto will lead to reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm? Statistically speaking, there is an overwhelming likelihood that <span style="font-style: italic;">someone</span> will die because of Pinto’s gastank but a minuscule likelihood that any particular individual will be one of the anticipated victims; the chances for a given driver or passenger are less than three-one-thousandths of a percent. Given these odds, does Rule 1.6(b)(1) permit or forbid whistleblowing? According to Comment 6:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">[6]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Paragraph (b)(1) recognizes the overriding value of life and physical integrity and permits disclosure reasonably necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm. Such harm is reasonably certain to occur if it will be suffered imminently or if there is a present and substantial threat that a person will suffer such harm at a later date if the lawyer fails to take action necessary to eliminate the threat. Thus, a lawyer who knows that a client has accidentally discharged toxic waste into a town’s water supply may reveal this information to the authorities if there is a present and substantial risk that a person who drinks the water <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page633" class="pagebreak" title="633">633</span>will contract a life-threatening or debilitating disease and the lawyer’s disclosure is necessary to eliminate the threat or reduce the number of victims.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: 17.65pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Does that Comment offer sufficient guidance?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Would Ford’s lawyers have been permitted to disclose confidential information about the Pinto’s design or danger under Rule 1.6(b)(2) or (b)(3)? Recall, these provisions authorize disclosure:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyer’s services;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result or has resulted from the client’s commission of a crime or fraud in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer’s services. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Chapter 6 recounted, earlier drafts of Rule 1.6 would have <span style="font-style: italic;">obligated</span> disclosure to prevent a client from committing an act that would result in death or substantial bodily harm to a third party. Worried that that lawyers would face an undue risk of liability for nondisclosure and that clients would withhold information necessary for effective representation, the ABA House of Delegates chose, instead, to approve a discretionary provision that permits, but does not compel, disclosure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1369" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1369" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Should disclosure of confidential information be mandatory rather than permissive in circumstances posing clear threats to life and safety? Under Nuclear Regulatory Commission mandates, an employee who becomes aware of certain nuclear safety risks <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> inform governmental officials. Engineering codes of conduct similarly <span style="font-style: italic;">require</span> disclosure of conditions posing a risk to public health or welfare.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1370" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1370" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 1.13 is unique to the United States. Other countries have no comparable requirements. Indeed, the Code of the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE) does not even have a provision analogous to Rule 1.13. Japan has a requirement comparable to Rule 1.13(b), which obligates in-house lawyers to report wrongdoing up the chain of the command but does not authorize reporting out if the organization fails to act.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1371" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1371" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">11.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If you were on a bar commission charged with recommending amendments to the Model Rules, what changes, if any, might you propose for Rule 1.13? What effect do you think a different rule might have on attorney conduct under circumstances described in the Pinto excerpt? In his discussion of the Pinto problem, Luban concludes that if Ford’s lawyers could not convince the company to redesign or recall the car, they should have alerted the public to the danger. Do you agree? Is that practical? Are there persuasive reasons why lawyers should defer to other decisionmakers on cost and safety decisions?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">12.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A common claim by corporate clients and their lawyers, across a wide array of organizational settings, is that responsibility for protecting public welfare rests—and ought to rest—with government. It is for politically accountable officials, not self-appointed attorney moralists, to make difficult tradeoffs. As long as clients comply with existing regulations, some lawyers claim, their duties are satisfied.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Others point out that a problem with this view is that it fails to acknowledge the limits of regulation. In contexts like the Ford Pinto case, or like the recent General Motors of Volkswagen debacles, industry leaders exercise far more influence over regulatory structures and enforcement than unorganized and uninformed consumers. Inadequate information among regulators may allow distribution of a product without adequate review of risks.<a id="_Ref32242272" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1372" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1372" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">13.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A related issue of decisionmaking authority involves the rights of consumers, workers, or other affected parties to make their own tradeoffs between dollars and risks. Corporate clients and their counsel often claim that it is not their role to impose personal preferences on others about what level of safety to demand; such imposition, they say, is improper and paternalistic.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">How plausible is this argument in circumstances such as the Pinto case? How much information about how many features of how many comparable models would consumers need in order to make a truly rational choice? Studies of informed consent in medical contexts indicate that most individuals do not adequately understand or recall disclosures concerning risky or experimental procedures. When faced with hard treatment choices, most surveyed patients do not want decisionmaking control and responsibility.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1373" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1373" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> When making car purchases, how many prospective buyers are likely to focus on rear-end collision fatalities?

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does it follow that consumers are unconcerned with safety simply because they do not make it central to their final decisions? Might they simply assume that government standards establish adequate protection? And if such standards, in fact, fall short, is there a role for mandatory disclosures that would enable consumers and regulators to make informed choices?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are the general counsel for Ford Motor Company. One of the company’s most respected engineers seeks your advice. He is concerned that Ford, in its rush to market a model competitive with small foreign cars, has been unwilling to make certain safety improvements involved in relocating the rear fuel tank of the Pinto automobile. Crash tests indicate that the car’s gastank punctures and explodes in rear-end collisions at relatively lowly speeds. However, other engineers doubt that the tests represent real-world conditions or that the safety performance is unacceptable, particularly for a small car. They note that the car complies with all safety requirements of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Moving the tank now would cost between $5 and $11 per vehicle, for a total of around $137 million, and would delay production. The CEO strongly opposes a design change, and there is no reason to believe that the Board of Directors would arrive at a different conclusion unless you raise persuasive objections.</p>

It valued human life at approximately $200,000 and serious burn injuries at $67,000 each. The memo projected the cost of settling lawsuits from Pinto collisions at about $49 million. Should you use that figure in analyzing the risks to Ford associated with the Pinto rear-end fuel tank design?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume you do nothing and that the Pinto is marketed with the gastank location unchanged. Soon thereafter, however, reports begin to surface indicating that cars are exploding, even in low-speed collisions. The engineer who approached you initially is in charge of recall decisions, and he holds two meetings with relevant in-house experts. They all oppose recall. If you disagree, how should you proceed?</p>

However, as a practical matter, the nature of an organizational client may affect a lawyer’s professional conduct for several reasons. As we will see, specific types of private companies, such as publicly traded corporations governed by the SEC, may be covered by regulatory regimes that impose specific obligations on the lawyers who represent them. In addition, the organizational structure of private companies, many of which operate through boards of directors or similar authorities, is often quite different than that of public agencies in ways that affect a lawyer’s duty to communicate and report. Lawyers for corporations, particularly those who work in-house, face significant barriers to reporting internal misconduct, since the consequences of whistleblowing may be a lost client or even (for in-house lawyers) a lost job. Overall, the fact that private organizations typically pay lawyers for their services—and often quite well—creates a much different set of pressures on lawyers to do their clients’ bidding. This Part explores some of these issues, beginning with a review of the specific reporting requirements for lawyers working for SEC-listed public companies, and then turning to whistleblower protections and the particular challenges faced by in-house counsel.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted earlier, the current version of Rule 1.13 was enacted in response to the SEC’s regulations implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Congress passed that Act in the wake of high-profile corporate scandals in the early 2000s, including Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossings, and Tyco. It applies to public companies—called “issuers” because they issue securities to investors—which are required to register with the SEC and meet various reporting and disclosure requirements. The professional standards promulgated by the SEC thus govern lawyers for public companies who practice in front of the Commission. The most critical provisions of the regulations implementing the act are discussed below.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The language of Sarbanes-Oxley raises a number of questions for lawyers who represent public companies. First: Who is governed by § 205? The regulation governs any lawyers who advise clients in the preparation of documents that foreseeably may become part of submissions to the SEC. This includes a wide range of corporate documents.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Second, what is an “appropriate response” by a chief legal officer to an attorney’s report of evidence of misconduct? It is a response that would lead a reasonable attorney to believe that the problem is being addressed in accordance with applicable laws. This includes a determination that the client has a colorable argument that its conduct is legal.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page639" class="pagebreak" title="639">639</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Third, what standard triggers a lawyer’s reporting obligations? Section 205.2(e) provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Evidence of a material violation</span> means credible evidence, based upon which it would be unreasonable, under the circumstances, for a prudent and competent attorney not to conclude that it is reasonably likely that a material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Many practitioners and commentators have found this standard confusing, with its convoluted syntax, multiple probabilistic terms (“material,” “credible,” “unreasonable,” “reasonably likely”), and double-negative construction.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1376" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1376" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span> The double-negative “unreasonable not to conclude” standard appears to be higher than a “reasonable lawyer” standard. If the rule required only that a reasonable lawyer would conclude that it is reasonably likely that a material violation had occurred, then the “reporting up” obligation might be triggered even if another reasonable lawyer concluded the opposite. The double-negative construction rules out that possibility; it requires that no reasonable lawyer could avoid the conclusion that a material violation is reasonably likely. “Reasonably likely” means more than “merely possible,” but something short of “more likely than not.”</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Apparently, this convoluted standard emerged as a compromise between two positions. Initially, the SEC wanted an objective standard triggering lawyers’ reporting obligations; the SEC’s preferred standard would have defined “evidence of a material violation” as “evidence that would cause a lawyer to reasonably believe that a violation is occurring.” Yet, nearly all practicing lawyers who commented on the proposed standard maintained that it was too demanding. They preferred a subjective standard that would have required reporting only if the attorney <span style="font-style: italic;">knew</span> that a violation was occurring. How different is the compromise standard from a subjective knowledge requirement?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Section 205.3(b) provides the basic “reporting up the ladder” framework: An attorney who becomes aware of evidence of a material violation of securities law must report it to the chief legal officer of the issuing company, who must, in turn, investigate, take steps to ensure that the issuer responds appropriately, and report back to the attorney who initially made the report. If that attorney does not receive a satisfactory response, he or she must go up the ladder once again and report the evidence to members of the company’s board of directors. Alternatively, the issuing company can set up a “Qualified Legal Compliance Committee” (QLCC) consisting of independent members of the board of directors. (In the excerpt reproduced above, we have omitted regulations concerning QLCCs.) Both the attorney and the chief legal officer can discharge their reporting requirements by reporting to the QLCC, provided that the QLCC has been established prior to the report (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>., a QLCC cannot be set up to deal with allegations of a violation after they surface). Section 205.3(b)(4) provides that if an attorney “believes that it would be futile to report evidence of a material violation to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page640" class="pagebreak" title="640">640</span>the issuer’s chief legal officer and chief executive officer (or the equivalents thereof),” the attorney may bring the evidence of a material violation directly to the board of directors.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The most controversial aspect of the regulation is § 205.3(d)(2). It permits lawyers representing issuers before the SEC to reveal client confidences in order to prevent or rectify fraud in which the lawyer’s services have been used.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Refusing to acquiesce to this provision, the Washington State Bar issued a 2003 ethics opinion asserting that it would continue to discipline lawyers who reveal client confidences, even if the revelation was authorized by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In August 2003, the Corporations Committee of the Business Law Section of the California State Bar sent a letter to the SEC general counsel agreeing with the Washington Bar and arguing that the SEC lacks authority to preempt state ethics rules. The SEC’s response was that the agency had such authority, and one of its Commissioners characterized the Washington bar ethics opinion as an “essentially lawless act.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1377" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1377" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">By contrast, the North Carolina Bar concluded that, under prevailing Supreme Court precedent, federal regulation preempts conflicting law if the agency clearly intended to preempt and its action is within the scope of its delegated authority. Thus, the North Carolina Bar took the position that, unless and until a court ruled that the SEC had exceeded its authority, its regulations should preempt contrary state bar standards.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1378" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1378" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How different is Sarbanes-Oxley from Rule 1.13? If a lawyer for a publicly traded company comes across evidence of a material violation of the Securities Exchange Act, what are her obligations under Rule 1.13<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13&quot; " />? Would it be possible for that lawyer to comply with both § 205 and Rule 1.13? What steps should she take to do so? Are Rule 1.13(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)&quot; " />’s standards for “reporting out” consistent with § 205(d)(2)’s standard for revealing confidences to the SEC to prevent the commission of a material violation after internal efforts have been exhausted?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What if the reporting attorney is fired? Under § 205.3(b)(10), the attorney may report the discharge to the board of directors. Does this provision rule out a cause of action for retaliatory discharge? Should it?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The regulations state that attorneys violating the rule will be subject to civil sanctions and penalties by the SEC, that they are immunized against penalties under inconsistent state standards by good faith efforts to comply, that the SEC will not seek criminal penalties, and that the regulations create no private right of action. The net result is to create a “safe harbor” for attorneys from civil lawsuits based on their companies’ violation of the regulations. Does that categorical exemption serve the public interest? Are regulatory violations likely to be relevant in malpractice litigation despite § 205’s disclaimer?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page641" class="pagebreak" title="641">641</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The SEC considered but rejected a “noisy withdrawal” rule. Such a rule would have compelled lawyers to withdraw, disaffirm relevant documents, and notify the SEC and successor counsel that she had withdrawn for professional reasons, if she did not get an appropriate response in a reasonable time. The proposal met with considerable support from academic experts but overwhelming opposition from the organized bar.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1379" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1379" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span> What is your view of its merits?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Sarbanes-Oxley regulations have not been well received by the practicing bar. The “up the ladder” reporting structure creates the unpleasant possibility that lawyers may be required to go over superiors’ heads—those who hired them, evaluate them, pay them, and often work side by side with them—and inform the board of directors that those same individuals may be engaged in illegal conduct. An additional complication arises for in-house counsel in multinational corporations operating in countries where whistleblowing is not permitted.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1380" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1380" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> As one lawyer puts it:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">An attorney has many roles in society—client representative, officer of the legal system, and public citizen responsible for justice, to name a few. Now, thanks to a group of forty law professors, a former plaintiffs’ attorney, and a Congress faced with a disillusioned public in an important election year, an attorney representing clients before the Securities and Exchange Commission also has another title: corporate snitch.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1381" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1381" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree? Why or why not?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 102(e) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice permits the Commission to “censure a person or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way” if the person is found to “have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct” (which includes violating § 205.3) or “to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities lawyers or the rules and regulations thereunder.” However, a review of 221 proceedings against lawyers filed by the SEC between 2002 and 2017 found that none resulted in punishment against lawyers for § 205.3 violations. When sanctions were imposed, most were for lawyer fraud, false statements, or misappropriation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1382" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1382" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">One of few public cases of enforcement involved John Isselmann, Jr., general counsel (and the only lawyer) for Electro Scientific Industries. When he learned that the company was overstating its income, he attempted to report that fact at a meeting of the company’s audit committee. He was cut off by the chief financial officer, who had developed the scheme. Isselmann kept silent for five months before resigning and later settled with the SEC for a $50,000 fine. He subsequently attributed his silence to ignorance. He had no accounting experience and only a limited securities law background and “relied heavily on accounting people . . . like outside auditors to flag those issues for me.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1383" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1383" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are an associate in a large corporate law firm representing Planetary Telecom (PT), an innovative telecommunications firm that has become highly successful in the past five years. You are asked to assist in drafting opinion letters required by securities law in connection with some complex transactions that PT’s chief financial officer (CFO) wishes to undertake. These transactions involve selling unprofitable assets to a company created solely for the purpose of holding those assets (the company is a “special purpose entity” or SPE). The SPE is held in the name of the CFO’s grandmother. By getting the assets off the books, the sale will help PT show a year-end profit and boost its stock prices. Securities law requires that the sale be genuine, which means that the assets must be effectively insulated from PT’s control. The SEC requires an opinion letter attesting that the sale is a “true sale” complying with the effective-insulation requirement. In fact, however, the CFO has structured the deal so that the liabilities will be transferred back to PT in a month. As a consequence, no true sale letter can appropriately be issued. Instead, PT’s accounting firm has stated that a different kind of opinion letter will suffice. This kind of opinion letter, called a “true issuance” opinion, does not assert that the SPE’s assets are insulated from PT’s control. It merely offers an opinion about who owns the assets if the SPE goes bankrupt. Based on your knowledge of securities law, you believe that the true issuance letters you have been asked to draft do not comply with securities law; only a true sale letter will suffice. You are also concerned because securities law requires that such deals have a legitimate business purpose, and you know that the SPEs exist only for the purpose of moving liabilities off the books for accounting purposes—a violation of the law. The accounting firm, however, insists that a true issuance letter is good enough.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You raise your concerns at a meeting with other lawyers working on the project. The meeting’s attendees seem discomfited by your analysis, but they do not participate in the discussion. In your view, it is not even a close call that the transactions are illegal.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Your state ethics code has a version of Rule 1.6 that does not allow revealing client confidences to prevent financial frauds. Its version of Rule 1.13 also does not permit disclosure of confidences outside the corporation. However, § 205.3(d)(2) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorizes lawyers to reveal client confidences to prevent material violations of securities law and to rectify frauds that utilized their services. May you disclose your client’s confidences to the SEC? Must you disclose?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">What happens when lawyers do, in fact, “blow the whistle”—when they go public with client misconduct? Studies of whistleblowers in various public and private sectors find that disclosure can impose substantial personal costs. Some individuals experience harassment, isolation, and economic retaliation, as well as the pain that comes from exposing colleagues’ and friends’ misjudgments. As Sissela Bok notes: “[T]he message of the whistleblower is seen as a <span style="font-style: italic;">breach of loyalty</span> because it comes from within. . . . The conflict is strongest for those who take their responsibilities to the public seriously, yet have close bonds of collegiality and duty to clients as well.”<a id="_Ref32239409" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1384" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1384" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> One lawyer who became unemployable after bearing an unwelcome message noted, “People think whistleblowers are great but they don’t necessarily want one in their organizations.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1385" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1385" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet whistleblowing can also confer great benefits on society. Leaks of confidential information have been critical in exposing major government scandals. Most prominently, a government whistleblower sparked impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump for pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate Trump’s political rival. In the private sector, whistleblowers have famously uncovered a range of corporate misconduct including: Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data to skew the 2016 election; Volkswagen’s “defeat devices,” which the company used to circumvent environmental regulations; and the false claim by the health technology company, Theranos, that it had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page644" class="pagebreak" title="644">644</span>devised blood tests requiring only small amounts of blood.<a id="_Ref32238766" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1386" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1386" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> Other widely publicized cases include those involving tobacco, asbestos, opioids, automobiles, contraceptives, clergy sexual abuse, savings and loan associations, mortgage foreclosures, and irresponsible or predatory lending practices.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1387" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1387" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> In these and other scandals, as the facts come out, lawyers have been subject to substantial criticism and sometimes financial liability for failing to protect innocent third parties. An example of a lawyer who became the target of criticism for failing to protect the public is David Boies, who was a Theranos board member and whose firm acted as legal counsel for the company at the height of the scandal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1388" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1388" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers who contemplate publicly blowing the whistle on clients can proceed in one of two ways. First, under Rule 1.13(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13(c)&quot; " />, a lawyer may “report out” clear legal violations, unresolved through internal action, which are reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the company. Alternatively, a lawyer may reveal confidential information under Rule 1.6(b)(1)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6(b)(1)&quot; " />, (2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(1), (2)&quot; \c 16 " />, or (3)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.6(b)(3)&quot; \s &quot;1.6(b)(1), (2), or (3)&quot; \c 16 " /> to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm or to prevent or redress substantial financial injury to third parties resulting from the client’s commission of a crime or fraud. Beyond these ethical standards lies the question of what, if any, protections lawyers have against retaliation by clients for reporting their misconduct. As a practical matter, for outside counsel, the issue in many cases is moot since whistleblowing is typically coupled with lawyer withdrawal under Rule 1.16. However, the issue is more complicated for in-house lawyers, for whom withdrawal might mean unemployment. And there are other ways that clients might retaliate, including impugning a lawyer’s reputation, that must be considered.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers who call out client misconduct are protected by the same panoply of laws that protect nonlawyer whistleblowers. At the federal level, whistleblower laws date back to the 18th century, when they were enacted to protect subordinate military officers from retaliation for revealing their superior officers’ criminal misconduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1389" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1389" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> The first False Claims Act—a law that imposes liability on individuals and companies for defrauding government programs—was passed in 1863 to combat fraud in Civil War contracting. It included a <span style="font-style: italic;">qui tam</span> provision, permitting whistleblowers to recover a portion of the damages recovered by the government due to the false claim in order to provide a financial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page645" class="pagebreak" title="645">645</span>incentive to report.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1390" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1390" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> Although the False Claims Act was curtailed during the war years, it was revived and expanded in the 1980s, and, in the decades since, the statute has been used to return some $60 billion to the federal fisc.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1391" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1391" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition, beginning in the 1970s, the federal government began passing legislation that protects government employees who disclose abuses and also safeguards private employees who report violations of certain federal safety and environmental standards. In particular, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 forbids retaliation against whistleblowers and establishes offices to investigate and evaluate whistleblower suits. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, strengthened in 2012 by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, protects federal employees who disclose “illegal or improper government” activities from supervisors’ or coworkers’ retaliation. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the wake of the Great Recession, contains a <span style="font-style: italic;">qui tam</span> provision, permitting whistleblowers to recover a bounty when the whistleblower provides information that leads to successful SEC enforcement actions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1392" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1392" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> There are other agency-specific laws, like the Intelligence Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988, which provided the basis for the whistleblower complaint in the Trump impeachment case.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1393" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1393" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Likewise, there is a patchwork of regulation at the state level.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1394" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1394" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> A few states have laws protecting all employees, not only those in regulated industries, who report violations to a government body. About half of all states also have established public policy exceptions to employers’ rights to fire at will in response to ethical resistance. Yet, although most courts have allowed employees to sue for wrongful discharge if they are fired for refusing to do something illegal, similar protection has not been available where employees lose their jobs after aggressively reporting illegalities to management.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But, even with all the above, there are still powerful deterrents to whistleblowing. In some agencies, whistleblowers may find little support from higher ups. A report from the Government Accountability Office “found that the DOJ sided with whistleblowers in only three of the seventy-two cases reviewed, and that whistleblowers suffered savage retaliation that sometimes lasted over a decade.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1395" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1395" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> In the private sector, mandatory arbitration agreements can silence whistleblowers. As one <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page646" class="pagebreak" title="646">646</span>commentator put it, “If you blow the whistle and no one hears, you’re not a whistleblower; you’re a sitting duck.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1396" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1396" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For these reasons and others, vast numbers of would-be whistleblowers never go public, and some who do prefer to remain anonymous. This has been the case with the whistleblower in the Trump impeachment case (despite efforts to “out” the person). Similarly, Mark Felt, the gutsy whistleblower who was Deep Throat in the Watergate scandal and gave the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Washington Post</span> information that exposed President Nixon’s obstruction chose to remain anonymous for three decades, only revealing himself in a 2005 op-ed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1397" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1397" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One clear takeaway from the research on whistleblowing is the need for robust legal protections for those who choose to reveal wrongdoing. Unfortunately, right now, even with the regulatory patchwork described above, may believe that whistleblowers are inadequately supported.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the few reported cases involving the retaliatory discharge of lawyers who blew the whistle on clients, courts have reached varying results. Several well-publicized decisions have not permitted attorneys’ claims to proceed to trial.

North American Co. for Life &amp; Health Ins</span><span style="font-style: italic;">urance</span>, 501 N.E.2d 343 (Ill. App. 1986), for example, an attorney who worked in-house at an insurance company sought $250,000 in compensatory damages and $10 in million punitive damages after he was fired for allegedly disobeying management’s request to destroy certain files. The trial court granted the insurance company’s motion for summary judgment, and the appellate court affirmed, on the ground that the tort of retaliatory discharge was not available to attorneys under the circumstances.

Gambro, Inc.</span>, 584 N.E.2d 104 (Ill. 1991), an in-house lawyer was fired after he told his superior that he would do anything in his power to stop the company from selling kidney dialysis machines known to be ineffective. Denying his cause of action, the Illinois Supreme Court reasoned that wrongful discharge suits were not necessary to encourage lawyer whistleblowing because professional ethics rules already compel attorneys to promote the public interest. Importantly here, unlike Model Rule 1.6, which is merely permissive, Illinois’s version of Rule 1.6 <span style="font-style: italic;">requires</span> lawyers to disclose confidential information to the extent necessary “to prevent the client from committing an act that would result in death or serious bodily injury.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, the trend among courts is to be more receptive to the plight of fired attorney whistleblowers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1398" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1398" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Discharges of whistleblowers have been held to violate public policy, to breach an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or to violate an implicit term of attorneys’ employment contracts.

He claimed that the defendant insurance company had punished his resistance to cutting corners and costs in defending policyholders. In the appellate court’s view, the company should have known in hiring the attorney that he would be bound by ethical rules and should have “incorporated this fact in creating a just cause employment contract.”</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Parallel issues arise when lawyers report misconduct by fellow lawyers. Although Rule 8.3 mandates such reports, as we discussed in Chapter 3, courts have divided over whether lawyers who are fired in retaliation for blowing the whistle have a valid claim of wrongful discharge.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861612" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219159" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756566" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908699" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In <span style="font-style: italic;">Herbster</span>’s aftermath, Illinois enacted legislation that would explicitly allow in-house lawyers to sue for retaliatory discharge if they were fired for refusing to obey corporate orders to violate a law or rule of ethics. The legislation also permits lawyers bringing such actions to reveal confidences obtained in the course of employment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1399" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1399" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> However, the Illinois legislation creates no cause of action for outside counsel or for in-house attorneys fired for attempting to have their employers comply with the law. What might be the basis for these distinctions? Are they appropriate?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should lawyers lose the protection of whistleblower laws if they violate professional duties in reporting client wrongdoing? That was the issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">State of New York ex rel. David Danon v. Vanguard Group Inc.</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1400" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1400" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> In that case, David Danon, while in-house counsel at Vanguard, raised concerns over what he viewed as the company’s illegal tax avoidance, which included improperly charging related entities in order to zero out profits and failing to file proper tax returns—resulting in claimed avoidance of $1 billion of federal tax and $20 million of New York tax. In 2013, Danon was terminated, he claimed, for his “persistent and vocal questioning” of Vanguard’s practices.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1401" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1401" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> He then filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">qui tam</span> suit under New York’s False Claims Act (FCA). In defense, Vanguard argued that the FCA’s protection is unavailable to a lawyer whose suit relies on client confidences disclosed in violation of the lawyer’s professional duties. Recognizing that New York’s version of Rule 1.6(b) permits a lawyer to reveal client confidences only “to prevent the client <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page648" class="pagebreak" title="648">648</span>from committing a crime,” the court agreed. Siding with Vanguard, the court ruled that Danon had gone beyond Rule 1.6(b) in filing the <span style="font-style: italic;">qui tam</span> action, which revealed more confidential information than necessary to stop the alleged tax violations (which the court said could have been halted through means other than a <span style="font-style: italic;">qui tam</span> suit). Accordingly, the court dismissed Danon’s lawsuit. Do you think this is fair? Recall that Danon had raised his concerns within the company to no avail. What other routes of disclosure might have been more appropriate or effective if Vanguard was violating tax law? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In its opinion, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Danon</span> court relied in part on a Formal Opinion by the New York County Lawyers’ Association. Issued in 2013, that opinion stated: “As a general principle, there are few circumstances, if any, in which, in the Committee’s view, it would be reasonably necessary within the meaning of 1.6(b) for a lawyer to pursue the steps necessary to collect a bounty as a reward for revealing confidential information.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1402" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1402" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> Do you agree? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2013, Sanford Wadler, general counsel of life sciences product manufacturer Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., drafted a memo to the company’s audit committee in which he stated his belief, based on legal analysis, that Bio-Rad employees in China had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by engaging in and covering up bribery. The memo laid out the evidence of wrongdoing and recommended that the company “promptly conduct an in depth investigation into business practices in China.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1403" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1403" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> In response, Bio-Rad retained outside counsel to conduct an investigation, which concluded that there was “no evidence to date of any violation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1404" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1404" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> Three days later, Bio-Rad’s CEO fired Wadler.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Wadler responded by initiating a three-prong retaliation claim against Bio-Rad. First, he sought protection under Sarbanes-Oxley § 806, which prohibits retaliation against an employee who lawfully reports conduct reasonably believed to violate “any rule and regulation” of the SEC. Second, he drew upon the Dodd-Frank Act, which protects whistleblowers who provide “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1405" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1405" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> Third, he relied on California public policy as set forth in <a id="dabmci_d0967ff46a47484d8bc470bc8a8f130f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Tameny v.

Atlantic Richfield Co.</span>, 610 P.2d 1330 (Cal. 1980), which held that employees were protected from retaliation for reporting a violation of fundamental public policy. Wadler’s case ultimately made it to trial, and a jury found that Bio-Rad had violated all three laws and returned a verdict of nearly $11 million in Wadler’s favor.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed on the federal counts, though it upheld Wadler’s state law retaliation claim. The court vacated the Dodd-Frank verdict based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in <a id="dabmci_0c43248892c34cd1b7ef14b7dda874c2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Digital Realty Trust Inc. v.

Ct. 767 (2018), which held that protections only extend to employees who report to the SEC (which Wadler did not). With reference to the claim of retaliation under Sarbanes-Oxley, the court held that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page649" class="pagebreak" title="649">649</span>reporting FCPA violations was not “protected activity,” since Sarbanes-Oxley only prohibited retaliation for reporting violations of SEC administrative rules and regulations.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1406" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1406" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> However, the court upheld the state law <span style="font-style: italic;">Tameny</span> claim, since <a id="dabmci_c8f184ab3c8e4df5b7532f1866fa81ae" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Wadler was fired for raising a violation of FCPA, which was, in the court’s view, based on a fundamental public policy.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1407" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1407" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> As a result, the court let stand nearly $8 million in damages to Wadler. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Unsatisfied, Bio-Rad filed a petition for rehearing en banc (which the Ninth Circuit rejected). Its main argument was that Wadler’s state law claim was based on being fired for protected activity under federal law (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>., reporting a violation of the FCPA)—a claim the court had already vacated. Do you think it is appropriate for a court to provide whistleblower protections under <span style="font-style: italic;">state</span> law for reporting a company’s <span style="font-style: italic;">federal</span> law violation, when the federal law itself does not provide protection?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Whistleblowers are often portrayed as heroic, acting from a selfless purpose and exhibiting courage in standing up to powerful systems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1408" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1408" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span> In truth, “[w]hile some whistleblowing may be most altruistic, some also occurs for mostly or wholly self-serving reasons, and the bulk most likely lies in between.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1409" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1409" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> Often, whistleblowers are complicated figures. For example, Mark Felt, Deep Throat in the Watergate scandal, was motivated in part by the desire to undermine the acting FBI director at the time, whom he sought to replace.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1410" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1410" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> Should that enter into the analysis?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What other structures might encourage ethical resistance in contexts such as those described above?

      </ul>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Which of these suggestions seem most promising? What other measures might be useful?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861613" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219160" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756567" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908700" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In-House Counsel</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The issues of client counseling and reporting misconduct take on unique features when lawyers themselves are employed by their organizational clients. This is the situation in which in-house counsel find themselves. How does a lawyer navigate her ethical duties when the representatives of the client are also her colleagues and even her bosses? What does it do to a lawyer’s independent judgment when a fundamental disagreement with the client might cost the lawyer her job? This part explores these questions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The evolution of in-house counsel positions has placed certain issues of ethical responsibility in new contexts. Although the percentage of lawyers working for private industry has remained fairly stable over the last quarter-century, the absolute size and status of corporate legal departments have grown substantially. Between 1997 and 2008, the 2,000 largest law departments grew an average of 4.8 percent per year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1412" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1412" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> In-house counsel have also grown in power, prominence and prestige, and, in many industries, have replaced outside firms as the primary counselor for the CEO and board of directors.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1413" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1413" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> In-house lawyers have also increasingly assumed central functions in providing basic legal services, selecting and monitoring outside attorneys, and attempting to prevent legal problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1414" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1414" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In-house counsel’s enhanced role reflects the changing scope and complexity of legal issues facing corporations. Increasing globalization, competition, and activism by regulators and nongovernmental organizations have required more attention. Over the past two decades, businesses have discovered that they can resolve many issues more quickly, cheaply, and effectively using in-house staff, who are familiar with business structure, employees, records, and objectives; who do not have to accommodate other clients’ demands; and who have no incentive to bill unnecessary hours. At the same time, the in-house job has become more attractive to lawyers with top credentials since an in-house position <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page651" class="pagebreak" title="651">651</span>often offers more regular and reasonable hours, less travel, and more professional stability, as compared to an outside counsel position, even while compensation remains competitive.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The role of in-house counsel presents both special opportunities and particular challenges. The opportunities arise because counsel are more knowledgeable concerning the organization’s legal issues and have closer continuing relationships with those who can act for it. The challenges arise because lawyers can’t simply “fire the client” who disregards their counsel or leaves them out of the loop. The status and livelihoods of in-house counsel are connected to, and in many ways, dependent on, the actions of business managers who in-house counsel may believe are acting illegally or unethically. How lawyers should respond in these circumstances is the subject of the discussion that follows. In the passage below, Robert Jackall describes the complex choices in-house counsel confront.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">122–23 (1988).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Drawing lines when information is scarce becomes doubly ambiguous, a problem that often emerges in shaping relationships with one’s colleagues. For instance, Black, a lawyer at Covenant Corporation, received a call from a chemical plant manager who had just been served with an order from the local fire department to build retaining dikes around several storage tanks for toxic chemicals so that firemen would not be in danger of being drenched with the substance should the tanks burst if there were a fire at the plant. The plant manager indicated that meeting the order would cause him to miss his numbers badly that year and he wondered aloud if the fire chief might, for a consideration, be persuaded to forget the whole thing. Black pointed out that he could not countenance even a discussion of bribery; the plant manager laughed and said that he was only joking and would think things over and get back to Black in a few weeks. Black never heard from the plant manager about this issue again; when they met on different occasions after that, the conversation was always framed around other subjects. Black did inquire discreetly and found out that no dikes had been built; the plant manager had apparently gone shopping for a more flexible legal opinion. Should he, Black wondered, pursue the matter or in the absence of any firm evidence just let things drop, particularly since others, for their own purposes, could misconstrue the fact that he had not acted on his earlier marginal knowledge? Feeling that one is in the dark can be somewhat unnerving.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">More unnerving, however, is the feeling that one is being kept in the dark. Reed, another lawyer at Covenant, was working on the legal issues of a chemical dumpsite that Alchemy Inc. [a subsidiary of Covenant] had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page652" class="pagebreak" title="652">652</span>sold. He suddenly received a call from a former employee who had been having trouble with the company on his pension payments; this man told Reed that unless things were straightened out in a hurry, he planned to talk to federal officials about all the pesticides buried in the site. This was alarming news. Reed had no documentation about pesticides in the site; if Alchemy had buried pesticides there, a whole new set of regulations might apply to the situation and to Covenant as the former owner. Reed went to the chemical company’s director of personnel to get the former employee’s file but was unable to obtain it. Reed’s boss agreed to help, but still the director of personnel refused to release the file. After repeated calls, Reed was told that the file had been lost. Reed went back to his boss and inquired whether it might be prudent for Covenant to repurchase the site to keep it under control. This was deemed a good idea. However, the asking price for the site was now three times what Covenant had sold it for. Everyone, of course, got hesitant; another lawyer became involved and began working closely with Reed’s boss on the issue. Gradually, Reed found himself excluded from discussions about the problem and unable to obtain information that he felt was important to his work. His anxiety was heightened because he felt he was involved in a matter of some legal gravity. But, like much else in the corporation, this problem disappeared in the night. Eventually, Reed was assigned to other cases and he knew that the doors to the issue were closed, locked, and bolted.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Black and Reed find themselves cut “out of the loop” of information when they raise questions concerning possible violations by other company officials. Yet both of them sense that the problems they noted—the possibility of bribery by the chemical plant manager (Black) and the possibility that the company was doing nothing about dangerous pesticides (Reed)—have not gone away. How should they respond? Are there any affirmative steps they may take to find out what has happened? If so, <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> they follow up on the matter?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Professor William Simon writes: “Every corporate lawyer knows that the manager is not the client. . . . [F]ew corporate lawyers have a coherent idea of what a corporate client could be other than the manager.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1415" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1415" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span> How much help do the Rules provide in figuring out what a corporate client could be other than the manager? As discussed earlier, Rule 1.13 states that an organization’s lawyer represents the organization and has special duties to safeguard the organization from employees’ illegal actions. Does that Rule tell Black and Reed how to proceed? Does it adequately take account of the public’s interest? Does it provide lawyers with adequate leverage in conversations with corporate officers? That is, does the Rule permit them to say truthfully something like: “I could be subject to discipline if I didn’t follow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page653" class="pagebreak" title="653">653</span>through on this matter!” If not, how would you draft an ethical rule or statutory provision that would help Black and Reed?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Jackall notes that “drawing lines when information is scarce becomes doubly ambiguous”—“doubly,” because there is no clear answer either to the question “what happened?” or to the question “is what happened acceptable?” Does the scarcity of information absolve a lawyer from responsibility for drawing lines? It may seem that the answer is clearly “yes”: one cannot be held responsible for what goes on behind one’s back. But in that case, an organization could absolve all but a handful of its employees from responsibility simply by dividing and controlling information within the organization. If an organization should not be able to restrict responsibility so easily, how would you prevent it?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> respond to the situations facing Black and Reed? Do the responsibilities of inside and outside counsel differ in such circumstances? How helpful are Rules 1.13<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.13&quot; " />, 1.6<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.6&quot; " />, and 5.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;5.1&quot; " />?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Consider the role of in-house counsel in identifying and reporting misconduct by corporate representatives in the context of the following case study of Hewlett Packard (HP). As you read the case study, consider who is speaking on behalf of the client and how that impacts the responsibilities of different lawyers in the company’s general counsel office. What might the lawyers have done to prevent the controversy?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 2006, the Silicon Valley computer company HP became embroiled in a highly publicized scandal. Problems arose from “pretexting,” the use of investigators to obtain confidential information through false pretenses. In this case, HP management used pretexting to investigate members of its own board of directors, among others. The case provides a highly illuminating portrait of “how the good go bad”—how well-intentioned lawyers and managers can become complicit in conduct widely viewed as unethical if not unlawful.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The scandal dates back to 2005, when leaks of confidential information accompanied the widely publicized firing of HP’s CEO, Carly Fiorina. Patricia Dunn, a member of the board of directors, became its new chair, and Mark Hurd became CEO. Among Dunn’s first challenges was to address leaks that could only have come from board members or top executives.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finding the leaker took on extra seriousness in January 2006, when a reporter ran a story on HP’s long-term strategy. Board member George Keyworth later acknowledged having been the reporter’s anonymous <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page654" class="pagebreak" title="654">654</span>source. He did not believe he had disclosed any proprietary information to her and considered the story to be good press. HP’s leadership, by contrast, viewed the story with alarm. HP’s general counsel, Ann Baskins, asked an HP employment lawyer, Ken Hunsaker, to head an investigation to root out the leaker. Hunsaker took on the assignment with gusto, and through pretexting (impersonating HP board members and others), Hunsaker and his team of investigators obtained phone records of HP employees, directors, and journalists. They also created a fictional disgruntled HP employee who emailed the reporter who wrote the January 2006 story and attached to the email a file with tracking capability. The investigative team hoped that the reporter would forward the email to her source for confirmation. Hurd, HP’s CEO, authorized the process but later denied knowledge of the tracking aspect.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Around the same time, Baskins asked Hunsaker to further explore the legality of pretexting. Hunsaker put the question to an HP security manager who responded that pretexting was common. In the security manager’s view, the practice was “on the edge, but above board.” Hunsaker’s now infamous email answer responded: “I should not have asked.” Beyond that, Hunsaker spent only an hour researching the issue online. It is not clear what sources he consulted, but had he looked at the websites of the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission, he would have discovered that both considered the practice illegal.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The following month, in February 2006, the pretexting issue arose again. Two HP security employees sent an email to Hunsaker stating that pretexting “is very unethical at the least and probably illegal.” Around the same time, Baskins again asked Hunsaker about the legality of pretexting, and he put the question to Ronald DeLia, a security contractor. This time, DeLia consulted his outside counsel. That lawyer offered a quick judgment, based on research done by a summer associate the preceding year, that pretexting was not illegal; the lawyer later claimed that he had not been hired to research the issue. DeLia then sent an email to Hunsaker indicating that no state or federal laws prohibited pretexting but that there was “a risk of litigation.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In March, Hunsaker circulated a report connecting board member Keyworth to the leaks. In preparation for a meeting with Hurd, Baskins instructed Hunsaker to talk to outside counsel about pretexting. Hunsaker asked the security manager to consult DeLia’s lawyer. This time, the lawyer had a paralegal prepare a response. She told the security manager that she was unable to find any criminal charges to indicate that pretexting was illegal. In April, at Baskin’s request, Hunsaker prepared a memo on the legal issues raised by pretexting. He noted his online research and his contacts with DeLia and his outside counsel. According to the memo, DeLia’s outside counsel had conducted “extensive research” (which it had not) and found the practice “not unlawful.”</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page655" class="pagebreak" title="655">655</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In May, a divided board asked Keyworth (the leaker) to resign. One of its most influential members, Tom Perkins, objected to the decision and resigned in protest. Perkins also recalled objecting to the legality of pretexting, though Dunn, the board’s chair, and other board members recalled no such objection. Larry Sonsini, HP’s outside counsel, then contacted Perkins asking how to handle the resignation. Post-Enron reforms require that a company report board resignations to the SEC, and if the resignation stems from any disagreement with the company or the board, the reasons must also be disclosed. Perkins said his disagreement was with Dunn, not the company, and the SEC report included no reasons.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Perkins subsequently consulted law professor Viet Dinh, who served with him on another board. Professor Dinh raised concerns about pretexting that Perkins then conveyed to Sonsini. Sonsini responded that pretext calls were a “common investigatory method” and that “[i]t appears, therefore, that the process was well done and within legal limits.” Perkins relayed this to Dinh who expressed doubts that the records could have been lawfully obtained. Perkins’s dissatisfaction continued to escalate after he received a notice from the phone company suggesting that his phone records were “hacked.” He was also angry that the minutes of his final board meeting did not reflect the objections to pretexting that he recalled making. Perkins demanded that the minutes be amended and that the company file a notice with the SEC since he now considered his dispute to be with the company rather than merely with Dunn. Baskins subsequently wrote to Perkins denying his requests, because the minutes had been approved and were accurate as drafted, and because he had earlier characterized the reasons for his resignation as personal. Perkins, now represented by Dinh, then contacted the SEC, the California Attorney General, and the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, which all launched investigations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A national scandal erupted, fueled by congressional hearings at which Dunn and Hurd testified and the two in-house lawyers, Baskins and Hunsaker, invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege. Dunn, Baskins, Hunsaker, and the security manager were all forced to resign. The California Attorney General charged Dunn, Hunsaker, DeLia, and two private investigators with four felony counts: fraudulent wire communications, wrongful use of computer data, identity theft, and conspiracy. The counts were later reduced to misdemeanors. A state court dismissed the charges against Dunn, and then later against all other defendants, based on evidence that they had performed community service. One investigator pleaded guilty to federal charges.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In his congressional testimony, Hurd apologized for the “rogue” investigation and for authorizing the fake email. Patricia Dunn, on the other hand, stated: “I do not accept personal responsibility for what happened.” She added: “I relied on the expertise of others in whom I had full confidence. I deeply regret that so many people, including me, were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page656" class="pagebreak" title="656">656</span>let down.” Larry Sonsini maintained that his response to Perkins about the legality of pretexting was not a “legal opinion. It was conveying the truth of what I was told.” Ann Baskin made no public statement. Her lawyer told <span style="font-style: italic;">New Yorker</span> reporter James Stewart: “A general counsel has to be able to rely on her senior counsel’s research and advice, particularly when she has hundreds of lawyers working for her worldwide.” Hunsaker’s lawyer assured Stewart that “[t]here cannot be a violation without intent to violate the law and Kevin absolutely believed that the investigation was being done in a legal and proper way.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The financial and personal effects of the scandal varied considerably. HP reimbursed Perkins for $1.5 million in legal expenses and agreed to pay Keyworth’s as well. Ann Baskin, in exchange for cooperating with HP’s investigation and releasing the company from liability, received the right to exercise stock options worth over $3.7 million, with another $1 million in options to vest immediately. Mark Hurd, who according to Dunn, had received the same legal advice that she had received, got a bonus of $8.6 million in 2007, along with options on over 500,000 shares of stock. HP stock rose to its highest value in over six years.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Both Congress and the California legislature subsequently passed legislation making pretexting a criminal defense.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In this case study, at least five lawyers confronted the legality of pretexting: HP’s in-house counsel Baskins and Hunsaker, investigator DeLia’s outside counsel (whose research was done by a summer associate and a paralegal), HP’s outside counsel Sonsini (who denied offering a legal opinion), and Dinh, the counsel for the board member who resigned in protest. Of the five, Dinh was the only one who objected to pretexting. How would you evaluate the conduct of the lawyers in the HP case? What accounts for their conduct? Could, or should, any of the attorneys be subject to professional discipline or malpractice liability? Did any violate Rule 1.1 regarding competence? Did any fail to exercise appropriate supervisory responsibility?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1417" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1417" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span> What would you have done in their place?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the aftermath of the scandal, HP hired Bart M. Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor, to evaluate the company’s ethical policies and its conduct of investigations. He told a <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> reporter that he was struck by the lack of consideration of ethical issues in the company’s efforts to trace press leaks. “Doing it legally should not be the test; that is given. You have to ask what is appropriate and what is ethical.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1418" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1418" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> What might explain the absence of ethical considerations for HP lawyers and managers? What lessons does their experience hold for general counsel? </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page657" class="pagebreak" title="657">657</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />“Where were the lawyers?,” asked one member of Congress in hearings on the HP scandal. “The red flags were waving all over the place,” but “none of the lawyers stepped up to their responsibilities.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1419" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1419" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> In search of explanations, some commentators have built on identity theory and research. This framework demonstrates how individuals’ role identification can encourage them to process information in ways that support their self-perception.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1420" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1420" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span> So, for example, a survey of several hundred in-house counsel found that those who identified themselves more as an employee than a lawyer were more likely to interpret an attorney’s obligations in a hypothetical ethical dilemma in ways consistent with management’s interests rather than with professional norms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1421" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1421" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span> Could such dynamics have been at work in the HP scandal? What correctives might be effective?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How the allocation of work to in-house counsel affects the exercise of ethical responsibility is a matter of longstanding debate. The traditional view has been that inside counsel would have less ability to check corporate misconduct because of their greater economic and psychological dependency on the company and their socialization into organizational culture. (In some civil law countries, where ethical rules place special emphasis on lawyers’ independence from their clients, in-house counsel are categorized as a separate profession altogether whose members do not belong to the bar.) Compounding the above, where a significant part of in-house attorneys’ compensation involves stock options, there may be economic incentives to overvalue the company’s short-term profit objectives at the expense of long-term values. To the extent that in-house counsel participate in shaping policies and transactions, these lawyers may have difficulty later exercising independent judgment concerning the legal issues involved.<a id="_Ref32240150" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1422" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1422" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> As the Jackall and HP case studies make clear, lawyers, like other managerial employees, face considerable pressure to remain team players. The same has been true of general counsel in other corporate scandals, such as Enron and Tyco. According to Steven Gillers, the job of in-house attorney is the most “ethically challenged position in the legal profession,” because “the client is the corporation but the directions come from management.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1423" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1423" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span> That difficulty is reflected in the significant number of criminal prosecutions of in-house counsel for aiding and abetting fraud.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1424" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1424" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span> In recognition of these compromising <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page658" class="pagebreak" title="658">658</span>influences, audit companies composed of independent directors often rely on outside counsel for advice on ethics and compliance issues.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1425" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1425" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Yet comparable pressures can exist for outside counsel. Many firm lawyers bill a substantial percentage of their time to a single client and find that it is “sometimes easier to say ‘no’ to a captive client than to a client who may take its business elsewhere.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1426" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1426" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> Moreover, outside lawyers may be less able to exercise their independence because they may have less access to information and fewer informal channels of influence. Eve Spangler’s study of lawyers working for organizations comments on this debate:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">In any comparison of in-house and outside legal services, law firms maintain that their independence is their single most significant asset. One law firm partner explains:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">It is not uncommon for us to tell the president that he’s a turkey. You know, “You’re a goddamn fool, and you’ve got an environmental problem right now and you’ve got to spend a million dollars to fix it even though it will lose you money this year, or you’re going to go to jail. That’s the magnitude of your problem.” I’d like to hear an in-house lawyer say that to a president who just had a stockholders meeting where he’s promised them the world. I’d like to see an in-house lawyer tell his board of directors that his president is violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The fact is, there’s just no room for willful blindness at that level. If you have both loyalties and accountability to the superior, you can’t be independent.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">This stance is in sharp contrast to that of the in-house lawyers who say, “I am first a corporate officer and second I happen to be a lawyer,” or, again, “I’m pretty much [a company man] through and through.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1427" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1427" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Nevertheless, the in-house attorneys Spangler interviewed insisted that they rarely face situations where job pressures would force them to compromise their judgment. They reported that they meet their ethical obligations by counseling executives to look to the long-term interests of the company rather than short-term advantage. And, when executives reject their advice, they report up the ladder when they have to even though it creates difficulties working with people “ ‘after you’ve brought the world down on their heads.’ ”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1428" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1428" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In a practical sense, much of the debate over inside and outside lawyers’ ethical autonomy may have missed the mark. As Elliot Freidson observes, “surely the more critical matter is the relationship one has to the market” and to one’s superiors, whether they are corporate managers or senior <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page659" class="pagebreak" title="659">659</span>attorneys in a firm.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1429" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1429" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span> Lawyers’ economic and psychological sense of vulnerability and the support available for ethical resistance is likely to be more significant than whether a particular lawyer practices in a corporate or law firm setting.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2003, the ABA Task Force on Corporate Responsibility recommended that a public company’s board of directors, not management, be given responsibility for the selection, retention, and compensation of general counsel, and that the attorneys in that position have regular meetings with the board’s independent directors to discuss legal compliance matters.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1430" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1430" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> To what extent would this practice assist in-house counsel facing difficult ethical issues?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A related, equally important issue is: Under what circumstances should either in-house or outside counsel withdraw from representation because a client declines to accept the lawyer’s advice? Geoffrey Hazard observes that representation of clients on an ongoing basis imposes moral responsibility for the client’s conduct in a sense that representation of clients for past acts does not. To defend an individual charged with murder is not the same as being “on retainer to the Mafia,” he insists.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What follows from that distinction? Hazard goes on to argue:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The obvious answer for the advisor whose advice is ignored is that he can resign. In some circumstances that is the only honorable course to be followed, but it is impractical as a response to all except fundamental disagreements. More important, though not often recognized by the critics of legal and other advisors to corporations, the sanction of resignation involves some ethical problems of its own. If taken seriously, it should be applicable only when any right-thinking advisor would resign. But this is to say that such a client ought to have no right-thinking advisor at all, at least until the client redirects his conduct so that it would no longer be objectionable to a right-thinking advisor. There are situations in which it seems proper that the client should suffer that kind of penalty, for example if he insists on fabricating evidence or carrying out a swindle. But if the case is less extreme than this, the sanction of resignation is too severe. It implies that the client should have to function without proper guidance, or perhaps cease functioning at all, because its managers do not see fit to follow the advice of its advisors. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If this were the consequence that should ensue from a client’s refusal to follow advice, it would mean that the advice was in effect peremptory—not an informed suggestion but a command. When an advisor’s advice is in effect peremptory, however, the result is a reversal of the underlying structure of responsibility for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page660" class="pagebreak" title="660">660</span>organization’s conduct. The advisor becomes the ultimate arbiter and the client a subordinate. . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">It seems unlikely that such a transfer of responsibility is contemplated by those who say that an advisor has some kind of responsibility for what his principal does. Probably it is assumed that the organization will not be left helpless for want of essential assistance, but rather that some other advisor will come along to take the place of the right-thinking advisor who resigns. This assumption, however, has some curious implications. It may mean that an equally high-minded advisor can step in as successor because he was not involved before. As a result, that which is reprehensible when done by one advisor in continuous service becomes acceptable when done by multiple advisors acting in a relay. . . . On the other hand, the assumption may be that a less high-minded successor can be expected to take over. If so, it reduces the significance of resignation to a merely personal matter and perhaps a case of narcissism. (It may also have the result of simply insulating the client from conscientious advisors in the future.) Still another possibility is that the client will figure out how to retain high-minded advisors without creating situations in which they will feel impelled to resign; the client will learn not to ask for advice in the cases that might put his counsel under that kind of pressure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1431" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1431" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you agree? Would you accept such rationales for continued employment in less respectable contexts (for example, by accused war criminals who argued that their replacements would have been worse)? Is it possible that lawyers’ threats of resignation could up the moral <a id="dabmci_0b6600386d45451b8274a810526170e6" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ante and encourage clients to rethink their conduct as well as encourage other attorneys to do the same? Is advice really peremptory as long as the advisor is not the proverbial “last lawyer in town,” a presumably rare circumstance for corporate counsel?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">When lawyers represent the government—be it as a lawyer for a government agency charged with defending it from lawsuits or a city attorney advising lawmakers on the legality of proposed local policy—the ethics rules generally applicable to lawyers apply with equal force. Government lawyers are organizational lawyers after all: they work on behalf of government bodies whose interests and goals define the role that those lawyers play. Accordingly, government lawyers, like their private sector counterparts, must fully adhere to the reporting duties set forth in Rule 1.13, as well as other fundamental ethical standards that have formed the central focus of our inquiry in this chapter. What <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> change when we turn our gaze to government practice is the context in which professional duties are interpreted and enacted, which influences <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page661" class="pagebreak" title="661">661</span>how government lawyers understand what they can and cannot do. The ethical context of government lawyers, as we explore in this section, can cut in different directions. On the one hand, government lawyers work in contexts in which the identity of the “client” is often less clear than in the private sector, and, moreover, the government lawyer’s “role as a gatekeeper for upholding the rule of law” may impose heightened duties to orient the lawyer’s actions toward advancing some conception of the public good.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1432" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1432" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> This creates ethical questions when government lawyers are placed in the position of defending government interests: Should they represent the government with zealous partisanship? Should their representation soft-pedal certain positions to more closely align with the public interest? And when should government lawyers have autonomy to define goals and strategies.<a id="_Ref32240425" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1433" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1433" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> On the other hand, a government lawyer can face significant pressure by powerful government officials to pursue policy objectives that the lawyer may believe to be of dubious legality. This section deals with both of these complex issues. </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc41908706" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Who Is the Client? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">We begin with the fundamental, and surprisingly difficult, question: Who precisely is “the client” of the government lawyer? Theoretically, the client could be the public, the government as a whole, the branch of government in which the lawyer is employed, the agency in which the lawyer works, or the officials responsible for the lawyer’s actions.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">That difficulty arises in a wide variety of factual settings. In some instances, lawyers in one agency, like the DOJ or a state attorney general’s office, are responsible for representing another agency’s position but find that position inconsistent with applicable laws, policies, or societal concerns. In other contexts, higher authorities within the lawyers’ own agency or the central administration may direct line-level lawyers to act in ways that they find similarly problematic. For example, a change in administration during the pendency of litigation may result in directives for a government lawyer to “switch sides,” although the lawyer believes that the new position is unsupported by the law or facts. Dilemmas also arise when the legislative or executive branch is unwilling to provide adequate funding for government institutions, such as prisons or mental health facilities. Government attorneys may then be in the position of defending conditions that they believe violate constitutional standards or individual rights. Another common problem involves confidential information that lawyers believe should be shared with other legislative, executive, or judicial decisionmakers or with the general public.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Analyzing this question, courts, commentators, and bar ethical codes have expressed different views, although they all maintain that lawyers </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page662" class="pagebreak" title="662">662</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> The difficulty lies in determining what constitutes the public’s interest and what it requires when members of the government disagree. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">One prominent position posits that the client is the government agency that employs the lawyer.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> This “agency approach” is reflected in Rule 1.13 of the Federal Bar Associations’ Model Rules of Professional Conduct for Federal Lawyers. However, the Rule includes the caveat that a government lawyer may have “authority to question [agency] . . . conduct more extensively than . . . a lawyer for a private organization in similar circumstances.”</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">offers a variation of the agency approach. Comment </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10.5pt;">c</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> to § 97 suggests that, in most cases, the client of the government lawyer is the agency involved in the underlying dispute but that the lawyer’s responsibility may differ depending on the circumstances. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The agency approach has both pros and cons. The primary advantages of the agency approach are clarity and political accountability. By limiting the government lawyer’s discretion to make independent judgments of the public’s interest, this approach vests decisionmaking authority with elected officials who may have a broader perspective and are theoretically responsible to the public. Critics charge, however, that the agency approach reflects an unrealistic assumption of political oversight and an impoverished conception of the government lawyer’s social responsibilities. After all, most government decisions are made by middle-level bureaucrats who are not in any direct sense subject to majoritarian control. Even senior agency officials have attenuated democratic accountability. High-ranking federal officials can owe their appointment to a single election where no candidate has even received a majority of the popular vote.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1437" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1437" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> More fundamentally, the agency-as-client framework may unduly restrict the lawyer’s obligation as a government employee to ensure that government policy is appropriately carried out. Where, for example, higher-level officials are directing a lawyer to act in ways that defy applicable law, regulations, or well-established legal principles, some effort to challenge that decision is consistent with democratic values.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">To that end, a rival approach—endorsed by the Model Rules—identifies the government lawyer’s client more broadly. Comment 9 to Rule 1.13 (which governs the organization as client) explains:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[9]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The duty defined in this Rule applies to governmental organizations. Defining precisely the identity of the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers may be </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page663" class="pagebreak" title="663">663</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">more difficult in the government context and is a matter beyond the scope of these Rules. . . . Although in some circumstances the client may be a specific agency, it may also be a branch of government, such as the executive branch, or the government as a whole. For example, if the action or failure to act involves the head of a bureau, either the department of which the bureau is a part or the relevant branch of government may be the client for purposes of this Rule. Moreover, in a matter involving the conduct of government officials, a government lawyer may have authority under applicable law to question such conduct more extensively than that of a lawyer for a private organization in similar circumstances. . . .</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In its most expansive version, this approach counsels government lawyers to take action in accord with the “public interest,”</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.1438" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1438" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> This approach, however, raises many questions since what counts as the public interest or the rule of law in any given context may be deeply contested. Rule 1.13 itself provides little help in this regard: It places beyond its scope the question of what concrete actions lawyers should take in the face of wrongful conduct.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The independence of government lawyers from political pressure is a cornerstone of the rule of law, which exists to check political abuse. What can and should a government lawyer do when asked to defend a policy or take a legal position she thinks is contrary to law? One option is to resign. Perhaps the most famous case in this regard occurred during the Nixon administration. Archibald Cox, the first special prosecutor of the Watergate break-in, sought to compel Nixon to produce tapes of White House conversations concerning the cover-up. When Nixon asked Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox, Richardson instead resigned, as did his deputy William Ruckelshaus. The official next in line then followed the President’s orders and abolished the special prosecutor’s office. The public was outraged over what became known as the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and Nixon subsequently resigned under threat of impeachment. </p>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Lawyers in the Trump administration have faced what observers like Professor Bradley Wendel have characterized as serious threats to their independence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1441" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1441" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> Consider the series of decisions made by lawyers surrounding the 2016 presidential election. One of the most contested issues in the 2016 presidential election was the decision by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to use a private email server for government business while she was Secretary of State. The FBI, headed by former federal prosecutor James Comey, opened an investigation. His first controversial decision came on July 5, 2016, when Comey departed from longstanding FBI practice to comment publicly on the Bureau’s finding that Clinton had used her personal email to review at least thirty-six classified emails. Comey characterized the conduct as “extremely careless” rather than criminal, and stated the FBI would not recommend charges against her.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1442" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1442" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span> His second decision, two weeks before the 2016 election, was to disclose that the FBI had reopened the investigation after discovering hundreds of thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton on the personal computer of one of Clinton’s staff members, who was married to former Congressman Anthony Weiner, himself under investigation for sexting with an underage girl. Reflecting on his pre-election announcement, Comey stated he was concerned that he could not complete an investigation of the newly discovered emails before the November 8th election and that he faced two “terrible options” about whether to disclose the inquiry. As he saw it, “to speak might affect the election. To fail to speak would be an affirmative act of concealment.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1443" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1443" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span> As between those options, he considered that concealment would be worse. After Comey’s announcement, Trump stated: “What happened today, starting with the FBI—maybe the system will become a little less rigged,” and went on the next day to convey his “respect” for what Comey did.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1444" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1444" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span> Comey’s announcement was viewed by many credible sources as a significant factor tipping the election to Trump.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">As it turned out, as the FBI was investigating the Clinton emails, it also opened an investigation into Russian meddling in the ongoing presidential election. Because he had been implicated in misleading Congress during his confirmation hearings about his own contacts with Russia during Trump’s campaign, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation on March 2, 2017. After Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the Russia investigation on March 20, Trump began discussing firing Comey with his aides and asked CIA director Mike Pompeo to intervene, which he declined to do.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1445" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1445" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span> Trump then called Comey to ask if Comey would “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation by confirming publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In April, Rod Rosenstein was confirmed as deputy attorney general, and he took over the Russian investigation, given Sessions’s recusal. On May 3, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page665" class="pagebreak" title="665">665</span>2017, Comey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he explained his actions in relation to the Clinton email investigation while refusing to discuss whether he was investigating collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Furious, Trump resolved to fire Comey and, soon thereafter, on May 8, Trump met with Sessions and Rosenstein, who agreed to write a letter justifying Comey’s termination. In the letter, Rosenstein stated that “I cannot defend the Director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. . . . The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General’s authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1446" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1446" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span> Sessions followed with a brief letter to the president calling for “a fresh start” at the FBI.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1447" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1447" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> The following day, Trump sent a letter to Comey stating: “I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1448" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1448" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Trump immediately contradicted the letters’ formal reference to Comey’s handling of the Clinton email investigation as the basis for the termination, telling a reporter, “In fact when I decided to [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.<span style="color: #000000;">’ ”</span> A week later, on May 17, 2017, Rosenstein announced the appointment of Robert Mueller III as special counsel in charge of investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian election interference. After news reports indicated that Mueller was possibly pursuing an obstruction case against Trump for firing Comey (among other actions), in June 2017, Trump ordered White House Counsel Donald McGahn II to fire Mueller. McGahn refused, saying that he would quit before executing the order. Trump subsequently backed down.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1449" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1449" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The history and policy strongly suggest that, as a general matter, the Attorney General and subordinate prosecutors may not accept direction from the President but must make the ultimate decisions about how to conduct individual investigations and prosecutions, even at the risk of being fired for disobeying the President. The Constitution does not determine whether ultimate authority rests with the President or the prosecutors, leaving Congress to decide. Congress has not explicitly answered the question, but its silence since the late nineteenth century in the face of the evolving importance of prosecutorial independence suggests that Congress has acquiesced in a relationship in which the President may express views to the Attorney General, but the ultimate authority rests with the Attorney General or with subordinate prosecutors to whom the Attorney General delegates authority.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1452" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1452" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span></p>

This was the strategy taken by DOJ lawyer Sally Yates, who agreed to become acting Attorney General at the beginning of the Trump administration until a successor could be confirmed. In that role, Yates was immediately thrust into the controversial role of defending Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. Yates refused to defend the Muslim Ban, stating in a letter to DOJ lawyers that she was not “convinced that the executive order is lawful.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1453" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1453" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> For this, she was promptly fired by President Trump.

In a Ninth Circuit hearing in a case challenging the policy, Fabian was asked to argue in favor of the administration’s position that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page667" class="pagebreak" title="667">667</span>detentions complied with a prior settlement agreement requiring “safe and sanitary” conditions. Judge A. Wallace Tashima, himself detained as a boy in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II, asked: “It’s within everybody’s common understanding that if you don’t have a toothbrush, if you don’t have soap, if you don’t have a blanket, that’s not ‘safe and sanitary’. . . . Wouldn’t you agree with that?” Fabian replied, “Well, I think, in [Custom and Border Patrol] custody, it’s frequently intended to be much shorter term. So it may be that for a shorter-term stay in C.B.P. custody that some of those things may not be required.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1456" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1456" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span> An edited video of this exchange went viral, receiving 20 million views. In response, Fabian received death threats. Fabian, hired by the Justice Department under Obama to work in the DOJ’s Office of Immigration Litigation, posted a private message on Facebook: “I’m so sorry that happened and I wish I could go back and try to say something better to make the position more clear, and since I can’t lots of people may will hate me for a long time.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1457" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1457" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> Was there anything Fabian could have said to justify the government’s policy? Did she have any options other than resigning if she disagreed with how the children were being treated? </p>

In meetings with him, his assertions about what “everyone thinks” and what is “obviously true” wash over you, unchallenged . . . because he’s the president and he rarely stops talking. As a result, Mr. Trump pulls all of those present in a silent circle of assent. Speaking rapid fire with no spot for others to jump into the conversation, Mr. Trump makes everyone a co-conspirator to his preferred set of facts or delusions. . . . From the private circle of assent, it moves to public displays of personal fealty. . . . To stay you must be seen as on his team, so you make further compromises. . . . And then you are lost.

The case involved a condemnation proceeding in which government negotiators had worked out a property <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page668" class="pagebreak" title="668">668</span>valuation settlement with an elderly couple who were unrepresented by counsel. The offer was about a third of what county appraisers had estimated the property to be worth, and the couple was unaware of its value. Weinstein believed that it was inappropriate for a public servant to exploit the landowners’ ignorance, even though it would save taxpayers money, and decided to call them up and tell them they were entitled to more than they were asking for.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1459" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1459" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span> Do you agree with Weinstein’s analysis?

      <p class="TextParagraph">In this section, we set out the ethical terrain of government lawyering. We begin with an overview: illuminating the diversity of professional contexts in which government lawyers practice and discussing how that diversity shapes the ethical issues government lawyers face and how they address them. We then turn to focus on the special problem of <span style="font-style: italic;">advising</span> the government about the legality of policy, using the infamous case of the Office of Legal Counsel’s “Torture Memos” as a case study.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadParagraph">
        <a id="_Toc451861589" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ethical Contexts of Government Lawyering</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">While approximately 10 percent of lawyers are employed by the government, this figure obscures wide variation in practice site and style.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1460" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1460" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> For one, lawyers work at different levels of government—federal, state, and local—and, within these levels, are employed by different entities—courts, executives, administrative agencies, and legislatures. Moreover, government lawyers hold different roles and engage in distinct types of practice. Some, as we saw in Chapter 8, are prosecutors with ethical duties to seek “justice” in enforcing criminal law, while others engage in civil litigation. Still other government lawyers play an exclusively advisory role. Much of government lawyer advising is routine: providing risk assessments to lawmakers about the legality of policy proposals or executive action, and often drafting policy to comport with legal requirements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1461" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1461" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span> In one final variation, across all of these contexts, a small subset of government lawyers are political appointees charged specifically with advancing a particular administration’s policy priorities, while most are “career” lawyers who staff agencies and carry out their functions across administrations despite changes in the governing party. </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page669" class="pagebreak" title="669">669</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This wide variation makes it impossible to draw general conclusions about any monolithic “ethics” of government lawyering, but it does help us to frame different types of professional challenges government lawyers face. We note at the outset that our discussion largely brackets the ethical duties of one class of government lawyers, prosecutors, whose special ethical obligations are more fully treated in Chapter 8.B.’s discussion of advocacy in the criminal law system. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Within the government’s corps of civil lawyers, as indicated above, one may differentiate between those who engage in litigation from those whose primary role is advising. Civil litigators work at all levels, defending government when sued and engaging in affirmative litigation to advance defined governmental interests. Lawyers in the DOJ’s Civil Division, for example, defend the federal government against a range of lawsuits arising out of federal policy, while also bringing affirmative litigation to recoup money lost to the federal government through fraud. Similarly, state attorneys general and city attorneys play defensive and offensive roles, with an increasing number filing affirmative litigation to enforce local policy around issues like public health and consumer protection, while challenging the federal government’s policies on health care, climate change, and immigrant rights.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1462" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1462" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span> Governmental agencies also have their own counsel who are authorized to pursue legal action to enforce their mandates. For instance, state employment and labor agencies regularly pursue litigation to enforce the rights of workers denied minimum wage or overtime, or who have been discriminated against; these cases overlap with private enforcement actions but are typically brought when claims are insufficient to attract private counsel or when they raise significant policy considerations. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although, as we have seen, it is widely accepted that criminal prosecutors have special duties to the public, Professor Bradley Wendel argues that “[g]overnment lawyers appearing in a litigated proceeding in a civil matter on behalf of the United States or a particular federal agency or officer are advocates like any other.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1463" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1463" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> However, agency lawyers are not of one mind on a government lawyer’s appropriate ethical conduct in litigation, taking different views on such questions as whether the government should disclose adverse material facts, assert a statute of limitations, or fail to inform opposing counsel of impending procedural defects in order to defeat an otherwise meritorious claim.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1464" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1464" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>State attorneys general have clashed with governors and legislatures over whether to defend or bring lawsuits, such as challenges to the federal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page670" class="pagebreak" title="670">670</span>comprehensive healthcare reform act.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1465" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1465" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> In one oft-cited case, Abner Mikva, then Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit, chided attorneys for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who pursued an appeal after it was clearly moot. Judge Mikva said it was “astonishing” that the government lawyers could “so unblushingly deny that . . . [they have] obligations that might trump the desire to pound an opponent into submission.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1466" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1466" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Outside of litigation, government lawyers routinely counsel and advise public officials about their legal responsibilities. As we discussed in Chapter 10, under Rule 2.1, when any lawyer acts as an advisor, that lawyer “shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice,” which means having to provide objective legal interpretations that accurately convey legal risks. Typically, government lawyers’ interpretations of law are never tested in court. Their advice to officials may be confidential, and it may lead officials to make decisions that do not become public. Even when officials’ interpretations of law are challenged, courts may refuse to review executive actions for constitutional reasons grounded in the separation of powers. Sometimes courts regard the issues as political questions, or questions about which the executive deserves deference. When, for one reason or another, judicial review is lacking, the legal interpretations government lawyers provide to officials become, for all practical purposes, binding law. Arguably, this places a special burden on government lawyers. In Wendel’s view, advising </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">envisions a highly fiduciary role in which lawyers use reasonable care and effort to provide accurate, unbiased advice to clients, who then are responsible for deciding how to proceed. There is nothing wrong with advising the client that one proposed route is likely contrary to applicable law, but suggesting there may be a different route to the same goal that would be legally permissible.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1467" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1467" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph">In addition, some have argued that government lawyers have heightened responsibilities of fidelity to law because they are themselves government officials.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1468" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1468" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span> </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />With regard to the appropriate ethical conduct of civil government lawyers in litigation, consider <a id="dabmci_7453f57e0a014a89aa9bf3a1afd23643" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Lybbert v. Grant County</span>, 1 P. 3d 1124, 1129 n.5 (Wash. 2000). There, the Washington Supreme Court held that it was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page671" class="pagebreak" title="671">671</span>permissible for government lawyers to have lulled opposing counsel, who had mistakenly served the wrong county official, into thinking that the government would defend on the merits, when, in fact, the government lawyers planned to file a motion to dismiss once the statute of limitations ran (which they did). According to the court, the government needed to be “scrupulously just” only when it was acting in a regulatory capacity. When litigating, government lawyers had no obligation to conform to a higher standard than other lawyers. Do you agree?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What are the obligations of government lawyers who are political appointees and how, if at all, are they different from career lawyers? Are appointees permitted to show special deference to the President who appointed them? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should lawyers who advise governmental officials in a nonlegal capacity nonetheless be held to account for violations of professional duties? This was the question put to D.C. Bar about Kellyanne Conway, who was appointed by President Trump as Counselor to the President in December 2016. In her Counselor capacity, Conway (who had been a pollster for Trump and then served as his presidential campaign manager) was assigned the job of publicly defending the president in relation to all manner of policy disputes, which she did with flair that drew close to, and sometimes crossed, the line of truthfulness. To give just one example, in defending Trump’s Muslim Ban, Conway claimed it was similar to an Obama decision to “ban” Iraqi refugees for six months following the “Bowling Green Massacre.” The problem was, Obama never banned Iraqi refugees (he only ordered enhanced screening), and there was never any “massacre” in Bowling Green, only the prosecution of two Iraqis for trying to send weapons and money to al-Qaeda.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1469" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1469" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span> Because of Conway’s numerous misrepresentations, in February 2017, fifteen legal ethicists filed a complaint with the D.C. Bar alleging that Conway, licensed in D.C., should be sanctioned for violating Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging “in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1470" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1470" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> The ethicists then amended the complaint in 2019 based on further evidence that Conway had violated the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan political activity. Assuming Conway did lie on Trump’s behalf, how do you think the Bar should rule on the question of whether a lawyer should be subject to discipline for a Rule 8.4(c) violation while acting as a nonlegal presidential advisor?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1471" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1471" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The materials that follow explore the nature of the government lawyer’s counseling role through a case study: the role of executive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page672" class="pagebreak" title="672">672</span>branch lawyers in the “war on terrorism.” The term “torture memos” refers to six legal opinions written by lawyers in the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in 2002, 2004, and 2005. Five of the six torture memos were initially secret, but all of them were eventually released to the public.<a id="_Ref32241317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1472" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1472" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The first two, both dated August 1, 2002, were signed by Jay S. Bybee (the head of OLC and now a Ninth Circuit judge) but actually written by an OLC lawyer, John Yoo (now a Berkeley professor), together with a more junior lawyer. One of them analyzed the applicability of the federal torture statutes to the interrogation of Al Qaeda detainees. The statutes read as follows:</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />“torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />“severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The Bybee/Yoo memo concluded that harsh interrogation would not constitute “torture” unless it inflicted physical pain equivalent to that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page673" class="pagebreak" title="673">673</span>associated with organ failure or death, and that mental suffering would not be “torture” unless it produced psychiatric symptoms that lingered for months or years. (The “organ failure or death” standard of severe pain was derived from a Medicare statute that entitles patients to emergency medical care if they experience severe pain.) The memo also concluded that government officials accused of torture could avail themselves of the criminal defenses of self-defense and necessity, and that it would be an unconstitutional infringement on the President’s commander-in-chief authority to enforce the torture statutes against those inflicting presidentially-authorized torture.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This first, and most famous, torture memo was leaked shortly after the Abu Ghraib scandal, in which U.S. soldiers photographed themselves abusing captives in an Iraqi prison. The memo caused enough of an uproar that DOJ withdrew it. Among its defenders were Professors Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule. To Posner and Vermeule, “the memorandum’s arguments are standard lawyerly fare, routine stuff.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1473" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1473" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span> They explain:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The Justice Department memorandum came out of the OLC, whose jurisprudence has traditionally been highly pro-executive. . . . Not everyone likes OLC’s traditional jurisprudence, or its awkward role as both defender and adviser of the executive branch; but former officials who claim that the OLC’s function is solely to supply “disinterested” advice, or that it serves as a “conscience” for the government, are providing a sentimental, distorted and self-serving picture of a complex reality.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1474" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1474" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">114</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">John Yoo, they add, belongs to “a dynamic generation of younger scholars . . . who argue for an expansive conception of presidential power over foreign affairs.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1475" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1475" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most other commentators were highly critical. Focusing particularly on the interpretation of “severe pain” in the criminal law of torture by drawing on a Medicare statute, Princeton Professor Peter Brooks labeled the memo “textual interpretation run amok—less ‘lawyering as usual’ than the work of some bizarre literary deconstructionist.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1476" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1476" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> editorialist Anthony Lewis, focusing on the memo’s discussion of self-defense and necessity, claimed that the memo “read like the advice of a mob lawyer to a mafia don on how to skirt the law and stay out of prison.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1477" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1477" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The second memo of August 1, 2002, also written by Yoo and signed by Bybee, was not leaked at the time but was eventually released by the Obama administration. It analyzes and specifically approves ten harsh interrogation techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation of up to eleven days.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Because of the uproar over the first torture memo, OLC substituted another memo released to the public at the end of 2004. It was written by OLC’s then-head, Daniel Levin. The memo withdrew, but did not replace, the Bybee/Yoo memo’s analysis of the criminal defenses and the president’s commander-in-chief power—Levin argued that because of President Bush’s stated policy against torture it was unnecessary to reach these issues. It also withdrew the “organ failure or death” test, which it viewed as a logical blunder.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In May 2005, Levin’s successor at OLC, Steven Bradbury, issued three confidential opinions, which were not released until 2009, although newspapers had reported on their contents. One re-analyzed the CIA’s techniques of “enhanced” interrogation—by this time the number was up from ten to thirteen—and concluded that none of them constitutes torture. The second concluded that even if they are used together, the cumulative result would still not be torture. And the third concluded that the “enhanced” techniques, taken singly or together, do not even rise to the lesser level of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment short of torture.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The interrogation techniques ultimately approved by the OLC “torture memos” include the following (excerpted from one of the Bradbury memos):</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Nudity . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cramped confinement</span>. This technique involves placing the individual in a confined space, the dimensions of which restrict the individual’s movements. The confined space is usually dark. . . . For the larger confined space, the individual can stand up or sit down; the smaller space is large enough for the subject to sit down. Confinement in the larger space may last no more than 8 hours at a time for no more than 18 hours a day for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page675" class="pagebreak" title="675">675</span>smaller space, confinement may last no more than two hours. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Stress positions </span>. . . The three stress positions are (1) sitting on the floor with legs extended straight out in front and arms raised above the head, (2) kneeling on the floor while leaning back at a 45 degree angle, and (3) leaning against a wall generally about three feet away from the detainee’s feet, with only the detainee’s head touching the wall, while his wrists are handcuffed in front of him or behind his back. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Water dousing</span>. Cold water is poured on the detainee either from a container or from a hose without a nozzle. . . . To ensure an adequate margin of safety, the maximum period of time that a detainee may be permitted to remain wet has been set at two-thirds the time at which . . . hypothermia could be expected to develop in healthy individuals. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sleep deprivation (more than 48 hours)</span>. . . . The primary method of sleep deprivation involves the use of shackling to keep the detainee awake. In this method, the detainee is standing and is handcuffed, and the handcuffs are attached by a length of chain to the ceiling. The detainee’s hands are shackled in front of his body. . . . The detainee’s feet are shackled to a bolt in the floor. . . . All of the detainee’s weight is borne by his legs and feet during standing sleep deprivation. You have informed us that the detainee is not allowed to hang from or support his body weight with the shackles. . . . If the detainee is clothed, he wears an adult diaper under his pants. Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper. . . . The maximum allowable duration for sleep deprivation authorized by the CIA is 180 hours, after which the detainee must be permitted to sleep for at least eight hours. You have informed us that to date, more than a dozen detainees have been subjected to sleep deprivation of more than 48 hours, and three detainees have been subjected to sleep deprivation of more than 96 hours; the longest period of time for which any detainee has been deprived of sleep by the CIA is 180 hours.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">All these techniques were approved for use on high-value detainees in the CIA’s secret “black site” foreign prisons. However, harsh interrogation techniques were also used on detainees at Guantánamo. An Army report found that one high-value detainee had been exposed to “degrading and abusive treatment [that] did not rise to the level of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page676" class="pagebreak" title="676">676</span>inhumane treatment.” This detainee, not identified by name in the report, was later determined to be Mohammed Al Qahtani. Qahtani was interrogated 20 hours a day for 48 days out of 54, with time off to be hospitalized when he exhibited irregular heartbeat. He was also subjected to sexual humiliation tactics. Eventually, the head of U.S. military commissions at Guantánamo refused to prosecute him because she concluded that his treatment amounted legally to torture.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">This problem describes a meeting at Guantánamo in which decisions to “go tough” on Qahtani were made.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1481" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1481" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span> The following excerpt comes from the minutes of a 2002 meeting at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base to discuss interrogation techniques. It was released by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two of the ten participants were lawyers: One was Staff Judge Advocate to the task force commander at Guantánamo, while the other was assistant general counsel to the CIA and chief counsel to the CIA’s counterterrorism center. The other participants were military and intelligence officers. Nine days after this meeting, the Staff Judge Advocate provided a legal memorandum that approved more than a dozen aggressive interrogation techniques, including stress positions, sleep deprivation, intimidation through the use of military working dogs, forced nudity, isolation, and the “wet towel” technique (a technique similar to waterboarding).<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1482" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1482" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> Many of these techniques were used on Guantánamo detainees.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The following notes were taken during the aforementioned meeting at 1340 on October 2, 2002. All questions and comments have been paraphrased: . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Colonel</span>: We can’t do sleep deprivation.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: Yes we can—with approval. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: We may need to curb the harsher operations while ICRC [the International Committee of the Red Cross] is around. It is better not to expose them to any controversial techniques. We must have the support of the DOD [Department of Defense].</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">DIA rep</span>: We have had many reports from Bagram [a U.S. base in Afghanistan] about sleep deprivation being used.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: True, but officially it is not happening. It is not being reported officially. The ICRC is a serious concern. They will be in and out, scrutinizing our operations, unless they are displeased and decide to protest and leave. This would draw a lot of negative attention. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">CIA counsel</span>: The DOJ has provided much guidance on this issue. The CIA is not held to the same rules as the military. In the past when the ICRC has made a big deal about certain detainees, the DOD has “moved” them away from the attention of ICRC. Upon questioning from the ICRC about their whereabouts, the DOD’s response has repeatedly been that the detainee merited no status under the Geneva Convention. The CIA has employed aggressive techniques against less than a handful of suspects since 9/11.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under the Torture Convention, torture has been prohibited under international law, but the language of the statutes is written vaguely. Severe mental and physical pain is prohibited. The mental part is explained as poorly as the physical. Severe physical pain described as anything causing permanent physical damage to major organs or body parts. Mental torture described as anything leading to permanent, profound damage to the senses or personality. It is basically subject to perception. If the detainee dies you’re doing it wrong. . . . Any of the techniques that lie on the harshest end of the spectrum must be performed by a highly trained individual. Medical personnel should be present to treat any possible accidents. The CIA operates without military intervention. When the CIA has wanted to use more aggressive techniques in the past, the FBI has pulled their personnel from theatre. In those rare instances, aggressive techniques have proven very helpful.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: We will need documentation to protect us.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">CIA counsel</span>: Yes, if someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used, regardless of cause of death, the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental. Everything must be approved and documented.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page678" class="pagebreak" title="678">678</span>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">DIA rep</span>: LEA [law enforcement agency] personnel will not participate in harsh techniques.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: There is no legal reason why LEA personnel cannot participate in these operations. . . . LEA choice not [to] participate in these types of interrogations is more ethical and moral as opposed to legal.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">CIA counsel</span>: The videotaping of even totally legal techniques will look “ugly.” . . . The Torture Convention prohibits torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. The US did not sign up on the second part, because of the 8th amendment (cruel and unusual punishment), but we did sign the part about torture. This gives us more license to use more controversial techniques.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: Does SERE employ the “wet towel” technique?<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1485" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1485" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">CIA counsel</span>: If a well-trained individual is used to perform this technique it can feel like you’re drowning. The lymphatic system will react as if you’re suffocating, but your body will not cease to function. It is very effective to identify phobias and use them (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> insects, snakes, claustrophobia). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">JAG</span>: In the BSCT [Behavioral Science Consultation Team] paper it says something about “imminent threat of death”. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">CIA counsel</span>: The threat of death is also subject to scrutiny, and should be handled on a case by case basis. Mock executions don’t work as well as friendly approaches, like letting someone write a letter home, or providing them with an extra book.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">DIA rep</span>: I like the part about ambient noise. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Meeting ended at 1450.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">* * *</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The approval of the harsh techniques drew some internal criticism at the Department of Defense. Noteworthy is the following email from Mark Fallon, the deputy commander of DOD’s Criminal Investigation Task Force.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">This looks like the kinds of stuff Congressional hearings are made of. Quotes from [the JAG] regarding things that are not being reported give the appearance of impropriety. Other comments like “It is basically subject to perception. If the detainee dies you’re doing it wrong” and “Any <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page679" class="pagebreak" title="679">679</span>of the techniques that lie on the harshest end of the spectrum must be performed by a highly trained individual. Medical personnel should be present to treat any possible accidents” seem to stretch beyond the bounds of legal propriety. Talk of “wet towel treatment” which results in the lymphatic gland reacting as if you are suffocating, would in my opinion shock the conscience of any legal body looking at using the results of the interrogations or possibly even the interrogators. Someone needs to be considering how history will look back at this.</p>

      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861591" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756577" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908711" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is there anything ethically improper in the conduct of the lawyers identified as “JAG” and “CIA counsel”?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Shortly after the release of the Bybee Memo in 2004, critics began to question the legal ethics of writing memoranda that seemingly gave the green light to torture. It was often unclear whether the critics objected to the conclusions of the Bybee Memo on moral grounds, because they were opponents of torture, or whether they objected on the ground that writing the opinion violated formal ethics rules. These are not mutually exclusive, but the two criticisms are fundamentally different. The former criticism would be the same no matter what the law said. Even if the plain language of the law explicitly approved torture, moralists might argue that lawyers should refuse to put their imprimatur on torture. The latter criticism is that the OLC lawyers did not interpret the law honestly in their written opinions to their clients. That could violate several rules of legal ethics. In the Rules of Professional Conduct these are:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Rule 2.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;2.1&quot; " />: “In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Rule 1.2(d)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(d)&quot; " />: “A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent. . . .”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Rule 1.4(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.4(b)&quot; \s &quot;1.4(b)&quot; \c 16 " />: “A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Rule 8.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(c)&quot; " />: “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Beginning in 2004, the DOJ’s internal ethics unit, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), launched an investigation of the Bybee Memo, examining email traffic and earlier drafts. OPR completed a lengthy report in 2008, which Attorney General Holder sent to a senior DOJ lawyer, David Margolis, for review. The OPR report was harshly critical of Judge Bybee and Professor Yoo, and recommended that they be referred to their state bars for possible professional discipline for violating their “duty to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page680" class="pagebreak" title="680">680</span>exercise independent legal judgment and render thorough, objective, and candid legal advice” in contravention of Rule 2.1.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">However, Margolis disagreed, criticized the OPR report, and concluded instead that Bybee and Yoo had merely exercised bad judgment—a recommendation that Attorney General Holder decided to follow. In February 2010, the DOJ released the OPR Report, surrounding documents, and Margolis’s critique.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">For the interrogation memos to violate ethics rules, it seems that the lawyers must know that the advice in the opinions is a misrepresentation of the law—or at least must have written their opinions believing that they do not faithfully represent the law. How would one know that or prove it? What if the lawyer responds, “I believe what I wrote”?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is the critique that the legal analysis is so untenable that intelligent, capable lawyers could not have written it in good faith? How do you tell when a legal argument is frivolous (as opposed to merely being an argument you disagree with)? What if other scholars disagree that the opinions are frivolous? In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Professor Michael Stokes Paulsen, a noted scholar and former OLC lawyer, strongly defends the memoranda:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">I have studied the legal memoranda in question, drawing on my expertise as a legal scholar whose work over much of the past decade has embraced these types of issues as a major area of research and writing, and on my experience as a government attorney in OLC in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The analysis contained in the memoranda in question is analysis with which, in certain respects, persons of good will can reasonably disagree, but it is well within the range of customary, legitimate, proper, and entirely ethical legal advice that may be provided by confidential legal advisors to the president and his administration.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1486" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1486" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">At the same Senate hearing, Professor Luban disagreed:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Twenty-six years ago, President Reagan’s Justice Department prosecuted law enforcement officers for waterboarding prisoners to make them confess. The case is called <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Lee</span>.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1487" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1487" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span> Four men were convicted and drew hefty sentences that the Court of Appeals upheld.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the technique as “torture.” This is perhaps the single most relevant case in American law to the legality of waterboarding. Any lawyer can find the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee </span>case in a few seconds on a computer just by typing the words “water torture” into a database. But the authors of the torture memos never mentioned it. They had no trouble finding cases where courts <span style="font-style: italic;">didn’t</span> call harsh interrogation techniques “torture.” It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Mr. Yoo, Judge Bybee, and Mr. Bradbury <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page681" class="pagebreak" title="681">681</span>chose not to mention the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee</span> case because it casts doubt on their conclusion that waterboarding is legal. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Other significant omissions include the failure of the August 1, 2002 “torture” memo to discuss or even mention the <span style="font-style: italic;">Steel Seizure Case</span> in its analysis of the President’s commander-in-chief power. . . . In its discussion of the necessity defense, the Bybee Memo fails to mention the recently-decided <a id="dabmci_ce6298357eea40c0a22e5d4dd2f30050" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop, United States v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;46;dabmci_ce6298357eea40c0a22e5d4dd2f30050_1;I318f7afd9c2511d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4;;0;F;United States v.

Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop</span>, 532 U.S. 483, 490 (2001), which calls into question whether federal criminal law even contains a necessity defense if no statute specifies that there is one. . . . In one place, the opinion may fairly be said to falsify what a source says. Discussing whether interrogators accused of torture could plead self-defense, the memo says: “Leading scholarly commentators believe that interrogation of such individuals using methods that might violate [the anti-torture statute] would be justified under the doctrine of self-defense.” The opinion refers to a law review article. What the article’s author actually says on the page cited is nearly the opposite: “<span style="font-style: italic;">The literal law of self-defense is not available to justify their torture</span>. But the principle uncovered as the moral basis of the defense may be applicable” (emphasis added). Omitting to discuss leading contrary cases, and spinning what cited sources say, is not honest opinion writing, and violates the ethical requirements of candor and independent judgment, and communication to a client of everything reasonably necessary for the client to make an informed decision.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1488" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1488" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Are these sufficient grounds to conclude that the OLC lawyers did not argue in good faith?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If a client asks a lawyer to write an opinion setting out the strongest argument possible favoring the legality of what the client wants to do, can the lawyer do so, or does Rule 2.1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;2.1&quot; " /> require the lawyer to provide only a candid and independent opinion?<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Does Rule 1.2(c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.2(c)&quot; \s &quot;1.2(c)&quot; \c 16 " /> bear on the question? It provides: “A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent.” </p>

He said it did not fall within the Anti-Torture Act. I’m not a lawyer, but you gotta trust the judgment of people around you and I do.” When Lauer (later disgraced by revelations of sexual abuse) then asked whether it would be “okay for a foreign country to waterboard an American citizen?” Bush replied, “It’s all I ask is that people read the book.”<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1491" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1491" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span> Does Bush’s stated reliance on lawyers affect your views of the gravity of conduct by Yoo and Bybee?</p>

      <p class="FileLine">Esquire 23–24 (Dec. 19, 1979).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Eighteen months ago, Joseph Fortenberry, Harvard College ’66 and Yale Law ’69, was on the perfect big-time lawyer’s career path. At thirty-three, he had a federal court of appeals clerkship under his belt and was a senior associate at the New York law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton &amp; Irvine working on the all-important antitrust case that Kodak was defending against Berkey Photo.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">His prospects for being made a partner at the prestige firm the following year were excellent: He was regarded not only as brilliant but also as engaging and enjoyable to work with; Kodak was the firm’s biggest case (occupying twenty lawyers full time, with gross billings of some $4 million a year); and he was working hand in hand with Mahlon Perkins Jr., one of the firm’s most respected partners.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Then came April 20, 1977. That morning, in the middle of one of hundreds of depositions (on-the-record question-and-answer sessions with a witness prior to the trial) that he had sat through for months, Joe Fortenberry’s career unraveled.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Alvin Stein, the lawyer for Berkey Photo, was questioning a Kodak “expert witness,” Yale economics professor Merton Peck, about files and other materials the professor had received from Kodak in order to prepare his testimony. In such suits, each side is allowed to obtain—or “discover”—almost any documents that the other side has used to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page684" class="pagebreak" title="684">684</span>prepare and bolster its case. Such materials can often be used to attack the credibility of witnesses.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Peck told Berkey lawyer Stein that he had shipped all the materials back to Perkins of Donovan Leisure earlier that year. What happened, then, to the documents, Stein asked Perkins. I threw them out as soon as I got them, the Donovan Leisure partner replied.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Perkins was lying. He’d saved all the documents in a suitcase, frequently taking them back and forth between his office at the firm and a special office he’d leased near the federal courthouse for the trial. And Joe Fortenberry, sitting at Perkins’s side during this deposition, knew his boss was lying. He’d worked with the suitcase full of documents, and at least once he’d carried it between Perkins’s two offices. Two weeks later, Perkins submitted a sworn statement to the court confirming he’d destroyed the documents.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In January of 1978, Perkins’s perjury came to light when Stein, at the end of the Berkey-Kodak trial, asked Peck about any reports he had submitted prior to the trial to Kodak’s lawyers. This led back to more probing questions about the materials Peck had used to prepare his testimony. Then—in what has since become a much-reported, pinstriped soap opera—on the Sunday night before the last week of the trial, a frightened Perkins broke down and confessed to Kodak lead lawyer John Doar that he’d never destroyed the documents but had actually hid them in a cupboard in his office. Perkins told the judge the next day, then resigned from the firm; Stein used Donovan Leisure’s withholding of documents to help convince the jury of Kodak’s bad faith and guilt; Kodak lost the case in a spectacular $113 million verdict (since reduced to $87 million); Kodak dropped Donovan Leisure; and Perkins was convicted of contempt of court for his perjury and sentenced to a month in prison.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But what about Joe Fortenberry?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The rules by which the bar disciplines lawyers—the Code of Professional Responsibility—require that “a lawyer who receives information clearly establishing that . . . a person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal shall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Moreover, the code requires that a lawyer who knows that another lawyer has engaged in dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation must report the offending lawyer to proper prosecutorial authorities.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In short, Fortenberry was obligated to speak up when Perkins lied. Instead, he said nothing to anyone. To be sure, Perkins, perhaps thinking he was helping Fortenberry, told the federal prosecutors who later investigated the case that Fortenberry had whispered in his ear and reminded him of the existence of the documents when Perkins told Stein he’d destroyed them. Fortenberry denies this. What’s undisputed, and more relevant, is that Fortenberry never said a word about Perkins’s lie <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page685" class="pagebreak" title="685">685</span>to the judge, as he was obligated to, or even to any other Donovan Leisure partner.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Throw the book at him, right? Wrong. Law firms teach young associates that they are apprentices to the partners, not whistle blowers. The partners, after all, are supposed to be the ones with the experience and standing to make decisions about right and wrong. Fortenberry had worked for Perkins for more than six months. In an environment like Donovan Leisure, this means that he respected the fifty-nine-year-old “Perk,” as his admiring partners called him, for the well-liked senior litigator that he was. It also means that he was intimidated by Perkins and, of course, that he knew Perkins was his ticket to a partnership when the firm partners would decide in the following year which of the associates at Fortenberry’s level would be offered that golden prize. “What happened to Joe” says a close associate “was that he saw Perk lie and really couldn’t believe it. And he just had no idea what to do. I mean, he knew Perkins was lying, but he kept thinking that there must be a reason. Besides, what do you do? The guy was his boss and a great guy!”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As stung as Donovan Leisure is by the Perkins affair, the firm’s partners have treated Fortenberry with the compassion that suggests that they understand his dilemma. They’ve paid for him to retain his own lawyer for the investigation that resulted in Perkins’s guilty plea and for possible bar association disciplinary action. (Federal prosecutors say there’s no evidence of criminal misconduct on Fortenberry’s part, but the Association of the Bar of the City of New York never comments on its own investigations regarding possible violations of the Lawyers Code of Professional Responsibility, even to the point of acknowledging whether there is one going on.) And they’ve kept him on at the firm and gone out of their way with signs ranging from work assignments to lunch invitations to show that they hold him blameless. In many ways, it hasn’t helped. Friends say that Fortenberry—“a well-liked, personable genius,” as one puts it—has been severely hurt emotionally by the Perkins episode. “He just looks and acts like a beaten man,” as another associate explained.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There’s one thing that Donovan Leisure could do to revive Fortenberry. They could make him a partner this June, when the decision on partners of his seniority is normally made. The odds are he’d have been made a partner had the Perkins affair never happened; so if, as Samuel Murphy of the firm’s management committee told me recently, “in judging Joe for partnership, we’re not going to hold the tragedy with Perk against him in any way,” it stands to reason that he will get the offer. Then again, how does Donovan Leisure look, its reputation already hurt by the Perkins affair, offering a partnership to the man who apparently violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and kept quiet while Perkins perpetrated his fraud on the court?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">With Donovan Leisure beginning to recover from the Perkins affair . . . the upcoming decision on what to do with Fortenberry may be the one <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page686" class="pagebreak" title="686">686</span>last hurdle they have to pass. (A once-feared malpractice suit by Kodak is now unlikely, a source at the camera maker says.)</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But there are larger questions, too, that Fortenberry’s sad situation should raise. Donovan Leisure senior partner Murphy says that “the firm is trying to create an atmosphere in which associates in positions like Fortenberry’s will feel free to take the story of one partner acting improperly to another partner.” But Perkins’s impropriety—a clear, deliberate lie—is an easy call. What about an associate who thinks his partner is filing a frivolous motion or is bilking a client? “You know, when you come to work at a big firm you do give up independence,” Murphy concedes. “And a young lawyer’s ideas about what is frivolous, for example, can’t always be accepted, though we do encourage them to tell the partners they’re working for what they think.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">And what about firms other than Donovan Leisure that haven’t been clubbed by a Perkins disaster into thinking about “open doors” and the like? I asked eight different associates, ages twenty-seven to thirty-two, at major firms around the country what they’d do in Fortenberry’s situation. None said that they’d speak up to the judge in the case as their Code of Professional Responsibility requires; only four suggested that there was another partner at the firm they’d feel free to go to if their boss did something like that; and one told a story of watching a partner bill a client (a major utility) for three times the hours worked and, not knowing what to do, doing nothing.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Judge Marvin E. Frankel, the trial judge in the Berkey-Kodak case, was highly critical of Donovan Leisure’s conduct during the trial and so outraged by Perkins’s lie that he personally called it to the attention of the federal prosecutors. Frankel has since left the bench and become a partner at the midtown firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn. An associate there told me last week he’d “have no idea” what to do in a Perkins situation. “There isn’t any way for an associate to handle that problem,” Frankel concedes. Yet, unexplainably, the once-outraged judge shifts the direct responsibility from the individual law firms, where it belongs, to the organized bar generally: “All firms, including this one, should push the bar association to evolve procedures so that an associate doesn’t have to be a hero to do what’s ethical.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Every year more and more of the best brains in our society go from law school to firms like Donovan Leisure. And every year these firms get larger—and more competitive. Without some real effort from those at the top, this is an environment that is destined to make automatons out of those who get by and tragedies out of those, like Fortenberry, who have the bad luck to get tripped up.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Assume the facts are as described above in the Berkey-Kodak case. Consider the following questions.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page687" class="pagebreak" title="687">687</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are an associate with Donovan Leisure, a prominent New York law firm. For the past two years, you have worked principally for one senior partner on a large antitrust suit brought by Berkey Photo against your client, Eastman Kodak. One of the major issues in the suit concerns whether Kodak’s acquisitions of early competitors or its superior product innovations were the primary cause of its dominant market position. In connection with that issue, Kodak has retained a highly regarded Yale economics professor to study the photography industry in the hope that he will develop an expert opinion that Kodak’s innovations, rather than its acquisitions, enabled it to attain dominance. Ultimately, the professor does develop such a theory. However, in one early letter to the senior partner, the expert indicates he is unable to explain how Kodak’s early acquisitions could be irrelevant to its present market position.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This letter and certain documents reviewed by the economist have not been produced in response to Berkey’s discovery demand for all such documents and for “interim reports” prepared by the economist. The partner in charge of the case has executed an affidavit under oath stating that he inadvertently destroyed the documents, believing them to be duplicates of material still available. The partner also privately maintains that he does not consider the economist’s correspondence to be a “report” within the meaning of the discovery demand.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You find that interpretation contrived, and you try unsuccessfully to convince the partner that the expert’s preliminary expression of doubt is precisely the sort of interim statement that Berkey is seeking for cross-examination purposes. At the very least, you believe the trial court should be asked to rule on the question. You also know that the documents have not been destroyed, although they reveal nothing of critical substantive value to Berkey. You greatly respect the senior partner and are at a loss to explain his behavior. What is your response?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume that you describe the situation to another senior partner whose opinion you value. He expresses doubt that the facts could be as you describe them. He points out that, if it were the case, the partner had suppressed evidence and lied under oath, and if the deception became public, that man’s life would be ruined, and the firm’s reputation would be tainted. In addition, the partnership could lose a major client and be subject to a multi-million-dollar malpractice suit. What do you do?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume that before you take any action, Berkey makes a settlement offer that Kodak is willing to accept. Does that alter your plans?</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />According to case histories of the litigation, the perjury in Perkins’s affidavit became public as a result of his own disclosure, first to fellow partner John Doar and then to the court. The existence of the expert’s early correspondence emerged after cross-examination when Berkey’s counsel asked him whether there were any documents “on this matter” prepared prior to a given date. When the expert responded by seeking a definition of “on this matter,” counsel for Berkey pursued the issue and district Judge Frankel compelled the letter’s disclosure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1494" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1494" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">134</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In his summary to the jury, counsel made the most of the incident:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">That sordid spectacle of dissembling, evasiveness, deception, and concealment disgraces the dignity of this court, this proceeding, and you jurors. And there is no doubt, I believe, based upon the evidence presented to you, and the conclusions to be drawn from that evidence, that the witness deliberately and purposefully concealed material evidence, and—I think it has got to be said—lied to you under oath. Not once, repeatedly. [The expert] has proven himself utterly unworthy of belief.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1495" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1495" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">135</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Judge Frankel also made clear his own dissatisfaction with Donovan Leisure’s performance. He began by noting that Perkins had executed his false affidavit in response to his partner’s request for something stronger that would “satisfy” the court as to why documents could not be produced. Frankel then questioned whether it was sufficient “for Mr. Perkins’ partners to demand more positiveness or whether it wasn’t incumbent on everyone concerned to press Mr. Perkins more vigorously than he appears to have been pressed for the truthful account we received so many months later.” As for the failure to disclose the expert’s early letter, Frankel questioned why lead counsel John Doar “did not see fit to let me look at the document,” and added:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">All of those things it seems to me reflect—and I have said it in just words of one or two syllables—a kind of single-minded interest in winning, winning, winning, without the limited qualification of that attitude that the Court, I think, is entitled to expect and which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page689" class="pagebreak" title="689">689</span>I feel must have infected Perkins and has infected certain aspects of this case from time to time in ways that I find upsetting.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1496" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1496" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">136</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">A week after the jury awarded Berkey a total of $113 million in damages, Kodak announced that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell was taking over the litigation. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed and remanded the lower court judgment. Kodak eventually settled the case for $6.75 million. Donovan Leisure paid $675,000 to Kodak to prevent a malpractice claim for failure to turn over documents.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1497" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1497" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">137</a></span> John Doar, who was widely criticized by Donovan Leisure colleagues for his “cold, distant, and morally arrogant manner” and his ineffective supervision of the Kodak litigation, resigned from the firm. According to James Stewart’s case history:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Fortenberry’s role in the scandal had nothing to do with his failure to be made a partner. The firm had actually passed him over two months before the Perkins matter ever came to light, partners there say. It later concealed its decision so as to enhance Fortenberry’s chances of getting another job, keeping him working so that prospective employers would not see his immediate dismissal from the firm and conclude that Fortenberry was indeed implicated in Perkins’s wrongdoing. Even so, Fortenberry was not hired by any private law firm to which he applied for a job.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Perkins emerged relatively well. Although he served twenty-seven days in jail for contempt of court, he was never disbarred. Subsequently he traveled extensively, taught English in Japan, and served as president of his local orchestra. One of his former partners described him as “happier, I believe, than he had been as a practicing lawyer.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1498" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1498" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">138</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In the mid-1980s, the then-sixty-five-year-old Perkins began working as a volunteer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, a prominent public interest law firm. “Intellectually, the work here is every bit as satisfying as what I did before,” he told a <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> reporter. “And politically, I derive a lot more satisfaction than I did at Donovan, Leisure.

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What implications can be drawn from the Berkey-Kodak case for the structure of law firms and content of ethical rules? Does Rule 5.2 provide adequate guidance for associates?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How much would it have helped if the firm had a designated ethics counsel who would be available to resolve the dilemma? According to one study, the majority of associates working in firms with over 100 lawyers report that their firm has such a counsel or a committee tasked with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page690" class="pagebreak" title="690">690</span>providing guidance on ethics inquiries.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1500" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1500" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">140</a></span> Can firms create better formal or informal channels of communications regarding ethical issues? What might have encouraged Fortenberry to disclose Perkins’s conduct to other partners in the firm at a point when the affidavit could have been withdrawn without major scandal?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If a firm does assign a partner or partners to serve as formal ethics counsel and the firm encourages lawyers to seek the ethics counsel’s advice, should associates be subject to formal or informal sanctions for failure to do so?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Recall that Rule 5.1(a) makes partners in a law firm responsible for ensuring that the firm’s policies give “reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the rules of professional conduct.” How stringently should it be applied? Consider the following situation. Law firm B is well-known for its extremely aggressive litigation tactics, which sometimes have led to sanctions under <a id="dabmci_428e3c73608f4f378d8e728b00ec6058" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rules 11 and 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In one recent high-stakes case, after repeated complaints by opposing attorneys that the firm’s lawyers resisted legitimate discovery requests, the trial judge rebuked the supervising partner. Afterwards, the abusive tactics became more subtle but did not stop. As the partner privately explains, “delay is worth a great deal to the firm.” Should the partner be subject to discipline under Rule 3.2? Should any other lawyers in the firm be subject to discipline under Rule 5.1(a)? Should firms as entities be subject to discipline under a theory of <span style="font-style: italic;">respondeat superior</span>? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What are lawyers’ duties to supervise nonlawyers? Rule 5.3(a) states that “a partner, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the [nonlawyer’s] conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.” Under Rule 5.3(b), a lawyer with direct supervisory authority “shall make reasonable efforts” to ensure that the nonlawyer’s “conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer.” Under Rule 5.3(c), a lawyer is held responsible for conduct of the nonlawyer if the lawyer orders or ratifies the nonlawyer’s conduct or the lawyer has managerial authority at the firm or direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer and “knows of the conduct at the time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.” </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What happens if the supervisory lawyer does not have direct knowledge of a nonlawyer’s misconduct? In the Georgia case, In re<span style="font-style: italic;"> Hawk</span>, a lawyer, Victor Hawk, ran his own small law firm practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1501" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1501" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a></span> In 2007, Hawk hired a paralegal, Richard Lee Owen, without running a background check. It turned out that Owen “had been convicted of several felonies, including the transportation of stolen vehicles, burglary, forgery in the first degree, theft by deception, and theft by conversion.” Over time, Owen was promoted to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page691" class="pagebreak" title="691">691</span>office manager, where he had access to law firm finances, which he used to embezzle nearly $600,000 in client funds over the course of three years. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Although Hawk claimed he had no knowledge of Owen’s actions or his checkered history, Hawk was nonetheless publicly reprimanded by the U.S. District Court in Georgia for negligent supervision in violation of Rule 5.3(a) and (b). In so doing, the court emphasized that Hawk delegated responsibilities to Owen, which included preparing disbursement sheets for client settlements and rubber-stamping Hawk’s name on settlement checks. Because of this and the fact that Hawk “failed to thoroughly scrutinize and audit his trust account,” the court found that, even though Hawk “may not have been aware of the embezzlement at the time, he is culpable for the broad grant of authority and complete autonomy he gave to Mr. Owen.” Hawk could not escape sanction based on lack of knowledge because “his failure to supervise contributed to the lack of knowledge” in the first instance. Do you think this is an appropriate reading of Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.3&quot; \s &quot;5.3&quot; \c 16 " />5.3? What specifically should Hawk have done to avoid professional discipline?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Chapter 3 notes, New York and New Jersey are the only states that permit firms, as well as individual lawyers, to be disciplined for ethical and legal violations.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Let me tell you how you will start acting unethically: It will start with your time sheets. One day, not too long after you start practicing law, you will sit down at the end of a long, tiring day, and you just won’t have much to show for your efforts in terms of billable hours. It will be near the end of the month. You will know that all of the partners will be looking at your monthly time report in a few days, so what you’ll do is pad your time sheet just a bit. Maybe you will bill a client for ninety minutes for a task that really took you only sixty minutes to perform. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page692" class="pagebreak" title="692">692</span>However, you will promise yourself that you will repay the client at the first opportunity by doing thirty minutes of work for the client for “free.” In this way, you will be “borrowing,” not “stealing.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">And then what will happen is that it will become easier and easier to take these little loans against future work. And then, after a while, you will stop paying back these little loans. You will convince yourself that, although you billed for ninety minutes and spent only sixty minutes on the project, you did such good work that your client should pay a bit more for it. After all, your billing rate is awfully low, and your client is awfully rich.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">And then you will pad more and more—every two minute telephone conversation will go down on the sheet as ten minutes, every three hour research project will go down with an extra quarter hour or so. You will continue to rationalize your dishonesty to yourself in various ways until one day you stop doing even that. And, before long—it won’t take you much more than three or four years—you will be stealing from your clients almost every day, and you won’t even notice it.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You know what? You will also likely become a liar. A deadline will come up one day, and, for reasons that are entirely your fault, you will not be able to meet it. So you will call your senior partner or your client and make up a white lie for why you missed the deadline. And then you will get busy and a partner will ask whether you proofread a lengthy prospectus and you will say yes, even though you didn’t. And then you will be drafting a brief and you will quote language from a Supreme Court opinion even though you will know that, when read in context, the language does not remotely suggest what you are implying it suggests. And then, in preparing a client for a deposition, you will help the client to formulate an answer to a difficult question that will likely be asked—an answer that will be “legally accurate” but that will mislead your opponent. And then you will be reading through a big box of your client’s documents—a box that has not been opened in twenty years—and you will find a document that would hurt your client’s case, but that no one except you knows exists, and you will simply “forget” to produce it in response to your opponent’s discovery requests.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Do you see what will happen? After a couple of years of this, you won’t even notice that you are lying and cheating and stealing every day that you practice law. None of these things will seem like a big deal in itself—an extra fifteen minutes added to a time sheet here, a little white lie to cover a missed deadline there. But, after a while, your entire frame of reference will change. You will still be making dozens of quick, instinctive decisions every day, but those decisions, instead of reflecting the notions of right and wrong by which you conduct your personal life, will instead reflect the set of values by which you will conduct your professional life—a set of values that embodies not what is right or wrong, but what is profitable, and what you can get away with.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">95–97, 102–03, 105 (Deborah L. Rhode, ed., 2001).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One of the best-known and most painful examples of [wrongful obedience by lawyers] was the Berkey-Kodak antitrust litigation in 1977, a bitterly contested private antitrust action brought by Berkey Photo against the giant of the industry. In the heat of adversarial combat, Mahlon Perkins, an admired senior litigator for the large New York law firm representing Kodak, snapped. For no apparent reason, he lied to his opponent to conceal documents from discovery, then perjured himself before a federal judge to cover up the lie. Eventually he owned up, resigned from his firm, and served a month in prison. Perhaps this sounds like an instance of chickens coming home to roost for a Rambo litigator. But by all accounts, Perkins was an upright and courtly man, the diametrical opposite of a Rambo litigator.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Joseph Fortenberry, the associate working for him, knew that Perkins had perjured himself but kept silent. “What happened . . . ” recalls another associate, “was that he saw [the partner] lie and really couldn’t believe it. And he just had no idea what to do. I mean, he . . . kept thinking there must be a reason. Besides, what do you do? The guy was his boss and a great guy!”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Notice the range of explanations here. First, the appeal to hierarchy: the guy was his boss. Second, to personal loyalty: the guy was a great guy. Third, to helplessness: Fortenberry had no idea what to do. Fourth, Fortenberry couldn’t believe it. He kept thinking there must be a reason. The last is an explanation of a different sort, suggesting that Fortenberry’s own ethical judgment was undermined by the situation he found himself in.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As a matter of fact, the same may be said of Perkins. He wasn’t the lead partner in the litigation; he belonged to a team headed by a newcomer to the firm, an intense, driven, focused, and controlling lawyer. In a situation of supreme stress, Perkins’s judgment simply failed him.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In Berkey-Kodak, neither Perkins nor Fortenberry received an explicit order to break the rules, but sometimes lawyers do. What guidance do the ethics rules give when this happens? ABA Model Rule 5.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.2(a)&quot; \s &quot;5.2(a)&quot; \c 16 " /> denies the defense of superior orders to a subordinate lawyer ordered to behave unethically, but Rule 5.2(b) states that a subordinate may defer to “a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty.” The problem is that the pressures on subordinate lawyers may lead them to misjudge when a question of professional duty is arguable and when the supervisor’s resolution of it is reasonable. Remember Fortenberry, who “kept thinking there must be a reason” when he heard Perkins perjure himself before a federal judge. This was not even close to an arguable question, and there’s nothing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page694" class="pagebreak" title="694">694</span>reasonable about perjury—but the very fact that it was Fortenberry’s respected supervisor who committed it undermined his own confidence that he understood what was reasonable and what was not. When that happens, Rule 5.2(b) will seem more salient to an associate than the bright-line prohibition on wrongful obedience that the first half of the rule articulates.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I want to see what we can learn about wrongful obedience from the most celebrated effort to study it empirically, Stanley Milgram’s experiments conducted at Yale thirty-five years ago. Even though these experiments are very well-known, I will begin by reviewing what Milgram did and what he discovered.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Imagine, then, that you answer Milgram’s newspaper advertisement, offering twenty dollars if you volunteer for a one-hour psychology experiment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1504" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1504" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">144</a></span> When you enter the room, you meet the experimenter, dressed in a grey lab coat, and a second volunteer, a pleasant, bespectacled middle-aged man. Unbeknownst to you, the second volunteer is in reality a confederate of the experimenter.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The experimenter explains that the two volunteers will be participating in a study of the effect of punishment on memory and learning. One of you, the learner, will memorize word-pairs; the other, the teacher, will punish the learner with steadily-increasing electrical shocks each time he makes a mistake. A volunteer, rather than the experimenter, must administer the shocks because one aim of the experiment is to investigate punishments administered by very different kinds of people. The experimenter leads you to the shock-generator, a formidable-looking machine with thirty switches, marked from 15 volts to 450. Above the voltages labels are printed. These range from “Slight Shock” (15–60 volts) through “Danger: Severe Shock” (375–420 volts); they culminate in an ominous-looking red label reading “XXX” above 435 and 450 volts. Both volunteers experience a 45-volt shock. Then they draw lots to determine their role. The drawing is rigged so that you become the teacher. The learner mentions that he has a mild heart problem, and the experimenter replies rather non-responsively that the shocks will cause no permanent tissue damage. The learner is strapped into the hot seat, and the experiment gets underway.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The learner begins making mistakes, and as the shocks escalate he grunts in pain. Eventually he complains about the pain, and at 150 volts announces in some agitation that he wishes to stop the experiment. You look inquiringly at the man in the grey coat, but he says only, “The experiment requires that you continue.” As you turn up the juice, the learner begins screaming. Finally, he shouts out that he will answer no more questions. Unflapped, the experimenter instructs you to treat silences as wrong answers. You ask him who will take responsibility if the learner is injured, and he states that he will. You continue.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page695" class="pagebreak" title="695">695</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As the experiment proceeds, the agitated learner announces that his heart is starting to bother him. Again, you protest, and again the man in the lab coat replies, “The experiment requires that you continue.” At 330 volts, the screams stop. The learner falls ominously silent, and remains silent until the bitter end.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But it never actually gets to the bitter end, does it? You may be excused for thinking so. In a follow-up study, groups of people heard the Milgram setup described. They were asked to guess how many people would comply all the way to 450 volts, and to predict whether they themselves would. People typically guessed that at most one teacher out of a thousand would comply—and no-one believed that they themselves would.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In reality, sixty-three percent of subjects complied all the way to 450 volts. Moreover, this is a robust result: it holds in groups of women as well as men, and experimenters obtained comparable results in Holland, Spain, Italy, Australia, South Africa, Germany, and Jordan; indeed, the Jordanian experimenters replicated the 65% result not only among adults but among seven-year-olds. Originally, Milgram had intended to run his experiments in Germany, to try to understand how so many Germans could participate in the Holocaust; his American experiments were merely for the purpose of perfecting his procedures. After the American dry run, however, Milgram remarked: “I found so much obedience, I hardly saw the need of taking the experiment to Germany.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In my view, we should regard the underestimates of subjects’ willingness to inflict excruciating shocks on an innocent person as a finding just as important and interesting as the 65% compliance rate itself. The Milgram experiments demonstrate not only that in the right circumstances we are quite prone to destructive obedience, but also that we don’t believe this about ourselves, or about our neighbors—nor do we condone it. Milgram demonstrates that each of us ought to believe three things about ourselves: that we disapprove of destructive obedience, that we think we would never engage in it, and, more likely than not, that we are wrong to think we would never engage in it. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Milgram experiments place moral norms in conflict. One is what I will call the performance principle: the norm of obeying authority, coupled with the norm of doing your job. The other is the no-harm principle: the prohibition on torturing, harming, and killing innocent people. In the abstract, we might think, only a sadist or a fascist would subordinate the no-harm principle to the performance principle. But the Milgram experiments seem to show that what we think in the abstract is dead wrong. Two out of three people you pass in the street would electrocute you if a laboratory technician ordered them to.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The question is why . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The feature I wish to focus on is the slippery-slope character of the electrical shocks. The teacher moves up the scale of shocks by 15-volt <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page696" class="pagebreak" title="696">696</span>increments, and reaches the 450 volt level only at the thirtieth shock. Among other things, this means that the subjects never confront the question “Should I administer a 330 volt shock to the learner?” The question is “Should I administer a 330 volt shock to the learner given that I’ve just administered a 315 volt shock?” It seems clear that the latter question is much harder to answer. As Milgram himself points out, to conclude that administering the 330 volt shock would be wrong is to admit that the 315 volt shock was probably wrong, and perhaps all the shocks were wrong.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Cognitive dissonance theory teaches that when our actions conflict with our self-concept, our beliefs and attitudes change until the conflict is removed. We are all pro se defense lawyers in the court of conscience. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when I have given the learner a series of electrical shocks, I simply won’t view giving the next shock as a wrongful act, because I won’t admit to myself that the previous shocks were wrong.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Let me examine this line of thought in more detail. Moral decision-making requires more than adhering to sound principles, such as the no-harm principle. It also requires good judgment, by which I mean knowing which actions violates a moral principle and which do not. Every lawyer understands the difference between good principles and good judgment—it is the difference between knowing a rule of law and being able to apply it to particular cases. As Kant first pointed out, you can’t teach good judgment through general rules, because we already need judgment to know how rules apply. Judgment is therefore always and irredeemably particular.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Let’s assume that most of Milgram’s subjects do accept the no-harm principle, and agree in the abstract that it outweighs the performance principle. <span style="font-style: italic;">They still need good judgment to know at what point the electrical shocks violate the no-harm principle.</span> Virtually no-one thinks that the slight tingle of a 15 volt shock violates the no-harm principle: if it did, medical researchers would violate the no-harm principle every time they take blood samples from volunteers. Unsurprisingly, only two of Milgram’s thousand subjects refused to give any shocks at all.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But how can 30 volts violate the no-harm principle if 15 volts didn’t? And if a 30-volt shock doesn’t violate the no-harm principle, neither does a shock of 45 volts.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course we know that slippery slope arguments like this are bad logic. At some point, the single grains of sand really do add up to a heap, and at some point shocking the learner really should shock the conscience as well. But it takes good judgment to know where that point lies. Unfortunately, cognitive dissonance generates enormous psychic pressure to deny that our previous obedience may have violated a fundamental moral principle. That denial requires us to gerrymander the boundaries of the no-harm principle so that the shocks we’ve already delivered don’t violate it. However, once we’ve kneaded and pummeled <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page697" class="pagebreak" title="697">697</span>the no-harm principle, it becomes virtually impossible to judge that the next shock, only imperceptibly more intense, crosses the border from the permissible to the forbidden. By luring us into higher and higher level shocks, one micro-step at a time, the Milgram experiments gradually and subtly disarm our ability to distinguish right from wrong. Milgram’s subjects never need to lose, even for a second, their faith in the no-harm principle. Instead, they lose their capacity to recognize that administering an agonizing electrical shock violates it.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What I am offering here is a corruption of judgment explanation of the Milgram experiments. The road to Hell turns out to be a slippery slope, and the travelers on it really do have good intentions—they “merely” suffer from bad judgment. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Let me return to the Berkey-Kodak case and see what light the corruption-of-judgment theory may shed on it. The theory suggests that we should find the partner’s and associate’s misdeeds at the end of a slippery slope, beginning with lawful adversarial deception and culminating with lies, perjury, and wrongful obedience. Following this lead, one fact leaps out at us: the misdeeds occurred during a high-stakes discovery process.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Every litigator knows that discovery is one of the most contentious parts of civil litigation. Civil discovery is like a game of Battleship. One side calls out its shots—it files discovery requests—and the other side must announce when a shot scores a hit. It makes that announcement by turning over a document. There are two big differences. First, unlike Battleship, it isn’t always clear when a shot has scored a hit. Lawyers get to argue about whether their document really falls within the scope of the request. They can argue that the request was too broad, or too narrow, or that the document is privileged, or is attorney work-product. Second, unlike Battleship, lawyers don’t always get to peek at the opponent’s card after the game. When the opponent concludes that a shot missed her battleship, she makes the decision ex parte—she doesn’t have to announce it to her adversary, who may never learn that a smoking-gun document (the battleship) was withheld based on an eminently debatable legal judgment.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Every litigation associate goes through a rite of passage: She finds a document that seemingly lies squarely within the scope of a legitimate discovery request, but her supervisor tells her to devise an argument for excluding it. As long as the argument isn’t frivolous there is nothing improper about this, but it marks the first step onto the slippery slope. For better or for worse, a certain kind of innocence is lost. It is the moment when withholding information despite an adversary’s legitimate request starts to feel like zealous advocacy rather than deception. It is the moment when the no-deception principle encoded in Model Rule <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page698" class="pagebreak" title="698">698</span>8.4(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(c)&quot; " /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1505" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1505" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">145</a></span> gets gerrymandered away from its plain meaning. But, like any other piece of elastic, the no-deception principle loses its grip if it is stretched too often. Soon, if the lawyer isn’t very careful, every damaging request seems too broad or too narrow; every smoking-gun document is either work-product or privileged; no adversary ever has a right to “my” documents. At that point the fatal question is not far away: Is lying really so bad when it is the only way to protect “my” documents from an adversary who has no right to them? If legitimate advocacy marks the beginning of this particular slippery slope, Berkey-Kodak lies at its end.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Recall, Rule 5.2(a) specifies: “A lawyer is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person.” Subpart (b) states, however: “A subordinate lawyer does not violate the rules of professional conduct if that lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Interestingly, other professions do not provide a comparable “superior orders” defense. Rather, most other ethical codes explicitly underscore individuals’ obligations to use independent judgment and to comply with relevant standards. For example, Rule 102 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Code of Professional Conduct provides that “ . . . in the performance of any professional service, a member . . . shall not subordinate his judgment to others.” Similarly Section 9.055 of the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics advises medical students, resident physicians, and other staff to “refuse to participate in patient care ordered by their supervisors in those cases in which they believe the orders reflect serious errors in clinical judgment or physician impairment that could result in a threat of imminent harm.” Subordinates should also “communicate their concerns to the physicians issuing the orders and, if necessary, to the appropriate person for mediating such disputes.” So too, Rule 9(a) of the National Society of Professional Engineers’ Code of Ethics for Engineers provides that engineers must “accept responsibility for all professional acts,” and Rule 1(a) requires that if their judgment is overruled under circumstances where the “safety, health, property, or welfare of the public are endangered, they shall notify their employer or client and such other authority as may be appropriate.”<a id="_Ref32241963" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1506" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1506" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">146</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Defenders of the Model Rules’ approach generally claim that it provides appropriate recognition of the reality of legal practice in organizational contexts: Namely, that the situation of the junior attorney is “more precarious and more pressured” than that of senior attorneys.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1507" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1507" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">147</a></span> Studies of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page699" class="pagebreak" title="699">699</span>ethical decisions in law firms find considerable incentives for lawyers to adopt, or leave unchallenged, the norms of dominant partners.<a id="_Ref32241933" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1508" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1508" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">148</a></span> In her study of ethical compliance in law firms, Kimberly Kirkland found that law firm associates from the first day learn “to look up and around” and that “the final arbiter of the quality of your work is not the client, the judge or any external truth, it’s the partner you’re working for.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1509" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1509" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">149</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">By contrast, critics of the Model Rules’ approach believe that special protection for subordinates is neither necessary nor appropriate. Given the political and financial constraints under which bar disciplinary agencies operate, they tend to pursue clear cases, not those involving “reasonable resolutions of an arguable question of professional duty,” whatever the status of the attorney. In fact, the most comprehensive review of Rule 5.2 found no reported case in which a junior attorney has been absolved of sanctions for following a superior’s order.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1510" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1510" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Yet to the extent that the Rule serves primarily to provide ethical guidance for lawyers rather than to affect disciplinary proceedings, critics believe that it provides the wrong message. In critics’ view, subordinate attorneys should be encouraged to raise ethical concerns with their supervisors or with others in a position to review a supervisor’s questionable calls. Such decisions may in some instances be the product of hasty, self-interested, or ill-informed judgments. And in some of those cases, associates who are under less direct pressure than their supervisors to achieve a final result may be in a better position to evaluate ethical concerns. One function of ethical codes is to provide justifications and support for lawyers who might otherwise have difficulty raising moral concerns. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2.</span><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps;"><span style="margin-right: 5px;" /></span>In a widely discussed article in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Harvard Law School Bulletin</span>, Professor Duncan Kennedy notes that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">There are many variations on law firm hierarchy. There are firms in which senior partners test associates to see if they are such sell-outs that they’ll do anything, no matter how ethically questionable, and firms in which someone will put a black mark in a mental book if you show the slightest hesitation about putting your arm to the elbow in muck. There are firms where you can get out of doing bad things with the equivalent of “please, not tonight, dear, I have a headache,” and firms where you can engage your coworkers in a serious dialogue about the ethics of particular cases.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1511" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1511" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">151</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">In Kennedy’s view, associates have a responsibility to try and ensure that their firm falls into the final category.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If you fight now, if you come to stand for something now you’ll be able to make things different when you own the place. If you’ve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page700" class="pagebreak" title="700">700</span>done nothing during the long interval but cave in, and cave in, and cave in, you won’t even know it when you own the place, or if you know it you won’t care. . . .</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">In correspondence responding to Kennedy’s article, Harvard Law School alumnus John Kester wrote:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">One should not barter one’s soul to practice law, and one does not have to. It is inconceivable to me that any attorney in my firm would be forced to work on a case if he found it morally offensive. But you can’t expect to be a habitual conscientious objector and still plan to be a general. No law graduates were ever conscripted to join my firm (or to go to law school, for that matter). If they do so, it’s because they seek challenging work, development of skills, able co-workers, an opportunity to help people, and wealth for themselves. If you are far to the left and only support causes you like, then you ought not be offering yourself for general hire as a lawyer. The problem is not with the clients or the cases, it’s with you—you are in the wrong line of work.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1512" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1512" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">152</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">How would you respond? What do the reading by Schiltz and Luban above suggest about the pressures and responsibilities of subordinate lawyers?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />An extensive body of law addresses how to control organizational misconduct and how to assign individual responsibility in organizational settings. Issues of enterprise liability, corporate crime, aiding and abetting, willful ignorance, conspiracy, and liability of managers and directors all have well-developed doctrine. Such topics are also the subject of an immense theoretical literature in economics, law, psychology and organization theory.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1513" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1513" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">153</a></span> These doctrinal and theoretical frameworks have some direct application to law firms, corporate counsel offices, and other legal employers.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In analyzing the relationship between organizational structure and collective ethical compliance, Professor Susan Saab Fortney suggests that the move by law firms away from general partnerships, in which all partners share in the legal liability of the firm, toward limited liability structures, in which partners are personally insulated from misconduct by other lawyers, has reduced firmwide incentives for policing collegial misconduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1514" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1514" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">154</a></span> If this is true, what could be done to restore such incentives without withdrawing the protections that limited liability law partnerships provide to lawyers who want to work together and pool resources and risk? </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861627" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219181" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756587" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908721" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 5</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 2014, General Motors encountered a world of trouble when it came to light that millions of its automobiles had faulty ignition switches. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page701" class="pagebreak" title="701">701</span>As a consequence of the defect, it was easy for keys (especially keys attached to heavy key chains) to slip out of the ignition, which would, in turn, disable power-assisted steering and brakes, as well as air bags. Over time, this defect led to many collisions, over 185 serious injuries, and over 124 deaths.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">GM started manufacturing cars with defective ignition switches around 2001 and stopped using the defective switches in its Model Year 2007 fleet. Yet at the time GM stopped using the defective switches, GM did not conduct a recall to remove the faulty and dangerous switches from millions of already-manufactured vehicles. For reasons discussed below, the company went for years without any sense of urgency about the problem and, generally, failed to recognize the problem for what it was.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Once the above information became public, GM’s inaction cost the company dearly. It was fined $35 million from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (its maximum penalty) and made to pay a $900 million penalty by the U.S. Department of Justice. GM’s CEO was repeatedly made to testify before Congress. GM reorganized its entire engineering division. And over 2.6 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches were recalled. Meanwhile, the ignition switch debacle set off internal reviews, responsible for the recall of at least another 28 million vehicles. More than 3,000 personal injury and wrongful death claims were filed against GM, most of which have now been resolved or dismissed. By 2019, the company had paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1515" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1515" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">155</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">GM CEO Mary Barra testified that she only learned about the ignition switch issue on January 13, 2014, and that she made appropriate disclosures very soon thereafter. She suggested that if she, or GM’s previous CEO, had learned of this defect sooner, appropriate action would have been taken, and many lives would have been spared.<span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"><a id="ftnb.1516" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1516" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">156</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In March 2014 Barra hired the law firm of Jenner &amp; Block to conduct an independent, thorough, investigation. On May 29, 2014, Anton R. Valukas of Jenner &amp; Block released the report, in redacted form.<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1517" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1517" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">157</a></span> Based on more than 350 interviews with 230 witnesses, this report blames the episode on engineering ignorance and bureaucratic dithering, not a deliberate cover-up. In Valukas’s words:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The interviews here showed a troubling disavowal of responsibility made possible by a proliferation of committees. It is an example of what witnesses called the “GM salute,” a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page702" class="pagebreak" title="702">702</span>crossing of arms and pointing outward towards others, indicating that the responsibility belongs to someone else. Here, because a committee was “responsible,” no single person bore responsibility or was individually accountable.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1518" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1518" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">158</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This phenomenon of “information silos” extended to GM’s lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1519" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1519" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">159</a></span> The Report concludes: “[F]aced with a pattern of crashes that had resulted in fatalities and an unexplained ‘anomaly’ that affected the deployment of airbags, [GM’s lawyers] did not . . . elevate the issues to the General Counsel and do not appear to have insisted on a quick and concrete timetable for the safety investigation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1520" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1520" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">160</a></span> The General Counsel claimed that he never knew about the issue. Outside counsel in products liability litigation recommended settling cases quietly, which had the unintended effect of keeping the safety problem bottled up in a litigation committee that did not know the big picture.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1521" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1521" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">161</a></span> The Report also found:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">At a Roundtable discussion [a committee meeting involving staff attorneys concerning product liability suits] on the Cobalt airbag non-deployment issue in 2012 [which was later found to be caused by the faulty ignition switch], a junior lawyer recalled asking whether there should be a recall. He was told that the issue had already been raised with engineering, that the engineers were working on it, and that they had not come up with a solution. This lawyer got the “vibe” that the lawyers had “done everything we can do.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1522" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1522" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">162</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet in 2003, GM’s then-General Counsel had issued a memorandum to “All Attorneys” in the office, reminding them that: “If you as an attorney are aware of any threatened, on-going, or past violation of a federal, state, or local law or regulation . . . it is your responsibility to respond appropriately.” The memo instructed junior lawyers to “report the situation to your superior,” and, “[i]f you believe that they have not addressed it appropriately or if you believe that bringing it to their attention would be futile, you should pursue it higher in the organization—if necessary, to me as General Counsel.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.1523" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section21.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.1523" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">163</a></span> This admonition closely reflects the reporting requirement in the recently-issued Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. It is unclear whether these instructions were still in circulation within GM’s legal department in 2012, when the Roundtable discussion took place.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Suppose you had been the junior in-house lawyer at that 2012 meeting. Assume that you knew at the time of the meeting that the defect in thousands of GM’s cars had already caused many deaths and was certain to cause many more, in the absence of an immediate recall. Assume as well that you guessed, but were not certain, that neither GM’s General Counsel nor its CEO knew about the problem. What would you do? What risks would you face? If you chose to go over your immediate supervisor’s head, what protections might be available to you?</p>

These lawyers work in places like the Department of Justice, charged with independently enforcing federal law, and the White House Counsel’s Office, which is supposed to be attentive to the long-range interests of the institution of the presidency, not simply follow the personal wishes of a particular president. Wendel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Trump Administration</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span> note 73<span data-field=" NOTEREF _Ref32240425 \h " />, at 304. Wendel does not see a strong distinction between the fiduciary duties of government lawyers in protecting the public interest and those of their private sector counterparts, who also have to protect the broader interests of their organizational clients (and their constituents, like shareholders) and resist efforts by managers to advance their own ends. <a id="dabmci_bd19668996104e6e8ff7034799296234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 303.</p>
