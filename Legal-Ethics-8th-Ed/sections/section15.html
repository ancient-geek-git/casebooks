      <p class="TextParagraph">The lawyer-client relationship is the foundation upon which legal ethics builds.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.453" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.453" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> Understanding how that relationship takes shapes, how it functions, and how it may come to an end is therefore critical to framing the obligations and dilemmas of professional role that we take up in the rest of the book. This chapter explores the following questions: When does a lawyer-client relationship form? What essential obligations does the creation of a lawyer-client relationship impose on the lawyer? Once the lawyer-client relationship is established, who gets to decide which issues? And how does the relationship end?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861314" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922242" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218880" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908428" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Formation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A lawyer-client relationship is formed when a client asks for legal assistance and the lawyer consents to provide it. And many relationships begin in an ordered, straightforward fashion—with a legal consultation, an explicit agreement by the lawyer to provide services, and the execution of a retainer agreement specifying the scope of representation. But sometimes, the circumstances surrounding the encounter between a lawyer and someone seeking legal help is more ambiguous. A lawyer may think that a client relationship clearly has not been formed, while the person seeking help may have the opposite view. How do we know who is right? For insight, consider the famous Seventh Circuit case below.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="CaseHead"><a id="_Toc451861315" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218881" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756297" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908429" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Westinghouse Electric Corp. v.

      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span> Opinion by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sprecher, Circuit Judge</span>:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[This appeal raises the following issue:] whether an attorney-client relationship arises only when both parties consent to its formation or can it also occur when the lay party submits confidential information to the law party with reasonable belief that the latter is acting as the former’s attorney. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The four separate appellants are some of the defendants in this antitrust case who were each denied their motions to disqualify the law <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page172" class="pagebreak" title="172">172</span>firm of Kirkland and Ellis (“Kirkland”) from further representing the plaintiff Westinghouse Electric Corporation (“Westinghouse”). . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The complaint in this case was filed on October 15, 1976 and the four appellants moved to disqualify Kirkland in January and February 1977. On April 18, 1978, the district court filed a lengthy memorandum followed by orders denying the disqualification motions. These appeals followed. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On September 8, 1975, Westinghouse, a major manufacturer of nuclear reactors, notified utility companies that 17 of its long-term uranium supply contracts had become “commercially impracticable” under <a id="dabmci_ab542de362fc439f88ff286a2524eadf" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 2–615 of the Uniform Commercial Code. In response, the affected utilities filed 13 federal actions, one state action, and three foreign actions against Westinghouse, alleging breach of contract and challenging Westinghouse’s invocation of <a id="dabmci_d448779258ae42a797f406480f1adfa7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 2–615. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As an outgrowth of its defense of these contract actions, Westinghouse on October 15, 1976, filed the present antitrust action against 12 foreign and 17 domestic corporations engaged in various aspects of the uranium industry.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Kirkland’s representation of Westinghouse’s uranium litigation has required the efforts of 8 to 14 of its attorneys [from its Chicago office] and has generated some $2.5 million in legal fees.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Contemporaneously with its Westinghouse representation in the uranium cases, Kirkland represented API [American Petroleum Institute], using six of its lawyers [from its Washington, D.C. office] in that project.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In October, 1975, Congress was presented with legislative proposals to break up the oil companies, both vertically by separating their control over production, transportation, refining and marketing entities, and horizontally by prohibiting cross-ownership of alternative energy resources in addition to oil and gas. Since this proposed legislation threatened oil companies with a potential divestiture of millions of dollars of assets, in November, 1975, the API launched a Committee on Industrial Organization to lobby against the proposals. On December 10, 1975, API’s president requested that each company designate one of its senior executives to facilitate coordination of the Committee’s activities with the individual companies.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Committee was organized into five task forces. The Legal Task Force was headed by L. Bates Lea, General Counsel of Standard Oil of Indiana, assisted by Stark Ritchie, API’s General Counsel.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On February 25, 1976, Ritchie wrote to Frederick M. Rowe, a partner in Kirkland’s Washington office, retaining the firm to review the divestiture hearings and “prepare arguments for use in opposition to this type of legislation.” On May 4, 1976, Ritchie added that the Kirkland <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" class="pagebreak" title="173">173</span>firm’s work for API “should include the preparation of possible testimony, analyzing the probable legal consequences and antitrust considerations of the proposed legislation” and “you should make an objective survey and study of the probable effects of the pending legislation, specifically including probable effects on oil companies that would have to divest assets.” Ritchie noted that “(a)s a part of this study, we will arrange for interviews by your firm with a cross-section of industry personnel.” The May 4 letter to Rowe concluded with:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Your firm will, of course, act as an independent expert counsel and hold any company information learned through these interviews in strict confidence, not to be disclosed to any other company, or even to API, except in aggregated or such other form as will preclude identifying the source company with its data.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On May 25, 1976, Ritchie sent to 59 API member companies a survey questionnaire seeking data to be used by Kirkland in connection with its engagement by API. In the introductory memorandum to the questionnaire, Ritchie advised the 59 companies that Kirkland had “ascertained that certain types of data pertinent to the pending anti-diversification legislation are not now publicly available” and the API “would appreciate your help in providing this information to Kirkland. . . .” The memorandum included the following:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Kirkland, Ellis &amp; Rowe is acting as an independent special counsel for API, and will hold any company information in strict confidence, not to be disclosed to any other company, or even to API, except in aggregated or such other form as will preclude identifying the source company with its data. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The data sought was to assist Kirkland “in preparing positions, arguments and testimony in opposition to this type of legislative (divestiture)” and was not to be sent to API but rather to Kirkland.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Pursuant to the provision in Ritchie’s May 4, 1976 letter to Rowe that interviews would be arranged with a cross-section of industry personnel, Nolan Clark, a Kirkland partner, interviewed representatives of eight oil companies between April 29 and June 15, 1976.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After going through several drafts, the final Kirkland report to API was released on October 15, 1976. The final report contains 230 pages of text and 82 pages of exhibits. References to uranium appear throughout the report and uranium is the primary subject of about 25 pages of text and 11 pages of exhibits. The report marshals a large number of facts and arguments to show that oil company diversification does not threaten overall energy competition. In particular the report asserts that the relatively high concentration ratios in the uranium industry can be expected to decline, that current increases in uranium prices are a result of increasing demand, that oil company entry into uranium production has stimulated competition and diminished concentration, that oil <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" class="pagebreak" title="174">174</span>companies have no incentive to act in concert to restrict coal or uranium production and that the historical record refutes any charge that oil companies have restricted uranium output. The report concludes that “the energy industries, both individually and collectively, are competitive today and are likely to remain so.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted at the outset of this opinion, the API report was issued on the same day as the present antitrust suit was filed against several defendants, including Gulf, Kerr-McGee and Getty.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The district court concluded that “[a] comparison of the two documents reveals a rather basic conflict in their contentions and underlying theories.” The court also observed that “[p]erhaps in recognition of the diametrically opposing theories of the API report and the Westinghouse complaint, Kirkland does not attempt to rebut the oil companies’ charges that it has simultaneously taken inconsistent positions on competition in the uranium industry.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Gulf, Kerr-McGee and Getty are substantial dues-paying members of API. Kerr-McGee and Getty are also represented on API’s board of directors.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At Ritchie’s request, the cross-section interviews were mainly arranged by Gerald Thurmond, Washington Counsel of Gulf Oil Company and a member of API’s Antitrust Strategy Group. On May 11, 1976, Thurmond advised Gulf officials that Nolan Clark of Kirkland planned to visit them. Attached to Thurmond’s letter were the questions “which will be covered” in the meeting.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The meeting was held on May 28, 1976 in Denver. Nolan Clark represented Kirkland. In attendance for Gulf were six vice presidents, a comptroller and a regional attorney. Also present was a Harvard professor who “also is working with API on the same subject.” The meeting lasted more than two hours followed by lunch, during which discussions continued. After the meeting and in three letters from Gulf vice president Mingee to Clark dated August 10, 11 and 13, Gulf submitted specific information sought by Clark through the questionnaire and other written questions and in each letter Mingee stressed the confidential basis upon which the information was supplied.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Nolan Clark’s interview with two Kerr-McGee vice presidents took place in Oklahoma City on June 9, 1976 and lasted about three hours. Clark was given considerable background information on Kerr-McGee’s uranium industry, including mining locations, uranium conversion process, and pellet fabrication. On the subject of uranium marketing and pricing, one of the Kerr-McGee vice presidents described the escalating prices and tightening supplies in the current market, and the reasons behind the trends. Kerr-McGee sent its completed questionnaire to Clark on August 25, 1976.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Kirkland did not interview any Getty personnel. However, Getty received the confidential API questionnaire which requested it to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" class="pagebreak" title="175">175</span>estimate the value of its assets subject to proposed divestiture and its research and development outlays in alternative energy fields. Getty completed the questionnaire and mailed its data sheets to Nolan Clark on June 4, 1976, with the understanding that the data would be held in confidence.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">II</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The crux of the district court’s determination was based upon its view that an “attorney-client relationship is one of agency to which the general rules of agency apply” and “arises only when the parties have given their consent, either express or implied, to its formation.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Of course in many respects and situations an attorney acts as a simple agent for the client, but the attorney is held to obligations to the client which go far beyond those of an agent and beyond the principles of agency, just as they transcend the legal bounds of an arms-length commercial transaction. Mr. Chief Justice (then Judge) Burger said . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The basic elements of the attorney-client relationship are not changed because the contract for services is expressed in a formal written contract. Indeed the very making of a formal contract and its performance impose a high duty on the attorney because he is dealing in an area in which he is expert and the client is not and as to which the client must necessarily rely on the attorney. . . . This is not to suggest that a formal contract is unimportant but rather that a formal long-term contract, superimposed on the normal attorney-client relationship, alters the relationship only by adding new dimensions of duties and obligations on the attorney.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For these reasons it is obvious why an attorney-client relationship does not arise only in the agency manner such as when the parties expressly or impliedly consent to its formation as the district court erroneously concluded.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The district court first determined that there existed no explicit or express attorney-client relationship in that no oil company representative requested Kirkland to act as its attorney orally or in writing and Kirkland did not accept such employment orally or in writing. The district court found that “Kirkland sent its legal bills to the API, and was compensated only by the API.” A professional relationship is not dependent upon the payment of fees<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>nor, as we have noted, upon the execution of a formal contract.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The court then purported to determine whether the professional relationship “may be implied from the conduct of the parties.” First, it found no “indicia” such as “the preparation of a legally-binding document like a contract or a will, or the attorney’s appearance in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding.” Second, the court searched for evidence of three fundamental characteristics of an agency relationship: the power to affect the legal relations of the principal and others; a fiduciary who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page176" class="pagebreak" title="176">176</span>works on behalf of his principal and primarily for his benefit; and a principal who has the right to control the conduct of the agent. Using these tests, the court concluded that “[v]iewed in its totality, we believe that the evidence shows that no attorney-client relationship has existed between Kirkland and the oil companies.” As we have indicated, to apply only the agency tests is too narrow an approach for determining whether a lawyer’s fiduciary obligation has arisen. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The client is no longer simply the person who walks into a law office.<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>A lawyer employed by a corporation represents the entity<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>but that principle does not of itself solve the potential conflicts existing between the entity and its individual participants. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Here we are faced with neither an ordinary commercial corporation nor with an informal or unincorporated association, but instead with a nation-wide trade association with 350 corporate and 7,500 individual members and doing business as a non-profit corporation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We need not make any generalized pronouncements of whether an attorney for such an organization represents every member because this case can and should be decided on a much more narrow ground. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The professional relationship for purposes of the privilege for attorney-client communications “hinges upon the client’s belief that he is consulting a lawyer in that capacity and his manifested intention to seek professional legal advice.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>The affidavits before the district court established that: the Washington counsel for Gulf “was given to believe that the Kirkland firm was representing both API and Gulf;” Kerr-McGee’s vice president understood a Kirkland partner to explain that Kirkland was working on behalf of API and also its members such as Kerr-McGee;<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>and Getty’s vice president stated that in submitting data to Kirkland he “acted upon the belief and expectation that such submission was made in order to enable [Kirkland] to render legal service to Getty in furtherance of Getty’s interests.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The professional relationship does not arise where one consults an attorney in a capacity other than as an attorney.<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>The district court said that the Kirkland “firm’s involvement was that of an expert consultant and researcher.” The questionnaire sent to 59 oil company members of API represented to the recipients that the Kirkland firm “is acting as an independent special counsel for API.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>The API letter employing Kirkland expressly said that “[y]our firm will, of course, act as an independent expert counsel.”<span style="color: #000000;" class="apple-converted-space"> </span>The lobbying-type functions undertaken by Kirkland in this case are not foreign to lawyers and in fact are a common undertaking by Washington, D. C. lawyers. In soliciting confidences from API members, Kirkland did not disavow its capacity as attorneys but came expressly represented as lawyers. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Affirmed in part; Reversed and Remanded in part.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What is the court’s holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse</span>? Does the court find that Kirkland had established a lawyer-client relationship with API’s members? What type?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What consequence flows from the court’s holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse</span>?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The <a id="dabmci_bb34f8a25b66413eb6012a14b95e9eef" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span> § 14, cmt. e states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">. . . . Even when a lawyer has not communicated willingness to represent a person, a client-lawyer relationship arises when the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide services, and the lawyer, who reasonably should know of this reliance, does not inform the person that the lawyer will not do so. . . . In appraising whether the person’s reliance was reasonable, courts consider that lawyers ordinarily have superior knowledge of what representation entails and that lawyers often encourage clients and potential clients to rely on them. . . .</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Was it reasonable for the members of API to believe that Kirkland was representing them in the lobbying matter? In this regard, does the language in the questionnaire stating that Kirkland “is acting as an independent special counsel for API” reinforce or cut against that belief? How much should it matter that the representatives of API member groups were sophisticated actors?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Could this case have been decided in favor of protecting the confidences of the API members without ruling on whether a professional relationship existed?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Note that even when a lawyer-client relationship has not been established, a lawyer has a duty to protect confidential information gained in initial consultation with a prospective client and must generally avoid representing interests adverse to that prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter. The law firm of an attorney who gains confidential information from a prospective client may represent a client with adverse interests if the attorney with the confidences limited her exposure and is screened off from the adverse representation. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Rule 1.18(b)–(d).</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse</span> illustrates a central principle of legal ethics: The creation of a lawyer-client relationship—explicitly by agreement or implicitly under the standard articulated in the case—means that the lawyer carries the full set of client duties, including the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. As we will discuss in the next chapter, whether a professional relationship has been formed also determines whether communications between a lawyer and client fall under the attorney-client privilege, which protects a lawyer from being compelled to reveal confidential communications in court or before a similar tribunal. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How much control does a lawyer have in defining when his or her actions constitute legal representation on behalf of a client (thus gaining protection of the privilege) and when they do not? This question came up in relation to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" class="pagebreak" title="178">178</span>Rudy Giuliani’s work on behalf of President Trump in the Ukraine, which led to Trump’s impeachment. In that case, Giuliani made a number of trips to convince Ukrainian officials to open corruption investigations (including one focused on the son of Joe Biden, a main political rival) that would benefit Trump’s campaign for reelection. When asked by a reporter for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Atlantic</span> about the extent to which these efforts (widely viewed as, at best, deeply inappropriate and, at worst, illegal) were at the behest of the President, Giuliani replied: “I’m not acting as a lawyer. I’m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government.” However, when Giuliani was subpoenaed by Congress to turn over documents in relation to the impeachment inquiry, he refused on the ground that the documents were covered by the attorney-client privilege—which would mean that he <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> representing Trump. To what extent should a court hold a lawyer like Giuliani to public statements about the nature of his relationship or defer to subsequent changes in how the relationship is characterized? What evidence would be relevant in determining whether a lawyer-client relationship existed and how would a court gain access to it? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">After experiencing severe headaches, Peter Talesh was admitted to the hospital, where tests determined that he had suffered an aneurysm in a large artery supplying blood to the brain. Emergency surgery was performed by the attending physician, who placed a metal clamp on the artery, cutting off the supply of blood in order to relieve pressure on the aneurysm and allow it to heal. Instead, the clamp so severely reduced blood flow to Peter’s brain that his right arm and leg became paralyzed.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Fourteen months later, Peter’s wife, Carol, met with an attorney, Abraham Winkler, to discuss whether her husband had any claims against the doctor for medical malpractice. At that meeting, Carol described the circumstances surrounding her husband’s injury and answered questions about the incident put to her by Winkler. At the conclusion of the meeting, which lasted forty-five minutes, Carol recalled Winkler telling her that “he did not think we had a legal case; however, he was going to discuss it with his partner.” When she did not hear from Winkler after one week, she concluded that he had come to the conclusion that “there wasn’t a case.” Winkler made no other contact with Carol, and she was not billed for the meeting.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One year later, Carol ran into an old friend, who happened to be a medical malpractice lawyer, and she described what had happened to her husband. Her friend expressed shock that she had not pursued a lawsuit against the doctor, stating that he thought she had a strong claim for medical malpractice. When Carol asked if he would take her case, the friend told her: “I’m sorry, but this type of claim has a two-year statute of limitations, so you are now barred from filing a lawsuit.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Could Carol sue Winkler on the ground that they had established a lawyer-client relationship and, in giving legal advice about her claim, he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" class="pagebreak" title="179">179</span>negligently failed to inform her of the two-year statute of limitations?<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.454" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.454" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> Would it matter that Peter rather than Carol would have been the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">A professional relationship may be formed on the basis of explicit or implicit understandings between the lawyer and client. As <span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse</span> demonstrated, such a relationship may arise even when a lawyer does not intend to create one, if the lawyer has acted in a way that makes it reasonable for someone in the client’s position to believe that the lawyer agreed to the representation. Why does this matter? Because, as we also saw in <span style="font-style: italic;">Westinghouse</span>, the creation of a lawyer-client relationship—even if implied by circumstances and not desired by the lawyer—means that the lawyer is bound to follow professional duties of loyalty (e.g., maintaining confidences and avoiding conflicts) and care. In later chapters, we will explore the loyalty duties related to confidentiality (Chapter 6) and conflicts of interest (Chapter 9). In this part, we focus on core aspects of the duty of care, specifically, the duty to provide competent representation and communicate effectively with the client.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861319" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218885" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908433" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Competence</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.1 states: “A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.” Comment 2 to the Rule makes clear that:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">[2] A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent as a practitioner with long experience. Some important legal skills, such as the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal drafting, are required in all legal problems. Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a skill that necessarily transcends any particular specialized knowledge. A lawyer can provide adequate representation in a wholly novel field through necessary study. Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Comment 5 emphasizes that competence “includes adequate preparation,” which is determined “in part by what it as stake; major <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" class="pagebreak" title="180">180</span>litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more extensive treatment than matters of lesser complexity and consequence.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition to the basic competence standard, Rule 1.3 specifies that “[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.” Failure to exercise diligence constitutes client neglect. When a lawyer fails to file a brief on time or misses a hearing in court, without adequate grounds for excuse, such conduct could be prosecuted in a disciplinary proceeding as a violation of Rule 1.3.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Remember that these are the minimum standards applicable to all lawyers under the professional rules. There are other standards that may also apply depending on the particular context. For instance, as we will see in Chapter 8’s discussion of conflicts of interest in criminal defense, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a criminal case has been interpreted as requiring “effective assistance of counsel,” which is measured against an “objective standard of reasonableness.” Reversal under this standard is mandated when, “but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” <a id="dabmci_27377765903e4e0299890fc55ab8afd9" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Strickland v.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Joseph F. Muto was admitted to the New York bar in January 1987. Although he worked in Syracuse for a real estate firm, for the District Attorney, and twice as a solo practitioner, he never established a successful practice. After ten years he moved to New York City. In response to an advertisement, he began doing immigration cases for attorney David Rodkin. After a few months, having seen how much money could be made in immigration law, he left with another employee, Karen Jaffe, both of whom opened individual practices in Chinatown. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[One of Muto’s clients was] Chang Kui Lin. Lin testified that he paid a “snakehead” $30,000 to smuggle him into Mexico by boat in 1992, then to Los Angeles on foot, and finally to New York by plane. In March 1993, he applied through Xing Rong Service Company for a work authorization card, which was granted and renewed annually. When that agency closed he switched to Blue Eagle. In 1997, Blue Eagle employee Tiffany Dong notified him of a political asylum hearing based on China’s coercive family planning policy—the first he had heard of the application. On November 10, he gave the agency his papers, including <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page181" class="pagebreak" title="181">181</span>his wife’s abortion certificate. The agency took him to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) hearing but failed to prepare, and asylum was denied. On February 6, 1998 Dong told Lin to appear for the Immigration Court (“IC”) master calendar on February 26. That day he went to Blue Eagle, paid $250, and was taken to the courtroom by Eddie Ye (Dong’s husband). . . . [Immigration Judge Ferris scheduled a merits hearing on Lin’s asylum claim for November 3.] Ye took Lin to the November 3 hearing and “told me that this Mr. Muto is my attorney.” Lin had never met Muto before and did not choose him, pay him, or sign a notice of appearance. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When Judge Ferris reprimanded Muto at the November 3 hearing for his “totally inadequate” . . . change of venue motion he answered: “I wasn’t aware, Your Honor.” He could not explain his failure to file the necessary documents. . . . Consulting with his client for the first time, Muto said Lin had “advised me he had trouble procuring the documents from his wife in China.” . . . Judge Ferris gave Muto two weeks to explain why he hadn’t moved to enlarge the time. “That’s what lawyers do,” Judge Ferris said. Muto promised, “[y]ou will have it.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lin could not see Muto before the next hearing on January 20, 1999, because the lawyer had given him neither a business card nor an office address. Ye once again took Lin to court. Another lawyer, Claude Maratea, appeared for Muto “of counsel” because, Lin said, “the Judge did not like this Muto to be at the hearing.” Judge Ferris observed that service on Muto at his home address had failed three times, and said, “I will note for the record that I saw him earlier. That he muttered something and then went scurrying out of my courtroom. I’m going to require Mr. [ ] Muto to be produced on this case.” When he was produced, Muto said “I had to accept responsibility, Your Honor. I didn’t prepare the motion [to enlarge the time to file.] I wasn’t sure exactly how you wanted it. I hadn’t done one before.” When Judge Ferris accused him of having “just ignored it,” he objected, stating that “[i]t actually slipped through the cracks. I apologize.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge: I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to represent this individual because you’re not representing him in [a] fair manner. . . . And then by sending in another lawyer who you knew could not answer any of these questions, because you walked out of my courtroom muttering that you weren’t going to appear in this case.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />I was feeling nervous coming in here, Your Honor.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Counsel, frankly, given the quality of your representation, that is the first appropriate response I have heard from you. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge Ferris gave him a week “to file a motion with me as to your law office failures in this matter.”</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page182" class="pagebreak" title="182">182</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />I expect you to set up an appointment immediately with your client at an address. Do you have any business cards with you?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />I kind of ran out of business cards today, Your Honor.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Yes, that’s what you tell me every time. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">When Ye brought Lin back to court a week later, Judge Ferris asked Muto about the motion “to be filed no later than yesterday.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />I did not do it, Your Honor. I had planned. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Mr. Muto, I’m requesting the Chief Judge of the United States Immigration Court to sanction you. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />I was going to do the work over the weekend. My mother is in the hospital for surgery. She’s very ill. And I have the name of the social worker at the hospital who [can] attest to that to verify what I’m saying.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Well, Mr. Muto, that’s not how you do it. Right? You know perfectly well it’s not the court’s job to call social workers at hospitals.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Calling his representation “less than stellar,” Judge Ferris gave him another week to file the motion. Otherwise, Judge Ferris said,</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">I will not allow you to be this man’s attorney anymore. . . . [You] couldn’t even write to The Court and ask for an extension claiming a family emergency, but . . . I’ve seen you in the court every day this week . . . you find the time to represent your clients or you get out of practice. I am tired of you, Mr. Muto, because you never meet your deadlines. . . . And you are hurting people and I am not going to be a party to that. Hear me well and hear me clearly. This record is going to the Appellate Division, Disciplinary Committee in its entirety. And I’m requesting action against you.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Muto filed his motion for consideration of late evidence. The bailiff called the case at noon the next day, but Muto was not present. Judge Ferris opened the hearing by saying: “I will note that Mr. Muto has poked his head in my door a couple of times this morning, but he has never stopped and he has never made a formal representation on the record as to why his client is not here.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">She denied the asylum application and ordered Lin deported. When both Muto and Lin appeared ten minutes later she reopened the case, acknowledging it was scheduled for the next day, but challenged Muto’s claim to have an office at 5 Doyers Street. Muto insisted he had his own room:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Invite you or anyone to come down and look at it</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" class="pagebreak" title="183">183</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Judge:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As a matter of fact, I tried to do that, Mr. Muto, and it could not be located in that building. . . . [S]hould someone misplace your business card, if they had it, they would have no way of contacting you because you’re unlisted. That is not a professional form of doing practice. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Muto:<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />That’s an upstate thing.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Judge Ferris rejected Muto’s excuses for delays in providing documentation, closed the record, and suggested voluntary departure. After consulting his client, Muto said Lin would accept it; but questioned by Ferris, Lin insisted on pursuing his application. In the subsequent disciplinary hearing, Muto attempted to explain why he accepted the voluntary departure. He said he had feared there was:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[P]robably at least a 50–50, if not greater chance that she would have that man taken into custody. That she would effectively—I don’t want to say a kangaroo court type hearing—but she would conduct a hearing in a very short span of time . . . deny his case, and then order him arrested. Muto claimed that Judge Ferris “was very angry at me. She has a problem with me. . . . I asked other lawyers if they would take the case over, and they overwhelmingly said no.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Muto then moved to withdraw as counsel because Lin “has not been completely up front with me.” Muto said he had “no clue that this case was on for today,” and the judge’s threatened grievance “will place me in a position where I would be possibly impeaching my client.” Judge Ferris questioned his good faith but gave him a day to file a formal motion to withdraw. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The next day Lin told Judge Ferris that Muto “asked me to have” Maratea represent him. Judge Ferris rebuked Muto: “[I]t’s inappropriate for you to be hiring him. . . . The Respondent is the one who hires his own lawyer. That’s the whole problem with this case. I have no evidence he ever hired you directly.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Describing how he would get other lawyers, like Maratea, to take over his cases, Muto stated:]</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">I’ll say a few words in Chinese [spoken] . . . point my thumb up. And have somebody—maybe a court interpreter, maybe a paid interpreter of another lawyer, explain to them. . . . And I’ll say, good lawyer [repeated in Chinese]. . . . And that’s how every other lawyer does it. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Judge Ferris reprimanded Muto for giving her the motion to withdraw late and for failing to follow regulations, but she eventually granted it. . . . Maratea [later] testified that Muto had asked him to handle Lin’s master calendar because Judge Ferris disliked Muto.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At what point did Joseph Muto go wrong? When did his representation become incompetent? Should he have accepted <span style="color: #252525;">Chang Kui Lin’s</span> case in the first place?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At his disciplinary hearing Muto argued:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">I provide quality legal services, Your Honor, at an affordable price for poor people who’ve been [gouged] and used by smugglers. . . . I give 150 percent of my effort and my time. I go in on Sundays very often. . . . I work ‘til 7:30 or eight at night. . . . I handle a lot of cases. And virtually every one of my clients is overjoyed and happy with my services. . . . I’m the only low budget lawyer in Chinatown. . . . I’m Filene’s basement. My office is physically in the basement. . . . [T]hese complaints which . . . high priced lawyers are bringing—this isn’t about justice. . . . This is Lord and Taylor trying to put Filene’s basement out of business.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.455" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.455" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">What do you make of that defense? Should it matter that (accepting the truth of his assertions), Muto was providing services to poor clients who would have otherwise likely gone without legal representation?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If you were on the New York state bar disciplinary committee hearing Muto’s case, what sanction would you impose? Recall the discussion of disciplinary sanctions in Chapter 3, which showed that solo practitioners were disproportionately likely to be disciplined and that client neglect was one of the most common grounds. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />An important and evolving issue in relation to the duty of competence is the lawyer’s obligation to understand and stay current with technology. In 2012, the ABA modified Comment 8 to Rule 1.1 to make clear that competence includes keeping abreast of “the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology.” Thirty-eight states have now adopted a duty of technological competence. What this duty requires is still a work in progress as state bars make efforts to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of legal technology. However, there are some general guideposts. Like other types of information, if a lawyer is not familiar with a particular type of legal technology she is using or intends to use, the lawyer must either engage in appropriate study to get up to speed or, as the Louisiana State Bar stated in its opinion on the matter, obtain “advice from another lawyer or consultant about both technology and a lawyer’s ethical and professional responsibilities.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.456" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.456" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> Commentators have identified a number of important issues that fall within the ambit of a lawyer’s duty of technological competence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.457" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.457" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span> For instance, cloud storage of client information has become increasingly prevalent—and poses tangible client risks. Most jurisdictions permit cloud storage but, like New York, require that lawyers take <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page185" class="pagebreak" title="185">185</span>“reasonable care to ensure that the system is secure and that client confidentiality will be maintained.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.458" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.458" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> Another issue of potential ethical concern is the use of law practice management software to keep track of legal deadlines. Courts have not been sympathetic to lawyers who have missed filing deadlines because of technological glitches with those software systems or failure to fully understand their function. For instance, courts have refused to excuse lawyers’ missed filing deadlines when an electronic calendaring system failed to calculate the correct date for appeal,<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.459" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.459" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> or when attorneys relied on email notifications of a court ruling instead of reading the ruling itself (and thus failed to realize they had lost and needed to file an appeal).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.460" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.460" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The discovery of electronically stored information (ESI), or e-discovery, remains a thorny issue. The problem arises when a client has ESI that may be relevant in a pending case, but the lawyer does not fully grasp the technological tools necessary to extract that information in order to comply with appropriate discovery requests and protect client interests. As a result, the client, or an outside expert selected to assist in e-discovery, may run an inadequate search that does not produce all relevant nonprivileged information or, conversely, may inadvertently execute an overbroad search that delivers privileged and/or irrelevant (but highly proprietary) information to a client’s adversary. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush"><a id="dabmci_360930e5aaac4bf686d67294116f6ce7" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />The California State Bar, in Formal Opinion 2015–193<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Formal Opinion 2015–193&quot; \s &quot;Formal Opinion 2015–193&quot; \c 16 " />, addressed both aspects of the e-discovery problem.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.461" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.461" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> Although the bar recognized that “[n]ot every litigated case involves e-discovery,” it stressed that “almost every litigation matter <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially </span>does.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.462" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.462" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> Accordingly, the bar held that the “ethical duty of competence requires an attorney at the outset of each case to determine what electronic discovery issues might arise during the litigation, including the likelihood that e-discovery will or should be sought by either side.” In the bar’s terms, this duty requires the lawyer to: </p>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The California Bar went on to say that an attorney without adequate e-discovery knowledge likely violates the duty of competence by failing to consult an e-discovery expert when it becomes clear that e-discovery is at issue; such an expert can help structure electronic searches so as to minimize the risk of disclosure of privileged and irrelevant information to the opposing party. In addition, the bar suggested that a lawyer may violate the duty of competence by failing to supervise the client or an outside expert in structuring e-discovery and overseeing its execution. The bar stressed that the “attorney should issue appropriate instructions and guidance and, ultimately, conduct appropriate tests until satisfied that the attorney is meeting his ethical obligations prior to releasing ESI.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.464" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.464" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> Thus, it is not sufficient for a lawyer to rely on an outside expert or a client’s IT department to design and execute searches. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you think this is a good rule? Given that the lawyer retains an expert precisely because she lacks sufficient knowledge of e-discovery, how should the lawyer conduct oversight? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Social media communications by clients and lawyers are another potential minefield that implicates lawyer competence. In its guidance on the issue, the D.C. Bar Association has stated that competence “may require lawyer review of client social media postings relevant to client matters” to ensure that social media postings are not inconsistent with claims made in litigation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.465" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.465" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> On the flip side, a lawyer may be disciplined for failing to prevent a client from deleting relevant ESI,<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.466" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.466" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> and this rule has been extended by state bars to client social media posts.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.467" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.467" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> Consider this issue when reviewing the materials on discovery abuse in Chapter 7.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">How a lawyer should use artificial intelligence (AI) is another complex question given the developing state of the art. As the “Google Generation” enters the profession, reliance on internet searches conducted without deep evaluation of the source of information and how reliable it is may raise concerns about competence. Such searches, even in reputable databases like Westlaw and Lexis, rely on complex algorithms that can produce significant variation for similar search queries.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.468" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.468" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span> How much should lawyers be held to understand those algorithms or, at least, to test the accuracy of a search engine through multiple queries before relying on its output? The New York State Bar, providing guidance on social media use, cautioned that “[i]f an attorney cannot ascertain the functionality of a website, the attorney must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page187" class="pagebreak" title="187">187</span>proceed with great caution in conducting research on that website.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.469" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.469" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> Similar issues are raised when lawyers rely on AI in areas like technology-assisted data review in litigation or automated document assembly. The evolving standards of technological competence make clear that lawyers cannot defend against errors that harm clients by claiming ignorance of how the technology works. To the contrary, lawyers must make reasonable efforts to understand how the technology functions and what client risks it presents (through study or associating experts), or face professional discipline. </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The lawyer-client relationship is built on candor and trust. This requires that there be a two-way exchange of information. As we will see, rules of confidentiality are designed to promote candid communication from client to lawyer. In addition, lawyers are obligated to provide ongoing information to clients about their cases, even about those strategic decisions that lawyers may be empowered to make on their own (<span style="font-style: italic;">see </span>Part C, <span style="font-style: italic;">infra</span>).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.4 covers the lawyer’s duty to communicate with clients. It mandates, in section (a)(1), that the lawyer “promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client’s informed consent . . . is required.” Thus, for example, if client consent is required before the lawyer can take on a case potentially posing a conflict of interest, the lawyer must provide the client with material information about the nature of the conflict and its potential impact on the client prior to consent. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Rule 1.7(b)(4)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.7(b)(4)&quot; \s &quot;1.7(b)(4)&quot; \c 16 " />. In addition, the lawyer is required by Comment 2 to Rule 1.4 to “promptly consult with and secure the client’s consent” prior to taking action on an issue—such as whether to settle a case or accept a plea—about which only the client is authorized to decide. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.2(a)&quot; \s &quot;1.2(a)&quot; \c 16 " />1.2(a), <span style="font-style: italic;">infra</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Even on questions of strategy and tactics, a lawyer under Rule 1.4(a)(2)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.4(a)(2)&quot; \s &quot;1.4(a)(2)&quot; \c 16 " /> is still required to “reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client’s objectives are to be accomplished,” while Rule 1.4(a)(3)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.4(a)(3)&quot; \s &quot;1.4(a)(3)&quot; \c 16 " /> and (4)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.4(a)(4)&quot; \s &quot;(4)&quot; \c 16 " /> make clear that the lawyer is otherwise required to “keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter,” and “promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How much information is a client entitled to receive? Rule 1.4(a)(6) states that the lawyer “shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.” Comment 5 suggests that what is “reasonably necessary” depends on the context, with the obligation for thorough explanation depending in part on the nature of the proceeding, the type of decision, and the time available for discussion. Overall, Comment 5 stresses that the “guiding principle is that the lawyer should fulfill reasonable client expectations for information consistent with the duty <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page188" class="pagebreak" title="188">188</span>to act in the client’s best interests, and the client’s overall requirements as to the character of representation.”</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At one level, the duty to communicate with clients seems straightforward: lawyers cannot advance clients’ interests without understanding what clients want and, when lawyers take action on clients’ behalf or receive information from adversaries or courts, one expects lawyers to readily share that information with clients. However, the “failure to communicate” is, in fact, one of the most common ethics complaints against lawyers nationwide.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.470" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.470" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span> Often, the problem goes hand in hand with other misconduct, especially client neglect. According to one commentator, this “dyad of misconduct is not surprising: if an attorney is not doing what he or she is supposed to be doing in a case, the attorney will probably not want to let the client know.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.471" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.471" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span> A recent case from Georgia illustrates this problem.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.472" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.472" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> It involved a lawyer, Charles Taylor, who, along with a nonlawyer associate, set up an LLC that advertised mortgage loan modification and bankruptcy services to homeowners facing foreclosure. Taylor routinely failed to supervise the nonlawyer associate in referring clients to the LLC, which would file skeletal bankruptcy petitions based on little evidence, and sometimes not file at all. Indeed, on several occasions, Taylor pocketed money conveyed by clients for bankruptcy filing fees, resulting in petitions being dismissed and clients’ homes being foreclosed upon. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Taylor failed to tell clients that he was keeping their money for his own fee, and refused to tell them why their petitions had been dismissed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.473" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.473" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span> The Georgia Supreme Court disbarred Taylor based on the totality of ethics violations, which included extreme negligence and failure to supervise his nonlawyer assistant. In other contexts, lawyers have been disciplined for failing to communicate plea offers to criminal defendants,<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.474" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.474" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> and failing to make time to meet with personal injury clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.475" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.475" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Communication violations can also arise in situations that do not involve deliberate misconduct. For instance, when two lawyers from different firms are working as co-counsel on the same matter, it may be unclear which lawyer is supposed to communicate information about which topics to their clients. Although, in this scenario, the duty to communicate falls equally on both lawyers (L1 and L2), one commentator has suggested that it would be ethically appropriate, at the outset of the co-counsel relationship, for the lawyers to gain client consent to delegate client communication to only one <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page189" class="pagebreak" title="189">189</span>of the lawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.476" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.476" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> In this view, “the client can simply agree that the services to be provided by L2 do not include reporting directly to the client, but rather communicating through L1. Practically speaking, this makes eminent sense, and many clients would prefer to have all communications directed to them through a single person—their lead counsel, L1.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.477" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.477" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> Do you agree this makes “eminent sense”? What risks might it pose for the client? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What duty does a lawyer have to disclose to the client that she has committed malpractice-worthy errors in handling the case? It is well-settled that a lawyer must disclose the commission of <span style="font-style: italic;">material</span> errors to current clients. The issue is what constitutes materiality. The North Carolina State Bar recently addressed this question and concluded that errors exist along a “spectrum” that include, on one end, those “errors that effectively undermine the achievement of the client’s primary objective for the representation, such as failing to file the complaint before the statute of limitations runs.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.478" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.478" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> Errors are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> material, on the other hand, if they are simply “nonsubstantive typographical errors” or involve “missing a deadline that causes nothing more than delay.” In the middle of the spectrum, errors “must be analyzed under the duty to keep the client reasonably informed about his legal matter. If the error will result in financial loss to the client, substantial delay in achieving the client’s objectives for the representation, or material disadvantage to the client’s legal position, the error must be disclosed to the client.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.479" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.479" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> In analyzing the duty to disclose errors, the <a id="dabmci_87fa599a9d8e45ccbc53ee43983c41c2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />ABA Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct, in Formal Opinion 481<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Formal Opinion 481&quot; \s &quot;Formal Opinion 481&quot; \c 16 " />, summarized its view of materiality as follows: “An error is material if a disinterested lawyer would conclude that it is (a) reasonably likely to harm or prejudice a client; or (b) of such a nature that it would reasonably cause a client to consider terminating the representation even in the absence of harm or prejudice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.480" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.480" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> What type of errors do you think would fall within category (b)?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Must a lawyer inform the client when the errors are discovered <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> representation is over? <a id="dabmci_831382830dcd4157983b890e267e0124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />According to Formal Opinion 481, the answer is no. “Nowhere does Model Rule 1.4 impose on lawyers a duty to communicate with former clients.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.481" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.481" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> Under the ABA’s analysis, the key issue is determining whether representation has, in fact, terminated, either by express statements or acts by the parties, or when it is objectively unreasonably to hold that the lawyer-client relationship still exists (as when, for example, the lawyer was retained to complete a discrete matter which has been accomplished). In the ABA’s view, because Rule 1.4 only refers to a lawyer’s duty to keep the “client” reasonably informed, termination relieves the lawyer of that duty since there is no longer any client with whom to communicate. Courts have generally followed this logic. The Connecticut <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page190" class="pagebreak" title="190">190</span>Supreme Court rejected the idea that lawyers have continuing obligations after the end of representation to correct or report earlier wrongs, on the theory that such a continuing duty would be “futile because, once representation ceases, the initial wrong typically is complete, and in the usual situation, it no longer can be undone by the attorney.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.482" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.482" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> However, at least one malpractice insurance carrier has disagreed, stating that it may be a breach of duty (and hence a basis for malpractice) for a lawyer to fail to report material errors to former clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.483" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.483" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> For authority, the carrier pointed to Rule 1.16(d), which requires a lawyer upon termination to “take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client’s interests.” Such steps, in the carrier’s view, should include informing the former client of prior material errors. Which view do you find more persuasive? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Because the lawyer is the client’s representative and can bind the client, the general rule is that the lawyer must defer to the client’s wishes. As discussed above, this suggests that the lawyer is generally bound to consult with the client before acting. However, consultation is not always practical. Lawyers are asked to make a vast number of decisions on behalf of clients, some under intense time pressure, and it is not feasible to require the lawyer to gain explicit authorization from the client with respect to each and every decision. Accordingly, lawyers must have discretion to make some decisions based on their understanding of the clients’ best interests. In addition, even when lawyers do have time to consult, they may have a different view of how to proceed than their clients based on their own expertise and experience. This raises several questions. On which issues do lawyers have authority to act on clients’ behalf? What is the appropriate course of action when a lawyer and client disagree over how to proceed in a matter? And what are the lawyer’s obligations when a client may have diminished capacity to make decisions?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861324" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218891" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756307" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908439" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ethical Framework</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.2 offers guidance on the allocation of authority between lawyer and client. Rule 1.2(a) sets a basic “means-ends” dichotomy: Lawyers are permitted to make tactical decisions about means, while clients are entitled to define the ultimate ends of the representation. Specifically, Rule 1.2(a) states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[A] lawyer shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation . . . and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page191" class="pagebreak" title="191">191</span>take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Rule is generally vague as to what constitutes “the objectives of the representation” versus the “means by which they are to be pursued.” Instead, Rule 1.2(a) carves out issues which are deemed to be essential objectives and thus reserved to client decisionmaking. In the civil context, the Rule states that the “lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter.” And in the criminal context, the Rule compels the lawyer to defer to the client’s decision, after consultation, “as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.484" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.484" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum are tactical decisions that are considered to be squarely within the lawyer’s discretion. What are those “tactical” matters? The <a id="dabmci_c15c4fbf169b440a81dd6b966f573b0d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span> § 21, cmt. e provides that, absent a contrary instruction, the lawyer “may decide whether to move to dismiss a complaint and what discovery to pursue or resist,” and during a hearing, may “object to another party’s question, probe further answers of a witness, or seek a curative instruction.” Similarly, the ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function, 4–5.2(d)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Standard 4–5.2(d)&quot; \s &quot;4–5.2(d)&quot; \c 16 " /> offer the following examples of tactical decisions, to be “made by defense counsel, after consultation with the client”:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">how to pursue plea negotiations, how to craft and respond to motions and, at hearing or trial, what witnesses to call, whether and how to conduct cross-examination, what jurors to accept or strike, what motions and objections should be made, what stipulations if any to agree to, and what and how evidence should be introduced.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On tactical issues, over which lawyers’ have presumptive authority to make decisions, what happens when the client disagrees with the lawyer’s choices? Comment 2 to Rule 1.2 leaves the issue unresolved:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">[2]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />On occasion, however, a lawyer and a client may disagree about the means to be used to accomplish the client’s objectives. Clients normally defer to the special knowledge and skill of their lawyer with respect to the means to be used to accomplish their objectives, particularly with respect to technical, legal and tactical matters. Conversely, lawyers usually defer to the client regarding such questions as the expense to be incurred and concern for third persons who might be adversely affected. </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page192" class="pagebreak" title="192">192</span>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Because of the varied nature of the matters about which a lawyer and client might disagree and because the actions in question may implicate the interests of a tribunal or other persons, this Rule does not prescribe how such disagreements are to be resolved. Other law, however, may be applicable and should be consulted by the lawyer. The lawyer should also consult with the client and seek a mutually acceptable resolution of the disagreement.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">The Rule goes on to say that if the lawyer and client cannot agree, the lawyer may withdraw or the client may discharge the lawyer. C</span>onsider how these rules apply to the cases that follow.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In the case below, Barnes was convicted in state court of robbery and assault. He instructed Michael Melinger, his assigned counsel, to raise several issues on appeal.

California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Douglas v. California,</span> 372 U.S. 353 (1963), the Court held that if an appeal is open to those who can pay for it, an appeal must be provided for an indigent. It is also recognized that the accused has the ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case, as to whether to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal. In addition, we have held that, with some limitations, a defendant may elect to act as his or her own advocate. Neither <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> nor any other decision of this Court suggests, however, that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page193" class="pagebreak" title="193">193</span>to compel appointed counsel to press nonfrivolous points requested by the client, if counsel, as a matter of professional judgment, decides not to present those points.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This Court, in holding that a state must provide counsel for an indigent appellant on his first appeal as of right, recognized the superior ability of trained counsel in the “examination into the record, research of the law, and marshaling of arguments on [the appellant’s] behalf,” <a id="dabmci_1a1b4a256b2c4d0dad0de1892a67c63a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Douglas v. California</span>. Yet by promulgating a <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> rule that the client, not the professional advocate, must be allowed to decide what issues are to be pressed, the Court of Appeals seriously undermines the ability of counsel to present the client’s case in accord with counsel’s professional evaluation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Experienced advocates since time beyond memory have emphasized the importance of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on one central issue if possible, or at most on a few key issues. Justice Jackson, after observing appellate advocates for many years, stated:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">One of the first tests of a discriminating advocate is to select the question, or questions, that he will present orally. Legal contentions, like the currency, depreciate through over-issue. The mind of an appellate judge is habitually receptive to the suggestion that a lower court committed an error. But receptiveness declines as the number of assigned errors increases. Multiplicity hints at lack of confidence in any one. . . . “[E]xperience on the bench convinces me that multiplying assignments of error will dilute and weaken a good case and will not save a bad one.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There can hardly be any question about the importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review. This has assumed a greater importance in an era when oral argument is strictly limited in most courts—often to as little as 15 minutes—and when page limits on briefs are widely imposed. Even in a court that imposes no time or page limits, however, the new <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> rule laid down by the Court of Appeals is contrary to all experience and logic. A brief that raises every colorable issue runs the risk of burying good arguments—those that, in the words of the great advocate John W. Davis, “go for the jugular,” in a verbal mound made up of strong and weak contentions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This Court’s decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders,</span> far from giving support to the new <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> rule announced by the Court of Appeals, is to the contrary. <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> recognized that the role of the advocate “requires that he support his client’s appeal to the best of his ability.” Here the appointed counsel did just that. For judges to second-guess reasonable professional judgments and impose on appointed counsel a duty to raise every “colorable” claim suggested by a client would disserve the very goal of vigorous and effective advocacy that underlies <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders.</span> Nothing in the Constitution or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page194" class="pagebreak" title="194">194</span>our interpretation of that document requires such a standard. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Reversed</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Justice Brennan,</span> with whom <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Justice Marshall </span>joins, dissenting. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What is at issue here is the relationship between lawyer and client—who has ultimate authority to decide which nonfrivolous issues should be presented on appeal? I believe the right to “the assistance of counsel” carries with it a right, personal to the defendant, to make that decision, against the advice of counsel if he chooses.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">If all the Sixth Amendment protected was the State’s interest in substantial justice, it would not include such a right. However, in <a id="dabmci_2247ddbc77dd475baa99703d212130df" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Faretta v. California&quot; \s &quot;A;O;21;dabmci_2247ddbc77dd475baa99703d212130df_1;I235eaf2b9c1e11d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4;;0;F;Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta v. California,</span> 422 U.S. 806 (1975), we decisively rejected that view of the Constitution. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> establishes that the right to counsel is more than a right to have one’s case presented competently and effectively. It is predicated on the view that the function of counsel under the Sixth Amendment is to protect the dignity and autonomy of a person on trial by <span style="font-style: italic;">assisting</span> him in making choices that are his to make, not to make choices for him, although counsel may be better able to decide which tactics will be most effective for the defendant. <a id="dabmci_b86682201a964a32b93eea05001da513" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Anders v. California</span> also reflects that view. Even when appointed counsel believes an appeal has no merit, he must furnish his client a brief covering all arguable grounds for appeal so that the client may “raise any points that he chooses.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The right to counsel as <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> conceive it is not an all-or-nothing right, under which a defendant must choose between forgoing the assistance of counsel altogether or relinquishing control over every aspect of his case beyond its most basic structure (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> how to plead, whether to present a defense, whether to appeal). A defendant’s interest in his case clearly extends to other matters. Absent exceptional circumstances, he is bound by the tactics used by his counsel at trial and on appeal. He may want to press the argument that he is innocent, even if other stratagems are more likely to result in the dismissal of charges or in a reduction of punishment. He may want to insist on certain arguments for political reasons. He may want to protect third parties. This is just as true on appeal as at trial, and the proper role of counsel is to <span style="font-style: italic;">assist</span> him in these efforts, insofar as that is possible consistent with the lawyer’s conscience, the law, and his duties to the court.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I find further support for my position in the legal profession’s own conception of its proper role. The American Bar Association has taken the position that</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">when, in the estimate of counsel, the decision of the client to take an appeal, <span style="font-style: italic;">or the client’s decision to press a particular contention on appeal,</span> is incorrect[, c]ounsel has the professional duty to give to the client fully and forcefully an opinion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page195" class="pagebreak" title="195">195</span>concerning the case and its probable outcome. <span style="font-style: italic;">Counsel’s role however, is to advise. The decision is made by the client</span>. ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeals, Standard 21–3.2<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Standard 21–3.2&quot; \s &quot;Standard 21–3.2&quot; \c 16 " />, Comment, at 21–42 (2nd ed., 1980) (emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The Court disregards this clear statement of how the profession defines the “assistance of counsel” at the appellate stage of a criminal defense by referring to standards governing the allocation of authority between attorney and client at trial. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function, Standard 4–5.2<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Standard 4–5.2&quot; \s &quot;Standard 4–5.2&quot; \c 16 " /> (1980). In the course of a trial, however, decisions must often be made in a matter of hours, if not minutes or seconds. From the standpoint of effective administration of justice, the need to confer decisive authority on the attorney is paramount with regard to the hundreds of decisions that must be made quickly in the course of a trial. Decisions regarding which issues to press on appeal, in contrast, can and should be made more deliberately, in the course of deciding whether to appeal at all. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[T]he Court argues that good appellate advocacy demands selectivity among arguments. That is certainly true—the Court’s advice is good. It ought to be taken to heart by every lawyer called upon to argue an appeal in this or any other court, and by his client. It should take little or no persuasion to get a wise client to understand that, if staying out of prison is what he values most, he should encourage his lawyer to raise only his two or three best arguments on appeal, and he should defer to his lawyer’s advice as to which are the best arguments. The Constitution, however, does not require clients to be wise, and other policies should be weighed in the balance as well.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is no secret that indigent clients often mistrust the lawyers appointed to represent them. There are many reasons for this, some perhaps unavoidable even under perfect conditions—differences in education, disposition, and socio-economic class—and some that should (but may not always) be zealously avoided. A lawyer and his client do not always have the same interests. Even with paying clients, a lawyer may have a strong interest in having judges and prosecutors think well of him, and, if he is working for a flat fee—a common arrangement for criminal defense attorneys—or if his fees for court appointments are lower than he would receive for other work, he has an obvious financial incentive to conclude cases on his criminal docket swiftly. Good lawyers undoubtedly recognize these temptations and resist them, and they endeavor to convince their clients that they will. It would be naive, however, to suggest that they always succeed in either task. A constitutional rule that encourages lawyers to disregard their clients’ wishes without compelling need can only exacerbate the clients’ suspicion of their lawyers. As in <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta,</span> to force a lawyer’s <span style="font-style: italic;">decisions</span> on a defendant “can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.” In the end, what the Court hopes to gain in effectiveness of appellate representation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page196" class="pagebreak" title="196">196</span>by the rule it imposes today may well be lost to decreased effectiveness in other areas of representation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, today’s ruling denigrates the values of individual autonomy and dignity central to many constitutional rights, especially those Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights that come into play in the criminal process. Certainly a person’s life changes when he is charged with a crime and brought to trial. He must, if he harbors any hope of success, defend himself on terms—often technical and hard to understand—that are the State’s, not his own. As a practical matter, the assistance of counsel is necessary to that defense. Yet, until his conviction becomes final and he has had an opportunity to appeal, any restrictions on individual autonomy and dignity should be limited to the minimum necessary to vindicate the State’s interest in a speedy, effective prosecution. The role of the defense lawyer should be above all to function as the instrument and defender of the client’s autonomy and dignity in all phases of the criminal process. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Court subtly but unmistakably adopts a different conception of the defense lawyer’s role—he need do nothing beyond what the State, not his client, considers most important. In many ways, having a lawyer becomes one of the many indignities visited upon someone who has the ill fortune to run afoul of the criminal justice system.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I cannot accept the notion that lawyers are one of the punishments a person receives merely for being accused of a crime. Clients, if they wish, are capable of making informed judgments about which issues to appeal, and when they exercise that prerogative their choices should be respected unless they would require lawyers to violate their consciences, the law, or their duties to the court. On the other hand, I would not presume lightly that, in a particular case, a defendant has disregarded his lawyer’s obviously sound advice. The Court of Appeals, in reversing the District Court, did not address the factual question whether respondent, having been advised by his lawyer that it would not be wise to appeal on all the issues respondent had suggested, actually insisted in a timely fashion that his lawyer brief the nonfrivolous issues identified by the Court of Appeals. If he did not, or if he was content with filing his <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> brief, then there would be no deprivation of the right to the assistance of counsel. I would remand for a hearing on this question.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> majority employs reasoning that is overtly paternalistic: It justifies the attorney’s authority to override a client’s desires for the client’s own good. After noting that it is often counterproductive to barrage an appellate court with too many arguments, the majority concludes: “For judges to . . . impose on appointed counsel a duty to raise every ‘colorable’ claim suggested by a client would disserve the very goal of vigorous and effective advocacy. . . .”</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page197" class="pagebreak" title="197">197</span>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does the fact that Barnes submitted a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> brief presenting “his” issues undercut or support the outcome? One might argue that if the appellate court was going to be barraged with the same arguments in any event, then the client had a right to have them presented by his attorney rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se.</span> The tactical choice was not whether to inundate the appellate court with arguments; rather, it was whether to inundate the appellate court with arguments presented by Barnes rather than the same arguments presented by Melinger. From this perspective, Barnes had the worst of both worlds: too many arguments and too little expert presentation. Conversely, one might argue that since the issues were presented by Barnes’s <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> brief, the appellate court was not denied an opportunity to consider them; Melinger’s omission was therefore harmless. Which position is most persuasive?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Would the <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> decision have come out differently if Barnes had not submitted a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> brief? Suppose that the appellate court, in affirming the conviction, had noted in dicta or during oral argument that it was not reaching certain issues because the defendant had not raised them. If these were the very issues that Barnes had wanted Melinger to raise, should it alter the result?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Commentators note that lawyers’ counseling falls on a spectrum: neutral information—suggestion—advice—urging.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.485" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.485" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> What limited empirical research is available indicates that lawyers vary greatly in terms of where they fall on this spectrum and how much they defer to clients on strategies that could determine outcomes. For example, one study of criminal defense lawyers found that only about a third believed that clients should make all important decisions and that about three-quarters thought that counsel should have the final say over whether to waive an affirmative defense. Lawyers divided over whether to obtain client consent before asking for a lesser included offense.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.486" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.486" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Courts have also divided about what constitutes undue neutrality or coercion.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.487" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.487" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Attorneys who fall on the neutrality end of the spectrum see their role as empowering clients and are reluctant to provide guidance that may unduly influence their decisions. As one public defender put it, “the defendant does the time, not me.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.488" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.488" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> By contrast, other lawyers argue that such attitudes are likely to result in more defendants doing more time in prison than if attorneys attempted to guide plea bargaining decisions. As these lawyers note, many criminal defendants suffer from mental health impairments, and the stress and time pressures of the process may make rational decisionmaking difficult.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.489" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.489" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> The problems are compounded by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page198" class="pagebreak" title="198">198</span>cognitive biases that encourage individuals to make overly optimistic assessments of their own circumstances and capabilities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.490" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.490" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span> Some commentators argue further that withholding advice from a client is itself a form of paternalism, because it assumes that clients are incapable of weighing their attorney’s views and then making an autonomous judgment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.491" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.491" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> Where would you put yourself on the counseling spectrum? Would it matter whether the case was civil or criminal or whether you were retained by the client or appointed by the court?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Can attorneys consider their own credibility in determining whether to advance a weak claim? Criminal defense lawyers routinely face issues about how to spend their “credibility capital” if they appear repeatedly before the same judges or bargain frequently with the same prosecutors.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.492" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.492" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The dissenters in <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> emphasize “the dignity and autonomy of a person on trial” and suggest that these values argue for deferring to a defendant’s choices even if they are not ones that experienced counsel would find prudent. How far does this argument extend? Is it consistent with <a id="dabmci_a3d9a2b586104256b559bf60bc709e04" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Martinez v.

Court of Appeal</span>, 528 U.S. 152 (2000), in which the Supreme Court found no constitutional right to self-representation on a direct appeal of a criminal conviction? <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez</span> upheld a decision of the California Court of Appeals requiring a self-taught paralegal to accept a court-appointed lawyer for his appeal, although he had represented himself at his jury trial and had wished to do so again on appeal. Do <span style="font-style: italic;">Martinez</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> together imply that a lawyer who is forced on an appellant may then decline to brief arguments that the client wants to raise? Or should appellate lawyers who are appointed over defendants’ objections give greater deference to their clients than <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> requires?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Although the right to self-representation extends only to trial proceedings, that includes the sentencing phase of trial; thus, a defendant cannot be compelled to accept the assistance of counsel in asserting mitigation claims.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">If defendants accept legal representation, are they bound to defer to their attorneys’ judgment about which arguments to present? Thus, for example, if a convicted defendant would find it humiliating to have facts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page199" class="pagebreak" title="199">199</span>about his abusive upbringing introduced as mitigating factors, must his counsel defer to the defendant’s priorities? <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> the <span style="font-style: italic;">Kaczynski</span> case <span style="font-style: italic;">infra</span>.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One commonly cited purpose of criminal punishment is to make defendants understand the seriousness and importance of the social norms that they have violated. Moreover, a wide array of criminal justice research indicates that procedural fairness and an opportunity to be heard are more important than the substantive outcome in shaping litigants’ perceptions of the justness of the legal system.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.493" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.493" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> Guilty defendants do not acknowledge the legitimacy of their punishment if the process appears unfair. Does this research undermine the view of the majority in <span style="font-style: italic;">Barnes</span> that choices about which arguments to raise on appeal are purely tactical? Are concerns about the effectiveness and moral justification of criminal punishment better served by the dissenters’ position? Or are the client’s overriding interests in reducing the risks or severity of punishment best served by giving lawyers authority to mount the most effective defense?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One recent study found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> defendants are convicted at rates equivalent to, or lower than, the conviction rates of felony defendants who have counsel. That study also found that the vast majority of <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> felony defendants, nearly 80 percent, do not display signs of mental illness. Most choose self-representation because of legitimate concerns about the quality of court-appointed counsel (an issue we explore in greater detail in Chapter 8).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.494" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.494" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> What implications do such findings have for how courts construe the right of self-representation?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the following case, in which you are a court-appointed appellate lawyer representing an inmate taking a first appeal from a felony conviction. Your client appears bitter about the fact that he was not permitted to “tell his side of the story” at his trial. The transcript shows that he initially insisted that he wanted to testify, then withdrew his request after conferring with his lawyer. According to the lawyer, she had strongly and repeatedly resisted allowing the client to testify because of an admissible prior record, a transparently false alibi, and a rambling, incoherent speaking style. You explain to your client that the only way to raise the issue on appeal is to argue that the lawyer offered ineffective assistance by so exaggerating the risks of testifying that his will was “overborne.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.495" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.495" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> This argument is a sure loser, and is likely to distract the court’s attention from the more promising issues you wish to raise on appeal. Yet the client is presenting a grievance that appears to be of considerable personal importance.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">One possible solution is to raise this issue in the appellate brief without arguing it at any length. Is this an adequate compromise, or does it undercut both the lawyer’s and the client’s objectives?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Is an issue that is certain to lose under prevailing doctrine, but one that raises real concerns, “frivolous” within the meaning of bar ethical rules? Rule 3.1 forbids the lawyer from presenting frivolous claims, and if there are no non-frivolous issues, the lawyer must attempt to withdraw.

In addition, they would file an “<span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> brief” setting forth “anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.496" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.496" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span> But in <a id="dabmci_62ac1ee19f4c4938af76445cfcbbb560" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Smith v.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">If the only argument that the client wishes to press on appeal involves the coercive counseling issue, and the appellate court has rejected similar claims, should you file an <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> brief?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some criminal defense lawyers do not file <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> briefs. One reason is that it seems disloyal. As one surveyed attorney explained: “[T]o me an <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> Brief is almost like a slap in the face to the client. Why are you even bothering to write the brief, if all you are going to say is here [are] all the reasons to deny relief. To me it sort of inherently conflicts with your obligation to represent your client zealously . . . [to say in a public document] my client is a loser, or his issues are loser issues.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.497" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.497" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> Another reason some attorneys resist filing such briefs is that they turn out to be more work than the standard appellate brief. Another surveyed lawyer noted, “you have to argue why all these issues are not issues.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.498" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.498" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> Then, if an appellate panel disagrees, the lawyer has to brief and argue a claim that the court almost always denies anyway.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What is your view? Is an <span style="font-style: italic;">Anders</span> brief a useful compromise because it enables attorneys to maintain their credibility without totally foreclosing review of possible grounds for appeal? Or is it a largely formalistic exercise that undermines fundamental principles of client loyalty and effective assistance of counsel?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jones v. Barnes</span> illustrates conflicts that may arise when lawyers are intent on pursuing the best interests of their clients but are convinced that clients misunderstand their own interests. In such cases, lawyers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page201" class="pagebreak" title="201">201</span>may be tempted to act paternalistically, by interfering with the client’s choices for the client’s own good.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Such ethical dilemmas are longstanding, but they have come into sharper focus during the last quarter-century. Part of the reason involves the rise of public interest and legal services practice. Many lawyers in such practice settings have found themselves talking across cultural divides; differences in social, economic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds have sometimes made it hard to understand the full range of concerns and needs of clients. Just as importantly, clients have often viewed their problems in terms that are not readily translatable into legal categories or resolvable by the legal system. When lawyers reformulate clients’ goals in ways they know how to address, it can be hard for clients to keep control over the terms of representation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Public interest, legal services, and criminal defense attorneys have been sensitive to such problems, because many of them are committed as a matter of principle to client empowerment and “democracy from the bottom up.” However, the issues of paternalism are by no means limited to these contexts. Attorneys who represent clients with impaired capacity have long struggled with these concerns. Juveniles, mental health patients, or individuals going through a traumatic life event may have difficulty evaluating their long-term interests. In other situations, individuals with little experience or interest in legal matters will often be tempted to leave crucial decisions up to their attorneys. The result may sometimes be to the clients’ practical advantage, but the price will be losing control over their own affairs. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The problem of attorneys defining client goals—or rather, attorneys assuming that client goals must be redefined to fit the limitations of the law or of their own capabilities and resources—is only one part of the paternalism problem. Other difficulties arise when lawyers consciously or unconsciously override or manipulate clients for “the client’s own good.” Consider the rather extreme example of Gary Gilmore, a convicted murderer, sentenced to death, who asked his lawyers, Mike Esplin and Craig Snyder, to drop all appeals because he wanted to be executed:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Gilmore said, “Now, don’t I have the right to die?” . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Gary told [his lawyers] of his belief that he had been executed once before, in eighteenth-century England. He said, “I feel like I’ve been here before. There is some crime from my past.” He got quiet, and said, “I feel I have to atone for the thing I did then.” Esplin couldn’t help thinking that this stuff about eighteenth-century England would sure have made a difference with the psychiatrists if they had heard it.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Gilmore now began to say that his life wouldn’t end with this life. He would still be in existence after he was dead. It all seemed part of a logical discussion. Esplin finally said, “Gary, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page202" class="pagebreak" title="202">202</span>we can see your point of view, but we still feel duty bound to go ahead on that appeal.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">When Gary said again, “What can I do about it?” Snyder answered, “Well, I don’t know.”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Gary then said, “Can I fire you?”</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Esplin said, “Gary, we’ll make the judge aware that you want to can us, but we’re going to file anyway.” . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">On the 3rd of November, Esplin got a letter from Gary. It read: “<span style="font-style: italic;">Mike, butt out. Quit fucking around with my life. You’re fired.</span>” . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Despite being dismissed, the two defense attorneys later Wednesday filed a notice of appeal—in their names. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">They said it was “in the best interest” of the defendant.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.500" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.500" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Despite his lawyers’ efforts, Gilmore was eventually executed by firing squad in Draper, Utah. His last words were: “Let’s do it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.501" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.501" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Esplin and Snyder found Gilmore’s belief in reincarnation irrational. But millions of people around the globe hold such beliefs. And since the late 1970s, about 11 percent of executions have been voluntary.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.502" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.502" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> A survey of death row volunteers found that three-quarters had a documented mental illness and half had severe abuse disorders.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.503" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.503" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> This case, like some of those addressed in Chapter 14 on public interest representation, raise questions about when lawyers may justifiably impose their own views about the clients’ best interest and the objectives of representation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To some commentators, paternalism is inappropriate under most circumstances. From a rights-based perspective, respect for individual autonomy counsels deference to freely-made choices concerning the conduct of one’s own life. And from a utilitarian perspective, evidence from a wide range of contexts suggests that people who exercise control over decisions are more likely to be satisfied with the outcome, and that clients who participate actively in the decisionmaking process often <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page203" class="pagebreak" title="203">203</span>achieve better results.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.504" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.504" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> Other commentators, while acknowledging that clients’ involvement should be encouraged and their decisions generally respected, nonetheless believe that paternalism is sometimes morally justified. The materials that follow explore these views.</p>

Rts. 1 (1975)&quot; \s &quot;5 Human Rights 1, 15–24 (1975)&quot; \c 13 " />.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One . . . pervasive, and I think necessary, feature of the relationship between any professional and the client or patient is that it is in some sense a relationship of inequality. This relationship of inequality is intrinsic to the existence of professionalism. For the professional is, in some respects at least, always in a position of dominance vis-à-vis the client, and the client in a position of dependence vis-à-vis the professional. To be sure, the client can often decide whether or not to enter into a relationship with a professional. And often, too, the client has the power to decide whether to terminate the relationship. But the significant thing I want to focus upon is that while the relationship exists, there are important respects in which the relationship cannot be a relationship between equals and must be one in which it is the professional who is in control. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To begin with, there is the fact that one characteristic of professions is that the professional is the possessor of expert knowledge of a sort not readily or easily attainable by members of the community at large. . . . Moreover, virtually every profession has its own technical language, a private terminology which can only be fully understood by the members of the profession. . . . These circumstances, together with others, produce the added consequence that the client is in a poor position effectively to evaluate how well or badly the professional performs. In the professions, the professional does not look primarily to the client to evaluate the professional’s work. . . . In addition, because the matters for which professional assistance is sought usually involve things of great personal concern to the client, it is the received wisdom within the professions that the client lacks the perspective necessary to pursue in a satisfactory way his or her own best interests, and that the client requires a detached, disinterested representative to look after his or her interests. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, as I have indicated, to be a professional is to have been acculturated in a certain way. It is to have satisfactorily passed through a lengthy and allegedly difficult period of study and training. It is to have done something hard. Something that not everyone can do. Almost all professions encourage this way of viewing oneself; as having joined an elect group by virtue of hard work and mastery of the mysteries of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page204" class="pagebreak" title="204">204</span>profession. In addition, the society at large treats members of a profession as members of an elite by paying them more than most people for the work they do with their heads rather than their hands, and by according them a substantial amount of social prestige and power by virtue of their membership in a profession. It is hard, I think, if not impossible, for a person to emerge from professional training and participate in a profession without the belief that he or she is a special kind of person, both different from and somewhat better than those nonprofessional members of the social order. It is equally hard for the other members of society not to hold an analogous view of the professionals. And these beliefs surely contribute, too, to the dominant role played by a professional in any professional-client relationship.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[The criticism of professionals I want to consider] might begin by conceding, at least for purposes of argument, that some inequality may be inevitable in any professional-client relationship. It might concede, too, that a measure of this kind of inequality may even on occasion be desirable. But it sees the relationship between the professional and the client as typically flawed in a more fundamental way, as involving far more than the kind of relatively benign inequality delineated above. This criticism focuses upon the fact that the professional often, if not systematically, interacts with the client in both a manipulative and a paternalistic fashion. The point is not that the professional is merely dominant within the relationship. Rather, it is that from the professional’s point of view the client is seen and responded to more like an object than a human being, and more like a child than an adult. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is, I believe, indicative of the state of legal education and of the profession that there has been to date extremely little self-conscious concern even with the possibility that these dimensions of the attorney-client relationship are worth examining—to say nothing of being capable of alteration. That awareness is, surely, the prerequisite to any serious assessment of the moral character of the attorney-client relationship as a relationship among adult human beings.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc451861330" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218897" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908445" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and Questions</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Above, Wasserstrom poses two related problems. First, he argues that the attorney-client relationship is structurally flawed, placing far too much power in the hands of the attorney. In effect, the lawyer rather than the client defines the strategies of representation, which typically leads lawyers to act in a paternalistic fashion toward their clients. Second, he suggests that paternalism is morally wrong. “The professional does not . . . treat the client like a person; the professional does not accord the client the respect that he or she deserves.” Who is the client that Wasserstrom envisions? Does the description fit the typical business client or wealthy individual seeking advice on tax or other financial issues? If Wasserstrom’s focus is on less sophisticated and powerful clients, is his criticism well taken?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page205" class="pagebreak" title="205">205</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A study by William Felstiner and Austin Sarat of divorce cases documented some of the patterns Wasserstrom described. Many lawyers attempted to “control clients and maintain professional authority” by suggesting that only insiders such as themselves would be able to deal with the “chaotic ‘anti-system’ ” in which the client was embroiled.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.505" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.505" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span> In some cases, attorneys appeared to find it in their interest to maintain dominance: A dependent client was a more compliant client.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">On the other hand, in most private practice, power flows in both directions. As David Luban describes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Lawyers, to be sure, exercise considerable leverage over their clients, who need their expertise, and that leverage can be abused. But we must not forget that private practitioners depend wholly on their clients for their livelihood, and this dependence is fundamental in the distribution of power. Lawyers may try to manipulate their clients, but such phenomena are of necessity relatively slight ripples on a vast ocean of lawyers’ economic dependence upon their clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.506" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.506" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">How might Wasserstrom reply? How would you?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Wasserstrom argues that lawyers’ paternalism is at best morally problematic, and at worst indefensibly dismissive of individual dignity and autonomy. Yet paternalism is a persistent feature of our legal landscape, as Duncan Kennedy reminds us:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[Lawmakers] have regulated the safety features of food and drugs, airplanes, railroads and boats, automobiles, fabrics for children’s clothing, and building materials. They have regulated the design of residential buildings, and of public buildings, in each case indirectly controlling what arrangements the owners of property could make with willing paying customers. They have regulated interest rates, the sale of securities, the structure of financial intermediaries and the contracts between corporations and their shareholders (both in and out of bankruptcy). They have developed whole panoplies of required terms for insurance contracts, the wages and hours of employment, occupational safety and health, occupational licensing, conditions of rental housing, terms of payment and non-payment of rent, consumer credit (truth in lending), security arrangements, door-to-door sales, franchising, sales of condominiums, condominium conversion, mine safety, pension and annuity contracts, union pension funds. They have required workers, as a condition of employment, to lay aside money <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page206" class="pagebreak" title="206">206</span>for their old age, and required employers to join workmen’s compensation schemes.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.507" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.507" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Bar ethical codes similarly include a broad array of provisions that prohibit lawyers from engaging in conduct that might be harmful to clients irrespective of their desires or consent. Examples include accepting an unreasonable fee; initiating a sexual relationship; handling a divorce or criminal case on a contingent fee basis; acquiring a financial interest in litigation; or preparing an instrument giving a lawyer a gift.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.508" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.508" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span> Each is an instance of paternalism, which Dennis Thompson has defined as “the imposing of constraints on an individual’s liberty for the purpose of promoting his or her own good.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.509" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.509" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">This definition highlights the moral problem posed by paternalism: “paternalism needs justification because it is a restriction of liberty.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.510" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.510" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> As philosopher Samuel Gorovitz puts it:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Because we respect individuals, we subscribe to what has been called the Principle of Autonomy, the view that individuals are entitled to be and do as they see fit, so long as they do not violate the comparable rights of others. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Because we care about the well-being of individual persons, we also grant a prominent place in the structure of our moral outlook to a second principle, often called the Principle of Beneficence. That principle, simply stated, holds that one ought to do good. . . . It is this principle that is typically invoked as the justification for overriding the Principle of Autonomy, when we limit someone else’s freedom in order to achieve what we see as being his or her own good.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.511" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.511" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In these terms, the problem of paternalism is not <span style="font-style: italic;">whether</span> paternalism is ever permissible (or required), but <span style="font-style: italic;">when</span>: When does the Principle of Beneficence override the Principle of Autonomy, and when does it fail to override it? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Dennis Thompson proposes a three-part test for justifiable paternalism:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">First, the decision of the person who is to be constrained must be <span style="font-style: italic;">impaired</span>. . . . Second, the restriction is as <span style="font-style: italic;">limited</span> as possible. . . . Finally, the restriction prevents a serious and irreversible <span style="font-style: italic;">harm.</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.512" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.512" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">The first condition assures us that paternalistic intervention will not seriously offend the Principle of Autonomy, for a person whose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page207" class="pagebreak" title="207">207</span>decisionmaking is impaired is not acting in a fully autonomous way. The second condition requires consideration of less restrictive alternatives. The third condition acknowledges the Principle of Beneficence under circumstances that most individuals would find compelling. Yet each of the highlighted terms—<span style="font-style: italic;">impaired</span> decision, <span style="font-style: italic;">limited</span> restriction, and <span style="font-style: italic;">serious, irreversible harm</span>—clearly requires further analysis, and can provoke significant dispute. Is a demonstrably foolish decision “impaired”? Under what circumstances might an imprudent gift or selfless act constitute a “harm”?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.513" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.513" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Another approach emphasizes situation-specific justifications. In some contexts, <span style="font-style: italic;">anyone’s</span> decisionmaking may be impaired, and reasonable individuals will consent to benign interventions in these cases. As Gerald Dworkin notes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[S]ince we are all aware of our irrational propensities, deficiencies in cognitive and emotive capacities, and avoidable and unavoidable ignorance it is rational and prudent for us to in effect take out “social insurance policies.” We may argue for and against proposed paternalistic measures in terms of what fully rational individuals would accept as forms of protection.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.514" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.514" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">That is, we ask what one <span style="font-style: italic;">would</span> consent to if one were fully rational. Under this approach, hypothetical consent becomes the touchstone of justifiable paternalism.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">However, we do not know exactly what “the fully rational individual” is or would consent to. None of us, after all, is fully rational under all circumstances; perhaps not under <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> circumstances.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.515" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.515" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span> In Problem 2 (set forth below), for example, consider the difficult questions that a lawyer must resolve in applying the hypothetical consent test: Is it irrational for someone with a painful terminal illness to commit suicide? Is it irrational for a partner to commit suicide if he or she is convinced that life alone is not worth living? These are questions about ultimate values—life, death, dignity, and love—which often have deep religious foundations. Such questions cannot be resolved through a value-free concept like “rationality.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The preceding critiques suggest the difficulties in attempting to justify paternalism by some unitary principle. Building on this insight, Kennedy argues that there is no such thing as capacity in the abstract; there is only capacity to make particular decisions, and a lawyer may have little to go on beyond a firm conviction that a client’s judgment is distorted and the lawyer will be harming the client by following the client’s foolish instructions. Kennedy acknowledges, however, that such intuitions may well be erroneous:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" class="pagebreak" title="208">208</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Paternalist action is inherently risky because it will make [clients] furious at you, and they may be right. If they are right, you will suffer twice: you will suffer with them the pain of the frustration of a valid project, and you will suffer on your own behalf . . . guilt that you have done them not just an injury, but an injustice. Even if it turns out that they were indeed suffering from false consciousness and that your intervention spared them a serious evil, they may not forgive you for taking things into your own hands.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.516" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.516" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">From this perspective, the problem of when paternalism is justified has no general “bright line” solution, because while we can often empathize with others, we can never be certain that our intuitions about their values, needs, and concerns are correct.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">According to many commentators including Kennedy, paternalism is justified when we “believe that the other is suffering from some form of false consciousness that will cause him to do something that will hurt him, physically or financially or morally or in some other way.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.517" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.517" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span> In other words, the need for paternalistic protection arises because we are all prone to confusion between our deeply-held values, our immediate whims or wants, and our “objective” best interests. Paternalism may be less justifiable if an action seemingly against a client’s self-interest comes from that individual’s deeply-held values, whereas there may be a stronger justification for paternalism to protect the client’s long-term values or objective interests against momentary whims.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />One obvious way for attorneys to avoid acting paternalistically is to inform their clients of the risks and benefits of different options, and then to accept their clients’ choices—or at least obtain their clients’ consent to the option recommended.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The moral significance of informed consent surfaced first in medical ethics. Until the mid-1900s, the unquestioned norm among physicians was paternalism toward patients. The Hippocratic oath enjoins physicians to “Do no harm,” and it was assumed that trained professionals were in a better position than patients to know what constituted harm. Many physicians believed that patients and their families were too anxious or ill-informed to be entrusted with life-and-death decisions. Moreover, the conventional wisdom was that giving patients bad news might itself jeopardize patients’ health.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Today, by contrast, the prevailing norm is quite different. Physicians expect to inform their patients about their illnesses and options and will not undertake even routine treatment without obtaining the patient’s informed consent. Further, in the medical context, tort liability backs up these norms, providing a right of action to a patient who is subjected to a non-emergency procedure, if the physician performs the procedure without furnishing adequate information about its risks and benefits.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.518" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.518" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" class="pagebreak" title="209">209</span>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Informed consent standards have been advocated, and in some instances adopted, for legal practice as well. Rule 1.0(e) defines informed consent as “the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation about the material risks of reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.” The Rules incorporate informed consent requirements in several key provisions, including those governing conflicts, which provide that conflicted lawyers shall not represent clients unless “each client consents after consultation.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.519" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.519" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In principle, informed consent seems like an attractive alternative to paternalism; in practice it is often difficult to apply. Some matters, such as the risks and benefits of representation that present a potential conflict of interest, may be too complex for inexperienced clients to assess. The difficulty is graphically illustrated by an antitrust class action involving claims against drug companies on behalf of antibiotics purchasers. Members of the class received notification that they would be bound by the result of the litigation unless they opted out. Letters that the attorney general received in response included the following:</p>
      <p class="TextHeadParagraph">Dear Sir:</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">In some cases, informing clients about technical matters may require a great deal of time and expense, for which clients (or lawyers with fixed or contingent fee agreements) may be reluctant to pay. In other contexts, clients <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" class="pagebreak" title="210">210</span>may simply prefer that attorneys with greater expertise assume responsibility for making critical decisions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.521" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.521" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Power asymmetries in many attorney-client relationships also may raise problems in determining if a client’s consent is truly autonomous. Even when lawyers attempt to remain neutral and objective, the way that they describe options and their likely consequences can preempt certain choices. Moreover, attorneys are trained to advocate positions and to persuade decision-makers to reach what the attorney believes are the right results. In many instances, attorneys may not even realize the extent to which they are pressuring or manipulating clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.522" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.522" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Defense lawyer Abbe Smith notes that one of the most difficult but crucial jobs of a defense attorney arises when any experienced criminal defense lawyer would advise a plea but the defendant insists on trial. Smith believes that the role of counsel in these cases is to “convince a client to hang on to as much liberty as he or she can—not to take an ill-considered, irrational, or immature ‘no’ for an answer. . . . [Lawyers] have to be willing to plead, argue, cajole . . . yell [and] badger . . .

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">How far should badgering extend? Does it differ for privately-retained and court-appointed lawyers?

He has been pressured by his former wife into signing a promissory note secured by his house in order to help his stepson start a new business. Fraudulent representations were made about the state of the company’s finances, and it has now gone bankrupt. The note has come due, and the client’s house will be subject to foreclosure unless he contests the transaction. He is unwilling to do so, both because it would trigger an acrimonious dispute and because everyone would learn that he had allowed himself to be cheated. He is, however, concerned about losing his home. Are you free to disregard your client’s short-term instruction not to file suit in favor of the long-term value of keeping his house?<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.524" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.524" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span></p>

You have severe doubts about your client’s competency, but you are afraid that if you raise your concerns with the court, your client will be subject to confinement at the state mental hospital for sixty days while an evaluation is completed.

He suddenly tells you that he wishes to redraft his will to cut out his wife of many years. He does not wish to discuss the reasons, apart from expressing general bitterness concerning their current relationship. Would it be permissible, or appropriate, to question this decision and delay carrying out your client’s instructions to provide time for further consideration? Suppose that you have been a friend and advisor to the wife in the past, although you have not had recent contact. What if your client dies without changing his mind before the new will is executed?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.526" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.526" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Your client was involved in a car accident in which one of his close college friends was killed. He is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular homicide, but some of the circumstances are unclear. You believe that if he contests the charges, the prosecutor might ultimately accept a plea to reckless operation of a vehicle. The client, however, insists that he should plead guilty to homicide, and in an emotional scene, tells you that he cannot live with himself unless he acknowledges his guilt. You do not think he has a realistic understanding of prison conditions or the effect of such a conviction on his long-term prospects. Should you enlist the client’s family and friends in trying to convince him not to plead guilty unless the prosecutor offers to reduce the charges? Would it be preferable simply to provide your best assessment of the likely consequences?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Conversely, suppose that the facts are strongly against your client but he wants to reject the reckless operation plea and go to trial. You advise your client that he would be extremely foolish not to take the plea because if, as is likely, he is convicted on the greater charge of homicide, the judge would doubtless impose the maximum penalty. Your client still wants to take his chances.

      <p class="TextParagraph">While Rule 1.2(a) makes clear that a “lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter,” Rule 1.2(c) states that a lawyer “may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent.” Comment 6 elaborates that the “scope of services to be provided by a lawyer may be limited by agreement with the client or by the terms under which the lawyer’s services are made available to the client.” Does this mean that a lawyer could enter a retainer agreement with a client in which the lawyer agrees to provide litigation services only on the condition that the client agree not to settle without the lawyer’s consent? In other words, could a lawyer contract around the basic allocation of control rules specified in Rule 1.2(a)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.2(a)&quot; " />?</p>

The lawyer and client cannot contract out of the lawyer’s duty to request permission from the tribunal before withdrawing on non-mandatory grounds.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Does this seem like the right resolution of the settlement problem? Consider the case of a public interest lawyer who works for a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting for equal pay for women. The lawyer has spent several years investigating a large corporate employer with a poor record of hiring and promoting women, and has collected evidence from current and former female employees of the company’s practice of paying women less than men for the same work. Because the company is considered an industry leader, the lawyer believes that a successful suit will have a broader impact by sending a message to other firms to promote pay equity. However, the lawyer anticipates that the company will fight the suit tooth and nail, and that it will cost an enormous amount of resources to litigate successfully. The lawyer’s organization is nonetheless willing to support the suit on the condition that it does not simply seek back pay for female workers, but also pursues injunctive relief that the lawyer hopes will result in a public recognition of liability by the company and an agreement to make proactive changes to ensure pay equity going forward. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Based on her research into similar cases, the lawyer understands that it is common for corporate defendants to propose confidential settlements in which they make undisclosed damage payments for backpay but refuse to admit liability or agree to systemic changes going forward. Plaintiffs are often tempted to take the money offered in these settlements, despite their sympathy to the broader pay equity cause or prior assurances that they want the company to provide injunctive relief. Given the risk that the clients might give up on what (from the lawyer’s perspective) is the most important part of the case (and the only reason her organization has agreed to it in the first place), why shouldn’t the lawyer be permitted to contract in advance to prevent a confidential monetary settlement? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As Problem 2 above highlights, a key question for lawyers in making decisions in the clients’ best interest is whether there is reason to distrust client decisionmaking capacity. If a client is comatose or otherwise wholly incompetent, the lawyer has only two alternatives: to “play God” or to take instructions from an alternative decision-maker, such as a guardian.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">However, more difficult ethical problems arise with partially competent clients. This part examines the challenges of legal representation in this context, focusing on two types of scenarios. The first involves the representation of clients with <span style="font-style: italic;">diminished capacity</span>, specifically, adults who are mentally disabled or some juveniles. The second involves the representation of <span style="font-style: italic;">sophisticated clients</span>. As the above discussion indicates, even highly sophisticated decision-makers can sometimes become irrational and fail to realize that their judgment is faulty. Clients can be “too smart for their own good,” or too indecisive about what their own good is.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861333" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218901" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908449" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Defining Competence</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A threshold question is what “competence” means. Experts generally agree that mental illness should not be equated with incompetence; many individuals suffering impairment in some areas retain decisionmaking capacity in others.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.532" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.532" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> Nor is eccentricity the same as incompetence, and in many situations, there is no value-neutral standpoint from which to assess the rationality of another’s convictions. For example, a person may decide to give all his money to his church. If the church is part of a mainstream religion, observers may call the person a saint; if the church is a “cult,” observers may assume that the person has been brainwashed and take legal steps to freeze the person’s assets. Yet almost every mainstream religion began as a cult, scorned by popular opinion. An outsider’s judgment that a “cultist” is incompetent may reveal more about the outsider’s biases than about the believer’s incapacity.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A further difficulty is that evaluations of competence may be influenced by ulterior motives. A typical situation arises when an elderly individual begins making extravagant expenditures, charitable contributions, or gifts to companions that will shrink the estate of potential heirs. Family members may respond by threatening or initiating involuntary guardianship proceedings, or pressuring the individual’s lawyer to intervene.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.533" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.533" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder; vertical-align: super; font-size: smaller; line-height: 100%;"> </span>Alternatively, disappointed heirs who learn that a deceased relative has made substantial charitable bequests may attack the testator’s competence and ask that the will be set aside—<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page216" class="pagebreak" title="216">216</span>a form of after-the-fact “paternalism” that is particularly problematic because the other heirs are scarcely disinterested, and the deceased is no longer around to defend his competency.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.534" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.534" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span> Dennis Thompson warns of the circular reasoning that bases judgments of incompetency solely on a person’s “eccentric” choices, and then overrules those choices because the person is incompetent. An adequate justification of paternalism, he advises, requires us to “identify some impairment that can be described independently of the end or good an individual chooses.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.535" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.535" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span></p>

        <a id="_Toc451861334" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Assessing Competence and Incompetence</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To avoid such circular analysis, some commentators propose focusing on the process rather than the substance of a decision. For example, do individuals understand the consequences of a choice, the alternatives available, and the likelihood that the particular choice will advance their objectives? Can they give reasons for their decision? However, as other experts note, it is often impossible to evaluate process without <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> background assumptions about substance. We evaluate an individual’s understanding and reasoning by reference to what we consider rational goals.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.536" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.536" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span> Moreover, as a practical matter, most of us will be willing to defer to people’s choices that appear consistent with their objectives, even if their reasoning process seems questionable. A harder question arises when clients’ short-term preferences seem clearly inconsistent with their long-term well-being.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Although the difficulties in objectively assessing competence cannot be entirely escaped, they can be addressed by examining factors such as: the ability to articulate the reasons behind a decision; the variability in the decision-maker’s mental state; the appreciation of the consequences of a particular decision; the substantive fairness of the outcome; and its consistency with the decision-maker’s long-term values.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.537" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.537" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Alternatively, David Luban proposes adopting a test of competency articulated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Matter of Will of White,</span> a nineteenth-century estates case:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[I]f there are facts, however insufficient they may in reality be, from which a prejudiced or a narrow . . . mind might derive a particular idea or belief, it cannot be said that the mind is diseased in that respect.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.538" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.538" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" class="pagebreak" title="217">217</span>
      <p class="TextFlush">Luban comments: “All that we can reasonably require is that the person be connecting beliefs to real facts by <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> recognizable inferential process. . . .”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.539" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.539" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> Furthermore, when the individual’s potentially harmful choice arises from membership in some recognizable group, such as a religious cult or political movement, Luban believes that viewing the individual as incompetent would be inconsistent with associational freedom.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.540" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.540" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span> This approach would rule out a great deal of paternalistic intervention.</p>

        <a id="_Toc451861335" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">When Competence Most Matters</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There are at least three ways in which a client’s “competence” may matter in a legal proceeding and different standards may apply in each instance.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">First, in a criminal proceeding, a defendant may be judged <span style="font-style: italic;">incompetent to stand trial</span> after a psychiatric evaluation because he “is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.” <a id="dabmci_2c221369186045a59434cb62ae542c99" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />18 U.S.C. § 4241(d). In such case, a client may be committed to a mental health institution.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Second, a criminal defendant may be deemed competent to stand trial but <span style="font-style: italic;">incompetent to represent himself</span>. This issue arose in<span class="Hyperlink"> </span><a id="dabmci_cdafab62e02e472caac5d696a73d3ec0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;" class="Hyperlink">Indiana v. Edwards</span><span class="Hyperlink">, 554 U.S. 164 (2008)</span>. There, after lengthy competency proceedings, the state trial judge found that the defendant suffered from schizophrenia, that he was competent to stand trial for attempted murder, but that he was not competent to represent himself. At a trial with court-appointed counsel, the defendant was convicted and sentenced to thirty years. The Indiana Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the standard for self-representation was the same as the standard for competency to stand trial. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the standards should be different. Competency to stand trial required only that the individual have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings, and an ability to consult with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.541" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.541" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Edwards</span> Court’s view, “[i]n certain instances an individual may well be able to satisfy <span style="font-style: italic;">Dusky’s</span> mental competence standard, for he will be able to work with counsel at trial, yet at the same time he may be unable to carry out the basic tasks needed to present his own defense without the help of counsel.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.542" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.542" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, the third way that competence matters is when a lawyer is called upon to <span style="font-style: italic;">make strategic decisions on a client’s behalf that may conflict with the views of the client</span>, who may be competent to stand trial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" class="pagebreak" title="218">218</span>(or pursue another course of legal action) but nonetheless suffer from a mental impairment. What is the standard for lawyer conduct in such a context?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861336" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218902" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756318" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908450" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Client Competency: The Ethical Framework</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Prior to the adoption of the Model Rules, the bar’s ethical codes provided no explicit guidance for such representation. Now, Rule 1.14 provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When a client’s capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action, including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client, and in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator, or guardian.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Information relating to the representation of a client with diminished capacity is protected by Rule 1.6. When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client’s interests.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Comment 6 provides as follows:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">[6]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In determining the extent of the client’s diminished capacity, the lawyer should consider and balance such factors as: the client’s ability to articulate reasoning leading to a decision, variability of state of mind and ability to appreciate consequences of a decision; the substantive fairness of a decision; and the consistency of a decision with the known long-term commitments and values of the client. In appropriate circumstances, the lawyer may seek guidance from an appropriate diagnostician.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What constitutes a “considered decision” or an appropriate “protective action” is open to dispute. Courts have divided over how far lawyers should depart from the typical advocacy role in representing clients under a disability. Some judges have applauded attorneys for acting in clients’ “best interest”; other judges have criticized attorneys for making judgments about medical treatment that are beyond their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page219" class="pagebreak" title="219">219</span>expertise and that usurp the judicial role.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.543" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.543" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span> The trend, both among courts and experts in the field, is toward deference to clients’ expressed preferences. The fact that a client disagrees with mental health experts concerning his condition does not always mean that he is incompetent to make his own decisions and to direct his lawyer accordingly. For obvious reasons, psychiatric professionals are often highly risk averse when any possibility of harm to the patient or to third parties is at stake; individuals whose liberty is at issue or who suffer significant side effects from medication, may have a different assessment of their own best interests.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When should attorneys follow a client’s wishes that are contrary to recommendations of mental health experts? There is no easy answer, and every course of action a lawyer might take runs risks. For example, in the context of civil commitments (a legal process through which an individual with symptoms of severe mental illness is court-ordered into inpatient psychiatric treatment), to agree with experts that the client’s institutionalization is beneficial may “fail to take into account . . . the conditions prevalent in many of the public psychiatric facilities to which patients are regularly committed and the severity of the side effects often caused by the administration of psychotropic medication.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.544" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.544" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span> If the lawyers who are appointed to represent individuals at civil commitment hearings are encouraged to follow doctors’ rather than clients’ wishes, they may end up failing to provide the kind of check on the system that their presence was meant to secure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.545" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.545" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> Given the loss of liberty and stigma associated with involuntary commitment, individuals deserve an advocate who will speak for their interest as they perceive it.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other side of the issue, one commentator cautions:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The patient-hospital relationship is not a simple adversarial one. It is not approached as such by the institution. To approach it that way from the patient’s side would, if nothing else, be incongruous. All the elements that argue for the broader fact-finder-counselor role are present, and pursuit of the objectives of improving the decision-making process, getting the full facts, promoting serious reflection on all options and their consequences, and of serving interests less narrow than those announced in mental confusion by the patient or perceived at first blush by the lawyer would appear to be the essence of good lawyering in the mental institution. To extend without thought the dictates or folklore of “traditional litigation” to the mental hospital situation is unlikely to benefit anyone other than the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page220" class="pagebreak" title="220">220</span>lawyer who measures success in terms of “beating” imagined adversaries. . . .<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.546" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.546" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Related problems figure in the guardianship system. Though Rule 1.14(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.14(b)&quot; \s &quot;1.14(b)&quot; \c 16 " /> endorses the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator, or guardian, such appointments are not always appropriate. Elderly individuals may be competent to handle certain decisions but not others. These individuals may justifiably fear that guardianship would mean the loss of control over crucial aspects of their lives. Moreover, the frequently inadequate oversight of guardians, and the undue costs of providing them for individuals with little property or only temporary disabilities, may make their appointment less desirable than relying on family attorneys to function as “de facto” guardians.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.547" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.547" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One final difficulty is that the choice of which role to adopt is generally up to lawyers themselves. Client oversight, the normal check on attorney conduct, is insufficient because the very point at issue is how much direction to take from the client. The problem is exacerbated by many clients’ difficulties in communicating with their attorneys or in replacing them if the relationship is unsatisfactory.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">How should lawyers deal with clients who are judged competent to stand trial but who have some mental health difficulties that seem to impair their decisionmaking ability?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This question surfaced in the celebrated case involving the “Unabomber,” which is excerpted below. Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt, in his dissenting opinion, summarizes the background facts of the case:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">By the time of his arrest in a remote Montana cabin on April 3, 1996, Ted Kaczynski had become one of the most notorious and wanted criminals in our nation’s history. For nearly two decades, beginning in 1978, the “Unabomber”—so designated by the FBI when his primary targets appeared to be universities and airlines—had carried out a bizarre ideological campaign of mail-bomb terror aimed at the “industrial-technological system” and its principal adherents: computer scientists, geneticists, behavioral psychologists, and public-relations executives. Three <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page221" class="pagebreak" title="221">221</span>men—Hugh Scrutton, Gilbert Murray, and Thomas Mosser—were killed by Kaczynski’s devices, and many other people were injured, some severely.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">In 1995, Kaczynski made what has been aptly described as “the most extraordinary manuscript submission in the history of publishing.” Kaczynski proposed to halt all his killings on the condition that major American newspapers agree to publish his manifesto, “Industrial Society and Its Future.” The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span> accepted the offer, and that most unusual document, with its “dream . . . of a green and pleasant land liberated from the curse of technological proliferation,” revealed to the world the utopian vision that had inspired Kaczynski’s cruel and inhumane acts. Among the readers of the manifesto was David Kaczynski, who came to suspect that its author was his brother Ted, a former mathematics professor at Berkeley who had isolated himself from society some quarter-century before. David very reluctantly resolved to inform the FBI of his suspicions, although he sought assurances that the government would not seek the death penalty and expressed his strong view that his brother was mentally ill. On the basis of information provided by David, the FBI arrested Kaczynski and, despite David’s anguished opposition, the government gave notice of its intent to seek the death penalty.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.548" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.548" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Theodore John Kaczynski, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court’s denial of his motion under <a id="dabmci_9378903dc9ff44c8944f3f95b6eea8a0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate his conviction. In that motion, Kaczynski alleges that his guilty plea to indictments returned against him as the “Unabomber” in the Eastern District of California and in the District of New Jersey, in exchange for the United States renouncing its intention to seek the death penalty, was involuntary because his counsel insisted on presenting evidence of his mental condition, contrary to his wishes, and the court denied his <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> request to represent himself. Having found that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> request was untimely and not in good faith, that counsel could control the presentation of evidence, and that the plea was voluntary, the district court denied the <a id="dabmci_0b32a1afa85c4f8e8d6ff8364ddd3e39" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 2255 motion without calling for a response or holding a hearing. . . .</p>

      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The facts underlying Kaczynski’s arrest (April 3, 1996) and indictment for mailing or placing sixteen bombs that killed three people, and injured nine others, are well known and we do not repeat them here. Rather, we summarize the pre-trial proceedings that bear on the voluntariness of Kaczynski’s plea.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Kaczynski’s capital case was assigned to Judge Garland Burrell, and Kaczynski was represented by Judy Clarke, Quin Denvir, and Gary Sowards, all highly experienced federal public defenders. They filed a notice under <a id="dabmci_956e10e24d324b3eb427684d352cae31" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />F. R. Crim. P. 12.2(b) that they intended to introduce psychiatric evidence for an impaired mental state defense of Kaczynski. Kaczynski himself made it clear that he was extremely reluctant to agree to this notice, and that he strongly opposed any form of mental state defense. Instead, he favored a combination of a necessity defense (arguing that his bombings were self-defense against technological society) and a motion to suppress all the evidence seized from his Montana cabin by the FBI. After jury selection, Kaczynski learned that his defenders intended to go ahead with the mental defense. In mid-December, Kaczynski agreed that evidence of his mental state could be introduced at the penalty stage of the trial but not at the guilt stage. Subsequently, however, Kaczynski announced that he wished to replace his counsel with Tony Serra, another lawyer with whom he had been in contact, because Serra would not use a mental status defense, and would defend the case along Kaczynski’s preferred lines. When the judge denied that motion because it would delay trial, Kaczynski asked to represent himself. The judge denied this motion as well, on the ground that it was untimely and made in a bad-faith attempt to delay the trial. Kaczynski attempted suicide, and the trial was postponed until he could be examined for competence. The court determined that he was competent to stand trial, and that despite his desire to represent himself, he would be represented by Clarke and Denvir, who would present a mental state defense. The court noted that permitting Kaczynski to represent himself would mean foregoing “the only defense that is likely to prevent his conviction and execution.” Kaczynski immediately agreed to plead guilty in return for no death sentence. He was sentenced to life without parole. He appealed.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the merits, Kaczynski contends that his plea was involuntary because he was improperly denied his <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> right, or because he had a constitutional right to prevent his counsel from presenting mental state evidence. Even if neither deprivation suffices, still the plea was involuntary in his view because it was induced by the threat of a mental state defense that Kaczynski would have found unendurable.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It goes without saying that a plea must be voluntary to be constitutional. . . . The general principles are well settled. . . . In sum, “a guilty plea is void if it was ‘induced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act.’ ”</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page223" class="pagebreak" title="223">223</span>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">A</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">[The court finds, on the basis of Kaczynski’s written and oral statements, his responses to questions at the time his guilty plea was entered, and his demeanor, that the plea was entered voluntarily.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This would normally end the enquiry, for being forced to choose between unpleasant alternatives is not unconstitutional. However, since the district court ruled on Kaczynski’s <a id="dabmci_5d98c2d5e7de464a87e273399d1e6191" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 2255 motion, we held in <a id="dabmci_14c52e11fdd5403890e94e2b48801879" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Hernandez, United States v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;26;dabmci_14c52e11fdd5403890e94e2b48801879_1;Idfbd39eb795d11d9bf29e2067ad74e5b;;0;F;United States v. Hernandez, 203 F.3d 614 (9th Cir. 2000)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Hernandez</span>, 203 F.3d 614 (9th Cir. 2000), that the erroneous denial of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> request renders a guilty plea involuntary. We reasoned that wrongly denying a defendant’s request to represent himself forces him “to choose between pleading guilty and submitting to a trial the very structure of which would be unconstitutional.” Because this deprives the defendant “of the choice between the only two constitutional alternatives—a plea and a fair trial,” we concluded that a district court’s improper <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> ruling “imposed unreasonable constraints” on the defendant’s decision-making, thus making a guilty plea involuntary. Therefore, we must consider whether Kaczynski’s plea was rendered involuntary on account of a wrongful refusal to grant his request for self-representation.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">B</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Following <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span>, our court has developed the rule that “[a] criminal defendant’s assertion of his right to self-representation must be timely and not for purposes of delay; it must also be unequivocal, as well as voluntary and intelligent.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Kaczynski argues that there must be an affirmative showing that he intended to delay the trial by asking to represent himself, and that none was made here. Rather, he asserts, the facts show that his purpose was to avoid the mental state defense. Kaczynski also contends that his <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> request was timely, which we assume (without deciding) that it was for purposes of appeal. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The court found that Kaczynski “clearly and unambiguously permitted his lawyers to adduce mental status evidence at trial, and his complaints to the contrary, asserted on the day trial was set to commence, evidence his attempt to disrupt the trial process.” Further, the court found that although Kaczynski contended he made his January 8 request to represent himself only because he could not endure his attorneys’ strategy of presenting mental status evidence in his defense, the record belied this contention because Kaczynski had authorized its use. The court also found that Kaczynski was well aware before January 8 that evidence of his mental status would be adduced at trial. In addition to the December 22 accord, Kaczynski was present during all but one day of the seventeen days of voir dire, during which the court observed that he conferred amicably with his attorneys while they openly and obviously selected jurors appearing receptive to mental health evidence about him. Finally, the court found that Kaczynski could not have immediately <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page224" class="pagebreak" title="224">224</span>assumed his own defense without considerable delay, given the large amount of technical evidence and more than 1300 exhibits that the government intended to offer. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Kaczynski contends that he could not have been influenced by delay, given that he was incarcerated for the long haul in any event. However, the district court found that he was simultaneously pursuing strategies to delay the trial, to project a desired image of himself, and to improve his settlement prospects with the government. Kaczynski also argues that it should not matter whether he agreed to let evidence of his mental state be presented in the penalty phase, because the trial might never have gotten that far. We disagree, for Kaczynski never did—and does not now suggest—that he is actually innocent or that there was any realistic chance that the jury would not unanimously find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-style: italic;">Affirmed</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Reinhardt</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Circuit Judge</span>, dissenting:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I disagree strongly with the majority’s decision and regretfully must dissent.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This case involves the right of a seriously disturbed individual to insist upon representing himself at trial, even when the end result is likely to be his execution. It presents a direct clash between the right of self-representation and the state’s obligation to provide a fair trial to criminal defendants, especially capital defendants. It raises the question whether we should execute emotionally disturbed people whose crimes may be the product of mental disease or defect and, if so, whether they should be allowed to forego defenses or appeals that might prevent their execution. In fact, it raises, albeit indirectly, the question whether anyone should be permitted to waive his right to contest his execution by the state if that execution might be unlawful.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The case of Ted Kaczynski not only brings together a host of legal issues basic to our system of justice, it also presents a compelling individual problem: what should be the fate of a man, undoubtedly learned and brilliant, who determines, on the basis of a pattern of reasoning that can only be described as perverse, that in order to save society he must commit a series of horrendous crimes? What is the proper response of the legal system when such an individual demands that he be allowed to offer those perverse theories to a jury as his only defense in a capital case—a defense that obviously has no legal merit and certainly has no chance of success? What should the response be when he also insists on serving as his own lawyer, not for the purpose of pursuing a proper legal defense, but in order to ensure that no evidence will be presented that exposes the nature and extent of his mental problems? The district judge faced these questions and, understandably, blinked. He quite clearly did so out of compassionate and humanitarian concerns. Nevertheless, in denying Kaczynski’s request to represent himself, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" class="pagebreak" title="225">225</span>district court unquestionably failed to follow the law. Notwithstanding the majority’s arguments in defense of the district judge’s actions, they simply cannot be supported on the ground he offered, or on any other ground available under the law as it now stands.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Whether Theodore Kaczynski suffers from severe mental illness, and which of the various psychiatric diagnoses that have been put forth is the most accurate, are questions that we cannot answer here. However, it is not now, nor has it ever been, disputed that under the governing legal standards, he was competent to waive his right to the assistance of counsel. Therefore, whatever we may think about the wisdom of his choice, or of the doctrine that affords a defendant like Kaczynski the right to make that choice, he was entitled, under the law as enunciated by the Supreme Court, to represent himself at trial. A review of the transcript makes startlingly clear that, under the law that controls our decision, the denial of Kaczynski’s request violated his Sixth Amendment rights. There is simply no basis for the district court’s assertion that the request was made in bad faith or for purposes of delay. Because, as the majority acknowledges, the erroneous denial of a self-representation request renders a subsequent guilty plea involuntary as a matter of law, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s holding that Kaczynski’s plea was voluntary.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.549" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.549" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">I</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . Following Kaczynski’s indictment, Federal Defenders Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke were appointed to represent him. Attorney Gary Sowards joined the defense team some time later. All three are superb attorneys, and Kaczynski could not have had more able legal representatives. From the outset, however, Kaczynski made clear that a defense based on mental illness would be unacceptable to him, and his bitter opposition to the only defense that his lawyers believed might save his life created acute tension between counsel and client. That tension persisted, and periodically erupted, throughout the many months leading up to Kaczynski’s guilty plea, and the dispute was not definitively resolved until Judge Burrell ruled on January 7, 1998, that Kaczynski’s attorneys could present mental-health evidence even over his vehement objection. It was that ruling, Kaczynski maintains—and the record indisputably reflects—that compelled him to request self-representation the very next day as the only means of preventing his portrayal as a “grotesque and repellent lunatic.” In doing so, Kaczynski was merely exercising the right that Judge Burrell had recognized he possessed the day before, immediately after he issued his controversial ruling that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page226" class="pagebreak" title="226">226</span>counsel, not client, would control the presentation of mental-health evidence.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.550" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.550" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Whether Kaczynski’s self-representation request was made in good faith, as Judge Burrell repeatedly stated on January 8, or whether it was a “deliberate attempt to manipulate the trial process for the purpose of causing delay,” as Judge Burrell subsequently held when explaining his reason for denying the request, is the issue before us. Although the answer is absolutely clear from the record, it is helpful to set forth a number of colloquies that demonstrate that everyone involved—including counsel for both sides and the district judge—was fully aware that Kaczynski’s request was made in good faith and not for purposes of delay. The record reveals that Kaczynski’s aversion to a mental-health defense was, indisputably, heartfelt, and that no one—least of all Judge Burrell—ever questioned Kaczynski’s sincerity prior to the time the judge commenced formulating his January 22 ruling.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">II</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Judge Reinhardt summarizes various evidence, including dozens of notes that Kaczynski wrote to his attorney, in which he expressed his unwillingness to present a mental-health defense at trial. For example, in 1997 he wrote: “I categorically refuse to use a mental-status defense.” He submitted to psychiatric evaluations only after receiving what he described as “false promises and intense pressure” from his attorneys, who understood that his primary concern was, as he wrote them in June 1997, “to get reliable psychological data about myself before the public in order to counteract all this silly stuff about me that the media have been pushing.”]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When, on November 25, 1997, Kaczynski learned that defense experts had diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and that the results of those examinations had been released to the government and to the public, he felt “shock and dismay.” In the courtroom on that day, Kaczynski wrote to Denvir and Clarke:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Did Gary [Sowards] give that info to the prosecutors with your knowledge and consent? If you all assume responsibility for revealing what is being revealed now, then this is the end between us. I will not work with you guys any more, because I can’t trust you. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">This case is developing in a direction that I certainly did not expect. I was lead [sic] to believe that this was not really a “mental health” kind of defense, but that you would try to show that my actions were a kind of “self defense.” Gary [Sowards] gave me the impression that we would use only Dr. Kriegler, and would use her only to show I would not “do it again.”</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page227" class="pagebreak" title="227">227</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the weeks that followed, Kaczynski also wrote three separate letters to Judge Burrell in which he explained his conflict with his attorneys and sought replacement of counsel. However, Denvir and Clarke prevailed upon him to delay bringing the conflict to the attention of the judge while they were engaged in negotiations with the Justice Department aimed at allowing him to plead guilty conditionally while preserving his suppression issues for appeal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.551" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.551" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> When those negotiations failed, Denvir and Clarke agreed to deliver Kaczynski’s letters to Judge Burrell, and they did so on December 18.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The letters reveal the depth of the rift that had developed between Kaczynski and his attorneys regarding the issue of mental-health evidence. The first letter, dated December 1, 1997 begins: “Last Tuesday, November 25, I unexpectedly learned for the first time in this courtroom that my attorneys had deceived me.” Kaczynski explained that he had been assured by his attorneys that the results of psychiatric examinations that he reluctantly agreed to undergo—and even the fact that he had been examined at all—would be protected by attorney-client privilege and would not be disclosed absent his approval. Moreover, he had been “led to believe that [he] would not be portrayed as mentally ill without [his] consent. . . .”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In a letter dated December 18, Kaczynski offered his reasons for objecting to a defense based on mental-health evidence:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">I do not believe that science has any business probing the workings of the human mind, and . . . my personal ideology and that of the mental-health professions are mutually antagonistic. . . . It is humiliating to have one’s mind probed by a person whose ideology and values are alien to one’s own. . . . [My lawyers] calculatedly deceived me in order to get me to reveal my private thoughts, and then without warning they made accessible to the public the cold and heartless assessments of their experts. . . . To me this was a stunning blow . . . [and] the worst experience I ever underwent in my life. . . . I would rather die, or suffer prolonged physical torture, than have the 12.2b defense imposed on me in this way by my present attorneys.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Previous consent to such a defense was, Kaczynski contended, “meaningless because my attorneys misled me as to what that defense involved.” . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the morning of January 5, Kaczynski informed Judge Burrell of his continuing conflict with counsel, and the judge appointed attorney Kevin Clymo as “conflicts counsel” to represent Kaczynski’s interests. Proceedings were postponed until January 7. On that day, Judge Burrell ruled that Kaczynski’s counsel could present mental-state testimony <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page228" class="pagebreak" title="228">228</span>even if Kaczynski objected. Judge Burrell then offered Kaczynski the option of self-representation, warning: “I don’t advise it, but if you want to, I’ve got to give you certain rights.” At the time of the court’s offer, Kaczynski declined to accept it, explaining that he was “too tired . . . [to] take on such a difficult task,” and that he did not feel “up to taking that challenge at the moment.” By then, according to his section 2255 motion, “Kaczynski was already contemplating suicide as the most probable way out of this cul-de-sac.” Later that same day, the court was informed that Tony Serra would, after all, be willing to represent Kaczynski. Kaczynski promptly requested a change of counsel, but Judge Burrell denied the request on the ground that substituting counsel would require a significant delay before trial could commence.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On January 8, Kaczynski decided to accept the court’s offer of the previous day and informed the court that he wished to represent himself.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.552" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.552" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span> Kaczynski’s counsel conveyed his request to the court with great reluctance:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Your Honor, if I may address the Court, Mr. Kaczynski had a request that we alert the Court to, on his behalf—it is his request that he be permitted to proceed in this case as his own counsel. This is a very difficult position for him. He believes that he has no choice but to go forward as his own lawyer. It is a very heartfelt reaction, I believe, to the presentation of a mental illness defense, a situation in which he simply cannot endure.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Kaczynski’s attorneys made clear that he was not seeking any delay in proceedings and that he was prepared to proceed <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> immediately. On that day, as before, Judge Burrell did not intimate that he perceived any bad-faith motive on Kaczynski’s part. To the contrary, he made numerous comments demonstrating his belief that Kaczynski sought self-representation solely because of the conflict over control of the mental-health defense. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The court repeatedly asserted that the key to the self-representation issue was whether Kaczynski was “competent,” and did not even hint at the possibility of a bad-faith motive. Ultimately, Kaczynski’s own attorneys called their client’s competency into question, expressing the view that his efforts to waive what appeared to be his only meritorious defense attested to the need for a competency evaluation. At that point, all counsel (including the court-appointed conflicts counsel) and Judge Burrell agreed that Kaczynski should undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine his competency to exercise his right to self-representation, and the next day the judge issued an order for the necessary medical examinations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The competency evaluation would, of course, have been altogether unnecessary had Judge Burrell believed on January 8 that Kaczynski’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page229" class="pagebreak" title="229">229</span>request to represent himself was made in bad faith. The judge could simply have denied the request on that ground. Nevertheless, two weeks later, after Kaczynski had been determined to be competent by a government psychiatrist, Judge Burrell denied the self-representation request, characterizing it—in a manner that directly contradicted the numerous statements he had made at the prior proceedings—as a “deliberate attempt to manipulate the trial process for the purpose of causing delay.”</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">III</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is impossible to read the transcripts of the proceedings without being struck by Judge Burrell’s exceptional patience, sound judgment, and sincere commitment to protecting Kaczynski’s right to a fair trial—and his life. Judge Burrell’s commendable concern about preventing Kaczynski from pursuing a strategy that would almost certainly result in his execution is reflected most dramatically in statements made in connection with the judge’s January 22, 1998 oral ruling denying Kaczynski’s self-representation request. The judge observed that by abandoning a mental-health defense and proceeding as his own counsel, Kaczynski would be foregoing “the only defense that is likely to prevent his conviction and execution. . . . That ill-advised objective is counterproductive to the justice sought to be served through the adversary judicial system, which is designed to allow a jury to determine the merits of the defense he seeks to abandon.” Judge Burrell was unwilling to permit Kaczynski to use the criminal justice system “as an instrument of self-destruction,” explaining that “a contrary ruling risks impugning the integrity of our criminal justice system, since it would simply serve as a suicide forum for a criminal defendant.” He contended, in effect, that society had an interest in preventing capital defendants from using the instrument of the state to commit suicide. As legal support for his reasoning, Judge Burrell cited Chief Justice Burger’s dissenting opinion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Nevertheless, Judge Burrell did not base his decision denying Kaczynski’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> rights on his views of the role of the criminal justice system in capital cases; he was not free to do so under controlling law. . . . Because Kaczynski’s psychiatric evaluation resulted in a declaration that he was competent, the only available basis for denying his request was to find that it was not made in good faith—but rather for the purpose of delay—even though the record squarely refuted that conclusion.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There can be no doubt that Judge Burrell’s admirable desire to prevent an uncounseled, and seriously disturbed, defendant from confronting, on his own, the “prosecutorial forces of organized society”—in this case, three experienced federal prosecutors aggressively seeking that defendant’s execution—lay at the heart of his denial of Kaczynski’s request for self-representation. A fair reading of the record provides no support for the finding that Kaczynski’s purpose was delay. . . . Yet it is easy to appreciate why, as one commentator has suggested, “the judicial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" class="pagebreak" title="230">230</span>system breathed a collective sigh of relief when the Unabomber pled guilty.” Indeed, all the players in this unfortunate drama—all except Kaczynski, that is—had reason to celebrate Kaczynski’s unconditional guilty plea. His attorneys had achieved their principal and worthy objective by preventing his execution. The government had been spared the awkwardness of pitting three experienced prosecutors against an untrained, and mentally unsound, defendant, and conducting an execution following a trial that lacked the fundamental elements of due process at best, and was farcical at worst. Judge Burrell, as noted, had narrowly avoided having to preside over such a debacle and to impose a death penalty he would have considered improper in the absence of a fair trial. It is no wonder that today’s majority is not eager to disturb so delicate a balance.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The problem with this “happy” solution, of course, is that it violates the core principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta v. California</span>—that a defendant who objects to his counsel’s strategic choices has the option of going to trial alone. Personally, I believe that the right of self-representation should in some instances yield to the more fundamental constitutional guarantee of a fair trial. Here, the district court understood that giving effect to <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span>’s guarantee would likely result in a proceeding that was fundamentally unfair. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Faretta</span> does not permit the courts to take account of such considerations. Under the law as it now stands, there was no legitimate basis for denying Kaczynski the right to be his own lawyer in his capital murder trial.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadCentered">IV</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I do not suggest that the result the majority reaches is unfair or unjust. It is neither. I would prefer to be free to uphold the district judge’s denial of Kaczynski’s request on the basis of the societal interest in due process for all defendants, and particularly capital defendants. Unfortunately, I am not permitted by precedent to do so. Because I am bound by the law, I am also unable to vote to affirm on the basis the district court relied on: that Kaczynski’s request was made in bad faith. Thus, with much regret, I must conclude that Kaczynski’s plea of guilty was not voluntary and that he was entitled to withdraw it. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Lawyer Michael Mello assisted Kaczynski in preparing his <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> appeal to the Ninth Circuit; he also wrote a book about the Unabomber case.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.553" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.553" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span> Mello describes Kaczynski as follows:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Like most psychopaths I’ve encountered in my travels as a capital defense lawyer, Kaczynski is wildly manipulative of people. He is the most selfish person I’ve ever known. He is a control freak. . . . <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page231" class="pagebreak" title="231">231</span>He’s fixated as Nixon was with rehabilitating his public image, to correcting perceived “lies” others have said about him; he has even written a book to that end, tellingly and pretentiously (if inaccurately) titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Truth versus Lies</span>. (The alleged “liars” are Kaczynski’s brother and mother, the media, etc., and guess who the “truth” teller is?). He desperately tries to control what people say or write about him.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.554" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.554" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does this describe a form of psychopathology, or merely a strongly-felt value placed by Kaczynski on his own image—different in degree, but not in kind, from the value that most individuals place on their own reputations? If his public image matters so much to Kaczynski, is the decision to use a mental status defense merely a tactical choice or is it a basic decision about the aims of the representation? How would you analyze this case in terms of Rule 1.2(a)?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />From another perspective, Kaczynski may have been desperate to avoid having doubts cast on his sanity for fear that the public would discount the arguments in his manifesto—a work that in his eyes provided the justification for his campaign of terrorism. Should his lawyers have taken this into account?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Mello believes that most people desperately wish to view the Unabomber as insane because that is more comforting than believing that inexplicable crimes can be the product of a healthy mind. Yet as Mello notes:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If you think Kaczynski is a paranoid schizophrenic, I have a question for you: What are his delusions? . . . That the Industrial Revolution has been a mixed blessing? Hardly a delusion. That technology is chipping away at our freedoms and privacy? Hardly a delusion. That committing murder—and threatening to commit more—was the only way to force the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span> into publishing, in full and unedited form, the 35,000-word Unabomber Manifesto? Hardly delusion. That the powers that be in our culture would define the Unabomber as a pathetic lunatic? Hardly a delusion. That a simple, self-sufficient life, in one of the most physically beautiful places in America, is preferable to the rat-race of academia? Hardly a delusion.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.555" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.555" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">One of the psychiatrists who examined Kaczynski explained that his paranoid delusion was “[h]is view of technology as the vehicle by which people are destroying themselves and the world.” In what sense is this a delusion? Wouldn’t many “normal” Americans agree? As noted above, another psychiatrist submitted a report asserting that Kaczynski’s unawareness of his psychiatric illness was itself a sign of illness.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.556" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.556" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> Is there any way for Kaczynski to avoid confirming this diagnosis? Is it legitimate for lawyers to submit such evidence against the client’s will?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" class="pagebreak" title="232">232</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />After Kaczynski’s trial, journalist William Finnegan published an article strongly condemning the Unabomber defense. According to Finnegan, Kaczynski was spared the death penalty “by a bizarre alliance of lawyers he was trying to fire, a family he had renounced, psychiatrists he did not trust or respect (and in some cases had never met), a federal judge who had drastically restricted his right to counsel and seemed to fear (with reason) the trial to come, a press convinced that he was a paranoid schizophrenic, and, finally, a legendary death-penalty opponent skilled at ‘client management’ (management, that is, of Kaczynski).”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.557" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.557" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span> As Finnegan tells the story, the defense team worked closely with Kaczynski’s mother and brother to popularize the image of Kaczynski as a madman in order to pressure the prosecution into dropping its demand for the death penalty. The press was more than happy to oblige, and the “client management” consultant succeeded in keeping Kaczynski in the dark about the mental defense his lawyers planned.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">As Finnegan relates the story, Kaczynski’s opposition to the mental defense did not represent a preference for death over dishonor, because Kaczynski did not see these as the only choices. He was focused on the possibility of a successful motion to suppress all the evidence seized from his cabin—essentially, the prosecution’s entire case. He wanted acquittal, not death. Finnegan comments: “If he did, in fact, believe that he had a chance of walking free from jail, he was, of course, severely deluded (not clinically deluded but blinded by unrealistic hopes, however conceived and encouraged). No judge in America would have set him free.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.558" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.558" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does this mean that Kaczynski’s rejection of a psychiatric defense was based on faulty legal judgment rather than fundamental values? If so, does it justify the defenders’ taking matters out of his hands? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Did Clarke and Denvir act improperly by insisting on a mental impairment defense? By plea bargaining on terms that Kaczynski detested (even though he was mistaken to think that he could get better terms)? In a brief to the court, Clark and Denvir asserted:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The decisions whether and how to present a mental status defense in the guilt phase (other than in an insanity defense) and what witnesses to call in the penalty phase of capital trial fall squarely within the category of strategic decisions that ultimately must be decided by trial counsel. . . . It is unconscionable for the government to ask to the court—in a capital case—to order defense counsel to forgo the only defense that is likely to prevent the defendant’s conviction and execution.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.559" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.559" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Do you agree? What would you have done?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does Rule 1.14<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.14&quot; " /> help justify what Clarke and Denvir did? Recall that subsection (b) states that when “the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" class="pagebreak" title="233">233</span>other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action . . . .” Comment 5 notes that protective measures could include “consulting with family members” and should be guided by “the wishes and values of the client to the extent known, the client’s best interests and the goal[ ] of intruding into the client’s decisionmaking autonomy to the least extent feasible . . . .” Comment 8 states that, when taking protective action, “the lawyer is impliedly authorized to make the necessary disclosures [of the client’s diminished capacity], even when the client directs the lawyer to the contrary.” Assuming that Kaczynski had diminished capacity, would presenting the mental impairment defense during trial have been in his best interests? Was it a proper disclosure of Kaczynski’s condition? What about the fact that Kaczynski’s brother and mother were working behind the scenes with the lawyers to convince Kaczynski to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As discussed above, under Rule 1.14(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.14(b)&quot; " />, “reasonably necessary protective action” includes “in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator or guardian.” Is it proper for a lawyer to seek appointment of a guardian for a client over the client’s objection? That was issue in the disciplinary case of Maryland lawyer Rhonda Framm, who agreed to represent client Robert Wilson in seeking to set aside a recently negotiated divorce settlement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.560" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.560" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span> Central to Framm’s strategy to vacate the settlement was showing that the client was incapacitated. After a psychiatric evaluation found that Wilson had a neuro-cognitive disorder (in part brought about by a prior stroke) that impaired his ability to understand complex information, Framm moved to vacate the settlement and appoint Wilson’s cousin as his guardian. In the hearing on the petition, Wilson (represented by appointed counsel) “denied that he was disabled and requested that the petition be dismissed,” while Framm argued in favor of guardianship on behalf of the cousin. Subsequently, the cousin decided to withdraw the petition, and Wilson filed disciplinary charges against Framm in relation to the guardianship petition (among other alleged misconduct). In ruling on the charges, the Maryland court of appeals held that Framm had failed to “abide by [her] client’s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation” under Rule 1.2(a) when she opposed her own client’s motion to dismiss the guardianship petition.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.561" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.561" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> The court further ruled that Framm had violated the conflict of interest rules by representing the client’s cousin in the guardianship hearing once it became clear that Wilson did not want a guardianship.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.562" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.562" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span> Responding to Framm’s argument that she was only acting in accord with Rule 1.14 in pursuing the guardianship on behalf of a client with diminished capacity, the court stated that, although Framm was in a “difficult position,” she was not able to represent the guardian and the client simultaneously.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.563" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.563" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span> This suggests that if a lawyer believes it is in the best <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page234" class="pagebreak" title="234">234</span>interest of the client to have a guardian, and the client disagrees, the lawyer must either give up pursuit of the guardianship or withdraw from the representation. Do you think putting the lawyer to this choice advances the purposes of Rule 1.14? Are they any effective alternatives? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In the aftermath of his trial, Kaczynski wrote:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Perhaps I ought to hate my attorneys for what they have done to me, but I do not. Their motives were in no way malicious. They are essentially conventional people who are blind to some of the implications of this case, and they acted as they did because they subscribe to certain professional principles that they believe left them no alternative. These principles may seem rigid and even ruthless to a non-lawyer, but there is no doubt my attorneys believe in them sincerely.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.564" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.564" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">Suppose that the principles to which Kaczynski refers are a fundamental commitment to zealous advocacy and a belief that the responsibility of a defense lawyer in a capital case is to save the client’s life. Would you agree that these principles were “rigid and ruthless” as applied in Kaczynski’s case?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The United States Supreme Court confronted a related issue in <a id="dabmci_582856139cc74947ba0f3c67cc75ef9e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Florida v. Nixon&quot; \s &quot;A;O;16;dabmci_582856139cc74947ba0f3c67cc75ef9e_2;I9a2ea64f9c9c11d991d0cc6b54f12d4d;;0;F;Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">Florida v. Nixon</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="Hyperlink">, 543 U.S. 175 (2004)</span>. There, the defendant, Joe Nixon, was charged with kidnapping a woman he had asked for assistance in a parking lot, and then burning her to death. The evidence of Nixon’s guilt was overwhelming. Among other things, Nixon confessed to police investigators, bragged about the crime to his brother and girlfriend, and numerous witnesses saw Nixon driving the victim’s automobile.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Faced with this incriminating evidence, Nixon’s defense attorney, Michael Corin, attempted to negotiate a plea that would avoid the death penalty—but was unsuccessful. He also had difficulty communicating with Nixon and could not get him to discuss a proposed strategy of conceding guilt and urging leniency during the penalty phase of the trial based on mental and emotional impairments.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Nixon was African American, and he demanded a different attorney and judge who were also African American. The trial judge denied those requests, and Nixon refused to attend trial. When questioned by the judge, he stated:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Y’all go ahead and have your trial if you want, but leave me out of it. You can sentence me, hang me, do what you want but leave me out of it. If you don’t give me no other lawyer. . . . Take me back to the jail and have Court without me. I don’t care.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">The trial court found that Nixon knowingly waived his right to attend trial, and Corin proceeded with his strategy of conceding guilt and claiming mitigating circumstances. The jury imposed the death penalty.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">A different lawyer represented Nixon in habeas proceedings, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court agreed, on grounds that the concession of guilt was tantamount to a guilty plea and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page235" class="pagebreak" title="235">235</span>required the defendant’s affirmative consent. In so ruling, the court relied on <a id="dabmci_90c6455ff0294c3b968d447237f0c040" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Cronic, United States v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;23;dabmci_90c6455ff0294c3b968d447237f0c040_1;Ice9aa8d49c9611d993e6d35cc61aab4a;;0;F;United States v.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In a unanimous opinion, the United States Supreme Court reversed. In its view:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant’s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel’s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant’s explicit consent. Instead, if counsel’s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant’s guilt, satisfies the <span style="font-style: italic;">Strickland</span> standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_ad3cece2938f415caf82d229a7174fe5" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />543 U.S. at 192.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What would you have done if you had been in Corin’s situation or on one of the courts reviewing the adequacy of his representation? One commentator described the case as involving “a mentally retarded black man with an appointed white lawyer on trial before a white judge in Leon County, Florida for killing a white woman.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.565" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.565" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span> Do the racial dynamics of the case affect your assessment?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Ethics scholar Lawrence Fox argues that Corin’s conduct was inconsistent with bar ethical rules because his concession of guilt relied on confidential information, protected by Rule 1.6, and Nixon had not consented to disclosure. In addition, Fox argues, Corin failed to adhere to Rule 1.14 concerning clients under a disability, discussed above.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.566" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.566" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> Recall the rule requires lawyers to maintain a normal lawyer-client relationship “as far as reasonably possible” with clients whose decisionmaking is impaired. Lawyers may also “seek the appointment of a guardian or take other protective measures” when they reasonably believe that the client “cannot adequately act in the client’s own interest.” Rule 1.14(b). What kind of relationship was “reasonably possible” with Nixon? Should Corin have sought to withdraw from the case or should he have requested the appointment of a guardian with whom to communicate on trial strategy? Should the trial court have granted a motion to withdraw and looked for an African American lawyer to represent Nixon?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In 2018, in <a id="dabmci_ef953c2c25844e86b7ad95925dbb0d5f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">McCoy v. Louisiana</span>, 138 S. Ct. 1500 (2018), the U.S. Supreme Court revisited the question of whether a defense lawyer could concede guilt. Robert McCoy was charged with triple homicide for the 2008 murders of his estranged wife’s mother, stepfather, and son in Louisiana. After firing his appointed counsel, McCoy hired Larry English.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.567" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.567" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span> As the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> reported, “Mr. McCoy’s parents had paid Mr. English $5,000 to defend their son. They had borrowed the money, using their car as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" class="pagebreak" title="236">236</span>collateral.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.568" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.568" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span> The trial court informed McCoy that English was not certified to try death penalty cases, but McCoy asserted he wished to proceed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.569" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.569" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Evidence of McCoy’s guilt was strong; so strong, in fact, that English determined the only way to save McCoy from the death penalty was to concede that McCoy had committed the killings in the trial’s guilt phase and then argue for second-degree murder by reason of mental incapacity during the sentencing phase (a charge that did not carry the death penalty).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.570" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.570" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">114</a></span> The evidence against McCoy included: McCoy’s prior threats to kill his wife, who was under police protection, and a taped 911 call in which a victim, McCoy’s mother-in-law, could be heard yelling, “She ain’t here, Robert . . . . I don’t know where she is,” right before a gunshot was fired. In McCoy’s car, the police found a receipt for the ammunition used in the killings, as well as the phone used by the mother-in-law in the 911 call. McCoy had also been caught on video buying that ammunition on the day of the crime and two witnesses stated that McCoy had admitted to the killings after the fact. On top of all this, when McCoy was arrested, the gun used in the killings was under the seat of his car. Despite this mountain of evidence, McCoy insisted that he was out of town on the night of the murders and that he was framed by the police because he knew they were involved in a drug trafficking conspiracy—an alibi Justice Ginsburg, in her majority opinion, called “difficult to fathom.” <a id="dabmci_d5e81bc4b4b24971b3027f3a9d32e352" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />138 S. Ct. at 1507.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The <span style="font-style: italic;">McCoy</span> facts were even more dramatic that those in <a id="dabmci_d315690d14fc4047b1b70b8956d9d985" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Florida v. Nixon</span>, 543 U.S. 175, 178 (2004), where defense counsel had proceeded at trial without Nixon’s participation—but Nixon himself, after having been informed of defense counsel’s strategy of conceding guilt, had neither consented nor objected. In contrast, <a id="dabmci_94a22ac3e829430e8d6dcb3b3edf5ced" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />McCoy not only strenuously objected when he learned of English’s plan, but asserted vigorous objections during the trial itself. Two weeks before trial, when English first announced his intent to concede that McCoy committed the triple murder, McCoy furiously instructed English “not to make that concession” and English was thus fully aware of McCoy’s “complet[e] oppos[ition]” to that strategy. <a id="dabmci_dc8d1171effb483d81bd8bae165e3255" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1506. Nonetheless, during his opening statement to the jury, English asserted there was “no way reasonably possible” that after listening to the evidence the jurors could arrive at “any other conclusion than Robert McCoy was the cause of these individuals’ death.” <a id="dabmci_9f47430a758b4f24a29729cf4eaa3434" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. McCoy objected in court to English’s opening statement and then testified at trial to his own innocence, using the frame-up alibi. At closing, English reiterated that “Robert McCoy committed these crimes” and asked for mercy in light of McCoy’s “serious mental and emotional issues.” <a id="dabmci_2d8e8db017814eb6acf9788b33603331" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1507.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">English’s strategy was plausible. He believed that he would undermine his credibility with the jury during the sentencing phase by insisting on McCoy’s innocence during the guilt phase, doubly so because of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page237" class="pagebreak" title="237">237</span>bizarreness of McCoy’s “alibi.” Many would agree that conceding guilt to spare a defendant’s life is a reasonable strategy under some circumstances. However, the issue here was whether English could pursue a reasonable strategy over his client’s explicit objections. In the end, English’s strategy failed: McCoy was convicted on all counts and sentenced to death. On appeal, McCoy argued for a new trial on the ground that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by permitting English to concede guilt. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Justice Ginsburg, writing for a 6–3 majority, agreed with McCoy, holding that by permitting his lawyer to concede guilt over his objection, the trial court had violated McCoy’s fundamental right to “assistance of counsel” under the Sixth Amendment. As the Court put it, protecting client autonomy is core to the Sixth Amendment’s protection: “Autonomy to decide that the objective of the defense is to assert innocence” is a decision reserved to the client, just like the decision “whether to plead guilty, waive the right to a jury trial, testify in one’s own behalf, and forgo an appeal.”<span class="FootnoteReference"> </span><a id="dabmci_ec6e2e1552ce445abd6ab57c72d7252b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1508. By allowing English to override McCoy’s autonomy, the trial court committed a “structural” error requiring reversal; because the case was not about “ineffective assistance of counsel,” it was not subject to harmless error review. <a id="dabmci_96cc3fe5c5d3427099514b2e95776d3e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1511. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Distinguishing <span style="font-style: italic;">Nixon</span>, the Court stated that “Nixon’s attorney did not negate Nixon’s autonomy by overriding Nixon’s desired defense objective, for Nixon never asserted any such objective.” <a id="dabmci_61baccda79644e11b3e21fa9cebba9f2" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1509.

Whiteside</span>, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), in which defense counsel admonished the defendant that he would reveal the defendant’s avowed intent to commit perjury by presenting an alibi that counsel knew for a fact to be false. The Court found “[t]here was no such avowed perjury here” since “English harbored no doubt that McCoy believed what he was saying; English simply disbelieved McCoy’s account in view of the prosecution’s evidence.” <a id="dabmci_9230dd59012c469f9e931bb12f02e058" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1510. English therefore faced no ethical conflict under Rule 1.2(d)’s proscription against assisting a client in a crime or fraud.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In the end, the Court’s majority expressed sympathy for English, but held firm to the idea that the decision to concede guilt was unambiguously for the client to make:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Larry English was placed in a difficult position; he had an unruly client and faced a strong government case. He reasonably thought the objective of his representation should be avoidance of the death penalty. But McCoy insistently maintained: “I did not murder my family.” Once he communicated that to court and counsel, strenuously objecting to English’s proposed strategy, a concession of guilty should have been off the table. The trial court’s allowance of English’s admission of McCoy’s guilt despite McCoy’s insistent objections was incompatible with the Sixth Amendment.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush"><a id="dabmci_f97730b709464753b08cc5b7058c8bde" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 1512.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, disagreed. They argued that English never actually conceded <span style="font-style: italic;">guilt</span> to the charged crime of first-degree murder, but rather “faced with overwhelming evidence that petitioner shot and killed the three victims, English admitted that petitioner <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" class="pagebreak" title="238">238</span>committed one element of that offense, <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>., that he killed the victims.” In this view, English conceded the <span style="font-style: italic;">fact</span> of the killings, while still arguing McCoy lacked the <span style="font-style: italic;">intent</span> required for first-degree murder. “So the Court’s newly discovered fundamental right simply does not apply to the real facts of this case.” <a id="dabmci_b031e6e9319c409e8fa297cb2a1c0b41" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you agree with the dissent’s distinction between conceding the fact of the killings and conceding legal guilt? Assuming the distinction holds, does it follow that the lawyer should be permitted to concede such a fundamentally important fact over the client’s objection? How would you square the <span style="font-style: italic;">McCoy</span> majority’s assertion that the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant’s autonomy in deciding that “the objective of the defense is to assert innocence” with the deference given to Kaczynski’s lawyers in presenting the insanity defense over Kaczynski’s objection?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">11.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If McCoy truly believed that his prosecution was a bizarre government conspiracy, should English have treated him as a client with diminished capacity under Rule 1.14?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">When representing juveniles, two paradigms are most common. The first is what might be called an “amicus curiae” approach. Assuming a highly paternalistic posture, lawyers adopting this approach attempt to determine the juvenile client’s best interest and advocate that interest in legal proceedings. The alternative is the conventional advocacy approach. Endorsed by the ABA Juvenile Justice Standards and other children’s rights groups, this approach defers to the client’s own preferences unless the client is impaired (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> lacks “capacity to direct the representation”).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.571" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.571" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The two paradigms’ differences are most apparent in those instances when lawyers’ efforts at persuasion fail. When this happens, the amicus curiae approach attempts to accommodate concerns of both autonomy and protection by presenting <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> information to the decision-maker, including the client’s preferences and the lawyer’s assessments, and, from there, the lawyer acts as an intermediary between the client and the legal system.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.572" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.572" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The approach is justified by the notion that the distinctive features of childhood and adolescence militate in favor of more hard-edged paternalism. Compared with adults, adolescents tend to be more subject to peer influence, more likely to engage in risky behavior, and more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page239" class="pagebreak" title="239">239</span>inclined to overvalue short-term concerns and undervalue long-term consequences.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.573" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.573" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span> They may also lack sufficient experience to understand the full implications of certain choices.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics point out, however, that in trying to have it both ways, the “amicus curiae” strategy risks compromising both concerns. An attorney who reports the juvenile’s desires but then proceeds to undermine them by disclosing further, often confidential, information has hardly respected individual dignity and autonomy. Yet an attorney who fails to make such disclosures or who attempts to present all facts neutrally may be unable to provide the guidance that an overburdened and understaffed court requires. Further, critics ask: Why should attorneys be involved in a case if they function just like a judge or a social worker? What in lawyers’ training equips them to determine children’s best interests and what oversight structures are available if they are wrong? If lawyers function as de facto guardians, who will voice the concerns of the client as the client perceives them? After all, it is the client who will have to live with the consequences.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.574" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.574" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">118</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Alternatively, when lawyers’ efforts at persuasion fail, those who endorse the conventional advocacy role believe that, once minors reach a certain age or demonstrate what the ABA Standards refer to as “considered judgment,” <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> decisions should control. Advocates of this approach believe that lawyers’ fundamental responsibility is to present—and advocate for—the child’s perspective. At the foundation of this approach is the Supreme Court’s decision in <span style="font-style: italic;" class="Hyperlink">In re </span><a id="dabmci_1478bbaeac1043c4b89c007a4d59abe3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;" class="Hyperlink">Gault</span><span class="Hyperlink">, 387 U.S. 1 (1967)</span>, which found that juvenile hearings must meet basic due process standards of adult trials, including the right to counsel. Proponents of the conventional advocacy role for lawyers representing juveniles argue that anything less would violate the principles <span style="font-style: italic;">Gault</span> establishes, even though <span style="font-style: italic;">Gault</span> specifically concerns only criminal cases, not the full range of cases involving juveniles.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.575" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.575" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">119</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This approach has several benefits. Avoiding pitfalls of paternalism, it obviously gives priority to individual dignity and autonomy. It is reasonable, as there is little evidence of systematic differences in older minors’ and adults’ reasoning ability or decisionmaking capacity—and lawyers representing adults do not equate competence with an ability to weigh accurately <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the costs and benefits of available options.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.576" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.576" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span> It takes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page240" class="pagebreak" title="240">240</span>account of institutional limits and competencies, as little in the history of juvenile and family courts suggest that even well-intentioned experts are reliably and objectively able to determine children’s “best interest.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.577" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.577" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span> And finally, as Martin Guggenheim notes, it seems “both inconsistent and unfair to treat the child as a morally responsible actor who must suffer the legal consequences of his own . . . acts and yet, at the same time, deny that he is autonomous enough to be capable or entitled to instruct counsel.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.578" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.578" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> Yet, this approach is also, of course, susceptible to criticism as it might make lawyers complicit in advocating for objectively bad outcomes.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In recognition of these difficulties, some commentators have advocated a hybrid, more contextual approach. Seeking a middle path, this framework recognizes that age is not an adequate proxy for competence, and that a minor who is able to make considered decisions in some circumstances may be unable to do so in others. Under this approach, an attorney should focus on factors such as the risks of a “wrong” decision and the minor’s age, mental capacity, psychological stability, strength of preferences, and ability to make rational, consistent judgments without undue influence by others.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.579" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.579" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861342" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218906" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756322" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908454" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 3</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The mother and step-father of a fifteen-year-old girl have retained you to defend their daughter on charges of vandalism and burglary. She comes from a troubled home and has a history of drug abuse. If she is willing to identify the other participant in the crime, the prosecutor will allow her to plead guilty to vandalism and will support her placement in a local halfway house with an excellent therapeutic counseling program. If she refuses, you believe that it might still be possible, on the eve of trial, to talk the prosecutor into a diversion program. Under that program, all charges will be dropped if your client successfully completes two years of probation, including participation in a youth-center counseling program. If your client fails to complete the program, the prosecutor can reinstate both charges and proceed against her as an adult felony offender. A third option is you could take the case to trial in juvenile court. There, you estimate that the chances of acquittal are about 40 percent. A conviction would probably result in a sentence of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page241" class="pagebreak" title="241">241</span>anywhere from six to eighteen months at the state’s correctional facility, an outcome that is likely to compound your client’s problems.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You believe that the halfway house (the first option) is by far the best option. Given your client’s current attitudes and closest friends, you doubt that she could manage to stay out of trouble for a two-year probation term. Since failure to complete that term might well result in a felony record, you believe that diversion (the second option) is not a particularly desirable strategy.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Your client’s parents agree. They would like their daughter to live in the halfway house, since it would provide the supervision that they are finding difficult and unpleasant to impose. But after preliminary conversations, your client appears adamantly opposed to the idea. She is unwilling to identify her accomplice, who appears responsible for supplying her occasional drug habit. She also appears more concerned about losing the ability to stay out late with friends if she moves to the halfway house than about the possibility of acquiring a felony record. She is frightened by the prospect of the state correctional facility, but has an unrealistic faith that she could talk her way out of a conviction if the case goes to trial.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">How should you proceed? Should you raise the possibility of a diversion program if the prosecutor does not propose it? If the prosecutor mentions the possibility but does not make a formal offer, must you present that option to your client?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The facts are the same as in Part (a) except that the parents now oppose the halfway house. The stepfather is convinced that the daughter does not need therapy; she just has a “bad attitude” and needs more discipline. The mother, who is deeply religious, thinks that greater involvement in their local church is the answer. She has already enlisted the minister to talk with her daughter about part-time work and participation in the church choir and youth group. Your client agrees, but you suspect that she is simply doing whatever is necessary to avoid the halfway house. What should you do?<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.580" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.580" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The facts are the same as in Part (a), except that your client, after obtaining assurances of confidentiality, tells you that her stepfather has sexually abused her and that her mother refuses to believe it. The daughter doesn’t want to “destroy the family” by reporting the abuse and believes that she has the situation under control by locking her door and managing not to be in the house alone with her stepfather. Your state has laws requiring health professionals, but not lawyers, to report any suspicion of child abuse. How do you proceed?</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Given the facts of Problem 3(a), would it be justifiable to omit mentioning the diversion program?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In addressing the issues in Problem 3(c), what information would you need about abuse victims in general, or about this family situation in particular, before you decide how to proceed?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Consider the ABA’s Standards of Practice for Lawyers Who Represent Children in Abuse and Neglect Cases (1996).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.581" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.581" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span> Standard B-4 provides that the attorney generally should “respect the child’s expressed preference and follow the child’s directions throughout the course of litigation.” However, Standard B-4(3) adds:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">If the child’s attorney determines that the child’s expressed preference would be seriously injurious to the child (as opposed to merely being contrary to the lawyer’s opinion of what would be in the child’s interest), the lawyer may request appointment of a separate guardian ad litem and continue to represent the child’s expressed preference. . . . The child’s attorney shall not reveal the basis of the request for appointment of a guardian ad litem which would compromise the client’s position.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The Comment notes that one of the “most difficult ethical issues for lawyers representing children occurs when the child is able to express a position . . . that could result in serious injury.” This is particularly likely when the child desires to “live in a dangerous situation because it is all he or she knows, because of a feeling of blame or of responsibility to take care of the parents, or because of threats. The child may choose to deal with a known situation rather than risk the unknown world of a foster home or other out-of-home placement.” In most cases, the Comment suggests that this dilemma can be resolved by effective counseling. However, if the child “cannot be persuaded [to abandon a dangerous position], the attorney has a duty to safeguard the child’s interests by requesting appointment of a guardian ad litem, who will be charged with advocating the child’s best interest.” Yet as the Comment also acknowledges, “as a practical matter, this may not adequately protect the child if the danger to the child was revealed only in a confidential disclosure to the lawyer because the guardian ad litem may never learn of the disclosed danger.”</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Does this Standard provide appropriate guidance on the facts of Problem 3(c)? If not, what would you propose?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The dilemma posed in Problem 3 is not only difficult, it may also be personally wrenching for the lawyer. The following is excerpted from a case report written by a third-year law student working in the clinic of an urban law school. The report helps to underscore potential issues with the “conventional advocacy” approach, described above:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">A child can’t sue, a child can’t enter into a contract, a child isn’t considered able to consent to sex, but yet, for the purpose of legal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page243" class="pagebreak" title="243">243</span>ethics, a lawyer must treat a child just like an adult client: she must advocate for the child’s stated interests, no matter how obvious it is to her that the stated interests are not in the best interests of the child.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Monday I picked up the case of A.B. She is a thirteen year old girl who was arrested for Theft II. She apparently had no prior record (later I discovered she had a shoplifting record in [another state]). When I saw her in the cellblock, the first thing that struck me was the way she was dressed—like a prostitute. I expected her to be scared, upset . . . instead she laughed at nearly everything. She told me she had only missed two days of school this year and that she participates in track, choir, and cheerleading! Nearly everything she said was a lie, but it was amazing how quickly she would think of such things and how easily they would roll off her tongue, with such conviction (she could be president someday). . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">When I went into the hallway to interview her parents, they informed me that they refused to have her released to them.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Parents: She constantly runs away, spends all of her time on the streets with twenty-one year olds (the age of some first year law students), never goes to school, does drugs, is completely out of control.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The parents are not married or [living] together but they both showed up in court together and stood firm in their decision. It was clear that they believed that this girl desperately needs help and that getting it through the system was in A.B.’s best interests. I thought they were well-meaning but misguided at the time.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The government hadn’t been looking to detain her but when they found out the parents didn’t want her released the intake worker and prosecutor both recommended that she be placed in a shelter home until trial. The government did not file a petition (formal charge) and the statute says filing of petition may be delayed for 5 days upon good cause shown. The prosecutor’s showing of good cause consisted of an assertion that they haven’t been able to contact the Complainant. The judge denied my motion to dismiss the case for lack of good cause for the five-day hold. The probable cause hearing consisted of the arresting officer testifying as follows: The Complainant called him and said that she had given A.B. $100 to hold for her in her bag. When she asked for it back the next day, A.B. wouldn’t give it to her. A.B. was then arrested and there was no money in her bag. I only asked three questions on cross because it was so obvious to me that they hadn’t established probable cause that I didn’t want to mess it up. The government apparently had no information about the Complainant (thus the request for a five day hold in filing the petition). It was just a hearsay account of an anonymous Complainant with no evidence as to why this mystery person (that the government did not know enough about to even contact) should be believed. If she had called <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page244" class="pagebreak" title="244">244</span>and said I took her money would there be probable cause to hold me for theft? The judge found probable cause.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.9pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Then the detention argument. Pretrial detention is for kids who are a danger to themselves or others or unlikely to show up at their hearing otherwise. The ONLY reason they were looking to detain her (as conceded by the prosecutor) was that the parents didn’t want her back. She was ordered into a shelter home. She was crying her eyes out as she heard in open court that her parents did not want her back. Afterwards I went back to the cellblock to talk to her and she was not laughing or smiling anymore. “I have no parents,” she said with tears streaming down her face. I felt really bad for her at the time although in the back of my mind I knew that the parents were doing what is best for her and I was arguing for something not in her best interest: for her to be put back on the street with her twenty-one year old boyfriends, drugs, etc. rather than getting help that she desperately needs.</p>

Today the prosecutor called and said the government has decided to drop the case. Though I don’t know why, it is probably because they couldn’t contact the complaining witness. The motion may have helped. Tomorrow she is to be released. The question is: released to whom? Social services contacted her aunt and secured a promise that the aunt would take her if the parents won’t.</p>

The mother still refuses to take her. She asked me what was the point of this whole thing if she is just going to be released. She asked what she is supposed to do when she has tried counseling and tried having her live with family members and A.B. is just completely out of control and nobody will see that she needs help. She asked why the law doesn’t protect her right as a parent who tries hard and cares about her child, but gives lawyers and all sorts of rights to children so they can be released back out onto the street. She asked what kind of a threat she can use on A.B. now that “they’ll lock your ass up if you commit a crime” has been proven idle. She said she refuses to take A.B. back if that’s what it takes to get somebody to listen to her and get help for A.B. before she gets pregnant, gets AIDS or ends up dead. The mother was very upset but was also respectful to me throughout the conversation and even thanked me for calling her when it was over. She pointed out how the system has failed and pointed out my role in that.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Most of the problems of paternalism we have examined in this chapter involved clients who are less competent, mature, well-educated, or well-off than their lawyers. This is scarcely surprising, because opportunities for paternalism arise only when lawyers believe they know better than their clients and have the power to put that belief into practice. Lawyers are less likely to have the confidence or the opportunity to second-guess wealthy, powerful, or sophisticated clients. Yet these clients also can have bad judgment or selective blind-spots. It frequently happens that the more canny the clients, the more difficult it is to dissuade them from mistakes because “[c]lients who’ve spent a lifetime outsmarting their opponents always think they know more about being a lawyer than their lawyer.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.582" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.582" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span> In the words of one Washington, D.C. white-collar defender, a powerful client who “has been in charge of his own life . . . is not used to releasing control” to his lawyer.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.583" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.583" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span> If the lawyer is to do the job successfully, it will often be necessary to manipulate or “manage” the client for his own good—and that raises the problem of paternalism.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Under what circumstances might paternalism be proper for lawyers representing clients with no “disability” other than bad judgment? Consider the ABA Section on Litigation’s Ethical Guidelines for Settlement Negotiations (2002).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.584" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.584" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> Standard 3.2.4 provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lawyer should provide a client with a professional assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of a proposed settlement, so that the client can make a fully-informed decision about settlement. Any effort to assist the client in reaching a decision should avoid interference with the client’s ultimate decisionmaking authority.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The Committee Notes on that Standard add:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The lawyer’s role in connection with settlement negotiations is one of advisor to and agent of the client. The lawyer should adhere to that relationship even when the lawyer’s judgment or experience leads the lawyer to believe that the lawyer more fully appreciates the wisdom of a proposed course of action than the client does. While a lawyer can and often should vigorously advise the client of the lawyer’s views respecting proposed settlement strategies and terms, that advice should not override or intrude into the client’s ultimate decisionmaking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" class="pagebreak" title="246">246</span>authority. . . . A lawyer should not threaten to take actions that may . . . induce the client’s assent to the lawyer’s position respecting a proposed settlement. Efforts to persuade should be pursued with attention to ensuring that ultimate decisionmaking power remains with the client.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Does that standard strike the appropriate balance for cases like those presented in Problem 4 below? What if a client’s foolish decisions could have disastrous effects on other corporate stakeholders, such as employees and investors, as well as the client’s reputation in the business community?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861345" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218909" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756325" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908457" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 4</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are an experienced white-collar defense attorney representing Buckley, a nationally-renowned securities broker who has been charged with insider trading and mail fraud. You have negotiated a plea agreement with the prosecution that would involve a large but not catastrophic fine, less than a year in jail, and a lifetime ban from securities trading, in return for assistance in the prosecution of others in the securities industry. In your view, the agreement is an excellent one for Buckley, who otherwise faces years in prison. Buckley, however, is convinced that he will be acquitted at trial. In his opinion, the prosecution’s case is not strong and the prosecutor is not smart. He is also convinced that the same charm and charisma that have advanced him for his entire career are sure to win over the jury.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">That is not how you see the case. You know that the prosecution’s evidence is very strong, and your trial experience convinces you that Buckley will come across to jurors as glib, arrogant, and unlikable. Buckley strikes you as a man who has beaten the system so often that he has persuaded himself the system can always be beaten, but there is little doubt in your mind that he will be convicted. You have repeatedly explained your assessment of the case, discreetly at first, then quite bluntly. Buckley’s response has invariably been the same: “I’ve made a hundred million dollars selling myself to the hardest guys on Wall Street, and no lawyer is going to tell me that I can’t sell myself to a jury.” He has threatened to fire you. You have considered quitting.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You are now contemplating alternative strategies. One is to propose that Buckley give a “dress rehearsal” of his testimony before a jury composed of secretaries and paralegals from your firm; one of your partners would do the direct examination and you would do the cross. Afterwards, the mock jurors would give Buckley their candid opinion of his performance. You would select jurors likely to agree with your assessment of the case. Another possibility is to enlist Buckley’s wife to place pressure on him to accept the plea.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Assume also that you have just received information that will enable you to discredit one of the prosecution’s witnesses. In your view, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page247" class="pagebreak" title="247">247</span>the prosecution’s case will remain strong enough to convict Buckley. You are convinced, however, that if you inform Buckley about the new information, his resolve to reject the plea agreement will be even greater. You plan not to tell him about the information.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Would any of these strategies be proper? Can or should you withdraw if Buckley insists on going to trial?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You represent a powerful client who is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Prosecutors from the DOJ have asked to interview your client in connection with possible obstruction of justice charges. He wants to be interviewed. In his view, asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination will seriously damage his reputation, and he believes that he has nothing to hide. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You worry that even if he has not engaged in obstruction, there is a real possibility that he will perjure himself during an interview, which will be conducted under oath. That concern is confirmed in a rehearsal of his possible testimony. Your client lost his temper, began ranting, and made what you believe are demonstrably false statements. You remind your client that in a deposition in earlier litigation, he had similar difficulty staying focused and avoiding perjury. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When he tells you that this interview will be different and he is confident of his ability, you consider saying: “Your prior experiences suggest that you have trouble staying on the subject. And that can defeat you. If you misstate something, then you could be subject to perjury charges. Please don’t testify. It’s either that or an orange jump suit. If you insist on the interview, I can’t represent you.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.585" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.585" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The more difficult issue, however, is: When may or must a <span style="font-style: italic;">lawyer</span> effect an early termination of the lawyer-client relationship through withdrawal? Rule 1.16 provides guidance on this question. The Rule is divided into categories of <span style="font-style: italic;">mandatory</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">permissive</span> withdrawal. Rule 1.16(a) states when withdrawal is mandatory. In addition to the situation in which the client fires the lawyer, withdrawal is mandated when (1) “the representation will result in violation of the rules of professional misconduct or other law,” or (2) when “the lawyer’s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer’s ability to represent the client.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1.16(b) identifies the conditions for permissive withdrawal. It allows a lawyer to withdraw if:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer’s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client has used the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client insists upon taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(5)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer’s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(6)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(7)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Note that, while a lawyer would be <span style="font-style: italic;">required</span> to withdraw under 1.16(a)(1) if she <span style="font-style: italic;">knows</span> that the client is committing (or plans to commit) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page249" class="pagebreak" title="249">249</span>a crime or fraud, the lawyer is <span style="font-style: italic;">permitted</span> to withdraw under 1.16(b)(2) if she has only a <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonable belief</span> of the client’s criminal or fraudulent conduct. Relatedly, if the lawyer knows that the client plans to commit a crime or fraud in the future, or is in the process of committing an ongoing crime or fraud in the present, withdrawal is mandatory. However, if the lawyer’s services have been used by the client to commit a <span style="font-style: italic;">past</span> crime or fraud (and there is no reason to believe it will recur), then withdrawal is at the lawyer’s discretion.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As Rule 1.16(b)(4)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(b)(4)&quot; \s &quot;1.16(b)(4)&quot; \c 16 " /> indicates, a lawyer may withdraw, even if doing so will have an adverse effect on the client, when the lawyer considers the client’s action “repugnant” or fundamentally disagrees with it. Sections (5)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(b)(5)&quot; \s &quot;(5)&quot; \c 16 " /> and (6)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(b)(6)&quot; \s &quot;(6)&quot; \c 16 " /> are designed to protect the lawyer from clients who do not uphold their obligations in the representation. As Comment 8 states: “<span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">A lawyer may withdraw if the client refuses to abide by the terms of an agreement relating to the representation, such as an agreement concerning fees or court costs or an agreement limiting the objectives of the representation.” Withdrawal based on nonpayment may only be accomplished after the client has been given “reasonable warning.” In addition, a lawyer may withdraw under section 1.16(b)(6) if the client’s actions make representation “unreasonably difficult,” such as when the client does not respond to reasonable requests for information or communication.</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">In litigation, it is usually the case that withdrawal requires court permission. Rule 1.16(c)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(c)&quot; \s &quot;1.16(c)&quot; \c 16 " /></span>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> thus recognizes:</span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">

      </p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Then, if withdrawal </span>

        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> come to the fore. Rule 1.16(d) provides:</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client’s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Termination of the lawyer-client relationship does </span>
        <span style="font-style: italic; background-color: #FFFFFF;">not</span>

        </span>
        <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"> This means both that the lawyer is bound not to disclose former client confidences and, even in the absence of disclosure, may not use “information relating </span>

Home Medical of America, Inc.</span>, the court set forth a typology of representation categories bearing on this issue: “(1) the law firm may be retained as general counsel to the client, handling all legal matters that may arise for a client, (2) the law firm may be retained to represent the client in all matters that may arise regarding a specific area of practice, such as litigation, tax, or employment matters, or (3) the law firm may be retained to represent the client only as to a specific matter or matters.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.593" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.593" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">137</a></span> The court stated that, as to the first two categories, representation was presumed to be ongoing even if there were no pending matters “because the reasonable expectation remains that the law firm will handle matters in the future for that client as they arise.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.594" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.594" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">138</a></span> As to category (3), the reasonable assumption is that the representation ends “when the matter is concluded.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.595" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.595" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">139</a></span> Confusion may arise, however, as to which category a lawyer is in if there has not been a clear agreement at the outset. And the consequences are significant: If the client’s belief of ongoing representation is reasonable, it would mean that the lawyer continued to hold duties to the client and could not, for instance, take on an adverse client without the original client’s consent. Because of this, lawyers are counseled to make the nature of representation (ongoing versus discrete) explicit in the retainer and, if the lawyer believes the representation has ended, to indicate that fact in a termination letter to the client.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.596" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.596" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">140</a></span></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When would a lawyer be justified in withholding documents from a former client? The <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> says that originals and copies relating to the representation must be turned over absent “substantial grounds” for nondelivery. But what grounds qualify as “substantial”? Comment c to <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> <a id="dabmci_1d0b8a375bfc4a5db2806f250b1c785e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 46 states that a “lawyer may refuse to disclose to the client certain law firm documents reasonably intended only for internal review, such as a memorandum discussing which lawyers in the firm should be assigned to a case, whether a lawyer must withdraw because of the client’s misconduct, or the firm’s possible malpractice liability to the client. The need for lawyers to be able to set down their thoughts privately in order to assure effective and appropriate representation warrants keeping such documents secret from the client involved.” How far should this extend? Can a lawyer retain preliminary drafts and legal research memoranda? What about internal memoranda that contain factual information from client interviews as well as the lawyer’s own impressions of the client’s credibility and personality? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">What should the lawyer do with client documents when the client has not yet fully paid the lawyer’s fee? Is it appropriate for the lawyer to place a lien on client documents, withholding them in an action to recover the lawyer’s fee? Rule 1.8(i) permits a lawyer to “acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer’s fee or expenses,” and most state bars have upheld the practice in the absence of prejudice to the client: for example, requiring a lawyer to turn over documents with evidentiary value in pending litigation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.597" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.597" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Consider the following case from a law school clinic. Student lawyers have prepared an affidavit for a client to file in a civil matter. Before filing, however, they discover that the client has been lying to them, and the facts attested to in the affidavit are untrue. The students withdraw from the case. The client asks them for the affidavit. It seems plausible that he intends to file it <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> or to ask his successor counsel to file it. The client insists that is not his intention, and the students do not <span style="font-style: italic;">know </span>that it is. Should they refuse to give the affidavit to their now-former client?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As discussed above, when a client is engaging in conduct that the lawyer fears is illegal, whether the lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> withdraw as a mandatory matter or simply <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> withdraw as a permissive matter hinges on the lawyer’s degree of certainty about the illegality. Under Rule 1.16(a)’s mandatory withdrawal requirement, the lawyer must withdraw if “the representation <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law”? This is an actual knowledge standard: The lawyer must know with certainty that the client’s actions will be illegal or violate the ethics rules, and knowledge may be inferred from the circumstances. Comment 2 to Rule 1.16 states that a lawyer must withdraw “if the client demands that the lawyer engage in conduct that is illegal” but is “not obliged to . . . withdraw simply because the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page252" class="pagebreak" title="252">252</span>client suggests such a course of conduct.” Conversely, withdrawal is merely permissive if the client “persists in a course of action involving the lawyer’s services that the lawyer <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonably believes</span> is criminal or fraudulent.” When does the level of knowledge tip from a “reasonable belief” to “actual knowledge”? Consider the lawyer for a criminal defendant accused of murder, who insists on testifying that at the time the victim was killed, the defendant was at a party at his girlfriend’s house. The lawyer interviews the girlfriend, who the lawyer finds to be evasive and unreliable. The lawyer then conducts a thorough investigation, contacting everyone who the client named as attending the party, but no one can corroborate the client’s alibi and, in fact, some of those named were out of town during the relevant period. It is illegal for the client to take the stand and testify falsely. If the client insists on testifying about the alibi, must the lawyer withdraw under these circumstances? Consider this question when you read the materials on perjury in Chapter 8. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When would withdrawal not impose a “material adverse effect on the interests of the client” and thus be permitted under Rule 1.16(b)(1)? In most cases, once the client has selected and begun working with counsel, there will be some tangible cost to the client if the lawyer withdraws: The client will have to go through the time and effort of finding another lawyer, transferring over relevant documents and other information, and getting the new lawyer up to speed. It is possible that the new lawyer may not have all the expertise and skill as the original lawyer and thus the client may feel shortchanged. At what point these costs amount to a “material adverse effect” is murky; materiality falls along a spectrum. Obviously, if a lawyer were to seek to withdraw on the eve of trial, that would cause massive adverse impacts on the client and could not be justified under (b)(1). On the other end, a lawyer may reasonably withdraw if the representation was only recently undertaken, and there are no important pending deadlines. Whether the lawyer can withdraw without material adverse effect further along in the representation will be fact-dependent. In this regard, the lawyer should consider whether the client will be able to find another lawyer of adequate quality; whether there is sufficient time for the new lawyer to learn the case and effectively represent the client’s interests; and whether the client will be forced to incur excessive costs in transferring the case. Remember, even if the lawyer cannot permissively withdraw under (b)(1), she may be able to do so under Rule 1.16’s other provisions. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What constitutes a “fundamental disagreement” between lawyer and client justifying permissive withdrawal under 1.16(b)(4)? In <span style="font-style: italic;">Njema v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>, the court permitted a lawyer’s motion to withdraw after the client had filed civil contempt charges against the lawyer for refusing to file various motions in the case, including a stay pending interlocutory appeal, a motion for judgment as a matter of law, and an amended complaint in client’s action against Wells Fargo to resist foreclosure.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.598" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.598" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">142</a></span> The lawyer claimed he refused to file the motions because they were either strategically unwise or legally unsupportable. Based on the contempt charges, the court held that there had “been an irreconcilable breakdown in the relationship <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" class="pagebreak" title="253">253</span>between [client and lawyer], and the trust . . . has been destroyed” such that the representation could not continue.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.599" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.599" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">143</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 1.16(b)(5)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(b)(5)&quot; \s &quot;1.16(b)(5)&quot; \c 16 " /> states that it is appropriate for a lawyer to withdraw if “the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer’s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled.” When is it appropriate for a lawyer to withdraw over a client’s failure to pay the lawyer’s fee? The answer depends, in part, on the reason for the client’s failure to pay. If the client cannot pay because he simply lacks the funds, then it is may be appropriate for the lawyer to work with the client to reduce the fee or even write the fee off if the client is indigent and the representation can be conducted pro bono. If, however, the client has the money to pay but is withholding it out of dissatisfaction with the lawyer’s services or billing practice, then the lawyer may consider withdrawal under the rule, although it is recommended that the lawyer first seek to resolve any disagreement over fees before seeking withdrawal as a last resort.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Rule 1.16(b)(6)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.16(b)(6)&quot; \s &quot;1.16(b)(6)&quot; \c 16 " /> permits withdraw if the representation “will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer.” How much responsibility should the lawyer have to consider financial burden at the outset of the representation? For instance, in a contingency fee case, if the lawyer knows or should know at the beginning of a lawsuit that it will be expensive to litigate and the claims are nonfrivolous but relatively weak, should that lawyer be permitted to withdraw once it becomes clear that loss is inevitable? What if the lawyer reasonably believed at the outset that the case was strong, but discovery revealed significant holes in the client’s case that made it unlikely the lawyer would ultimately recover any fee? Consider this issue in relation to Problem 6 below.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How much information must a lawyer give the court when asking for permission to withdraw under 1.16(c)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1.16(c)&quot; " />? On the one hand, the lawyer owes a duty of confidentiality to the client that must not be breached in the process of withdrawal. On the other hand, the lawyer must give the court enough information for the court to determine whether withdrawal should be permitted, particularly when withdrawal would have an adverse effect on a client’s interests. The State Bar of California took up this issue in Formal Opinion Number 2015–192, based on the following situation: A lawyer represents a corporation that is prosecuting a trade secret misappropriation case against a former employee who left to work for the Client corporation’s primary competitor. When the lawyer comes across information showing that the claim against the employee is bogus, she attempts to persuade the Client’s CEO to dismiss the claim. When the CEO refuses, stating that “he does not really care about winning or losing the lawsuit, but that he merely wants to keep the lawsuit going in order to damage Competitor’s public image,” the lawyer seeks to effectuate a mandatory withdraw (since it would violate the Rules to continue advancing a frivolous lawsuit).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.600" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.600" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">144</a></span> However, when the lawyer asks the court for permission to withdraw, the judge <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page254" class="pagebreak" title="254">254</span>“concerned about potential prejudice to the Client,” orders the lawyer to provide “a detailed declaration, filed under seal, about what your client said to you that makes you think you need to withdraw.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.601" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.601" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">145</a></span> Noting the conflict between the lawyer’s duty of confidentiality to the Client and the lawyer’s duty to obey the court order, the California Bar stated that, while the lawyer “may be able to tell the court some of the circumstances leading to her request to withdraw,” she “must not cross the line and disclose confidential client information—here, for instance, CEO’s statements about his reasons for wanting to continue the litigation or any facts about the representation that would tend to portray Client in a poor light.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.602" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.602" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">146</a></span> Recognizing the lawyer’s dilemma in not wanting to be held in contempt of court, the Bar stated that “we believe Attorney has a duty to take all reasonable steps to avoid the dilemma—either by obtaining Client’s consent to the <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> disclosure or some other compromise measure, or by filing a writ petition with the Court of Appeal challenging the court’s order.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.603" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.603" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">147</a></span> In the event that all of those efforts fail, the Bar had only this to offer: “this Committee cannot categorically opine on how the attorney must choose between her competing duties to maintain the client’s confidences and to obey the court’s order. Whatever the attorney’s decision, however, she must take reasonable steps to minimize the impact of that decision on the client.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.604" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.604" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">148</a></span> Is this helpful advice? Are there any other alternatives? What would you do if you were the lawyer in this situation? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The ABA, in evaluating the ethical propriety of disclosing confidences in a motion to withdraw because of a client’s failure to pay a fee, took a more forceful position. <a id="dabmci_e241d2d6d2c84c09ac8a7f4e7314c8ab" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />In Formal Opinion 476, the ABA stated that a lawyer seeking to withdraw over nonpayment of a fee should first seek to do so based simply on “professional considerations.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.605" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.605" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">149</a></span> If the court presses for more detail, the lawyer is advised to continue “seeking to persuade the court to rule on the motion without requiring the disclosure of confidential client information, asserting all non-frivolous claims of confidentiality and privilege; and if that fails; . . . submit only such information as is reasonably necessary to satisfy the needs of the court and preferably by whatever restricted means of submission, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> review under seal, or such other procedures designated to minimize disclosure as the court determines is appropriate.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.606" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.606" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a></span> If the court insists on more information, the ABA’s position is that it would be permissible for a lawyer to reveal such information under the exception to confidentiality permitting a lawyer to disclose information to comply with a “court order.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.607" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.607" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">151</a></span> The ABA emphasized that this analysis only applies to withdrawal for nonpayment of fees. Why do think it should be so limited? Could the same logic be applied to resolve the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page255" class="pagebreak" title="255">255</span>dilemma analyzed in the California State Bar opinion above? Note that unlike the Model Rules, California’s Rules do not create an exception to confidentiality to allow lawyers to comply with court orders.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">10.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />On what grounds may a court refuse a lawyer’s motion to withdraw? This issue came up in the controversial case over the Trump administration’s effort to include a question about citizenship in the 2020 Census. In 2018, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Jr. announced he would seek inclusion of such a question, raising concerns that immigrants who were either themselves not citizens or had family members who were not citizens would refuse to participate, driving down their representation in the official count and thereby affecting the allocation of congressional seats and federal funding based on Census figures. A number of lawsuits were filed by states, cities, and nonprofit groups to block the citizenship question. Although the administration claimed it was seeking inclusion of the question to get an accurate count of noncitizens to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, it was revealed during the litigation that the main architect of the citizenship question proposed it to the Trump administration as a way to suppress the political power of immigrant communities through redistricting. Even after a loss in the Supreme Court,<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.608" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.608" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">152</a></span> the administration continued to press the issue, sparking further litigation. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In a case pending in the Southern District of New York, the administration sought to swap out eleven career DOJ attorneys who had been working on the case since its inception for other DOJ lawyers—presumably because the new lawyers were willing to continue litigating the Census question. Judge Jesse Furman rejected the motion, stating that the defendants had offered “no reasons” for the substitution of counsel. Judge Furman also expressed frustration with the administration’s claim that it did “not expect that withdrawal of current counsel will cause any disruption in the matter,” stating that mere “expectation” was “not good enough” given that there were significant motions pending and that, if the defendants still desired to add the citizenship question to the 2020 Census, “time would plainly be of the essenc<span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">e.”</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.609" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.609" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">153</a></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> </span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">The order prompted a Trump tweet: “So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?”</span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">11.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Upon termination, aside from protecting client confidences, what other steps must a lawyer to take to “protect a client’s interests” under Rule 1.16(d)? Is a lawyer required to refrain from publicly criticizing a former client? Consider David Boies’s representation of Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul accused of systematic sexual abuse against dozens of women. After generating a firestorm of controversy for how he handled Weinstein’s case (which began in 2015 and included hiring a private firm to dig up opposition research to discredit Weinstein’s accusers), Boies appeared to throw his former client under the bus in an interview with <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker</span>: “Although he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr. Weinstein <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page256" class="pagebreak" title="256">256</span>has himself recognized that his contact with women was indefensible and incredibly hurtful. In retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.610" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section15.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.610" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">154</a></span> Given that civil and criminal charges were still pending against Weinstein, do you think this public statement was appropriate? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You represent two plaintiffs—Lisa and Jim Dolan—in a personal injury case. The case alleges that Bendectin, the drug that the defendant manufactured and sold to alleviate pregnant women’s morning sickness, in fact, caused catastrophic birth defects. Your complaint alleges that Lisa took Bendectin while pregnant to alleviate her nausea, and it caused her to give birth to a child (Jim) with malformed and missing fingers and a missing pectoral muscle. For that, you seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You’ve now been prosecuting the case for three years, and in that time, you’ve accumulated overwhelming evidence of the manufacturer’s negligence. (You can show that the defendant aggressively marketed Bendectin to pregnant mothers with almost no testing to ensure it was safe.) But, despite your best efforts, you’ve found only mixed and contradictory evidence bearing on whether Bendectin is, in fact, a teratogen (an agent that can cause a birth defect). Then, as if that weren’t bad enough, Lisa Dolan has become an increasingly demanding client; she calls you with incessant requests, both day and night. In addition, and maybe worst of all, the case has been extremely expensive to litigate. You took the case on a contingency fee basis; as such, you are responsible for all costs and expenses. Those costs have mounted, and the case has become a major financial drain on you and your law firm. It is starting to feel like a black hole that you pour money into, with no hope of seeing that money again.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Suppose that the defendant manufacturer offers a settlement of $20,000. This sum is tiny compared to Jim’s medical bills, and it is also dwarfed by what you initially hoped to recover—but, given the problems above, you strongly support the offer’s acceptance. You will still be out roughly $150,000 (which you’ve so far spent on scientific and medical experts, deposition costs, medical examinations, and the like), but at least you’ll be done with the ordeal.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite your persistent attempts to persuade her otherwise, however, Lisa Dolan adamantly refuses to accept the settlement offer. She wants her day in court and dreams of holding Bendectin’s manufacturer responsible for the harm she believes Bendectin caused her family.</p>

Under the continuing representation rule, a claim for legal malpractice is tolled if the lawyer continues to represent a client on the specific matter in relation to which malpractice allegedly occurred. Until a lawyer has, in fact, effectuated a full withdraw from the representation, the statute remains tolled. Emails to client representatives indicating an intent to withdraw have been held not to terminate the representation. <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> <a id="dabmci_3ee2768b9a7c4ce687aa8d1705948d79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Paravue Corp. v.
