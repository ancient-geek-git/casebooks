      <p class="TextParagraph">For aspiring lawyers, law school is the essential gateway to legal practice. Yet the role of legal education has long been controversial. There has been a built-in tension between the goal of equipping students with necessary technical skills and the goal of instilling professional values emphasizing the lawyer’s social role. And, as the cost of law school has rapidly increased over the past three decades and the legal market has changed, questions about the practical and social relevance of legal education, whose interests it serves, and how well it advances the public good have become increasingly contested. What should contemporary law schools be teaching students? What role should legal education play in inculcating values of public service and ethical responsibility? How well do law schools fulfill their obligation to promote a diverse profession? This chapter explores the critical role of legal education in producing effective and ethical lawyers, while also promoting professional diversity and access to justice. It is organized around three main themes. Part A discusses the structure of legal education, offering an overview of the historical origins of law school and contemporary issues concerning accreditation and rankings. A key focus is how law schools are run and who they serve. Part B explores the goals, methods, and outcomes of legal education, with attention to how well law school pedagogy prepares students and how law school performance should be assessed. Part C concludes by considering the law school experience for students, highlighting ongoing challenges of promoting diversity and maintaining student health and satisfaction. </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As Chapter 15 on bar admissions indicated, apprenticeship was the dominant system for legal education during the American legal profession’s formative years. Most of the legal education that occurred outside the apprenticeship system centered in a few small for-profit law schools. The most famous of these was the Litchfield Law School in Connecticut. Formally established in 1784, it focused on adapting Blackstone’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Commentaries</span> to American contexts and was influential in the development of the nation’s early legal culture.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2248" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2248" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> These independent schools, and a small number of university counterparts, fared poorly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page986" class="pagebreak" title="986">986</span>during the Jacksonian populist era, when enrollment flagged. In 1840, the nation had only nine university-affiliated law schools with a total of 345 students.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2249" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2249" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The characteristic features of modern legal education did not emerge until after the Civil War—when they came to the fore at Harvard Law School. The development had much to do with the appointment of Charles Eliot to the university’s presidency and Christopher Columbus Langdell to the newly created post of dean of the law school in 1870. Both had great faith in scientific methodology and its application to legal education. Langdell’s case method attempted to derive general principles of law from appellate decisions in the same way that scientists sought to extract rules of nature from biological specimens. Langdell’s goals were to institutionalize the case method and the Socratic style of teaching, and to establish law school as a three-year post-graduate requirement. Although students initially resisted Langdell’s teaching approach and could “see nothing in the system but mental confusion and social humiliation,” it quickly became the dominant model.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2250" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2250" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These initiatives coincided with a period of increased concern about educational standards within the profession and the culture generally. The American Bar Association (ABA), formed in 1870, established a Committee on Legal Education that soon recommended tighter admission standards. One of its first proposals was for states to require attorneys to complete three years of law school. Formed in 1900, the Association of American Law Schools (AALS), soon echoed the ABA’s call. The effort succeeded—and by the turn of the century, there were over 100 university-affiliated law schools, and over the next several decades, more schools opened their doors.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2251" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2251" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span> States soon began accepting law school attendance as a substitute for apprenticeship and such attendance became the dominant method of professional training. As historians have pointed out, part of the impetus for upgrading bar admission requirements was overtly exclusionary: the bar wanted to curtail competition and undercut independent law schools, which catered mostly to first- and second-generation immigrants, many Jewish and Catholic, in order to “purify the stream at its source.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2252" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2252" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This formalization of professional education was not unique to law. And the trend was not without its critics. One of the most prominent was sociologist Thorstein Veblen, who maintained that “vocational” schools like law “belong[ed] in the modern university no more than a school of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page987" class="pagebreak" title="987">987</span>fencing or dancing.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2253" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2253" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span> Other commentators, although sympathetic towards efforts to make professional education more rigorous, were unpersuaded that all forms of legal practice required the same academic preparation. That view was reflected in a celebrated 1921 Report for the Carnegie Foundation, <span style="font-style: italic;">Training for the Public Profession of Law.</span> At the time of the Report’s release, the American bar varied considerably in its educational standards. The author, Alfred Reed, was a nonlawyer who advocated for maintaining that diversity. According to Reed, the profession should recognize the dual nature of legal education and legal practice—<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the need for an elite corps of highly qualified lawyers to serve corporate and governmental clients, and the need for general practitioners, trained in night- and part-time programs accessible to the working classes, to fill more routine legal needs. By institutionalizing this division, through two separate exams for two divisions of lawyers, the profession could accommodate concerns of quality and accessibility. Both the ABA and the AALS flatly rejected that recommendation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Controversies over appropriate requirements for entry to law school and the profession have been one aspect of a broader debate over the structure of legal education. Who should teach what, to whom, for how long, and by what method have all been matters of longstanding dispute. The following discussion focuses on the most important and most contested issues.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" style="line-height: 1em;" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc335223860" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732730" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733652" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369596" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487212" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861775" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219326" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756730" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908864" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Accreditation</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">About four-fifths of states require applicants to graduate from an ABA-accredited law school as well as pass a bar exam in order to gain admission to practice. This gives the ABA enormous power over the form and content of legal education. In exercising this power, the ABA’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar has developed detailed accreditation standards concerning matters such as classroom hours, student-faculty ratios, use of adjunct professors, library resources, and so forth. Once a school has established its compliance with these standards, it is subject to a site visit every seven years to ensure its continued adherence to accreditation requirements. As discussed below, many of the controversies about legal education have centered on the question of whether the ABA’s one-size-fits-all approach to accreditation serves the interest of law students and the broader profession.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2254" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2254" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Not all states have limited admission to graduates from ABA accredited schools. Some have developed their own accreditation systems, and California permits practice by graduates of unaccredited schools who have passed the bar exam (California is one of the few states <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page988" class="pagebreak" title="988">988</span>that also still permit entry by apprenticeship). California’s approach to unaccredited schools has raised a separate set of concerns. Critics claim that many of these schools charge high tuition but fail to deliver quality instruction, and also fail to provide accurate information on high dropout and low bar passage rates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2255" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2255" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite significant dissatisfaction with the current accreditation structure, there is little consensus about how to fix it. Some educators and bar leaders would like to eliminate or substantially curtail accreditation requirements to give institutions more leeway to customize programs in order to match students’ diverse needs and demands. These commentators argue that if accreditation were eliminated or curtailed, institutions could offer a range of specialties and could vary in their reliance on adjuncts and online courses, degree requirements, and in the relative importance they attached to practical skills and legal scholarship. From this perspective, a free market of reasonably well-informed students and legal employers would promote more experimentation, competition, and ultimately a more cost-effective legal education than the current approach.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">By contrast, other lawyers and legal academics question how many students and legal employers would have sufficient knowledge to create a well-functioning free market. Some also fear that, in the absence of strict accreditation standards, law schools might need to reduce costs and quality in order to compete for the applicants who favor a “less is more” approach to legal education, regardless of its impact on the public.<a id="_Ref32942210" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2256" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2256" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, some bar leaders would like to tighten, not loosen, accreditation standards in certain areas. An influential 1992 report by an ABA Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession, <span style="font-style: italic;">Narrowing the Gap</span> (the MacCrate Report), identified ten core skills and four central values necessary for any “well-trained generalist to practice law competently and professionally.” The “Fundamental Lawyering Skills” section of the report describes functions common to nearly all areas of practice: (1) problem solving, (2) legal analysis and reasoning, (3) legal research, (4) factual investigation, (5) communication, (6) counseling, (7) negotiation, (8) litigation and alternative dispute-resolution procedures, (9) organization and management of legal work, and (10) recognition and resolution of ethical dilemmas.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2257" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2257" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> Providing training in all of these areas would require enriching, not shortening, current degree programs. </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page989" class="pagebreak" title="989">989</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Part of what makes consensus in this area so difficult is that legal education has multiple constituencies with competing agendas. Law schools are expected to produce both “Pericles and plumbers”—lawyer-statesmen and routine service providers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2258" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2258" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span> Faculty and students have differing interests, and ones that are not necessarily identical with those of the ultimate consumers—clients and the public.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Consider one example. Periodically, reformers suggest shortening law school from three years to two, which would decrease students’ costs and get them into the workforce more quickly. The downside, obviously, would be that students would graduate having studied less law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the following excerpt, federal judge and law professor Richard Posner argues for “letting the market decide.” If you were the federal official charged with overseeing law school accreditation structures, would you agree with his proposal?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc335223861" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732731" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733653" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369597" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487213" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861776" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219327" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756731" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908865" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Richard A. Posner, “Let Employers Insist If<span> </span>Three Years of Law School Is Necessary”</p>
      <p class="FileLine">San Francisco Daily Journal, December 15, 1999, A4.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We have no theory of education, and so the only way an educational policy or program can be evaluated is by subjecting it to competition. When government prescribes educational policy, not just for public schools but for all schools, it thwarts the competitive process. That is the situation with regard to legal education.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Government has decreed that anyone who wants to be a lawyer must go to law school for three years. As a result, we have no experimental or otherwise empirical basis (and no compelling theoretical reason, simply because as I have said there is no good theory of education, including legal education) for believing that law school has to take so long, at enormous cost; not just the tuition, . . . but the foregone income that the student would have had, had he been working instead of going to school.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Graduate schools of business grant an M.B.A. after only two years, and the business world seems not to be suffering as a result of the “abbreviated” education that their students receive. Business education, not incidentally, is an unregulated branch of education. The two-year M.B.A. is the upshot of a competitive process among business schools.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It will be argued that law students can’t make a judgment whether they need a third year of law school; they are too immature and too ignorant about law. Maybe so. But employers know whether a third year of law school is necessary. If they think it is, they will not hire students who have not completed a third year of law school, or they will pay students who leave earlier much less. . . . There is no need for government to do the insisting.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page990" class="pagebreak" title="990">990</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I am willing to concede the case for some paternalism. Some newly graduated lawyers hang out their own shingle rather than going to work for a law firm or other knowledgeable employer, and perhaps consumers need protection from the under-educated lawyer, if that is how a person who has not completed the third year of law school should be described. If consumer protection is needed in this area, it can be provided by stiffening the bar exam, or perhaps by giving a special bar exam to students who don’t complete the third year, or perhaps by confining the title “lawyer” to the three-year graduate and assigning another title, such as “legal advocate” or “legal counselor” to practitioners who have not had three years of law school.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Courts, too, need protection from lawyers who lack the skills or experience to handle a trial. But the necessary protection can be obtained by court rules requiring demonstrated skills and experience, not completion of an artificially determined period of schooling.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">I don’t think the deregulation of legal education would lead to the disappearance of the third year. Many employers and many students may decide that the educational benefits of a third year exceed the costs. What I think is certain, however, is that removing an artificial barrier to competition will result in a better third year. The law faculties will no longer have a captive audience. They will have to demonstrate to students and employers that the third year provides real value added to the students and to the profession. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In widely publicized remarks made in 2013, President Barack Obama, himself a Harvard-educated lawyer, supported reconsidering the third year of law school: “I believe . . . that law schools would probably be wise to think about being two years instead of three years. . . . The third year [students] would be better off clerking or practicing in a firm, even if they weren’t getting paid that much. But that step alone would reduce the cost for the student.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2259" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2259" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span> After the Great Recession, a few law schools, including Northwestern, instituted “accelerated JD programs” that permitted students to earn their JD in two years.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2260" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2260" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> Although those schools did not offer any discount in tuition and required two-year graduates to pay the same total fees as three-year graduates, the accelerated programs enabled students who graduated early to gain an additional year’s worth of income. Northwestern suspended its program in 2015, citing a lack of enrollment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2261" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2261" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> As an alternative, it (and other schools) instituted a two-year J.D. program for students with foreign law degrees, giving them credit for one year’s worth of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page991" class="pagebreak" title="991">991</span>foreign studies, and permitting them to enter law school outside of the regular admissions processes (so as not to affect the school’s ranking).</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As Obama’s remarks underscore, a defining challenge of contemporary legal education is cost. Over the last three decades, the price of a law degree has increased approximately three times faster than the average household income. Spiraling costs resulted from, among other things, higher merit-based financial aid, higher faculty salaries, lower faculty-student ratios, expanded skills and writing instruction, more intense clinical instruction, improved technology, additional bar preparation, and expanded student services.<a id="_Ref32942251" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2262" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2262" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Many law school leaders do not believe that the accreditation structure is the main factor driving these increased costs (pointing instead to the constraints of ranking systems, discussed below). A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that most school administrators say they would continue to meet or exceed accreditation standards, even if they were not required to do so.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2263" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2263" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span> On the other hand, experts also acknowledge that accreditation standards do inhibit experimentation with lower-cost alternatives.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2264" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2264" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Today’s highly expensive system raises serious concerns. To finance their education, many graduates are accumulating debt that may be difficult to pay off in the increasingly competitive job market. In 2014, about one-third of recent law graduates did not find full-time employment requiring bar passage ten months after graduation. Although that percentage declined by 2017, more than a quarter of recent graduates still lacked legal employment.<a id="_Ref32942197" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2265" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2265" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">These problems have attracted the attention of vocal critics. In 2011, a <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times </span>editorial announced that “American legal education is in crisis” and claimed that the majority of schools are “stuck in an outdated instructional and business model.” It cited issues such as crushing student loans, bleak job prospects, an inability to meet the needs of Americans of limited income, and the inadequacy of practical training. In a <span style="font-style: italic;">National Law Journal </span>debate, “Are Law Schools in Crisis?,” Professor Brian Tamanaha reviewed the figures on student debt and employment and concluded that “law schools are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> in crisis,” but their graduates are. In a subsequent <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times </span>op-ed, Tamanaha made his case: </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The economics of legal education are broken. The problem is that the cost of a law degree is now vastly out of proportion to the economic opportunities obtained by the majority of graduates. The average debt of law graduates tops $100,000, and most new lawyers do not earn salaries sufficient to make the monthly payments on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page992" class="pagebreak" title="992">992</span>this debt. More than one-third of law graduates in recent years have failed to obtain lawyer jobs. Thousands of new law graduates will enter a government-sponsored debt relief program, and many will never fully pay off their law school debt.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">How did we get into this mess? And how do we get out?</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Two factors have combined to produce this situation: the federal loan system and the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/a/american_bar_association/index.html?inline=nyt-org" style="word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;">American Bar Association</a>-imposed <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/accreditation.html" style="word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;">accreditation standards</a> for law schools. Both need to be reformed.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">First, consider the loan system. For more than three decades, law schools have steadily increased tuition because large numbers of students have been willing and able to pay whatever price the schools demanded. . . . The reason that students have been able to pay such astronomical sums is that the federal government guaranteed <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/student_loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" style="word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;">student loans</a> from private lenders, and now it supplies the loans itself with virtually no limits.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">To restore some economic rationality, the federal loan system needs to demand greater accountability from law schools: those with a high proportion of recent graduates in financial trouble should lose their eligibility to receive money from federal loans. (A similar requirement is currently applied to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/forprofit_schools/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" style="word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;">for-profit colleges</a>.)</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The money itself also needs to be reined in. One option is to cap the total amount that each law student can borrow from the government (at, say, a maximum of $125,000). Law schools would then be forced to set tuition with this limit in mind. A flaw of this proposal is that, to reap additional revenue, law schools could simply enroll more students, which would only worsen the oversupply of law graduates.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">So another option is to cap the total amount of federal money that any individual law school can receive. A number of law schools now get about $50 million annually in loan money for students directly from the government. Placing an across-the-board cap on total federal loan money (of, say, $40 million) would force law schools to control tuition as well as enrollment.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Whichever cap is chosen, it will function properly only if the government refuses to guarantee private loans and if private loans can be discharged in bankruptcy, which would make banks leery of lending money to law students who are unlikely to repay. To make up for this, the law schools themselves would have to extend loans, thereby aligning their interests with the success of their students.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Then there’s the problem of the American Bar Association-imposed accreditation standards. In theory, these standards, put in place a century ago at the urging of legal educators, ensure a certain level of quality by requiring every law school to be run like an expensive research university—limiting, for instance, the use of adjuncts and teachers on contract. In practice, however, by imposing a “one size fits all” template, these standards ensure that there is little differentiation among law schools—no lower-cost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page993" class="pagebreak" title="993">993</span>options and no range of choices comparable to what exists at the undergraduate level among community colleges, teaching colleges and research universities.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">One solution to this problem is to strip away the accreditation requirements that mandate expenditures to support faculty scholarship—for example, deleting the requirement that the bulk of professors be in tenure-track positions, removing limits on teaching loads, not requiring paid research leaves for professors, not requiring substantial library collections and so forth. This would allow some law schools to focus on training competent lawyers at a reasonable cost while others remained committed to academic research. Law students would then be able to choose the type of legal education they desired and could afford.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">If we don’t change the economics of legal education, not only will law schools continue to graduate streams of economic casualties each year, but we will also be erecting an enormous barrier to access to the legal profession: the next generation of American lawyers will consist of the offspring of wealthy families who have the freedom to pursue a variety of legal careers, while everyone else is forced to try to get a corporate law job—and those who fail will struggle under the burden of huge law school debt for decades.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The complexion of the legal profession, and our legal system, will suffer as a result.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2266" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2266" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">In rebuttal, Philip Schrag argues that Tamanaha’s calculations overlook significant federal programs that allow graduates to repay less than their full indebtedness.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2267" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2267" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> These include Income-Based Repayment and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) programs that cap annual loan repayment at 10 percent of discretionary income, and after twenty years forgive remaining debt. Schrag also argues that Tamanaha’s proposal would create a two-tiered system of legal education (two-year versus three-year programs), and further stratify the legal profession. Finally, Schrag is skeptical that two-year law schools will offer more practical training than their three-year counterparts. Do you agree with Tamanaha’s diagnosis of the problem? What about his proposed cures? What other approaches might be desirable?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In contrast to arguments that accreditation increases costs in ways that potentially harm students, Ben Barton raises another concern with accreditation: that it does too little to protect students against poor quality legal education. In Barton’s account, the critical problem facing law schools in the “lost decade” after the Great Recession was the dramatic decline in law school applications (down roughly 25 percent from 2008 to 2018).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2268" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2268" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span> This destabilized school finances dependent on student tuition (which itself had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page994" class="pagebreak" title="994">994</span>risen dramatically since the 1980s). Because schools needed to stay afloat, while maintaining their status position in the rankings hierarchy (based in part on the quality of incoming applicants, measured by LSAT scores, undergraduate GPAs, and bar passage rates), they faced a Hobson’s choice. Either they could maintain class size at pre-recession levels to keep hold of tuition dollars at a cost of reducing class quality (and potentially falling in the rankings), or they could maintain quality but sacrifice size.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2269" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2269" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> As Barton shows, most schools did a bit of both. However, not all schools were similarly situated in addressing the challenge, with those at the high end of the status hierarchy best equipped to continue attracting strong students from the (smaller overall) pool of applicants, while making nips and cuts to class size and costs. Schools lower down in the rankings faced increasingly difficult choices and many schools, especially those near the bottom, chose to reduce admissions standards to the bare minimum and raise tuition, while encouraging students to take out the maximum in loans.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2270" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2270" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> The result for these students was predictably disastrous: In 2016, the average student debt at Thomas Jefferson and Whittier law schools was around $180,000 (more than any other school), while the California bar passage rate for those schools’ students was 31 percent and 21 percent respectively (the lowest of all ABA-accredited schools in California).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2271" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2271" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">24</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">How could the ABA let this happen? As Barton recounts, when the ABA proposed tightening up bar passage requirements, it faced a huge backlash from deans and ultimately chose to maintain the existing standard, which only requires schools to show that, in three of the last five years, at least 75 percent of graduates passed the bar (or that the first-time bar passage rate was not more than 15 percent below the jurisdictional average).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2272" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2272" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">25</a></span> However, this loose standard was riddled with exemptions that enabled bar passage to drop well below 75 percent. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">When faced with pressure to address these problems from the Department of Education and consumer advocates, the ABA passed a new rule creating a rebuttable presumption of noncompliance if a school’s attrition rate (the percentage of students who drop out and do not transfer) rises above 20 percent. In 2017, fifteen schools had attrition rates above this level, including Thomas Jefferson, Golden Gate, and Arizona Summit (the latter of which is one of the six for-profit law schools in the United States). Given Arizona Summit’s abysmal record of attrition and low bar passage (27 percent in 2017), combined with its students’ staggering average debt loads (nearly $180,000 in 2016), the ABA was finally forced to act. In 2018, it initiated its first-ever disaccreditation action against the school.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2273" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2273" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">26</a></span> To avoid the same fate, Whittier Law School closed its own doors the same year. Arizona Summit, represented by former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, sued the ABA on due process grounds, arguing that it had applied <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page995" class="pagebreak" title="995">995</span>its accreditation standards in an “arbitrary and capricious” fashion. The school pointed out that it was in compliance with the bar passage rules (its two-year rate as of 2018 was 60%).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2274" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2274" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span> The parties settled the suit in early 2019 and Arizona Summit has not been disaccredited. Do you think this is the right outcome? For its part, Arizona Summit maintains that it provides opportunities for students from nontraditional backgrounds, including many first-generation students, to become lawyers and that it fully discloses its costs and their bar performance. Who do you think is right? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What should the ABA do about schools with extremely low bar passage rates? As noted above, when the ABA Section on Legal Education and Admissions proposed a requirement that at least 75 percent of a school’s graduates pass the bar after two attempts, the suggestion met with substantial criticism. Among the most vocal opponents were deans of law schools that enrolled comparatively large numbers of students of color with low LSATs and GPAs.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2275" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2275" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Do you think the ABA was right to abandon the proposal? What should the rule be? Does the fact that low-performing schools enroll disproportionate numbers of students of color and first-generation students cut in favor of or against tightening standards, given that these students will face the greatest financial hardship if they do not pass the bar? If the ABA will not change its rules and enforce them aggressively, should low-performing schools continue to receive permission from the Department of Education to receive taxpayer-backed federal loans, which are the main source of law school financing?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2276" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2276" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Schools with low bar passage and job placement statistics often argue that students should be permitted to make their own decisions about the financial tradeoffs of pursuing a law degree in the marketplace for legal education. However, critics note that, on issues like bar passage and employment rates, schools do not have a great track record of transparency and the accreditation rules often do not go far enough to force out information that prospective students really need to determine whether a particular law school is worth the investment risk. Beginning in 2012, after reports that schools were hiring graduates back on short-term contracts to boost employment numbers and <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News </span>rankings, the ABA attempted to increase transparency. It required schools to break out employment statistics for graduates in full-time (FT), long-term (LT) jobs that were bar passage required (BPR), those that did not require bar passage but were J.D. advantaged (JDA), and a few other categories.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2277" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2277" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> In addition, the Department of Education under the Obama administration promulgated the “gainful employment rule,” requiring schools to have graduates with debt-to-income <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page996" class="pagebreak" title="996">996</span>ratios of less than 12 percent two years after graduation in order to qualify for federal loans. However, that rule was passed late in the Obama administration and the Trump Department of Education seems disinclined to follow it. Moreover, the ABA still does not require schools to hit any employment benchmark to maintain accreditation, and critics suggest that students targeted by low-performing schools may have difficulty assessing the available outcome data. As a result, some commentators believe the accreditation standard should be tightened to require schools to show that at least 60 percent of graduates have FTLT, BPR, or JDA jobs in two or more of the last five graduating classes.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2278" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2278" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span> Would you support that proposal? How much would it help? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As the case of Arizona Summit highlights, for-profit law schools are particularly problematic since their primary goal is to make a return on students’ tuition dollars, which gives such schools an incentive to charge as much as possible (encouraging students to max out on federal loans), while providing the least costly services. As noted above, the Obama Department of Education cracked down on these so-called “InfiLaw” schools (named after the for-profit InfiLaw Corporation) by passing the gainful employment rule and suspending the right of schools to receive federal loans. Most prominently, in 2016, the Department denied InfiLaw-owned Charlotte Law School’s application to be recertified for federal loans, which, along with the ABA’s decision to place the school on probation, sent Charlotte into a death spiral. Charlotte and Florida Coastal joined the Arizona Summit suit against the ABA over its accreditation standards described above. Given the risks to students, should for-profit law schools be permitted? Should they be more closely regulated? Why? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Research on these schools has shown that they market themselves to students of color with low LSATs under the banner of promoting “access to justice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2279" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2279" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> Riaz Tejani argues that such practices exploit these students by charging them tuition that is often higher than elite schools for an education that offers a very low chance of success: promising “social inclusion” that is “devoid of social protectionism.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2280" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2280" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> How can, or should, regulators respond? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><a id="_Toc335223863" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732733" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733655" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369599" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487215" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861778" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />How, and how much, should the ABA assess law school outcomes, and what should follow from those assessments? We have already discussed the importance of tracking law schools’ employment outcomes and the problem of transparency. What about tracking learning outcomes? In 2017, the ABA created new requirements designed to focus less on inputs, such as faculty/student ratios and library resources, and more on outputs, such as the effectiveness of instruction and the competence of graduates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2281" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2281" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Standard 302, in particular, was amended to state that every law school “shall establish learning outcomes that shall, at a minimum, include competency” in areas covering “substantive and procedural law,” “[l]egal analysis and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page997" class="pagebreak" title="997">997</span>reasoning, legal research, problem-solving, and written and oral communication,” “ethical responsibilities,” and other professional skills. Schools are required to base assessment on these learning goals and to periodically “determine the degree of student attainment of competency in the learning outcomes.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2282" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2282" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> It is not clear whether this shift will prompt rigorous reappraisal of law school pedagogy or whether schools will view it as another bureaucratic hoop to jump through. What is your view? How should schools assess the impact of what goes on it the classroom? Are student course evaluations sufficient? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You have been appointed to a new ABA Task Force on the Future of Legal Education to reevaluate accreditation standards in light of recent challenges. What would you recommend concerning accreditation? How much uniform national regulation is appropriate? Should the ABA encourage greater diversity among law schools?

      <p class="TextParagraph">An important factor that many observers believe has adversely affected law school cost, content, and diversity is rankings, particularly those of <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News and World Report</span>. Students, faculty, alumni, donors, and funders are all concerned with how well their institutions measure up in comparison with rivals, and rankings have become a crucial index of status. These educational scorecards have had benefits. Some relevant characteristics can be objectively assessed, and schools should be held accountable for their performance. Rankings can supply a counterweight to complacency and a check on puffing. In their absence, applicants would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page998" class="pagebreak" title="998">998</span>undoubtedly encounter an educational “Lake Wobegon,” where all institutions were above average.<a id="_Ref32942269" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2286" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2286" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">But some argue that the problem with rankings, such as those in <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span>, is that they assign a single score based on arbitrary weightings of a partial list of characteristics, many of which bear little relation to the quality of education. This pecking order then implies a false precision that assumes undue influence, and skews decisionmaking by applicants and the institutions themselves. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span> algorithms for calculating rankings heavily weight reputation, measured by the subjective perceptions of top administrators and prominent judges and practitioners. As these individuals freely acknowledge, they rarely possess enough systematic knowledge about other institutions to make accurate comparative judgments.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2287" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2287" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span> Those surveyed often depend on word-of-mouth reputations and prior rankings, which create a self-perpetuating dynamic. Past recognition provides a halo effect, which perpetuates high scores even when the evaluator knows nothing about current performance. This explains why Princeton’s and MIT’s law schools do so well even though they do not exist.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2288" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2288" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> When educational leaders are asked to perform the impossible task of rating institutions for which they lack direct information, many fall back on the only source of data available for that purpose: <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span>.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2289" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2289" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The more objective factors that influence rankings are problematic for other reasons. Almost all of these factors measure inputs, such as the test scores of the entering class, alumni contributions, and library books per student, which receive arbitrary weights and bear no necessary relationship to the quality of the learning experience. The main measure of output is placement rates, which can be subject to manipulation. Worse still, the undue importance of these rankings among students, faculty, employers, and alumni donors has led to various unwelcome practices. Some institutions have fudged the facts or engaged in strategic behaviors, such as giving unjustly low evaluations to close competitors in reputational surveys; denying admission to qualified applicants of color with low test scores or placing them in night or part-time programs that do not count in rankings; manipulating academic leaves and titles to improve student/faculty ratios, or (as mentioned above) hiring their own <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page999" class="pagebreak" title="999">999</span>graduates on a short-term basis to improve job placement records.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2290" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2290" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span> Although the ABA changed its rules to require the disclosure of full-time jobs requiring bar passage or a JD, and whether they were subsidized by the school, concerns linger that the emphasis on placement still puts pressure on schools to push students into jobs with earlier hiring deadlines (mostly in the private sector) as opposed to those in the public interest that tend to require bar passage and probationary periods. In 2020, <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span> will include a measure of “scholarly impact” based on citation counts of a school’s tenured and tenure-track faculty—a measure that many worry will motivate schools to skew hiring toward faculty who prioritize research, especially in larger fields with high citation potential.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2291" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2291" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">44</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Meanwhile, critics identify other fundamental problems in the way that ranking systems skew law school priorities. The <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News </span>framework discourages investment in many areas that enhance educational quality but are not rated, such as access to clinical courses, well-designed public service programs, and a diverse faculty and student body. Instead, the premium placed on reputation encourages overinvestment in scholarship at the expense of teaching, and expensive public relations campaigns that do nothing to improve the learning environment.<a id="_Ref32942284" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2292" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> In addition, the emphasis on expenditures per student motivates schools to invest enormous energy in external fundraising that empowers private donors to influence curricular priorities through the creation of substantively focused centers (around issues like technology, business law, the environment, and others), which often carry certificate programs that require students to take prescribed courses. As a result, rankings contribute to curricular fragmentation, pushing students into curricular silos that increase coursework demands as students strive to take bar courses and meet the requirements of specializations. </p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is there anything that law schools or professional associations could do to counteract rankings’ unwanted effects? The California bar called on <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News and World Report</span> to adjust its ranking formula to consider diversity as 15 percent of overall rating.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2293" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2293" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span> Would you support that move or would incremental adjustment simply legitimate a fundamentally flawed system? The ABA Commission on Diversity has proposed educating the public, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1000" class="pagebreak" title="1000">1000</span>potential students, and employers about the limits of rankings, and to explore alternative rating systems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2294" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2294" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> What other factors should the rankings measure? Should student satisfaction count? What effects might that have on how law school administrators and faculty act?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2295" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2295" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should law schools follow the lead of a number of liberal arts colleges and attempt a collective boycott of rankings? Although much of the data used in rankings is publicly available from the ABA, administrators and faculty could refuse to provide reputational information.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2296" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> However, if schools fail to supply the data that <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span> requests, the magazine uses its own estimates, which are skewed in ways that punish noncompliance.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2297" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2297" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> Prior efforts to organize a law school boycott have foundered because not enough institutions have been willing to risk penalties to undermine the ranking structure.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you weigh the benefits of rankings against their drawbacks? Are there better ways to provide public information about law schools and to hold them accountable? Why have the few previous attempts to provide alternative rankings been so unsuccessful? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Succeeding (or even just maintaining one’s position in) the rankings game requires an enormous investment of resources. As mentioned already, this is partly a function of the <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span> rankings algorithm itself, which rewards higher expenditures per student, including larger salaries for faculty as well as student financial aid. In addition, it simply costs a lot of money to compete for rankings, such as deep tuition discounts to recruit high-LSAT students and mass mailings of expensive promotional materials that might enhance reputation. These rankings-induced costs are one cause of increased tuition, and the accompanying increased student debt.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2298" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2298" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> How should law schools address this problem? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">In preparing students to be effective lawyers and to serve the common good, the law school mission combines client-centered and public-facing goals. As we have suggested throughout this book, promoting these twin goals is at the core of what it means to be a profession, but in practice these goals often conflict. Law school is a microcosm of this broader problem. In the discussion below, we explore the challenge of educating lawyers from the perspective of law schools’ goals, methods, and outcomes. The aim is to assess pedagogy in relation to what the law school experience is designed to do (which of course is contested), and to question how well schools are doing to meet their goals <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1001" class="pagebreak" title="1001">1001</span>based on objective and subjective factors, including student satisfaction and performance. </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As the history detailed in Part A suggests, what educators and students understand as the mission of law school has long been subject to debate and has shifted over time.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2299" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2299" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> An example is the move from “scientific” analysis of case law to a greater emphasis on practical training. While there have been external pressures toward conformity (from accreditation and rankings), there have also been ongoing efforts by schools to innovate and differentiate themselves. A prominent 2007 report on the state of legal education by the Carnegie Foundation (known as the Carnegie Report) found that law schools across America, irrespective of geography or status, generally seek to promote three primary goals. </p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Case Method and Its Discontents</span>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">One of the most common criticisms of contemporary legal education is the disconnect between its curricular focus and the demands of practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2301" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">54</a></span> Recent graduates are not “market ready,” and sophisticated clients are less and less willing to subsidize their training.<a id="_Ref32942298" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2302" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2302" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span></p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1002" class="pagebreak" title="1002">1002</span>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Part of the problem stems from the slightly schizophrenic role that modern legal education has attempted to play. In seeking to advance legal knowledge as well as convey practical skills, law schools run the risk of doing neither very well. According to many critics, contemporary legal education offers too little theory <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> too little practice. It provides inadequate training in basic skills and insufficient grounding in disciplines that should inform legal analysis and legal practice, such as economics, psychology, finance, and management. Those criticisms raise questions about law schools’ traditional reliance on the case method and the Socratic discussion format, and their inadequate attention to practical and interpersonal skills.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Modern legal education has largely rejected Langdell’s premises about law as a science, based on deductive principles organized in a logical system. Yet his approach is often said to “rule us from the grave.” A diluted case method and quasi-Socratic style still characterize many law school classrooms. The reasons have much to do with the adaptability of this method for large classes, its corresponding low costs, and its perceived ability to sharpen analytic and verbal advocacy skills, as well as to accommodate different intellectual approaches.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">However, the case approach is highly limited and somewhat of a misnomer. It does not require study of actual cases, although that, as legal realists noted, would be “little enough.” It directs attention only to the text of judicial opinions, a censored account that leaves out much of the “living process” of the law.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2303" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2303" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span> What it often ignores is the translation of a dispute into a legal grievance; the investigation, negotiation, and presentation of parties’ claims; the unstated factors influencing judicial decisionmaking; the consequences of that decision on the individuals involved; alternative methods of resolving disputes; and the social, political, and economic backdrop of the process. </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">At its best, the Socratic method develops verbal and analytic skills, and promotes self-critical understanding of varied viewpoints.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2304" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2304" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span> At its worst, in Ralph Nader’s phrase, this controlled dialogue offers students only freedom to “roam in an intellectual cage.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2305" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2305" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> Students sometimes complain that faculty invite the student to “guess what I’m thinking,” and then find the response inevitably lacking; professors are “fishing for the ‘right’ answers and students [are] trying to catch the hook.”<a id="_Ref32942361" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2306" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2306" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> Critics also argue that Socratic questioning can diminish students’ self-confidence and encourage corrosive skepticism. They believe that the hierarchical and competitive classroom climate discourages participation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1003" class="pagebreak" title="1003">1003</span>by many students, particularly women, and fails to supply enough opportunities for interactive learning, teamwork, and feedback.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">The case method of law teaching presents students with a series of concrete disputes and compels them to reenact these disputes by playing the roles of the original contestants or their lawyers. It thus forces them to see things from a range of different points of view and to entertain the claims associated with each, broadening their capacity for sympathy by taxing it in unexpected ways. But it also works in the opposite direction. For the student who has been assigned a partisan position and required to defend it is likely to be asked a moment later for his views regarding the wisdom of the judge’s decision in the case. To answer, he must disengage himself from the sympathetic attachments he may have formed as a committed, if imaginary, participant and reexamine the case from a disinterested judicial point of view. The case method thus works simultaneously to strengthen both the student’s powers of sympathetic understanding and his ability to suppress all sympathies in favor of a judge’s scrupulous neutrality. Most important, it increases his tolerance for the disorientation that movement back and forth between these different attitudes occasions. In this way the case method serves as a forcing ground for the moral imagination by cultivating that peculiar bifocality that [is] its most essential property.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">One aim of this complex exercise in advocacy and detachment is the cultivation of those perceptual habits that lawyers need in practice. Forcing students to defend positions they do not believe in or that they consider morally offensive may seem arbitrary and insensitive, but it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1005" class="pagebreak" title="1005">1005</span>serves an important goal. The student who is put in this position must strain to see the claim he has been given to defend in its most attractive light. He must work to discover its strengths and to articulate them, and this he cannot do unless he temporarily puts his earlier convictions to one side. In this way students get used to looking with a friendly eye even at those positions they personally reject, and before long they acquire some skill at identifying the strengths and weaknesses of whatever claim is presented to them, those that are unfamiliar or morally distasteful as well as those they recognize and endorse. Gradually, much of this becomes habitual. . . . [I]n time it increases a person’s powers of empathic understanding and relaxes the boundaries that initially restrict his sympathies to what he knows and likes.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does Kronman accurately describe the intellectual and personal changes that the case method encourages?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Kronman believes that legal education makes law students more conservative in their outlook. It is important to realize that Kronman does not mean that law school promotes right-wing views. “Conservative” in his sense means “resistant to sweeping social change,” in a right-wing as well as left-wing direction. Critics such as Duncan Kennedy criticize this conservatizing tendency of legal education, whereas Kronman praises it.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2308" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2308" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span> How would you assess it?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />In defending the traditional Socratic method, which he likens to a “contact sport,” Georgetown Law Professor Louis Michael Seidman argues that it can instill a “seriousness that doesn’t exist now.” He explains:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 26.65pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">The kind of teaching that I think has become quite prevalent—and frankly it drives me up a wall—is this: The professor asks a question, student A says “blah, blah, blah” and the professor says “that’s a really good point.” Student B raises her hand and says “yeah but blah, blah, blah.” The professor says “That’s a really good point also. Boy do we have smart students here.” Student C: “blah, blah, blah.” “Wow, I hadn’t thought of that, that’s a great point.” So the net result of that is people are reinforced in the ideas they already have. There is much less effort to challenge them.<a id="_Ref32942317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2309" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2309" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you think this is a fair characterization of contemporary law school teaching? </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Experiential Learning</span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Law is the only profession that sends its students into practice without intensive clinical experience, and many educators believe that they suffer as a consequence. Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the U.C. Berkeley Law School, argues that: “There is no way to learn to be a </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1006" class="pagebreak" title="1006">1006</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">lawyer except by doing it. . . . [I]t is unthinkable that medical schools could graduate doctors who had never seen patients or that they would declare that they just wanted to teach students to think like doctors.”</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2310" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2310" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> In a study by the National Association of Law Placement, associates in private firms rated clinical courses as the most helpful experience in making the transition to practice.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2311" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2311" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> Students who lack such courses are also missing opportunities to develop cross-cultural competence and an understanding of how law functions, or fails to function, for the have-nots. Schools are similarly weak in non-clinical courses that integrate experiential approaches and address practice-oriented topics, such as problem solving, marketing, project management, interpersonal dynamics, and information technology. Consider that issue in light of the following excerpt from the 2007 Carnegie Report.</span>
      </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc335223870" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732740" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733662" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369606" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487222" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861783" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219337" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756741" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908875" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />William M. Sullivan et al., Educating Lawyers: Preparation for the Profession of Law</p>
      <p class="FileLine">187–91 (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 2007).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[T]he task of connecting [legal] conclusions with the rich complexity of actual situations that involve full-dimensional people, let alone the job of thinking through the social consequences or ethical aspects of the conclusions, remains outside the [case] method. Issues such as the social needs or matters of justice involved in cases do get attention in some case-dialogue classrooms, but these issues are almost always treated as addenda. Being told repeatedly that such matters fall, as they do, outside the precise and orderly “legal landscape,” students often conclude that they are secondary to what really counts for success in law school—and in legal practice. In their all-consuming first year, students are told to set aside their desire for justice. They are warned not to let their moral concerns or compassion for the people in the cases they discuss cloud their legal analyses. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Another unforeseen consequence results from the near-exclusive focus on systematic abstraction from actual social contexts, which suggests two major limitations of legal education. One limitation is the casual attention that most law schools give to teaching students how to use legal thinking in the complexity of actual law practice. Unlike other professional education, most notably medical school, legal education typically pays relatively little attention to direct training in professional practice. The result is to prolong and reinforce the habits of thinking like a student rather than an apprentice practitioner, thus conveying the impression that lawyers are more like competitive scholars than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1007" class="pagebreak" title="1007">1007</span>attorneys engaged with the problems of clients. Neither understanding of the law is exhaustive, of course, but law school’s typically unbalanced emphasis on the one perspective can create problems gratuitously for what [the American Bar Foundation’s study] <span style="font-style: italic;">After the JD</span> calls “the transition to practice.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The second limitation is law schools’ failure to complement the focus on skill in legal analysis with effective support for developing the ethical and social dimensions of the profession. Students need opportunities to learn about, reflect on, and practice the responsibilities of legal professionals. Despite progress in making legal ethics a part of the curriculum, law schools rarely pay consistent attention to the social and cultural contexts of legal institutions and the varied forms of legal practice. To engage the moral imagination of students as they move toward professional practice, seminaries and medical, business, and engineering schools employ well-elaborated case studies of professional work. Law schools, which pioneered the use of case teaching, only occasionally do so.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Both these drawbacks—lack of attention to practice and the weakness of concern with professional responsibility—are the unintended consequences of reliance on a single, heavily academic pedagogy to provide the crucial initiation into legal education. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We endorse a different strategy, which we call <span style="font-style: italic;">integrative</span>. . . . Something like an integrative strategy has, in fact, begun to emerge recently in discussions of legal education. The core insight behind the integrative strategy is that effective educational efforts must be understood in holistic rather than atomistic terms. For law schools, this means that, far from remaining uncontaminated by each other, each aspect of the legal apprenticeship—the cognitive, the practical, and the ethical-social—takes on part of its character from the kind of relationship it has with the others. . . .</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="NoteMainHead"><a id="_Toc335223871" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732741" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733663" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369607" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487223" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451861784" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36219338" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756742" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908876" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Notes and <a id="_Toc335223872" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335732742" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc335733664" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc339369608" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc340487224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Questions</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /> A core element of the Carnegie Report’s “integrative” strategy is an increased emphasis on practical training. As studies after its release showed, only a tiny fraction of law schools required clinical training, and a majority of students graduated without it.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2312" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2312" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span> Partly in response to the Carnegie Report, and to market pressure for more skilled lawyers, the ABA amended its accreditation standards to require that law schools mandate “one or more experiential course(s) totaling at least six credit hours,” which may include “a simulation course, a law clinic, or a field placement.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2313" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> A positive outcome <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1008" class="pagebreak" title="1008">1008</span>of this change is that students now must graduate with some core competency in practical lawyering. However, rather than significantly modifying the curriculum, many schools have chosen to meet the standard by increasing opportunities for part-time externships and redesignating courses as “experiential” by including some simulated components.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2314" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2314" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span> This has been driven by law schools’ quest to make students “practice ready” while at the same time cutting costs in response to the economics of law school discussed in Part A. Thus, some commentators who stress the pedagogical value of representing underserved clients in clinics as a way to promote skill development and deepen commitment to public service express concern that the move toward greater experiential training comes at the cost of adequate support for clinical education. In Seidman’s view, with the turn to experiential learning, clinics “are beginning to lose out. . . . We are just farming out students in large numbers to people who are practicing law.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2315" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2315" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span> What is your view? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How central a role do you believe that skills instruction should play in law school? The California Bar considered, but never implemented, an admission standard requiring applicants to the bar to complete fifteen units of experiential learning while in law school (significantly more than the ABA standard of six). Do you think this would a good policy? If so, how should additional skills training be financed? Would it make sense to require law school faculty to build practice and professionalism components into their standard curricular offerings? How would you respond to commentators who claim that, if clinical training was so valuable, employers would demand it for those they hire?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If skill-building is the goal, would it be equally or more cost-effective to shorten law school and to offer skills training through post-graduate courses or apprenticeship, along the lines of legal education in other nations?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2316" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2316" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />If law schools care about practical training, should they change the way they engage in faculty hiring and promotion? Many professors have very brief practice experience and a substantial number do not hold JDs.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2317" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2317" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> Many graduate from a small number of elite schools.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2318" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2318" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span> Clinical faculty tend to lack the status and resources of their colleagues. Less than one-third of clinical teachers are on the same tenure track as non-clinical faculty and over 60 percent are on contracts or hold other forms of nonsecure positions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2319" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2319" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span> Can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1009" class="pagebreak" title="1009">1009</span>law schools effectively produce practice-ready lawyers without modifying personnel structures? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What kinds of skills most need greater attention in law schools? After consultation with leaders of law firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and in-house corporate counsel offices, Northwestern Law School identified certain core competencies that should be more central to legal education. These included teamwork, communication, quantitative analysis, strategic thinking, project management, and globalization.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2320" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2320" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> Other commentators have made similar suggestions for curricular reform and proposed topics such as organizational dynamics, marketing, and other “soft skills.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2321" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2321" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span> As noted above, more schools are moving in the direction suggested by these proposals and are including more training in practice-related skills.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2322" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2322" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> How would you evaluate your school’s efforts? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Are there other curricular areas apart from practice skills that you believe deserve more attention? In response to critiques of the traditional focus on litigation and appellate case analysis, some schools have refocused the first year to cover legislation, regulation, problem solving, and comparative materials. Other schools have encouraged interdisciplinary approaches and sequenced learning in the second and third years.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2323" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2323" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span> In an age of machine learning and artificial intelligence, still other schools have started to teach technological competence. What do you think about these initiatives? Do they go far enough? What about training students in “soft” skills, like collaboration, or teaching students to think seriously about what it means to be happy?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2324" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2324" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">77</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Training for Public Service and Leadership</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Beyond technical skill, law school is supposed to inculcate the spirit of professionalism, which includes commitment to ethical conduct in the service of clients as well as to public values in support of the rule of law and access to justice. A 2016 survey of 24,000 lawyers in all fifty states found that values (such as integrity and trustworthiness) were “far more important in brand new lawyers than legal skills.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2325" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2325" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">78</a></span> What role should law schools play in promoting these values? One obvious way schools do so is through the required course in professional responsibility, but this is too limited an opportunity to fully explore the multifaceted dimensions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1010" class="pagebreak" title="1010">1010</span>of professional socialization and it often is taught “to the test”—<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>., to help students pass the MPRE. Clinical education also gives students a chance to learn about the value of access to justice. This section spotlights other ways that law schools have tried to inculcate professional values: through supporting public interest and pro bono activities, and increasing curricular and extracurricular initiatives in leadership.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As Duncan Kennedy’s critique of the case method excerpted above underscores, one key challenge in promoting values of public service is the law school experience itself. The influence of the law school socialization process has been much debated. Most commentators, including the authors of the Carnegie Report, assume that legal education has a substantial effect in shaping student values, perceptions, and professional careers.<a id="_Ref32942394" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2326" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2326" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> A frequent observation is that students enter law school talking of justice and leave talking of jobs.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Commentators believe that this shift in perspective is attributable to several forces. One is high tuition and limited financial aid and loan forgiveness programs, which deter some students from seeking public interest employment.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2327" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2327" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> In response, those who wish to promote public service argue that Loan Repayment Assistance Programs (LRAPs) and public interest scholarships can significantly expand graduates’ job opportunities. Supporting that claim, in one large-scale study, half of the responding attorneys with public interest jobs reported that the availability of loan forgiveness was very important in their choice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2328" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2328" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">81</a></span> Some, but not all research suggests that scholarships and fellowships are even more effective in encouraging public interest placements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2329" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2329" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">82</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other commentators attribute the shift in perspective from justice to jobs to a curriculum that discourages a focus on public interest engagement. Most research finds that issues of social justice receive relatively little attention in the core curricula.<a id="_Ref32942432" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2330" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2330" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">83</a></span> However, other studies suggest that law school does not have a large or negative effect on attitudes toward public interest law, and that the more significant influence on career commitments comes from market forces, such as the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1011" class="pagebreak" title="1011">1011</span>comparatively low salary and prestige associated with much of the public interest work available.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2331" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2331" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">84</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In response to the problem of what researchers have called public interest “drift”—the decline in desire to pursue careers representing underserved clients or causes<a id="_Ref32942598" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2332" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2332" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">85</a></span>—law schools have taken different paths. Some have opted to institute public interest specializations providing tailored coursework, programming, and career services. In 2015, Equal Justice Works listed over forty law schools offering a public interest certificate program. The UCLA Law School launched one of the first in 1997.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2333" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2333" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">86</a></span> The program was created to respond to public interest drift by providing an institutional counterweight to law school socialization. The program continues to admit twenty-five students to UCLA each year, emphasizing past public service as a predictor of future public interest practice. The courses are limited to program students to promote a sense of community and counteract feelings of isolation and alienation.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Beyond specialized training, law schools have also sought to increase student pro bono participation. In 1996, the ABA amended its accreditation standards to call on schools to “encourage students to participate in pro bono activities and to provide opportunities for them to do so.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2334" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2334" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> An interpretation of those standards provides that “pro bono opportunities should at a minimum involve the rendering of meaningful law-related services to persons of limited means or to organizations that serve such persons; however, volunteer programs that involve meaningful services that are not law-related may be included within the law school’s overall program.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2335" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2335" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Although a growing number of schools have made efforts to increase pro bono involvement, substantial challenges remain. Approximately forty schools require service by students, and fewer impose specific requirements on faculty. Even at these schools, the amounts demanded are sometimes quite minimal: Half of those responding to an ABA survey required students to contribute only ten to twenty hours.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2336" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2336" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> Moreover, the quality of some programs is open to question. Many students lack onsite supervision or a classroom opportunity to discuss their work or pro bono issues generally, and see relatively little faculty support for such efforts.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2337" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2337" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span> In the nation’s first comprehensive report on pro bono programs <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1012" class="pagebreak" title="1012">1012</span>in legal education, an AALS Commission offered a diagnosis that remains apt: “law schools should do more.”<a id="_Ref32942500" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2338" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2338" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">The inadequacy of support for public service is a missed opportunity for both the profession and the public. As the materials on pro bono in Chapter 14, Section C.4 note, such work offers participants a wide range of practical benefits, such as training, trial experience, problem-solving skills, and professional contacts. For many, this experience also provides their most direct exposure to what passes for justice for poor people and to the need for legal reforms. In addition to these educational and practical benefits, a positive public service experience in law school may help inspire future involvement.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2339" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2339" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">For these reasons, the AALS Commission recommended that schools seek to make at least one well-supervised law-related pro bono opportunity available to every student and either require student participation or find ways to attract the great majority of students to volunteer.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2340" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2340" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> Some commentators have also recommended that law schools impose pro bono requirements on faculty. If an important goal of legal education is to inspire a commitment to public service, then having faculty serve as role models makes obvious sense.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2341" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2341" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Although no occupation produces such a large proportion of leaders as law, and leadership development is now a $50 billion industry, legal education has lagged behind.</span>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What accounts for the inadequacies in many law schools’ approach to public service? Would it help if <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News and World Repor</span>t or some other organization ranked pro bono programs by the number of placements provided or hours contributed per student?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2346" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2346" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span> What other strategies might be most effective in producing reform?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should law schools do more to support public service? If so, what strategies seem most promising? In his study of public interest drift, John Bliss finds that “drifting” students are more likely to have ambivalent feelings about their careers coming into law school and express more concern about the risks of taking an unconventional public interest path, which makes them more likely to follow the crowd into the law firm hiring process at the beginning of the 2L year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2347" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2347" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">As he notes, students who are reluctant to “close any doors,” tend to “upload their resumes” and choose law firm jobs rather than public interest experiences during the summer.</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2348" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2348" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> To reduce pressure and expand student choices, Bliss suggests changes such as pushing back the law firm recruiting process to spring of the 2L year to give students more time to consider options, and providing more opportunities for skills and professional formation in the 1L year. Such reforms could “lend understanding and unity across the corporate/public-interest student divide, mitigating competing accounts of deviance among first-year students.”</span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;" class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2349" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2349" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a></span><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> Would you support such changes? Do you think they would matter in shaping student career choice? </span></p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How would you assess your law school’s public interest and pro bono opportunities? What, if any, changes would you recommend?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />How much effect do you believe that law school debt has on students’ career choices? In 2007, a federal loan assistance program, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, was enacted. The program provides debt relief to graduates of any law school who take qualifying jobs—and forgives the loans of those who commit at least ten years to public interest legal work.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2350" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2350" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>According to Professor Philip G. Schrag, one of the drafters, the program was designed to “enable student borrowers to choose their careers without being <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1014" class="pagebreak" title="1014">1014</span>unduly influenced by their debt burdens and [to] enable governments and nonprofit organizations to retain talented professionals who would otherwise be forced to resign after two or three years and seek higher-paying jobs so that they could repay their student loans.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2351" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2351" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span> Despite its promise, the program’s implementation by the Department of Education has drawn tremendous criticism as it was reported that an astonishing 99 percent of applicants for loan forgiveness have been rejected, nearly one-quarter for technical application problems.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2352" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2352" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> This low forgiveness rate appears hard to justify given that Congress expanded the program in response to outrage over previous high rejection rates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2353" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2353" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span> Many schools have school-specific LRAP programs, but benefits vary.

      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Assessing how well law school does in advancing its multifaceted mission depends on which outcomes we focus on, the time frame for evaluation, and from whose vantage point “success” is measured. As the earlier discussion of rankings and accreditation suggested, there is already ample measurement of certain kinds of short-term outcomes—bar passage and job placement—at the expense of focusing on longer-term career satisfaction and broader contributions to society. Although some schools have sought to study these types of outcomes, Professor Paul Campos suggests that, overall, schools may choose to remain willfully blind: “Law schools are very good at tracking down the whereabouts of their graduates for the purpose of soliciting donations from them. We have very little formal data about what our graduates are doing because we have chosen not to gather that data—perhaps, in part, because on some level we would prefer not to know.”</span>

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As the ABA’s move toward learning outcomes highlights, law schools are being asked to think more proactively about measuring the impact of what professors are doing in the classroom; the new metrics focus on whether students are attaining competency in core skills, not just passing final exams.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> In this regard, there has been a salutary shift to </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1015" class="pagebreak" title="1015">1015</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">what Neil Hamilton has called “competency-based” learning, which prioritizes ongoing feedback and assessment based on performing practice-related tasks at “a mastery level of achievement.”</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> As part of this shift in assessment, many schools have also devoted more resources to providing academic support for at-risk students to ensure that they are leveled-up, not left behind.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Yet if one thinks of outcomes in terms of promoting student—and eventual lawyer—well-being, much work remains to be done. Recent studies indicate relatively high levels of student substance abuse and mental health challenges during school.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> Experts suggest that administrators should devote more resources to identify students who might need extra support, and do more to provide and publicize resources.</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;" class="FootnoteReference">
          <a id="ftnb.2360" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2360" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> As the ABA National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being reports, because law students as well as practitioners have an “elevated risk” of stress, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, the profession needs a more holistic approach to well-being; attention should focus on multiple dimensions of a lawyer’s life, including emotional, social, intellectual, physical, and spiritual concerns.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> Urging the profession to “acknowledge the problems and take responsibility,” the Task Force recommends that law schools create best practices for detecting problems and assisting students in need, while providing training to faculty and incorporating well-being in Professional Responsibility courses.</span>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When a 2018 Gallup-Purdue survey asked lawyers about the cost-effectiveness of their legal education, only 20 percent said that law school “prepared me well for life outside of graduate school” and only 23 percent said it was “worth the cost.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2363" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2363" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span> What should law schools do to address these troubling responses? </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As Chapter 2 indicated, although the profession has become much more diverse over the past century, diversity remains a significant challenge. Commentators have suggested that the problem is driven, in part, by the legacy of discrimination and ongoing bias in the profession, as well as problems in the “pipeline” and pool of potential applicants. The discussion below addresses these challenges in the context of law school admissions and campus climate, with diversity broadly understood across multiple dimensions of race, class, immigrant background, gender, and sexuality. </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc36219343" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756747" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908881" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Admissions</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Most law schools long discriminated on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, and religion. Part of the impetus for tighter admission standards during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reflected racial, ethnic, and religious biases among many educational administrators. For example, Columbia Law School was urged to require that applicants have a college diploma or pass an examination including Latin as a way to “keep out the little scrubs whom the school now promotes from grocery counters.”<a id="_Ref32942620" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2364" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2364" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Discrimination against immigrant and Jewish students continued throughout the early twentieth century, while racial barriers were even more enduring. Although the first black student graduated from law school in 1869 and some institutions serving black students formed graduate programs in law around the same period, few of these programs survived after the Reconstruction era. A series of lawsuits beginning in the 1930s forced the establishment of separate state law schools for black students, and eventually the integration of existing institutions.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The history of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sweatt v. Painter</span> litigation illustrates the extent of the obstacles confronting racial minorities. In 1940, the Texas legal profession included approximately 7570 white attorneys and 22 black attorneys. When a qualified black applicant sought admission at the University of Texas Law School, the state responded first by adding law classes at Prairie View University. Prairie View was an impoverished historically black institution that offered college credit for mattress and broom-making, and lacked chairs and desks in two of the three law classrooms. Yet, in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sweatt</span> litigation, the state court concluded that the Prairie View facility was “substantially equal” to the University of Texas Law School.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2365" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2365" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">118</a></span></p>

The AALS then passed a resolution designed to encourage, but not to require, member schools to abolish racially discriminatory practices. Not until 1964 did all schools do so. Even after law schools removed formal prohibitions against non-white applicants, the absence of financial aid and the lack of affirmative action, active recruitment, and supportive academic environments all worked against minority students’ inclusion.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2366" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2366" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">119</a></span> Until the 1960s, lawyers of color represented fewer than 2 percent of the profession.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Overt discrimination declined over the next several decades. In the 1960s, diversity increased significantly, partly in response to the civil rights movement. During the late 1960s, a series of meetings under the auspices of the Office of Economic Opportunity led to the formation of a national Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO) for minorities, with representatives from the ABA, AALS, and LSAC (Law School Admission Council). This group’s efforts, coupled with other social and governmental pressures, led to increased financial aid, recruitment, and prelaw training. Support and protest activities by Black, Asian, and Latinx law student organizations accelerated this progress. According to the most recent comprehensive data available, while minorities account for about 40 percent of the nation’s population, they constitute 39 percent of law school students, 12–14 percent of tenured professors, and at least 17 percent of law school deans.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2368" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2368" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Women’s entry into law school has been challenging in distinctive ways. For most of this nation’s history, “both formal policies and informal norms assumed that law was unfit for women and women unfit for law.”<a id="_Ref32942610" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2369" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2369" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> “No woman,” declared one nineteenth-century Columbia trustee, “shall degrade herself by practicing law especially if I can save her.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2370" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2370" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span> Such attitudes built on broader cultural assumptions about gender roles. A recurrent anxiety was that women’s exposure to masculine education and pursuits would result in infertility, frigidity, and “race suicide.” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1018" class="pagebreak" title="1018">1018</span>Theories about the deadly “brain-womb” conflict warned that women who diverted their scarce energies to cognitive rather than reproductive pursuits risked permanent physical and psychological damage. The lower birth rate among female professionals appeared as both a cause and consequence of deep neuroses. Career women who remained single were viewed as morbid, sex-starved spinsters, while those who married were accused of neglecting their children’s needs and irreparably injuring their husbands’ self-respect and social status.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2371" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2371" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Other rationales for women’s exclusion were more pragmatic. Some professors and administrators worried about distractions for male students in the classroom and opportunities for unchaperoned exchanges in the library. So too, many faculties did not want to squander scarce places on female students who would presumably not have the same opportunities as male competitors to make full use of their legal training. Societal discrimination against women thus became a rationale for perpetuating it.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2372" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2372" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Such attitudes discouraged women from applying to law school and legitimated discrimination against their admission. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, female students never constituted more than 3 percent of law school classes except during World War II. Not until 1972 did all ABA-accredited schools remove bans on women students. Moreover, even where formal admission policies were gender-neutral, educational experiences were not. Until women began entering law schools in substantial numbers during the 1970s, a common practice was to ignore their classroom presence as much as possible except for special issues or ceremonial occasions. For example, some professors observed Ladies Days, on which they called only on women students for selected cases or hypotheticals involving “women’s concerns.” Rape and needlework were favored topics.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2373" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2373" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span> Sol Linowitz, a prominent Washington practitioner, recalled that “[t]here were only two women in my class at Cornell Law School, and to tell the truth we felt somewhat uncomfortable when they were around. It never occurred to us to wonder whether <span style="font-style: italic;">they</span> felt uncomfortable.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2374" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2374" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Progress on issues of gender has been more dramatic than on issues of race and ethnicity. The percentage of female law students grew from 3 percent in 1960 to almost half by the turn of the 21st century. Nevertheless, the picture is not as positive from an intersectional perspective, with minority women in general, and Black women and Latinas in particular, still underrepresented. Moreover, as the discussion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1019" class="pagebreak" title="1019">1019</span>below suggests, although female students have achieved numerical parity, their experiences and opportunities often continue to diverge from those of their male classmates. </p>
      <p class="Center3emDash">———</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Current ABA accreditation standards require law schools to demonstrate “by concrete action” a commitment to having a “law school body that is diverse with respect to gender, race, and ethnicity.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2375" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2375" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> The most common and widely accepted strategies involve proactive recruitment and retention programs, adequate financial aid, and educational support services. A more controversial issue involves affirmative action programs that result in acceptance of targeted minority students with lower average LSATs and GPAs than white applicants.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">However, in <a id="dabmci_410d84f8fe244d3c8d2b8efafd978cb3" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Grutter v.

Yet, at the time of <span style="font-style: italic;">Grutter</span>, the Court also decided a companion case, <a id="dabmci_5860e3ef048c4761a5aada7280812313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Gratz v.

Bollinger</span>, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), which struck down the University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions program because it awarded a substantial and fixed number of points toward admission to members of targeted racial and ethnic minority groups. The cases were distinguished, in part, because the law school’s program neither established a fixed quota for minority admissions, nor restricted diversity considerations to those of race and ethnicity. Rather, the school considered candidates’ whole file and sought to achieve a “critical mass” of students of color. The number of African American, Latino, and Native American students in each class varied between 14 and 20 percent during a previous seven-year period, “a range inconsistent with a quota.” <a id="dabmci_5f8b45d2488d40abac578a1de082bc1d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Grutter</span>, 539 U.S at 330.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Michigan cases attracted a record number of amicus briefs. Support for the law school’s program came from virtually all higher education associations, including the AALS, and a wide range of business organizations, as well as a group of highly distinguished retired military <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1020" class="pagebreak" title="1020">1020</span>leaders. These defenders of affirmative action made several claims. First, they contended that institutions of higher education, including professional schools, have a compelling state interest in taking racial and ethnic diversity into account in the admission process. In supporters’ view, it is essential to educate lawyers who will adequately reflect the diverse make-up of the population they will serve. Writing for the majority in <a id="dabmci_a16c60cf2f354626a953c9be96bdd458" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Grutter</span>, Justice O’Connor agreed:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_98fd3a2725414df892bc20246fb310c4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 326. In addition, the Court was also apparently swayed by research finding that a student body with varied backgrounds and perspectives enriches all participants’ learning environment. Here, amicus briefs cited studies showing that students who experience racial diversity in education display less prejudice, are better equipped to defuse conflicts, demonstrate sharper cognitive skills, exhibit a clearer understanding of multiple perspectives, and report greater satisfaction with their academic experience.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2376" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2376" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Proponents also argued, and the Court agreed, that law schools were justified in taking into account factors other than quantitative metrics such as test scores and GPAs. Although formulas based on these quantitative measures help predict first-year law school performance, such formulas account for only 16 to 36 percent of the variance in law school grades, and grades measure only <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> of the skills necessary for effective legal practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2377" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2377" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span> The most systematic attempt to follow students after graduation has not found a significant correlation between law school grades and later achievements. Most notably, a longitudinal survey by Michigan Law School found that LSATs and GPAs did not correlate with graduates’ earned income, career satisfaction, or contributions to the community. Minorities admitted under affirmative action criteria did as well on these measures as other graduates.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2378" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2378" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">For their part, opponents of affirmative action do not necessarily discount the value of diversity—but they worry that differential hiring and promotion criteria based on race will reinforce stereotypes of inferiority that the legal profession should be seeking to challenge. In his recent memoir, Justice Clarence Thomas attributed his inability to get the law firm jobs he wanted as evidence of what a “law degree from Yale was worth when it bore the taint of racial preference.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2379" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2379" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">132</a></span> Many opponents also believe that affirmative action violates a moral principle of color-blindness. As Justice Thomas put it in his dissent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Grutter</span>,</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all. . . . Having decided to use the LSAT, the Law School must accept the constitutional burdens that come with this decision. The Law School may freely continue to employ the LSAT and other allegedly merit-based standards in whatever fashion it likes. What the Equal Protection Clause forbids, but the Court today allows, is the use of these standards hand-in-hand with racial discrimination.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="TextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_da5e78aa396048d5896e44f7ceba231d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />539 U.S. at 346, 363 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Critics of preferential treatment further argue that it masks rather than addresses the core problem, which is inadequate preparation for law school. According to Clint Bolick, director of litigation at the Institute of Justice:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">So long as we have a regime of racial preferences that problem is not going to be addressed head-on. . . . When affirmative action is practiced that way it does not have any impact in expanding the pool of qualified applicants, which is what the goal should be. The way affirmative action is practiced today is cosmetic and superficial. It does not offer a systemic cure for serious social problems. It simply reshuffles the deck [among applicants].<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2380" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2380" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">133</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">In Bolick’s view, current policies do not help those most disadvantaged by longstanding discrimination. Preferential treatment simply enables the most privileged nonwhite candidates to obtain better positions, and to attend better law schools than their credentials justify.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This view was in the background of the challenge to the University of Texas’s affirmative action program, which reached the Supreme Court in 2016. In <a id="dabmci_8d5c323522024099aad307c4d07aa29d" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</span>, 570 U.S. 297 (2013), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1022" class="pagebreak" title="1022">1022</span>Abigail Fisher, a white student, claimed the University of Texas denied her admission based on her race. The Supreme Court had taken Abigail Fisher’s case once before. On that occasion, it ended up issuing a narrow opinion reaffirming that educational diversity is an interest sufficient to overcome the general ban on racial classifications by the government, but cautioned that public institutions must have good reasons for the methods they use to achieve that goal. Colleges and universities, Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority, must demonstrate that “available, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice” before using race in admissions decisions. <a id="dabmci_50dce3ceec504a75b8235a6e4437343a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />570 U.S. at 312.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The first time around, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit for review of U.T.’s admission standard under its newly-enunciated test, and a divided panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed that the Texas plan indeed passed muster. The Fifth Circuit stressed that Texas’s plan does not use race to the exclusion of other factors. Instead, as U.T.’s director of admissions explained, “race provides—like language, whether or not someone is the first in their family to attend college, and family responsibilities—important context in which to evaluate applicants, and is only one aspect of the diversity that the University seeks to attain.”</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> According to the Fifth Circuit, this limited use of race was justifiable: “We are persuaded that to deny U.T. Austin its limited use of race in its search for holistic diversity would hobble the richness of the educational experience.”</span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The group that led that the Texas affirmative action challenge, Students for Fair Admissions, subsequently challenged the admission program of Harvard University. The organization represents Asian-American applicants, whose academic credentials are, on average, stronger than those of all other racial groups. Asian Americans would constitute 43 percent of the Harvard class if admission were based on SAT and GPA alone; instead they have comprised roughly 20 percent of Harvard’s admitted class over the past several years. Based on these statistics, the plaintiffs argue that Harvard has intentionally discriminated against Asian-American applicants by systematically </span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">downgrading them through the use of “personal ratings”—a score designed to capture qualities such as “leadership potential, “courage,” and “grit.” This formula, plaintiffs contend, allowed the university to upgrade the applications of African-American and Latinx students in an effort to balance the racial makeup of the class.</span>

Administrators at these schools argue that the GRE is better suited to assess the potential of students from diverse backgrounds because it tests knowledge acquired in college as opposed to abstract skills (like logic games). Using the GRE also offers students flexibility, since it is necessary for admission to other graduate programs. And it helps law schools achieve diversity goals because scores do not count toward <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. News</span> rankings. Beyond the test, how much relevance should school admission officers attach to nonquantitative criteria, such as socioeconomic background, leadership ability, community service, employment experiences, and perseverance in the face of hardship? Especially in light of the claims in the Harvard case, do you think greater reliance on such factors leave too much room for idiosyncratic or biased judgments? Or are such criteria an imperfect but essential way to holistically assess candidates in order to achieve a diverse student body? </p>

In their <span style="font-style: italic;">Grutter</span> dissents, both Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist emphasized the small deviation from year to year in the percentages of admitted minority students during most of the period under review and the fact that administrators actively monitored the number of minorities throughout the admission process. When does the pursuit of a critical mass of minority students become a quota?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is “diversity” the best rationale for racial and ethnic preferences? Consider the views of one self-described “tepid” supporter of affirmative action, a black <span style="font-style: italic;">Time</span> editor, Perry Bacon. He objects to placing a burden on students or workers to contribute a “uniquely black viewpoint.”</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">But the fact is, a Michigan Law School student would learn a lot more about the “unique experience” of blacks in America if he spent a day at an inner-city school in Detroit than he would in a torts class with me. In fact, a white person who grew up poor has an equally or perhaps more diverse perspective, and yet my blackness counts so much more in affirmative action. . . . Let’s stop using this notion of diversity to sidestep the real issue. Colleges don’t want more minority students so we can all hold hands and sing <span style="font-style: italic;">It’s a Small World</span>. Why can’t we just say what the real goal is: the creation of a multiethnic élite? I think young minorities can help form that élite. But I want to join that élite and be expected to deliver the “unique experience” of my whole life rather than an assumed experience based solely on the color of my skin.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.2388" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section26.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.2388" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">141</a></span></p>

      <p class="FileLine">National Black Law Journal, Winter 1989, at 1.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextHeadCentered">Race in the Law School Classroom</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Minority students across the country have waged a series of protests to draw attention to problems of diversity in the nation’s law schools. Although the students’ bottom line demand is often for the recruitment of more minority faculty and students, the anger and frustration apparent in these protests indicate that the disappointment is not simply over the lack of “color” in the hallways. The dissatisfaction goes much deeper—to the substantive dynamics of the classroom and their particular impact on minority students. In many instances, minority students’ values, beliefs, and experiences clash not only with those of their classmates but also with those of their professors. Yet because of the dominant view in academe that legal analysis can be taught without directly addressing conflicts of individual values, experiences, and world views, these conflicts seldom, if ever, reach the surface of the classroom discussion. Dominant beliefs in the objectivity of legal discourse serve to suppress the conflict by discounting the relevance of any particular perspective in legal analysis and by positing an analytical stance that has no specific cultural, political, or class characteristics. I call this dominant mode “perspectivelessness.”</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">This norm of perspectivelessness is problematic in general, and particularly burdensome on minority students. While it seems relatively straightforward that objects, issues, and other phenomena are interpreted from the vantage point of the observer, many law classes are conducted as though it is possible to create, weigh, and evaluate rules and arguments in ways that neither reflect nor privilege any particular perspective or world view. Thus, law school discourse proceeds with the expectation that students will learn to perform the standard mode of legal reasoning and embrace its presumption of perspectivelessness. When this expectation is combined with the fact that what is understood as objective or neutral is often the embodiment of a white middle-class world view, minority students are placed in a difficult situation. To assume the air of perspectivelessness that is expected in the classroom, minority students must participate in the discussion as though they were not African-American or Latino, but colorless legal analysts. The consequence of adopting this colorless mode is that when the discussion involves racial minorities, minority students are expected to stand apart from their history, their identity, and sometimes their own immediate circumstances and discuss issues without making reference to the reality that the “they” or “them” being discussed is from their perspective “we” or “us.” Conversely, on the few occasions when minority students are invited to incorporate their racial identity and experiences into their comments, they often feel as though they have been put on the spot. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1028" class="pagebreak" title="1028">1028</span>Moreover, their comments are frequently disregarded by other students who believe that since race figures prominently in such comments, the minority students—unlike themselves—are expressing biased, self-interested, or subjective opinions. The result is that minority students can seldom ground their analysis in their own racial experiences without risking some kind of formal or informal sanction. Minority students escape the twin problems of objectification and subjectification in discussions when minority experiences are deemed to be completely irrelevant, or are obscured by the centering of the discussion elsewhere. The price of this sometimes welcomed invisibility, however, can be intense alienation. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Instructors create the conditions that lead to the objectification of minority students by narrowly framing classroom discussions as simple exercises in rule application and by not giving students permission to step outside the doctrinal boundaries to comment on or critique the rules.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">In each of these cases minority students confront difficult choices. To play the game right, they have to assume a stance that denies their own identity and requires them to adopt an apparently objective stance as the given starting point of analysis. Should they step outside the doctrinal constraints, not only have they failed in their efforts to “think like a lawyer,” they have committed an even more stigmatizing <span style="font-style: italic;">faux pas</span>: they have taken the discussion far afield by revealing their emotional preoccupation with their racial identity.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Given the infrequency with which most law teachers create the space for and legitimize responses that acknowledge the significance of a racially-informed perspective, it is not surprising that minority students often choose the role of “good student” rather than run the risk of appearing to be incapable of exercising the proper decorum and engagement in legal analysis. Such experiences teach minority students that in law school discourse, their cultural and experiential knowledge is not important or relevant. Indeed, they learn that any failure to observe the constructed dichotomy between the rational—read non-racial and non-personal—and the emotional—read racial and experiential—may elicit derision or disregard. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Many of these problems could be averted if professors framed discussions so that the boundaries of acceptable responses were not so narrowly constructed. This would give students permission to drop the air of perspectivelessness, to stand within their own identity, and to critique the doctrine or rule directly. Yet instructors often fail to broaden the parameters of the discussion, perhaps believing that to do so would legitimize the inclusion of racial perspectives where none had existed before. Some may assert that since white students do not feel the need to fall back on personal, racialized views of the world, neither should minorities. This belief, however, is predicated on an erroneous view that white students—and indeed the instructors themselves—are not also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1029" class="pagebreak" title="1029">1029</span>reflecting racialized views when they frame and discuss issues. They accept the absence of an explicitly racial referent as evidence that the doctrinal or substantive framework being discussed is objective and race-neutral. However, majority as well as minority students view the world through a consciousness constructed in part through race. The appearance of perspectivelessness is simply the illusion by which the dominant perspective is made to appear neutral, ordinary, and beyond question. As a result, while the perspectives of minority students are often identified as racial, the perspectives of their majority classmates are not. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">An equally stressful, but conceptually more obscure experience is what I call subjectification. This is experienced by minority students when, after learning to leave their race at the door, their racial identities are unexpectedly dragged into the classroom by their instructor to illustrate a point or to provide the basis for a command performance of “show and tell.” The eyes of the class are suddenly fixed upon the minority student who is then expected to offer some sort of minority “testimony”. . . . Usually, the effort to elicit the minority perspective is a cue that the discussion is a policy—as opposed to a doctrinal—discussion. The racial conflict, if any, is seen as occurring outside of the classroom while the objective of the discussion is apparently to determine how best to address the problem. To the extent that the minority student can participate in this debate, she is viewed as a biased or specially interested party and thus, her perspectives are probably regarded as being too subjective to have a significant bearing on the ultimate solution. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Some of these dilemmas can be addressed by altering the way racial issues are framed, by presenting racism as a serious societal problem, and by explicitly deprivileging dominant perspectives. Instructors wishing to explore racial issues without contributing to the anxiety of minority students should resist framing minority experiences in ways that make such experiences appear to be disconnected to broader issues and that can be easily forgotten as soon as the policy discussion is over. Instead, the frame should be shifted so as to illuminate the connection between racial subordination and the values and interests that appear to be race-neutral or that are simply taken for granted. This would provide space for minority students to contribute to discussions in ways that value their perspectives and do not put them on the spot.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">How should law schools address diversity issues in the context of supporting student organizations? This issue came to the fore in the case <a id="dabmci_58625c12af6544449b0ceaf3d8fae717" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</span>, 561 U.S. 661 (2010). The case involved Hastings College of Law, a school within the University of California system. Hastings extends official recognition of student groups through its “Registered Student Organization” (RSO) program. Though, of course, students can meet together even if they don’t organize into an RSO, several benefits attend this school-approved status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as Hastings’s name and logo. In exchange for recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. In particular, all RSOs must comply with the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and sexual orientation. Specifically, the policy states:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discriminatory practices. All groups, including administration, faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned student residence facilities and programs sponsored by [Hastings], are governed by this policy of nondiscrimination. [Hasting’s] policy on nondiscrimination is to comply fully with applicable law.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access and treatment in Hastings-sponsored programs and activities.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextParagraph"><a id="dabmci_955eef98087a472da4c2ec7eb70493d0" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />561 U.S. at 670. Hastings interpreted this policy to mandate that RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions, regardless of his or her status or beliefs.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the beginning of the 2004–2005 academic year, however, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO formed the Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that charters student chapters at law schools throughout the United States. These chapters must adopt bylaws that, among other things, require members and officers to sign a “Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in accord with the Statement’s principles. Chapters must exclude from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page1033" class="pagebreak" title="1033">1033</span>affiliation anyone who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” or holds religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an application for RSO status. Several days later, Hastings rejected the application on the grounds that CLS’s bylaws did not comply with the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, as CLS barred students based on religion and sexual orientation. CLS subsequently sued under <a id="dabmci_06c4ff9ced9a425996f442804e3972e8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Hastings’s disapproval violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">In a five-to-four opinion, the Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the all-comers condition on RSO status was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral and therefore did not violate CLS’s right to free speech. In so doing, the Court reviewed, and credited, administrators’ justifications for their judgment:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">First, the open-access policy “ensures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by [RSOs] are available to all students.” Just as “Hastings does not allow its professors to host classes open only to those students with a certain status or belief,” so the Law School may decide, reasonably in our view, “that the . . . educational experience is best promoted when all participants in the forum must provide equal access to all students.” RSOs, we count it significant, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for membership restrictions. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Third, the Law School reasonably adheres to the view that an all-comers policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, “encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.” . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">Fourth, Hastings’ policy, which incorporates—in fact, subsumes—state-law proscriptions on discrimination, conveys the Law School’s decision “to decline to subsidize with public monies and benefits conduct of which the people of California disapprove.” . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers requirement are surely reasonable in light of the RSO forum’s purposes.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Over the past ten years, something quite dramatic has happened. An inkling was provided in <span style="font-style: italic;">CLS v. Martinez</span>, a 5–4 decision. Hastings Law School threw the Christian Legal Society off campus because of the society’s beliefs that members should hold traditional Christian beliefs on a variety of subjects, including on sexual relations, and only people of the opposite sex should be allowed to marry. The court allowed Hastings to get away with just that. It was an eye-opening decision. The claim of religious liberty could not stand up with an idea supported by influential segments of society.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">Law schools play a particularly important role in advancing the value of diversity in the legal profession. Law schools identify the faculty talent that educates and produces new scholarship and the student talent that continually renews the profession. Law schools also choose the knowledge, skills, and values that form the legal canon and create an identity for lawyers. . . . In short, law schools occupy a central role in forming and transforming the intellectual capital, the group identity, and culture of the profession. For this reason, law schools are crucial to the project of making the profession more diverse. . . .</p>
      <p style="line-height: 1em;" class="TextParagraph">As law schools enact a diversity agenda, they can strengthen the consensus about the value of diversity to the profession and the larger society using oral and written messages, but, most importantly, through educational and management practices, such as the appointment of a full time Chief Diversity officer, that reflect equity and inclusion. Specifically, law schools can change perceptions, challenge stereotypes, and reduce unconscious bias when they hire, promote, and tenure a broadly diverse faculty and staff to teach and mentor a broadly diverse student bodies. By creating a diverse learning environment, law schools can model how to create a work force with the skills that will be needed by a more international, pluralistic and mobile client base. . . . Listed below are some of the actions that can be taken by law schools to enhance their existing diversity programs.</p>
