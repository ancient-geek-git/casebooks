      <p class="TextParagraph"><a id="_Toc451861238" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922231" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />The term “law of lawyering,” or “law governing lawyers,” refers to all the bodies of formal and informal law that regulate the professional conduct of lawyers. These include: (1) the ethics rules issued under the inherent power of the courts—which supply the most significant and detailed authority; (2) bar formal opinions, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span>, and ABA Standards for various legal specialties; (3) court rules (such as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and state-court counterparts), generally-applicable criminal and civil statutes and regulations, and fiduciary law; (4) the United States Constitution; and (5) tort law, in the form of legal malpractice actions. We discuss each below, as well as the parallel bodies of law governing judicial conduct.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861218" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218802" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908351" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Ethics Rules and the Inherent Power of the Courts</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To practice law, you must belong to at least one state’s bar, which means simply that you have been admitted to practice in that state. Lawyers may belong to the bar of more than one state. The “bar” is nothing more than the set of all lawyers admitted to practice in the state at a given time. It is not the same as a bar association (a professional organization of lawyers).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.180" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.180" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></span> To practice in the federal courts of a state, lawyers require separate admission, although generally that merely involves the payment of a fee (and no special bar exam is required).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Ethics rules are promulgated by the courts of each state, as part of their inherent power to administer the courts. “Inherent powers consist of all powers reasonably required to enable a court to perform efficiently its judicial functions, to protect its dignity, independence, and integrity, and to make its lawful actions effective.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.181" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.181" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></span> This “inherent power doctrine” rests on separation of powers principles, and courts have occasionally struck down legislation permitting nonlawyers to practice law, as an invasion by the legislative branch of the courts’ inherent powers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.182" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.182" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">3</a></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page52" class="pagebreak" title="52">52</span>Although the outer bounds of inherent power are unclear, the authority of the courts to issue binding ethics rules and to discipline lawyers for ethics violations is firmly settled. However, courts have acknowledged that the legislative and executive branches can also regulate the legal profession—and they do.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Today’s state ethics codes are titled “Rules of Professional Conduct.” (In the past they were called Canons of Professional Ethics or the Code of Professional Responsibility, and older judicial decisions refer to them under those names.) All states base their Rules of Professional Conduct on a set of Model Rules of Professional Conduct produced by the American Bar Association (ABA). But it is important to understand that the Model Rules are not the law of any state. The ABA is a private organization with no rulemaking authority. Its Model Rules are just what the title suggests: a model that states can use as a blueprint for their own rules.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In fact, all states modify the ABA’s rules to suit their own preferences—no state’s rules are a 100 percent match with the Model Rules. Textbooks, including this one, focus on the Model Rules, and the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) tests knowledge of the Model Rules. But—we repeat—the Model Rules are not the law. The state codes are.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Formally, a state’s ethics code (its Rules of Professional Conduct) is promulgated by its highest court. In practice, courts delegate the task of rule writing to committees of lawyers, and then adopt what the committee produces. This is one way in which law is a self-regulating profession: The bar writes the ethics rules, and judges (not legislators) adopt them.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The courts also supervise the lawyer discipline system. In some states, nominally independent agencies are tasked with handling disciplinary matters. Each oversight organization has a staff of professional prosecutors, called <span style="font-style: italic;">bar counsel</span>, to investigate grievances against lawyers and, if necessary, prosecute lawyers for ethics violations. Hearings take place before disciplinary panels composed mostly of lawyers. (Many states also include at least one nonlawyer on disciplinary panels.) This is the second way the legal profession regulates itself. If either side appeals a panel decision, it goes to the courts. We discuss the disciplinary process in detail in Section E, below.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861219" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218803" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756221" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908352" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Bar Opinions, the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, and ABA Standards</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">State and local bars and bar associations provide ethical guidance to lawyers in several forms. First, every state’s Rules of Professional Conduct include “Comments” on the rules. So do the ABA Model Rules, and state rule-makers often copy the Model Rules’ Comments verbatim or nearly verbatim. These Comments explain each rule’s rationale and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page53" class="pagebreak" title="53">53</span>provide interpretive guidance. Unlike the Rules themselves, the Comments are non-binding. Second, most state bars run hotlines staffed by volunteer lawyers to answer lawyers’ run-of-the-mill questions in a time-sensitive manner. For larger issues, state and local bar associations—and also the ABA—have ethics committees that write interpretive opinions. Written by volunteers, bar opinions naturally vary in quality; the best are impressively reasoned analyses of the rules comparable to good judicial opinions. In roughly a dozen states, these opinions have binding force. In most states, meanwhile, bar opinions have no force of law, but the courts treat them as persuasive. This means, as a practical matter, that lawyers who follow the opinions’ guidance have a powerful defense against ethics charges; in that respect, following the opinions is usually a “safe harbor” for lawyers, even in states where the opinions are not formally binding.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.183" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.183" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">4</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the 1990s, the American Law Institute (ALI) created a compendious <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers</span>, with detailed black-letter rules and Reporters’ comments. Like all ALI Restatements, it draws on case law and aims to provide a statement of the law in the majority of jurisdictions. It sometimes differs from the ABA Model Rules and it is often much more specific. Like the Model Rules, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Restatement</span> lacks the force of law, but it has powerful persuasive authority, and it often provides the best guidance for lawyers facing ticklish issues that the rules do not clearly resolve.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ABA also issues model standards for specialty practice areas, for example the ABA Standards on Criminal Justice (for prosecution and defense lawyers) and the ABA Model Standards for Family and Divorce Mediation. You’ll note, for example, that we frequently cite to the ABA’s Standards on Criminal Justice in Chapter 8, as we discuss dilemmas of advocacy in the criminal law paradigm.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218804" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756222" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908353" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Court Rules, Statutes, and Regulations</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Lawyers are also bound by court rules and generally-applicable statutes and regulations.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Obviously, lawyers must follow the rules of procedure and evidence in the courts before which they practice. Some of these rules run parallel to ethics provisions. For example, <a id="dabmci_f3e3fbe30eca4a398e2bad6138e2c690" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, discussed in detail in Chapter 7, prohibits frivolous legal filings and arguments, and Model Rule 3.1<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.1&quot; \s &quot;Model Rule 3.1&quot; \c 16 " /> does the same.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The legal profession also is bound by generally-applicable federal and state criminal laws, banking and securities laws, antitrust law, consumer protection law, antidiscrimination law, and other law of general applicability. Thus, for example, in <a id="dabmci_75d344f3dddc4ade88b3de926ffcf7d4" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Goldfarb v. Virginia</span>, 421 U.S. 773 (1975), the Supreme Court struck down minimum fee schedules set <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page54" class="pagebreak" title="54">54</span>by state bars as an antitrust violation. As for criminal law, consider, for example, <a id="dabmci_42ebf91132964c75b459f86db93a8f5e" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Bronston, United States v.&quot; \s &quot;A;O;25;dabmci_42ebf91132964c75b459f86db93a8f5e_1;I72da38f3928511d9a707f4371c9c34f0;;0;F;United States v. Bronston, 658 F.2d 920 (2d Cir. 1981)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Bronston</span>, 658 F.2d 920 (2d Cir. 1981). Bronston was a partner in a New York City law firm. Unbeknownst to the firm, he did legal work for a major financier even though the firm was representing a client bidding against the financier for the same municipal contract on which Bronston was advising him. Bronston’s conduct was a clear-cut conflict of interest—an ethics violation—but he was also convicted under a federal fraud statute and sentenced to four months in prison. Two decades later, a partner in a renowned Wall Street law firm went to prison in Wisconsin for bankruptcy fraud because of an undisclosed conflict of interest.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.184" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.184" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">5</a></span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Both cases illustrate that ethics violations can also be criminal offenses. The conflict of interest laws governing lawyers working for the federal government are also backed by criminal penalties.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.185" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.185" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">6</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Quite apart from criminal law, states statutorily regulate the practice of law, and that regulation is quite extensive in the nation’s two largest jurisdictions, California and New York. In some contexts, the federal government regulates lawyer conduct as well. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires lawyers to report possible securities violations by client companies, in some cases by going over their supervisors’ heads directly to the company’s board of directors. We discuss these Sarbanes-Oxley requirements extensively in Chapter 11.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Next, some state and federal agencies have adopted their own rules governing the conduct of lawyers practicing before them. Violation of these rules can result in loss of the right to practice before the agency.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.186" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.186" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">7</a></span> For example, lawyers practicing before federal immigration courts are forbidden from engaging in “contumelious or otherwise obnoxious conduct”—an unusually-worded rule that may well send immigration practitioners scurrying to their dictionaries.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.187" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.187" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">8</a></span> So too, immigration lawyers are forbidden from “knowingly or with reckless disregard” making a false statement of fact or law—arguably a more stringent rule than Model Rule 3.3(a)(1)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.3(a)(1)&quot; \s &quot;Model Rule 3.3(a)(1)&quot; \c 16 " />, which forbids knowingly false statements, but not recklessly false statements.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.188" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.188" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">9</a></span> The Treasury Department also has promulgated a detailed set of regulations to govern all professionals—nonlawyers as well as lawyers—who practice before the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In addition to rules, statutes, and regulations, lawyers have fiduciary obligations to their clients. Although the retainer agreement <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page55" class="pagebreak" title="55">55</span>between client and lawyer takes the form of a contract, its fiduciary character means, in the words of the classic case <span style="font-style: italic;">Meinhard v. Salmon</span>, that the lawyer “is held to something stricter than the morals of the marketplace.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.189" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.189" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">10</a></span> Lawyers must place the clients’ interests above their own. In many contexts, the lawyer is the client’s agent, legally empowered to speak for the client and bind the client. Fiduciary duties such as confidentiality and the avoidance of conflicts of interest are rooted in agency law—although the specific contours of those obligations are spelled out in the applicable Rules of Professional Conduct, which sometimes differ from agency standards.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.190" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.190" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">11</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861221" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218805" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756223" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908354" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Constitution</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Constitution supplies yet another set of relevant authority. In the area of criminal justice, Fifth Amendment standards of due process and the Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel govern lawyer conduct. For example, <a id="dabmci_e45481070237494e93590fa67cd6f442" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Brady v.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)&quot; \c 3 " /><span style="font-style: italic;">Brady v. Maryland</span>, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), requires prosecutors to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense, and Model Rule 3.8(d)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 3.8(d)&quot; \s &quot;Model Rule 3.8(d)&quot; \c 16 " /> makes this an ethics obligation as well. In addition, as discussed in Chapter 13 on Market Regulation, in <a id="dabmci_1280aa6bf1d042af997334af65055d81" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Bates v.

State Bar of Arizona</span>, 433 U.S. 350 (1977), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects some forms of lawyer speech, including attorney advertising. And, the following year, in <a id="dabmci_99aa5cfc2acf49eabf797a10b7bb4241" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-weight: bolder;"><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Primus, In re&quot; \s &quot;A;O;12;dabmci_99aa5cfc2acf49eabf797a10b7bb4241_1;Ia0a00ac19c9a11d993e6d35cc61aab4a;;0;F;In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 (1978)&quot; \c 3 " /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">In re Primus</span>, 436 U.S. 412 (1978), the Supreme Court upheld the right of a lawyer for a nonprofit organization to solicit clients, as a form of protected political expression.

      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861222" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218806" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908355" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Tort Law (Malpractice)</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A final constraint on attorney behavior comes from tort law and specifically the tort of legal malpractice. Lawyers who commit malpractice by departing from the customs of the profession can be liable to clients, and sometimes to third parties, injured by their misconduct. We discuss the malpractice system in Section D.2 below.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is not automatically malpractice even if it causes injury. In practice, however, a client who sues a lawyer for malpractice and can prove the lawyer violated ethics rules will often have a winning case.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">For obvious reasons, malpractice insurers have a strong incentive to make sure that the lawyers they insure avoid ethics violations as well as other malpractice. Those insurers set conditions for purchasing malpractice policies, which may require a law firm to put a conflicts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page56" class="pagebreak" title="56">56</span>checking system in place, as well as a tickler system to ensure that lawyers do not miss deadlines. Insurers may require their own review of opinion letters by law firms, and they may conduct ethics audits of their policyholders. In this way, malpractice insurance providers become <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> ethics enforcers, and the conditions they attach to malpractice policies are, in effect, a “private” system of ethics regulation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.191" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.191" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">12</a></span></p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="2" class="Head1"><a id="_Toc451861223" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc451922228" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218807" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756225" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908210" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908356" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />B.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Professional Regulation and Choice of Law</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The above discussion reveals that lawyers are regulated by a complex web of state and federal laws, opinions, rules, and regulations. Beyond that, there is another layer of complexity because much of lawyers’ contemporary practice crosses state lines or sometimes national borders. This interstate and transnational mobility creates the difficult question of <span style="font-style: italic;">which</span> jurisdiction’s law governs a given lawyer’s conduct.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Where state ethics rules differ or conflict, Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.5&quot; \s &quot;8.5&quot; \c 16 " />8.5 offers guidance. States have always reserved the right to discipline lawyers whom they license regardless of where the lawyer’s misconduct occurred, and Rule 8.5(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.5(a)&quot; \s &quot;8.5(a)&quot; \c 16 " /> restates this “long-arm jurisdiction” principle. In addition, in 2002, the ABA amended Rule 8.5(a), to add the sentence: “A lawyer not admitted in this jurisdiction is also subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction if the lawyer provides or offers to provide any legal services in this jurisdiction.” As to the choice of law, Rule 8.5(b)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.5(b)&quot; \s &quot;8.5(b)&quot; \c 16 " /> provides:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[T]he rules of professional conduct to be applied shall be as follows:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />for conduct in connection with a matter pending before a tribunal, the rules of the jurisdiction in which the tribunal sits, unless the rules of the tribunal provide otherwise; and</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />for any other conduct, the rules of the jurisdiction in which the lawyer’s conduct occurred, or, if the predominant effect of the conduct is in a different jurisdiction, the rules of that jurisdiction shall be applied to the conduct. A lawyer shall not be subject to discipline if the lawyer’s conduct conforms to the rules of a jurisdiction in which the lawyer reasonably believes the predominant effect of the lawyer’s conduct will occur.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Stated differently, Rule 8.5(b)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.5(b)&quot; " /> provides that in litigation settings, the ethical rules of the forum tribunal apply. In non-litigation settings, the ethics rules that apply are those of the state where the conduct occurred, unless the conduct’s “predominant effect” was felt elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Still, both tests are susceptible to criticism. While the territorial approach arguably errs on the side of rigidity, the “predominant effect” test has been criticized for indeterminacy, as it may be impossible to know in advance where the predominant effect of the lawyer’s action might be.</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page57" class="pagebreak" title="57">57</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Beyond the question of indeterminacy, it may also seem puzzling that a state can exercise <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> disciplinary authority over a lawyer not licensed to practice in that state. After all, suspension and disbarment—the ultimate sanctions in lawyer discipline—by definition, apply only when the lawyer has a state license that can be suspended or revoked. However, courts and bar agencies have other sanctions available that can extend to lawyers from other states. A state can issue a private or public reprimand, and it can refuse ever to admit the lawyer to its own bar, even on a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice</span> basis. Perhaps most importantly, many states have reciprocal discipline relationships with other states. Under these reciprocity agreements, another state’s discipline of a lawyer may trigger discipline in the lawyer’s home state as well.</p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Federal-State Choice-of-Law</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Determining applicable standards of professional conduct by lawyers in federal courts has turned out to raise additional and vexing problems. Current practice varies widely among the ninety-four federal districts, and a lack of uniformity of each district’s rules of professional conduct makes it difficult for lawyers even to find out what the local rules are, much less comply with them. Some districts adopt the ethics rules of the state in which the court sits; others modify those rules slightly; still others have rules of their own, usually the ABA Model Rules. Furthermore, federal districts vary in their answers to the “<span style="font-style: italic;">Erie</span> question” of whether to adopt state-court interpretations of state rules or to develop a federal common law of professional responsibility.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The following problems illustrate the care with which lawyers must analyze choice-of-law problems to determine their ethical obligations.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="HeadMisc"><a id="_Toc451861224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218808" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756226" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908357" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Problem 1</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />You are bar counsel in State X. You have successfully prosecuted a discipline case against Mason, a lawyer licensed in X. Mason had filed a consumer class action against Ajax Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of a widely-used shampoo for head lice. The action alleged that the shampoo is ineffective. Ajax’s lead defense counsel, Ross, negotiated a settlement agreement with Mason in which Mason obtained a large fee while his clients obtained minimal damages. The agreement also required Mason not to tell plaintiffs the details of the negotiation, or their likelihood of obtaining a higher recovery if they declined the settlement offer. The representative clients learned of the agreement through a whistleblower on Ajax’s defense team. State X’s disciplinary authorities suspended Mason for violating Rules 1.4 (on communicating with clients) and 1.7 (on conflicts of interest).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">You are now considering disciplinary action against Ross, Ajax’s counsel, for violating Rule 8.4(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 8.4(a)&quot; \s &quot;8.4(a)&quot; \c 16 " />, which states: “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, <span style="font-style: italic;">knowingly assist or induce another to do so</span>, or do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page58" class="pagebreak" title="58">58</span>so through the acts of another” (emphasis added). You believe that Ross assisted or induced Mason to commit disciplinary violations because Ross wanted to settle the case on favorable terms. However, Ross is licensed in State Y (the state where Ajax is located) but not in State X. None of the members of Mason’s client class lives in State Y.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">If Ross and Mason negotiated the settlement agreement at a meeting in State Y, do you have jurisdiction to seek discipline against Ross in State X? What if they had negotiated the settlement agreement in State X? Alternatively, what if they negotiated the agreement electronically, each in their own home state? Should the physical location at which the agreement was negotiated matter?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Alternatively, you are bar counsel in State Z. On Ross’s advice, employees of Ajax have made fraudulent misrepresentations about the shampoo (asserting that it has no problems) and the progress of the lawsuit (asserting that it has no factual basis) to consumer protection officials in State Z. Ross is not licensed in State Z, and none of Mason’s clients live in Z. Do you have jurisdiction to pursue disciplinary charges against Ross in Z for violating Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 1.2(d)&quot; \s &quot;1.2(d)&quot; \c 16 " />1.2(d), “A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage . . . in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent”?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You work for the St. Louis, Missouri office of a large national law firm. Your firm is headquartered in New York, and you are licensed in both Missouri and New York. Currently you are representing Hypertronics, a closely-held Missouri-based technology company that is negotiating its own sale to ALS, a high-tech company whose headquarters and principal facilities are located in Princeton, New Jersey. You are also licensed to practice in New Jersey. You have done a variety of paperwork for the pending sale.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Together with Hypertronics executives and the company’s general counsel, you have flown to New York City, where the deal will be closed at a meeting with ALS executives. The meeting will take place at your firm’s New York offices. In New York, Hypertronics’s general counsel reveals to you that, due to unanticipated technical problems in some of its new product designs, the company may default on several major contracts. These contracts had figured prominently in setting the purchase price for Hypertronics. Without them, it is highly unlikely that ALS would have agreed to buy Hypertronics for the agreed-upon price. If, as seems likely, Hypertronics defaults on the contracts after being purchased, ALS would lose a substantial amount of money.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Hypertronics’ general counsel maintains that the risk of default is not sufficiently high, and its materiality is not sufficiently clear, to require disclosure to the purchaser. Over your protests, counsel insists <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page59" class="pagebreak" title="59">59</span>that the closing proceed at the agreed-upon price. You believe that this would constitute a civil (not criminal) fraud under both Missouri and New Jersey law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The gnarly problem is that New Jersey’s confidentiality rule requires you to disclose client confidences if that is necessary to prevent client fraud that would inflict substantial financial injury, but Missouri’s rule forbids the disclosure. New York’s rule permits the disclosure but does not require it. The relevant confidentiality rules in the three states are as follows.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Missouri Rules of Professional Conduct 4–1.6:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or the disclosure is permitted by Rule 4–1.6(b).</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">The exceptions provided in paragraph (b) do not include revealing confidences in cases of client fraud. Nor, under relevant law, is disclosure “impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation.”</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6(b)(1) provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A lawyer shall reveal [information relating to representation of a client] to the proper authorities, as soon as, and to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary, to prevent the client . . . from committing a criminal, illegal or fraudulent act that the lawyer reasonably believes is likely to result in . . . substantial injury to the financial interest of property of another.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">New Jersey Rule 1.6(e) provides:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Reasonable belief for purposes of [Rule] 1.6 is the belief or conclusion of a reasonable lawyer that is based upon information that has some foundation in fact and constitutes prima facie evidence of the matters referred to in subsection . . . (b) . . . .</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">Finally, New York’s confidentiality rules permit you to reveal confidential information “to prevent the client from committing a crime,” and “to withdraw a written or oral opinion or representation previously given by the lawyer and reasonably believed by the lawyer still to be relied upon by a third person, where the lawyer has discovered that the opinion or representation was based on materially inaccurate information or is being used to further a crime or fraud.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One other gnarly problem: Each of the three states has a choice of law rule in its state version of Rule 8.5. The Missouri and New Jersey choice of law rules are identical to Model Rule 8.5(b). New York’s choice of law provision has an important substantive difference from the ABA rule. Whereas Model Rule 8.5(b)(2) focuses on the jurisdiction where the conduct took place, <a id="dabmci_b5b3ba96bc4440f5bb0a694ade8af9fc" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />New York Rule of Professional Conduct 8.5(b)(2)(ii) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page60" class="pagebreak" title="60">60</span>focuses on the jurisdiction where the lawyer principally practices. It reads:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">If the lawyer is licensed to practice in this state and another jurisdiction, the rules to be applied shall be the rules of the admitting jurisdiction in which the lawyer principally practices; provided, however, that if particular conduct clearly has its predominant effect in another jurisdiction in which the lawyer is licensed to practice, the rules of that jurisdiction shall be applied to that conduct.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is the “predominant effect” of your conduct in Missouri, New Jersey, or New York? Or is there no predominant effect in one state rather than another? Which state’s choice-of-law rule applies?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">b)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Which state’s confidentiality rule applies?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">c)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should you reveal the information about Hypertronics’s potential contract default or not?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">d)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Suppose that ALS, the New Jersey company, also has a major facility in New York. How does that affect the analysis?</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One way to approach these questions is to notice that if you consummate the deal ALS might suffer loss, while if you don’t it is Hypertronics that might suffer loss. Imagine that whichever company suffers the loss files a grievance against you in all three state bars. How would each state’s bar counsel approach the problem?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The first formulations of professional ethics date back some 2500 years to principles established by medical practitioners. The first British barristers were subject to rules of their Inns of Court, and in the mid-18th century, Parliament passed a comprehensive statute regulating solicitors. However, it was not until the early 20th century that American lawyers formalized a similar body of standards in an official code.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">During the bar’s early years, its ethical norms arose largely through professional traditions and informal community oversight. Judicial sanctions were relatively rare and usually occurred in response to violations of criminal or civil law.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.192" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.192" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">13</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In 1906, the ABA issued an influential report recommending a formal ethics code. The immediate impetus for the Committee’s formation was a Harvard University address by then-President Theodore <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page61" class="pagebreak" title="61">61</span>Roosevelt that rebuked corporate lawyers for helping powerful clients evade regulatory legislation. The ABA’s president authorized a Committee to consider whether the “ethics of our profession rise to the high standards which its position of influence in the country demands.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.193" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.193" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">14</a></span> As the following Report reflects, the Committee’s concerns were rather different than Roosevelt’s.</p>

      <p class="FileLine">600, 600–04 (1906 American Bar Association Reports).</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">To the American Bar Association:</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Your instructions direct us to report upon the “advisability and practicability” of the adoption of such a code [of ethics].</p>
      <p class="TextFlush">First, <span style="font-style: italic;">as to advisability</span>.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We are of opinion that the adoption of such a code is not only advisable, but under existing conditions of very great importance. There are several considerations moving us to this conclusion:</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />With Wilson, Webster and others, we believe that “justice is the great interest of man on earth.” And here in America, where justice reigns only by and through the people under forms of law, the lawyer is and must ever be the high priest at the shrine of justice. Under our form of government, unless the system for establishing and dispensing justice is so developed and maintained that there shall be continued confidence on the part of the public in the fairness, integrity and impartiality of its administration, there can be no lasting permanence to our republican institutions. Our profession is necessarily the keystone of the republican arch of government. Weaken this keystone by allowing it to be increasingly subject to the corroding and demoralizing influence of those who are controlled by graft, greed and gain, or other unworthy motive, and sooner or later the arch must fall. It follows that the future of the republic depends upon our maintenance of the shrine of justice pure and unsullied. We know it cannot be so maintained unless the conduct and motives of the members of our profession, of those who are the high priests of justice, are what they ought to be. It therefore becomes our plain and simple duty, our patriotic duty, to use our influence in every legitimate way to help make the American Bar what it ought to be. A code of ethics, adopted after due deliberation and promulgated by the American Bar Association, is one method in furtherance of this end.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />With the marvelous growth and development of our country and its resources, with the ranks of our profession ever extending, its fields of activities ever widening, the lawyer’s opportunities for good and evil are correspondingly enlarged, and the limits have not been reached. We <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page62" class="pagebreak" title="62">62</span>cannot be blind to the fact that, however high may be the motives of some, the trend of many is away from the ideals of the past and the tendency more and more to reduce our high calling to the level of a trade, to a mere means of livelihood or of personal aggrandizement. With the influx of increasing numbers, who seek admission to the profession mainly for its emoluments, have come new and changed conditions. Once possible ostracism by professional brethren was sufficient to keep from serious error the practitioner with no fixed ideals of ethical conduct; but now the shyster, the barratrously inclined, the ambulance chaser, the member of the Bar with a system of runners, pursue their nefarious methods with no check save the rope of sand of moral suasion so long as they stop short of actual fraud and violate no criminal law. These men believe themselves immune, the good or bad esteem of their co-laborers is nothing to them provided their itching fingers are not thereby stayed in their eager quest for lucre. Much as we regret to acknowledge it, we know such men are in our midst. Never having realized or grasped that indefinable ethical something which is the soul and spirit of law and justice, they not only lower the <span style="font-style: italic;">morale</span> within the profession, but they debase our high calling in the eyes of the public. They hamper the administration and even at times subvert the ends of justice. Such men are enemies of the republic; not true ministers of her courts of justice robed in the priestly garments of truth, honor and integrity. All such are unworthy of a place upon the rolls of the great and noble profession of the law.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Members of the Bar, like judges, are officers of the courts, and like judges should hold office only during good behavior. “Good behavior” should not be a vague, meaningless or shadowy term devoid of practical application save in flagrant cases. It should be defined and measured by such ethical standards, however high, as are necessary to keep the administration of justice pure and unsullied. Such standards may be crystallized into a written code of professional ethics, and a lawyer failing to conform thereto should not be permitted to practice or retain membership in professional organizations, local or national, formed, as is the American Bar Association, to promote the administration of justice and uphold the honor of the profession. Such a code in time will doubtless become of very great practical value by leading to action through the judiciary, for the courts may, as conditions warrant, require all candidates for the Bar to subscribe to suitable and reasonable canons of ethics as a condition precedent to admission. If this be done, the courts will be in an indisputable position to enforce, through suspension or disbarment, the observance of proper ethical conduct on the part of members of the Bar so admitted. Action by the national Association will also tend to develop uniformity between the various states, not only in form and method of statement, but also in application, and this we deem of practical importance. . . .</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page63" class="pagebreak" title="63">63</span>
      <p class="TextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A further reason why we report the advisability of canons of ethics being authoritatively promulgated arises from the fact that many men depart from honorable and accepted standards of practice early in their careers as the result of actual ignorance of the ethical requirements of the situation. Habits acquired when professional character is forming are lasting in their effects. The “thus it is written” of an American Bar Association code of ethics should prove a beacon light on the mountain of high resolve to lead the young practitioner safely through the snares and pitfalls of his early practice up to and along the straight and narrow path of high and honorable professional achievement.</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What group of lawyers is the Committee referring to as “the shyster, the barratrously inclined, the ambulance chaser, the member of the Bar with a system of runners”? What client populations do such lawyers serve?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Is it true that “the lawyer must ever be the high priest at the shrine of justice”?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861233" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218814" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756232" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908363" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;"><span style="margin-right: 5px;" /></span>The Evolution of Bar Ethical Rules</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Following the above 1906 Report, an ABA Committee drafted thirty-two model Canons of Ethics, which the Association approved in 1908 with little controversy or debate. Most states adopted the Canons, in some instances with local modifications. In most other states, the Canons were treated as a source of guidance to practitioners, courts, and disciplinary tribunals. However, substantial problems in enforcement soon arose, in part because of the standards’ brevity, generality, and attempt to combine moral exhortation with disciplinary mandates. The situation worsened as the number of Canons multiplied. By the late 1960s, there were forty-seven Canons, and some 1400 formal and informal opinions interpreting them by the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. The result was a proliferation of precedents lacking in coherence and consistency. Despite the unwieldy multiplication of texts, many significant ethical problems remained unacknowledged and unaddressed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.194" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.194" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">15</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The obvious inadequacies of this structure prompted the adoption of a new model Code of Professional Responsibility in 1969. Again, the proposed standards generated relatively little controversy. After approval by the ABA House of Delegates, the Code was ultimately adopted by every state except California, which enacted a similar body of rules.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In an effort to avoid the confusion that had surrounded the Canons, drafters of the Code divided the text into three parts: Canons, Ethical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page64" class="pagebreak" title="64">64</span>Considerations (ECs), and Disciplinary Rules (DRs). The nine Canons are “statements of axiomatic norms, expressing in general terms the standards of professional conduct.” ECs “are aspirational in character and represent the objectives toward which every member of the profession should strive.” DRs are the mandatory rules. Thus, the DRs are “hard law,” while the Canons and ECs are “soft law.” Understanding this structure is useful for contemporary lawyers because older judicial decisions and bar opinions refer to the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet, soon after the Code’s adoption, its content and structure began to provoke criticism. Some complained that the gulf between what the Ethical Considerations exhorted and what the Disciplinary Rules required fostered cynicism and created confusion concerning enforcement. Others identified further problems, including the Code’s failure to distinguish among various functions that lawyers performed (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</span>, advocate, counselor) and the inconsistency of its rules on competition with newly emerging Supreme Court decisions. Within a decade of the Code’s adoption, a special ABA Commission was already recommending an alternative set of standards, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Unlike their predecessors, the drafting of these Rules ignited considerable dispute. After heated debates, in 1983, the ABA approved a final version. Today, every state has adopted the Model Rules in large part, although with variations in certain substantive provisions, including the rules governing conflicts of interest and confidentiality.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.195" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.195" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">16</a></span> The Model Rules are often amended, but states do not always adopt the amendments. In practice, therefore, lawyers need to keep abreast of changes in their states’ Rules of Professional Conduct. Federal courts generally adopt the ethical provisions in force in the jurisdiction in which they sit.</p>
      <p class="TextHeadParagraph">
        <a id="_Toc451861234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">The Regulatory Framework</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The format of the Model Rules marks a significant departure from earlier codes. It provides black-letter rules with interpretive comments and little of the moral exhortation characteristic of its predecessors. A note on the Rules’ scope states that “the comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of each rule is authoritative.” The advantage is that this format is familiar to lawyers, and it eliminates potential confusion between hard law and aspiration. However, some commentators have been critical of the Model Rules’ loss of aspirational content, which reduces ethics to the lowest common denominator of required conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.196" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.196" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">17</a></span> </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">A related issue involves the process for formulating bar ethical rules. Once a profession’s regulatory focus shifts from expressing shared values to specifying minimum disciplinary standards, how much control should it exercise over the drafting and enforcement process? As the following excerpt highlights, a recurrent critique of the legal profession’s regulatory codes is that they have been established by the group to be regulated.</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="5" class="ExcerptHead"><a id="_Toc451861236" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218816" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908365" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Deborah L. Rhode, In the Interests of Justice</p>
      <p class="FileLine">(2000).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In an influential history of the legal profession sponsored by the American Bar Association, former Harvard Law School Dean Roscoe Pound assured ABA leaders that their organization was not the “same sort of thing as a retail grocers’ association.” If he was right, it was for the wrong reason. Lawyers, no less than grocers, are motivated by their own occupational interests. What distinguishes the American bar is its ability to present self-regulation as a societal value. Lawyers retain far more control over their own oversight than any other group. Such freedom from external accountability too often serves the profession at the expense of the public. . . . The problem is not that bar policies are baldly self-serving. Lawyers and judges who control regulatory decisions generally want to advance the public’s as well as the profession’s interests. Rather, the difficulty is one of tunnel vision, compounded by inadequate accountability. No matter how well intentioned, lawyers and former lawyers who regulate other lawyers cannot escape the economic, psychological, and political constraints of their position. Without external checks, these decision makers too often lose perspective about the points at which occupational and societal interests conflict. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Historically, the profession itself has controlled the regulatory process. For centuries, courts have asserted “inherent power” to regulate the practice of law. One rationale for this authority is that judges need to control the conduct and qualifications of lawyers in order to assure the proper administration of justice. A second justification is that self-regulation preserves the separation of powers and protects the independence of the legal profession from government domination. As a practical matter, American courts have delegated much of their regulatory authority to the organized bar, which defends its autonomy on similar grounds. According to the Preamble of the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, “An independent legal profession is an important force in preserving government under law, for abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members are not dependent on government for the right to practice.”</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">These arguments have considerable force, but they cannot justify the current regulatory structure. Protecting the bar from state control clearly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page66" class="pagebreak" title="66">66</span>serves important values, and nations that lack an independent profession have had difficulty safeguarding individual rights and checking official misconduct. But professional autonomy and government domination are not the only alternatives. Many countries with an independent bar impose far more checks on its self-regulatory powers. Such governmental efforts to increase lawyers’ accountability do not necessarily pose significant risks of retaliation or threats to the proper administration of justice. Indeed, American courts often recognize as much, and increasingly permit some regulation of attorneys by legislatures and administrative agencies.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Yet on the whole, lawyers retain considerable control over their own regulation. Bar codes of conduct claim to protect the public, but the public has had almost no voice in their formulation or enforcement. Only one nonlawyer served on the commissions that drafted the American Bar Association’s Model Code of Professional Responsibility and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. Only one was represented on the thirteen-member Ethics 2000 Commission that recommended revisions. The ABA House of Delegates, which has power to accept or amend model ethical codes, is composed exclusively of lawyers. And the state supreme courts that ultimately adopt, reject, or modify ABA standards, rely heavily on recommendations from their local bars. Although nonlawyers often have token representation on other regulatory bodies such as discipline committees, these lay members typically are selected by the profession. Almost never do they have the information, resources, leverage or accountability to consumer groups that would be necessary to check bar control.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The limitations of such a structure are obvious. Political and economic theorists have long recognized the self-regarding tendencies of self-regulating occupations. . . . The vast majority of surveyed lawyers favor bar control over regulatory processes despite the obvious potential for bias.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In justifying this control, lawyers often claim that ultimate governance authority rests with state judges, who do not face the same conflicts of interests as practitioners. Yet the history of self-regulation suggests the limitations of such oversight. Most judges are by training and temperament sympathetic to bar interests. Moreover, their reputation, effectiveness, and, sometimes, reelection, depend partly on cooperative relations with the profession. Seldom has the judiciary attempted to impose regulation that might seriously compromise lawyers’ status, income, or power. As a result, bar standards of conduct have been insufficiently demanding and inadequately enforced.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Deborah Rhode’s excerpt challenges the traditional justifications for the bar’s control over its own ethical codes and enforcement structures. How would bar leaders respond to this critique? How would you?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.197" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.197" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">18</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Does the preceding critique give adequate weight to the importance of an independent profession? Consider the way that the close relationship between American lawyers and judges has helped both maintain the independence of the profession and the rule of law. The importance of such a relationship was well illustrated in the much-publicized “lawyer’s uprising” in Pakistan in 2007. Following Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf’s politically-motivated suspension of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and sixty-plus other judges, thousands of lawyers took to the street. For months, the lawyers led human rights activists, media, and students in protest. In 2009, following Musharraf’s resignation under intense pressure, the judges were finally reinstated. It seemed an “improbable victory,” but one that was deeply inspiring to the global profession.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.198" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.198" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">19</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Other countries, including those with comparable legal traditions, such as Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, have moved to replace the profession’s self-regulatory powers with oversight by more independent bodies, including nonlawyers.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.199" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.199" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">20</a></span> Would such changes be desirable in this country? If so, how could they be achieved?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.200" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.200" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">21</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What changes would you expect in the American bar’s codes of conduct if groups other than lawyers played a central role in the codification process?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many commentators have challenged the desirability of state-based systems of ethical regulation for a profession whose work increasingly crosses state boundaries.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.201" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.201" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">22</a></span> Would it be more efficient for both lawyers and clients if the American bar was subject to national uniform standards of practice, admission, licensing, and discipline? Defenses of the current system take several forms. One is the standard justification for federalism: It is good to allow states to adjust to local circumstances and take somewhat different approaches to common concerns. Over time, the results from these varied approaches can help guide regulators to adopt the optimal strategy. Another argument rests not on claims that state regulation is desirable, but rather on assumptions that it is politically inevitable. Powerful groups within the profession see too little to gain from a move toward nationalization. How persuasive do you find these claims?</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A final matter involves international regulation. Increasing globalization in the market for legal services has correspondingly increased the importance of international standards that affect American lawyers. For example, the United Nations in 1990 adopted Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers as part of an effort to implement international standards in criminal justice. The Council of Bars and Law Societies of the European Union (CCBE), as the representative of bar associations in European Union countries, adopted a Code of Conduct in 1988, which was revised most recently in 2019.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.202" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.202" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">23</a></span> Conflict of laws issues can arise among national jurisdictions concerning lawyer regulation.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As noted above, American courts have traditionally asserted inherent power to regulate the practice of law. The tradition has its roots in thirteenth century English practices, when Edward I vested authority in the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas to determine those fit to appear before the bench. In disbarment proceedings before these early English courts, attorneys guilty of misconduct were literally cast over the “bar,” a wooden barrier separating judges and clerks from lawyers, litigants, and witnesses.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In this country, eighteenth and nineteenth century courts seldom exercised their disciplinary power. Community disapproval and lack of referrals were the primary sanction for professional misconduct and the inadequacy of this approach was a major impetus for the formation of bar associations. The rise of integrated (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> compulsory) bar associations in the early twentieth century brought an expansion in regulatory power. Under legislative or judicial mandate, both voluntary and integrated bars gradually acquired authority to investigate misconduct and to impose sanctions, subject to court oversight. The procedures governing lawyer discipline have varied from state to state, although they all must meet constitutional requirements. Because current disciplinary proceedings are “quasi-criminal” in nature, courts have extended basic due process safeguards such as (1) the opportunity to confront evidence and cross-examine witnesses, <a id="dabmci_700346d8bf2d48308c060274db10a918" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span data-field="TA \l &quot;Willner v.

      <p class="TextParagraph">The effectiveness of disciplinary structures is a matter of continuing concern.

Underlying this discussion are broader questions about self-regulation raised earlier. Are there inherent problems in a regulatory system controlled by the group to be regulated?

      <p class="TextParagraph">[Editors’ Note: The case arose after Tammy Forsberg retained attorney John R. Casey to represent her in a personal injury action. Having settled the claim for $35,000, Casey (who was entitled to a one-third contingency fee) declined to provide Forsberg with her two-thirds share of the recovery. After several unsuccessful efforts to collect, Forsberg hired James Himmel to represent her. Casey subsequently agreed to pay $75,000 in settlement of the claim and Forsberg agreed not to initiate criminal, civil, or disciplinary charges. When Casey failed to honor that agreement, Himmel sued and won a judgment of $100,000. However, he received no fee because, despite the judgment, Forsberg ultimately collected only $15,400 and Himmel’s retainer agreement gave him one-third of the recovery in excess of the amount owed on the original claim.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Prior to retaining Himmel, Forsberg had contacted the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Committee (ARDC). When investigation revealed other complaints against Casey, ARDC initiated an action and subsequently disbarred Casey by consent. The ARDC then pursued charges against Himmel for failing to report Casey’s misconduct. On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court sustained those charges.]</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page71" class="pagebreak" title="71">71</span>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Justice Stamos</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We begin our analysis by examining whether a client’s complaint of attorney misconduct to the Commission can be a defense to an attorney’s failure to report the same misconduct. Respondent offers no authority for such a defense and our research has disclosed none. Common sense would dictate that if a lawyer has a duty under the Code, the actions of a client would not relieve the attorney of his own duty. Accordingly, while the parties dispute whether or not respondent’s client informed the Commission, that question is irrelevant to our inquiry in this case. We have held that the canons of ethics in the Code constitute a safe guide for professional conduct, and attorneys may be disciplined for not observing them. . . . A lawyer, as an officer of the court, is duty-bound to uphold the rules in the Code. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Respondent contends that the information was privileged information received from his client, Forsberg, and therefore he was under no obligation to disclose the matter to the Commission. Respondent argues that his failure to report Casey’s misconduct was motivated by his respect for his client’s wishes, not by his desire for financial gain. To support this assertion, respondent notes that his fee agreement with Forsberg was contingent upon her first receiving all the money Casey originally owed her. Further, respondent states that he has received no fee for this representation of Forsberg.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Our analysis of this issue begins with a reading of the applicable disciplinary rules. Rule 1–103(a)<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;DR 1–103(a)&quot; \s &quot;Rule 1–103(a)&quot; \c 16 " /> of the Code states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer possessing unprivileged knowledge of a violation of Rule 1–102(a)(3) or (4) shall report such knowledge to a tribunal or other authority empowered to investigate or act upon such violation.</p>
      <p style="margin-right: 17.65pt;" class="TextFlush">107 Ill.2d R. 1–103(a).</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Rule 1–102<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;DR 1–102&quot; \s &quot;1–102&quot; \c 16 " /> of the Code states:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(a)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A lawyer shall not</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">(5)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>
      <p style="margin-right: 17.65pt;" class="TextFlush">107 Ill.2d R. 1–102<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;1–102&quot; " />.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . We agree with the Administrator’s argument that the communication regarding Casey’s conduct does not [fall under the attorney-client privilege.] The record does not suggest that this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page72" class="pagebreak" title="72">72</span>information was communicated by Forsberg to the respondent in confidence. We have held that information voluntarily disclosed by a client to an attorney, in the presence of third parties who are not agents of the client or attorney, is not privileged information. . . . In this case, Forsberg discussed the matter with respondent at various times while her mother and her fiancé were present. . . . The record [also] shows that respondent, with Forsberg’s consent, discussed Casey’s conversion of her funds with the insurance company involved, the insurance company’s lawyer, and with Casey himself. Thus, under [prior precedent] the information was not privileged.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Though respondent repeatedly asserts that his failure to report was motivated not by financial gain but by the request of his client, we do not deem such an argument relevant in this case. This court has stated that discipline may be appropriate even if no dishonest motive [exists]. . . . In addition, we have held that client approval of an attorney’s action does not immunize an attorney from disciplinary action. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The third issue concerns the appropriate quantum of discipline to be imposed in this case. . . . [Respondent’s] failure to report resulted in interference with the Commission’s investigation of Casey, and thus with the administration of justice. Perhaps some members of the public would have been spared from Casey’s misconduct had respondent reported the information as soon as he knew of Casey’s conversions of client funds. We are particularly disturbed by the fact that respondent chose to draft a settlement agreement with Casey rather than report his misconduct. As the Administrator has stated, by this conduct, both respondent and his client ran afoul of the Criminal Code’s prohibition against compounding a crime, which states in section 32–1:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">A person compounds a crime when he receives or offers to another any consideration for a promise not to prosecute or aid in the prosecution of an offender. . . . Compounding a crime is a petty offense.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Both respondent and his client stood to gain financially by agreeing not to prosecute or report Casey for conversion. According to the settlement agreement, respondent would have received $17,000 or more as his fee. If Casey had satisfied the judgment entered against him for failure to honor the settlement agreement, respondent would have collected approximately $25,588.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We have held that fairness dictates consideration of mitigating factors in disciplinary cases. . . . Therefore, we do consider the fact that Forsberg recovered $10,400 through respondent’s services, that respondent has practiced law for 11 years with no record of complaints, and that he requested no fee for minimum collection of Forsberg’s funds. However, these considerations do not outweigh the serious nature of respondent’s failure to report Casey, the resulting interference with the Commission’s investigation of Casey, and respondent’s ill-advised choice to settle with Casey rather than report his misconduct. . . .</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Plaintiff, a member of the Bar, has sued his former employer, a law firm. He claims he was wrongfully discharged as an associate because of his insistence that the firm comply with the governing disciplinary rules by reporting professional misconduct allegedly committed by another associate. The question presented is whether plaintiff has stated a claim for relief either for breach of contract or for the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of this State’s public policy. The lower courts have dismissed both causes of action on motion as legally insufficient . . . on the strength of New York’s employment-at-will doctrine. For reasons which follow, we modify the order and reinstate plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of contract. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[Wieder, an associate at the defendant law firm, asked the firm to represent him in his purchase of a condominium. The firm assigned another associate, L.L., to represent Wieder. L.L. neglected Wieder’s real estate transaction, and covered up his neglect by lying to him. When Wieder complained to partners at the firm, they admitted that L.L. was “a pathological liar.” Wieder insisted that the firm report L.L. to the bar’s disciplinary authorities. Eventually, and reluctantly, the firm did so, but fired Wieder.]</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="TextFlush">II.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We discuss first whether, notwithstanding our firmly established employment-at-will doctrine, plaintiff has stated a legal claim for breach of contract in the fourth cause of action. . . . The employment-at-will doctrine is a judicially created common-law rule “that where an employment is for an indefinite term it is presumed to be a hiring at will which may be freely terminated by either party at any time for any reason or even for no reason.” [The Court notes that in preceding cases of retaliatory discharge of whistleblowers, the at-will employment doctrine prevented the employees from suing.] . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Defendants, a firm of lawyers, hired plaintiff to practice law and this objective was the only basis for the employment relationship. Intrinsic to this relationship, of course, was the unstated but essential compact that in conducting the firm’s legal practice both plaintiff and the firm would do so in compliance with the prevailing rules of conduct and ethical standards of the profession. Insisting that as an associate in their employ plaintiff must act unethically and in violation of one of the primary professional rules amounted to nothing less than a frustration of the only legitimate purpose of the employment relationship. . . . We conclude, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page74" class="pagebreak" title="74">74</span>therefore, that plaintiff has stated a valid claim for breach of contract based on an implied-in-law obligation in his relationship with defendants.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Partnerships exist by the agreement of the partners; partners have no duty to remain partners. The issue in this case is whether we should create an exception to this rule by holding that a partnership has a duty not to expel a partner for reporting suspected overbilling by another partner. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[In 1990, Collette Bohatch became a partner in the Texas law firm of Butler &amp; Binion. She worked in the firm’s three-person Washington, D.C. office, which did virtually all of its legal work for Pennzoil. Bohatch came to believe that John McDonald, the managing partner in the office, was substantially overbilling Pennzoil. She raised the issue with the office’s other partner; then with the firm’s managing partner; and finally, with two other members of the firm’s management committee. The firm’s management committee investigated her charges and concluded that they were unfounded (a conclusion that Bohatch subsequently argued was a coverup). Bohatch was then informed that she should seek other employment. Subsequently, her partnership draw was reduced, and then her partnership was terminated. Bohatch sued the firm for breach of fiduciary obligation. A Texas jury awarded her $307,000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages. On appeal, the Texas Court of Appeals held that Butler &amp; Binion had not breached its fiduciary obligation to Bohatch, because the firm did not terminate her partnership for self-gain. It held that the firm had improperly withheld her partnership draw, however, and awarded her $35,000 plus attorneys’ fees. Bohatch appealed.]</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">. . . The issue presented, one of first impression, is whether the fiduciary relationship between and among partners creates an exception to the at-will nature of partnerships; that is, in this case, whether it gives rise to a duty not to expel a partner who reports suspected overbilling by another partner . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The fiduciary duty that partners owe one another does not encompass a duty to remain partners or else answer in tort damages. Nonetheless, Bohatch and several distinguished legal scholars urge this Court to recognize that public policy requires a limited duty to remain partners—<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, a partnership must retain a whistleblower partner. They argue that such an extension of a partner’s fiduciary duty is necessary because permitting a law firm to retaliate against a partner who in good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page75" class="pagebreak" title="75">75</span>faith reports suspected overbilling would discourage compliance with rules of professional conduct and thereby hurt clients.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">While this argument is not without some force, we must reject it. A partnership exists solely because the partners choose to place personal confidence and trust in one another. Just as a partner can be expelled, without a breach of any common law duty, over disagreements about firm policy or to resolve some other “fundamental schism,” a partner can be expelled for accusing another partner, which may have a profound effect on the personal confidence and trust essential to the partner relationship. Once such charges are made, partners may find it impossible to continue to work together to their mutual benefit and the benefit of their clients. . . . The threat of tort liability for expulsion would tend to force partners to remain in untenable circumstance—suspicious of and angry with each other—to their own detriment and that of their clients whose matters are neglected by lawyers distracted with intra-firm frictions. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We emphasize that our refusal to create an exception to the at-will nature of partnerships in no way obviates the ethical duties of lawyers. Such duties sometimes necessitate difficult decisions, as when a lawyer suspects overbilling by a colleague. The fact that the ethical duty to report may create an irreparable schism between partners neither excuses failure to report nor transforms expulsion as a means of resolving that schism into a tort.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We hold that the firm did not owe Bohatch a duty not to expel her for reporting suspected overbilling by another partner. . . . We affirm the court of appeals’ judgment.</p>
      <p class="TextFlush"><span style="font-family: &quot;Wingdings&quot;, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-variant: normal; text-transform: none;">n</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;"> Justice Spector</span>, joined by <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chief Justice Phillips</span>, dissenting:</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The issue in this appeal is whether law partners violate a fiduciary duty by retaliating against one partner for questioning the billing practices of another partner. I would hold that partners violate their fiduciary duty to one another by punishing compliance with the Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Accordingly, I dissent. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">[A]ttorneys organizing together to practice law are subject to a higher duty toward their clients and the public interest than those in other occupations. As a natural consequence, this duty affects the special relationship among lawyers who practice law together. . . . I believe that the fiduciary relationship among law partners should incorporate the rules of the profession promulgated by this Court. . . . In light of this Court’s role in setting standards to govern attorneys’ conduct, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court to deny recourse to attorneys wronged for adhering to the Disciplinary Rules. I would hold that in this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page76" class="pagebreak" title="76">76</span>case the law partners violated their fiduciary duty by retaliating against a fellow partner who made a good-faith effort to alert her partners to the possible overbilling of a client. . . . The duty to prevent overbilling and other misconduct exists for the protection of the client. Even if a report turns out to be mistaken or a client ultimately consents to the behavior in question, as in this case, retaliation against a partner who tries in good faith to correct or report perceived misconduct virtually assures that others will not take these appropriate steps in the future. Although I agree with the majority that partners have a right not to continue a partnership with someone against their will, they may still be liable for damages directly resulting from terminating that relationship. . . .</p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">In re Himmel</span> was the first reported decision disciplining a lawyer solely for his failure to report collegial misconduct. The decision provoked substantial controversy. Some commentators noted with approval that Illinois lawyers’ reports of misconduct increased after the court’s judgment (although subsequent prosecutions for failure to report misconduct have remained rare). This uptick matters because lawyers’ reports are more likely than clients’ reports to result in disciplinary charges and often expose conduct that would not otherwise reach disciplinary agencies because clients benefit or have been compensated.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.206" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.206" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">27</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Other commentators pointed out that <span style="font-style: italic;">Himmel</span> leaves many troubling issues unresolved. For example, how prompt must the report be and how much knowledge is necessary to trigger attorneys’ obligations? Should it be a “substantial basis,” “a firm opinion that the conduct in question had more likely than not occurred,” or some other standard? If the misconduct may be attributable to a substance abuse problem, would it be enough to contact a lawyer assistance program?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.207" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.207" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">28</a></span> Should lawyers for malpractice insurance companies also have obligations to inform disciplinary authorities of misconduct that comes to light in investigations related to policy coverage? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />At the time <span style="font-style: italic;">Himmel</span> was decided, lawyers’ conduct in Illinois was governed by Illinois’s version of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, the predecessor to the Model Rules. Would James Himmel still have faced discipline, if Model Rule 8.3<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.3&quot; " />, rather than Rule 1–103(a), had been operative?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Can <span style="font-style: italic;">Wieder</span> be distinguished from <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohatch</span>? How?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page77" class="pagebreak" title="77">77</span>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Who has the better argument: the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohatch</span> majority or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wieder</span> court and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bohatch</span> dissent?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.208" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.208" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">29</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />An associate in a Connecticut law firm discovered that another lawyer at the firm had changed computer-generated forms for client bills by substituting his name as the lawyer who provided a particular service in place of the lawyers who actually performed the service.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.209" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.209" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">30</a></span> The associate brought the matter to the attention of the managing partner. The partner subsequently reported that he had discussed the matter with the lawyer involved, had informed him that the conduct was unacceptable and must not be repeated, and had disclosed the conduct to the clients. The partner noted that no clients had been overcharged because the matters were being billed on the basis of fixed fees per case or a uniform hourly rate regardless of who performed the work. Accordingly, the partner believed that conduct did not need to be reported to the bar Grievance Committee. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">The associate was unconvinced and asked the Connecticut Committee of Professional Ethics whether, under Rule 8.3<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.3&quot; " /> and also Rule <span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Model Rule 5.2&quot; \s &quot;5.2&quot; \c 16 " />5.2, which permits a subordinate lawyer to defer to a “supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty,” he could defer to the partner’s judgment about whether his colleague’s misconduct had to be reported.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.210" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.210" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">31</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">The Connecticut Committee of Professional Ethics concluded that the conduct, indeed, had to be reported—and that the associate could not defer to his senior colleague’s flawed analysis. It reasoned that this was not a situation that implicated Rule 5.2<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;5.2&quot; " /> because it was not a situation where the associate was “acting at the direction of a supervisory lawyer, in a matter . . . where a consistent course of action or position was required.” Moreover, in the Committee’s view, even if Rule 5.2 were applicable, the question of whether the lawyer’s misconduct raised a “substantial question” of his honesty and fitness to practice could “reasonably be answered only one way.” Accordingly, the associate was obligated to report the misconduct.</p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Do you agree? How would you have handled the matter, if you had been in the associate’s shoes? If an associate failed to report under these circumstances, should he be subject to discipline?</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page78" class="pagebreak" title="78">78</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What constitutes sufficient knowledge of misconduct to trigger reporting and, with associates, to protect the reporting lawyer from retaliation? That was the issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Joffee v. King &amp; Spalding LLP</span>.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.211" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.211" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">32</a></span> There, junior associate David Joffee reported to King &amp; Spalding’s general counsel his concern that two senior partners had committed professional misconduct by falsely claiming in court that their client had not disclosed information in violation of a nondisclosure agreement when they, in fact, knew the opposite was true. The senior partners’ actions had resulted in a court order to show cause why they should not be sanctioned, which was settled after King &amp; Spalding were replaced as counsel in the case. Immediately after Joffee reported his concern, he was demoted and his pay was frozen. Joffee then sent an email to the partner in charge of the firm’s associates committee, further criticizing the senior partners’ conduct and stating that the sanctions order was “entirely understandable.” Joffee was fired two months later and filed a claim under <span style="font-style: italic;">Wieder</span> for retaliatory discharge. The firm’s defense was that Joffee could not sue because he lacked “actual knowledge” of the senior partner’s ethical misconduct. The district court rejected this argument, stating that an associate may file a <span style="font-style: italic;">Wieder</span> claim if he “reported, attempted to report, or threatened to report suspected unethical behavior and that he suffered an adverse employment action.” A “good faith belief” in the partners’ unethical conduct was sufficient, and it did not matter that the associate only reported internally, not to the bar. Do you think this is an appropriate extension of <span style="font-style: italic;">Wieder</span>? Does it give the right incentives to associates?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What types of violations raise “a substantial question” about a lawyer’s “honesty, trustworthiness or fitness” so as to trigger a reporting requirement under Rule 8.3<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.3&quot; " />? Note that state bars have opined that inaccurate advertising, unreasonable fees, and breaches of confidentiality trigger the duty to report,<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.212" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.212" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">33</a></span> while others have found a lawyer’s failure to properly segregate client funds, timely file divorce judgments, and use of impermissible trade name do not.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.213" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.213" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">34</a></span> Do these cases help you to demarcate the line between actions that trigger the reporting requirement and those that do not? It is clear that the duty to report applies to misconduct even when that misconduct is committed by partners and lawyers in the reporting lawyer’s firm.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.214" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.214" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">35</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Should lawyers be subject to discipline for conduct reflecting bias on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status? <span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Rule 8.4(g)<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;8.4(g)&quot; " />. Should judges, or opposing counsel also report such misconduct to bar disciplinary authorities? Are they compelled to do so, under Rule 8.3? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Stepping back, the wisdom and value of Rule 8.3 remains disputed. With a few limited exceptions, laws in the United States do not require citizens to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page79" class="pagebreak" title="79">79</span>report even serious crimes to public authorities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.215" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.215" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">36</a></span> Nor does tort law impose a duty to act, rescue, or report, except in very limited circumstances.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.216" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.216" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">37</a></span> Law professor (now federal judge) Gerard Lynch has argued that the same values underpinning society’s unwillingness to impose reporting requirements on citizens generally also apply in lawyer disciplinary contexts. In his view, the “impulse to protect one’s friends and associates from harm, even from deserved punishment, is a moral and socially useful impulse precisely because it reaches beyond individual self-interest; it assimilates another’s well being to that of oneself.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.217" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.217" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">38</a></span> Professional relationships founded on trust serve an essential personal and societal function; they satisfy deep-seated interpersonal needs and provide essential buffers between the individual and the state. For lawyers, no less than other individuals, such considerations “counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">against</span> the imposition of a generalized duty to inform.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.218" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.218" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">39</a></span> To Lynch, the bar’s power of self-regulation imposes no special reporting responsibilities. A democratic society, he notes, is also self-regulating, but it delegates the police function to specialists. So too, Lynch argues, the profession can appropriately delegate the oversight process to bar disciplinary authorities.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.219" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.219" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">40</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">By contrast, most bar leaders believe that reports of serious collegial misconduct are essential to protect clients and the public from abuses that would otherwise be impossible to detect or deter.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.220" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.220" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">41</a></span> Rules imposing a duty to disclose misconduct and malpractice can provide critical support for those who would like to come forward but fear collegial hostility or retaliation. In effect, reporting requirements can make lawyers “feel less like a snitch.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.221" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.221" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">42</a></span> Even lawyers who ultimately decline to report misconduct can find that a disclosure rule increases their leverage in seeking constructive responses to misconduct from errant attorneys or their firms. Under this line of analysis, reporting duties should be enforceable through professional disciplinary actions and civil liability. Such enforcement, it is claimed, would provide additional pressure for compliance with professional norms, as well as increase the remedies available to injured parties. However, these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page80" class="pagebreak" title="80">80</span>commentators also support greater protection of lawyer whistleblowers from retaliation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.222" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.222" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">43</a></span></p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">You are a junior partner in a prominent firm in a small city. Over the last several years, you have defended an insurance company in two separate personal injury suits handled by the same plaintiffs’ attorney. One of those cases settled for what you considered a grossly inadequate sum because the attorney failed to conduct sufficient factual investigation or legal research. The lawyer did, however, recover a substantial contingency fee for minimal work. In a second case, the lawyer bungled matters at trial through inept witness preparation, sloppy cross-examination, and a meandering argument before the jury. As a result, his seriously injured client recovered only a fraction of what the case was worth.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The attorney has now joined a small firm that specializes in insurance defense work. You are currently defending a claim in which one of the co-defendants is represented by that attorney. The attorney, who is this time charging by the hour, has insisted on attending depositions and meetings at which he is unnecessary and unprepared. On several occasions he has demeaned witnesses and lawyers of color; for example, in off-the-record statements, he has referred to one of his opposing counsel, a young Hispanic woman, as “Taco Belle.” And, in two instances, once to opponents and once to the court, the lawyer has misrepresented his reasons for seeking continuances.

      <p class="TextParagraph">William J. Neale, a member of The Florida Bar, petitions this Court for review of a referee’s recommendation in a bar grievance procedure. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This complaint against Neale arose from his representation of a Mrs. Mitchell for a claim of injuries she suffered as a result of being bitten by a dog in 1970. After attempts to negotiate a settlement failed, Neale filed suit on Mitchell’s behalf in 1973. A few days before trial, Neale learned that the dog had a history of biting and that punitive damages might be available. His motion to amend the original complaint in order to allege punitive damages was denied, and Neale, believing that a four-year statute of limitations controlled, took a voluntary nonsuit with his client’s concurrence. At that time, however, the statute of limitations on strict liability arising from dog bites was three years, and the defendants <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page82" class="pagebreak" title="82">82</span>successfully raised this defense in the subsequent suit. On appeal, the district court affirmed the trial court’s judgment against Mrs. Mitchell.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The referee found that Neale’s late discovery of the dog’s propensity to bite reflected inadequate preparation under the circumstances because Neale did not properly interrogate his client or make an independent investigation that would have resulted in his learning of the dog’s history of biting.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Neale learned a fact that he deemed important late in the game. He then overlooked or misconstrued the statute of limitations on his statutory remedy. This neglect, however, is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant conviction of an ethical violation under Canon 6<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Canon 6&quot; \s &quot;Canon 6&quot; \c 16 " />.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The power to disbar or suspend a member of the legal profession is not an arbitrary one to be exercised lightly, or with either passion or prejudice. Such power should be exercised only in a clear case for weighty reasons and on clear proof. . . . There is a fine line between simple negligence by an attorney and violation of Canon 6<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;Canon 6&quot; " /> that should lead to discipline. The rights of clients should be zealously guarded by the bar, but care should be taken to avoid the use of disciplinary action under Canon 6 as a substitute for what is essentially a malpractice action.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Neale had prepared to go to trial on his original complaint. Late in the proceeding he discovered a theory upon which he might have obtained a larger recovery for his client but then made the mistake of dismissing the action. His conduct might well be the basis of a negligence action against him, but, in our minds, it is insufficient to warrant a disciplinary action.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">We therefore reject the recommendations of both the referee and the bar and dismiss the charges against the respondent.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">It is so ordered.</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The American disciplinary process has never lacked for critics. Over the last four decades, virtually every systematic review has identified serious inadequacies. In 1970, after a comprehensive national study, an American Bar Association Committee identified a “scandalous situation” in bar oversight. Subsequent committees have come and gone, documenting significant improvements but identifying chronic problems in responses to misconduct. Reviews by independent scholars have been even more critical. As Richard Abel summarized their consensus: “too little unethical behavior is named, blamed, claimed, and punished. . . .” Most Americans agree. Only about a third of the public believes that the bar does a good job disciplining lawyers. “Too slow, too secret, too soft, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page83" class="pagebreak" title="83">83</span>and too self-regulated” has been the traditional view. Yet lawyers themselves tend to fault the system on precisely the opposite grounds. Many see it as see it as “unfair, oppressive, and counterproductive” for those subject to regulation.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Both critiques have some basis in fact, although it is consumers who pay the greatest price. The basic problem is structural. As John Coffee puts it, self-regulation permits “the continued government of the guild, by the guild, and for the guild.” What that has meant for bar discipline is too little focus on consumer protection and too much focus on lawyers’ reputational concerns. Many disciplinary authorities do not even handle garden variety misconduct—“mere” negligence and overcharging—because of resource limitations and the (erroneous) assumption that other civil liability remedies are available. But virtually all authorities sanction misconduct committed outside of professional relationships in what is too often a misdirected effort to prevent discredit of the bar.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -18pt; margin-left: 39.6pt;" class="TextHeadParagraph">A.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />The Flawed Structure of Professional Discipline</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The basic difficulty is that state supreme courts have claimed inherent authority to regulate the profession but have insufficient time, interest, or capacity to exercise that authority effectively. Most of these courts face crushing caseloads, and their justices have neither the resources nor the expertise to ensure adequate oversight. Nor do they have much inclination or incentive to challenge the organized bar on matters that hold great importance for lawyers but are not priorities for the general public. Judges share the background and world view of those they claim to regulate. As social theorists note, a group’s distinctive norms, behaviors, and ways of thinking construct an institutional identity that shapes decisionmaking. Moreover, most state judiciaries are elected and depend on lawyers for endorsements, rankings, and campaign contributions. Even in states where judges are selected through merit processes, state and local bars exercise substantial influence. The judiciary is also dependent on support from the organized bar concerning salaries and budgets, and is readily accessible to lawyer lobbying at conferences, annual meetings, and social gatherings. By contrast, consumer interests rarely have such opportunities for influence.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Part of the problem is the public’s lack of information and incentives to mobilize on the issue. Few voters are aware of the judiciary’s role in regulating the profession, and no powerful groups have sought to make such issues relevant in judicial elections. HALT, the only national consumer organization that focuses on reforming the legal profession, has only about 20,000 members. Its resources and influence cannot compare to those of local and national bar associations that represent close to a million lawyers. Nor have consumer protection agencies been willing to intervene and even the playing field. A primary reason is that the individual clients and third parties most vulnerable to lawyers’ misconduct lack political leverage and incentives to demand reform. Most are “one shot” players who use lawyers infrequently and episodically. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page84" class="pagebreak" title="84">84</span>other regulatory contexts, the constituency that has been most effective in mobilizing consumers or representing their interests has been public interest lawyers. But the success of their efforts often depends on financial support and pro bono contributions from the private bar. Such assistance is hard to come by on issues that put the bar’s own interests at risk. The few sporadic efforts that have been made to create more publicly accountable disciplinary structures have proceeded with little consumer support and have folded in the face of opposition by the bar.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">As a consequence, courts have delegated day-to-day oversight authority to bar organizations or to commissions that are nominally independent but that are closely aligned with bar interests. Lawyers can appeal disciplinary sanctions to the state supreme courts, but consumers have no effective recourse for decisions or processes that are unresponsive to their interests. Bar oversight processes are almost entirely reactive and generally respond only to complaints of serious professional misconduct or criminal convictions.<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="FootnoteReference"> </span>Although almost all jurisdictions have ethical rules requiring lawyers to report evidence of misconduct, these mandates are widely ignored and rarely enforced. Only about ten percent of the complaints to disciplinary bodies come from the profession. Yet despite lawyers’ notorious unwillingness to inform on colleagues, the most comprehensive survey found only four disciplinary actions over two decades for failure to report ethical violations. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The resulting reliance on client grievances leads to under-inclusive remedies. The system fails to respond when clients benefit from the misconduct, as in abusive litigation practices or complicity in fraud, or when victims lack information or incentives to file complaints. Sophisticated business clients generally find that withdrawal of business or non-payment of fees offer more effective remedies than those available from the disciplinary system. Even less powerful consumers who lack such options often doubt that bringing the matter to the bar will produce a satisfactory response. They are generally correct. The vast majority of grievances are dismissed without investigation because they fail to state a plausible claim within agency jurisdiction; for the remaining claims, inadequate resources often limit the effectiveness of responses. Only about three percent of cases brought to disciplinary authorities result in public sanctions. Even where the bar finds significant misconduct, sanctions are often lax and clients are not guaranteed adequate compensation. For cases involving minor grievances of neglect, negligence, and fee disputes that authorities decline to handle, malpractice litigation is generally too expensive, and the lawyers most likely to be subject to complaints frequently lack civil liability insurance. Although a growing number of states have alternative dispute resolution systems for minor grievances and fee disputes, few of these programs are mandatory and not all are perceived as effective by clients. . . .</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The problem is compounded by the absence of transparency. <span class="N">Most ethical violations by lawyers or inadequacies in bar responses are not </span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page85" class="pagebreak" title="85">85</span><span class="N">visible to the public. Except in four states, bar disciplinary agencies will not disclose the existence of a complaint unless they have found a disciplinary violation or probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred. Lawyers with as many as 20 complaints under investigation have received a clean bill of health when a consumer asked for information about their records, and it has sometimes taken as many as 44 complaints over a decade to get a practitioner disbarred. Even where sanctions are imposed, the public lacks a ready way of discovering them. Not all states publish information concerning disciplinary sanctions, and many do not do so on-line or in forms that consumers can access. Because the vast majority of complaints never result in public sanctions, and the vast majority of malpractice actions never result in published opinions, consumers often lack crucial knowledge about lawyers’ practice histories.</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph"><span class="N">The profession and the public also lack information that would enable them to assess the adequacy of disciplinary processes. Few states publish aggregate data concerning the nature of grievances, characteristics of attorneys, and sanctions imposed. </span>The lack of transparency concerning the treatment of complaints, and the lack of proactive oversight of corporate lawyers whose clients seldom file grievances, feeds practitioners’ suspicion t<span class="N">hat the disciplinary system is biased against small firms, solo practitioners, and racial and ethnic minorities.</span><span class="FootnoteReference"> </span><span class="N">The studies to date have not been adequate to evaluate those concerns.</span> Nor do the twenty states that have diversion programs publish statistics on the effectiveness of these programs in preventing misconduct and addressing clients’ concerns.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">One consequence of the profession’s failure to develop adequate regulatory processes is that other<span class="N"> decision makers have stepped into the breach and supplemented or supplanted bar oversight. For example, lawyers’ complicity in some of the major financial scandals of the early 21st century led to no disciplinary actions but major new legislation. Congress required, over the ABA’s vehement objections, that counsel in publicly traded companies make internal reports of potential fraud to corporate leadership. Other federal and state agencies have imposed ethical standards beyond what bar rules require, and prosecutors have brought criminal proceedings where disciplinary authorities have failed to act. As John Leubsdorf summarizes the trend: “more and more regulators have sought to regulate the bar . . . and have become increasingly unwilling to defer to either bar associations or courts.” Commercial organizations have also entered the arena. Insurance companies have insisted on additional ethics-related safeguards as a condition of malpractice coverage and some directories and websites include information on lawyers’ disciplinary history and /or client reviews.</span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span class="N">Yet these initiatives have fallen short. State courts’ assertion of inherent regulatory powers have limited the scope of comprehensive administrative and legislative intervention. And insurance companies’ </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page86" class="pagebreak" title="86">86</span>
        <span class="N">leverage has been limited by the unwillingness of all but [two] state bar[s] to require that lawyers have malpractice coverage. . . .</span>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Do you agree with Rhode and Woolley that problems in the attorney disciplinary system are traceable, in large part, to the self-regulating nature of the legal profession? If outsiders regulated lawyers would problems be better or worse?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Commentators have proposed a variety of reforms to respond to the inadequacies Rhode and Woolley identify above. One cluster of strategies focuses on efforts to make the disciplinary process more proactive and effective. Here, reformers suggest that the jurisdiction of disciplinary agencies should be broadened to include concerns of neglect, negligence, and fees, and resources should be increased to insure adequate investigation and remedial responses. The standard of proof should be the same as for other civil matters—a preponderance of evidence—instead of clear and compelling evidence. In addition, reformers suggest that, rather than relying almost exclusively on felony prosecutions and complaints brought to their attention, regulatory officials should proactively initiate investigations based on malpractice filings, judicial sanctions, and random trust fund audits. In addition, reformers suggest that states should work to make grievances easier to file. Here, states should publicize the complaint process and assist individuals in filing complaints.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.224" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.224" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">45</a></span> Do you support these reforms?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Other countries with legal systems comparable to the United States have moved in a direction of greater responsiveness to consumer concerns and could serve as appropriate models for reform. <span class="N">These countries have established co-regulatory structures in which the bar shares authority with other, more publicly accountable entities. For example, in England and Wales, legal services are governed by an independent Legal Services Board, with a majority of lay members and a lay chair. Less serious complaints involving performance issues are addressed by the Legal Ombudsman, who</span> may require the lawyer to apologize or to pay compensation for financial losses or “inconvenience/distress,” and may also take action “in the interests of the complainant” to put right “any specified error, omission or other deficiency.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.225" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.225" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">46</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph"><span class="N">In Australia, widely publicized scandals also prompted state governments to create more accountable and consumer-oriented regulatory processes. For example, </span>Queensland has an independent Legal Services Commission headed by a nonlawyer.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.226" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.226" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">47</a></span> Its disciplinary system includes a Client Relations Center, which resolves minor disputes, and a Legal Practice <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page87" class="pagebreak" title="87">87</span>Tribunal, composed of a Supreme Court Justice, one nonlawyer, and one practitioner as advisors. Problems of competence and diligence can be subjects for discipline, and all disciplinary actions are published on the Legal Service Commission website. <span class="N">Should similar models be adapted for the United States?</span><span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.227" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.227" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">48</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Others take particular aim at the lack of transparency that now pervades nearly all facets of the lawyer disciplinary process.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.228" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.228" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">49</a></span> As Rhode and Woolley note, only four states—Florida, New Hampshire, Oregon, and West Virginia—treat all or most complaints about lawyers as a matter of public record. In many other states, a complaint becomes a matter of public record only if there is a finding of probable cause, and many complaints are dismissed without such a finding.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.229" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.229" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">50</a></span> Furthermore:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 27pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">All but a few jurisdictions impose private discipline, and in many jurisdictions, it is the type of discipline most often imposed. When private discipline is imposed, the affected lawyer and complainant learn about the discipline, but the sanction and the proceedings themselves are maintained as confidential and typically cannot be accessed by the public.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.230" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.230" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">51</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">Proponents of secrecy insist that confidentiality is necessary to safeguard the integrity of investigations, promote administrative efficiency, and to ensure that lawyers are not harmed by unfounded or frivolous complaints.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.231" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.231" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">52</a></span> Others disagree. As Leslie Levin has explained:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 27pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">[T]he secrecy surrounding most lawyer discipline in this country makes the fairness and effectiveness of the discipline process virtually impossible to ascertain. It seems clear that the unavailability of discipline information not only hurts consumers of legal services—who may be victimized by lawyers who have been secretly sanctioned in the past—but also affects the legal profession and the public at large.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.232" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.232" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">53</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Is the current lack of transparency justifiable?</p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />There is also the problem that, even if a lawyer has been subject to “public” discipline, crucial information may be “public” only in the limited sense it could theoretically be ferreted out by a savvy researcher scouring a bar website. But the information might not be known by, or practically available to, prospective clients—and even when it is available and actually located, it will typically be vague and incomplete (stating that a lawyer was subject to public discipline, say, but nothing about the lawyer’s underlying conduct or reason or reasons for the lawyer’s punishment). To address this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page88" class="pagebreak" title="88">88</span>problem, some suggest that lawyers ought to be required to provide information concerning their performance records to prospective clients. Other promising alternatives might be centralized databanks and toll-free hotlines that would provide information about judicial sanctions, disciplinary actions, and malpractice judgments akin to the online clearinghouse for physicians, required in about half the states. Would you support any such reforms? If so, how might they be achieved? If not, what alternative strategies would you recommend?</p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861249" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218830" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756248" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908379" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Disciplinary Sanctions</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In principle, the sanctioning process is designed to serve three main functions: protection of the public, protection of the administration of justice, and preservation of confidence in the profession. In fact, much lawyer discipline seems to fit within three classic justifications of punishment: incapacitation, rehabilitation, and deterrence.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Jurisdictions now vary in the range and characterization of disciplinary remedies. Disbarment, which refers to a permanent withdrawal of the license to practice law, is the most uniform but also the most infrequent response. It is also not necessarily “permanent,” for reasons described below. Another common remedy, suspension, refers to a temporary prohibition on practice either for a specified period (usually ranging from several months to several years) or until compliance with certain specified conditions. Less stringent sanctions include public and private censures, reprimands, admonitions, warnings, cautions, probation, and mandatory education.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions set forth a range of factors that should guide the imposition of penalties. Aggravating factors include prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, multiple offenses, obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding, illegal conduct, and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct. Furthermore, the ABA’s Model Rule for Lawyer Discipline instructs courts or boards to consider:</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">Some supreme courts rely heavily on those standards in imposing discipline; others have modeled their own standards on the ABA’s framework. The remaining jurisdictions generally have bright-line rules or presumptive sanctions for specific offenses, or alternatively, employ a case-by-case approach to all disciplinary decisions. An unfortunate effect of this regulatory patchwork is to create substantial inconsistencies in responses to similar conduct within and across jurisdictions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.234" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.234" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">55</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to the limited data available, disciplined attorneys are disproportionately likely to practice alone or in small firms and represent individuals, rather than corporations or associations, often in the areas of family law, criminal defense, and plaintiff-side personal injury.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.235" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.235" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">56</a></span> Reflecting this focus, in California in 2000 through 2001, 23 percent of all lawyers were solo practitioners, but such practitioners were the target of 78 percent of disciplinary actions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.236" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.236" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">57</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A number of factors may account for that overrepresentation. Solo and small-firm lawyers have less collegial oversight. They also have less economic cushion, and fewer staff and technological resources to monitor deadlines, respond to client inquiries, and track client funds. There is also the question of whether these lawyers really do violate the rules more often—or, rather, whether there is a bias against solo and small-firm practitioners and/or these lawyers’ ethical lapses are disproportionately likely to be detected and punished.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.237" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.237" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">58</a></span> On the latter, common grounds for sanctions include mismanagement of trust funds, inadequate communication, and neglect of client matters, such as failure to perform services within prescribed periods. Underfunded disciplinary agencies generally find it cost-effective to target their limited resources to pursue these more cut-and-dry violations. By contrast, the kinds of violations that may be more common in large firms, such as discovery abuse, intentional foot dragging, or complicity in coverups, are harder to prove, and are more likely to benefit, rather than disadvantage, the instant client (rendering it less likely that the client will lodge a disciplinary complaint).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.238" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.238" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">59</a></span> Consider these factors as you assess the sanction-related issues that follow.</p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Permanent Disbarment</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A controversial issue related to lawyer sanctions involves permanent disbarment. As noted above, permanent disbarment is the most serious penalty. But, in some states, it’s a bit of a misnomer. While five states require all disbarments to be permanent and another eight allow permanent disbarment in some situations, most states allow disbarred attorneys to apply for reinstatement after a prescribed period, generally between three to seven year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.239" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.239" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">60</a></span> Nationally, only about 10 percent of those who seek reinstatement or readmission succeed.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.240" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.240" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">61</a></span> But, between states, the frequency of reinstatement varies. Thus, over one ten-year period, Pennsylvania granted three-quarters of the applications from forty-four lawyers who sought to resume practice, while its neighbor, Delaware, granted none.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.241" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.241" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">62</a></span> Lawyers who are permanently disbarred in one jurisdiction can be readmitted in another and even those who have been disbarred more than once can apply for reinstatement.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">According to David E. Johnson, Director of the Office of the Attorney of Ethics of the Supreme Court of New Jersey:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Disbarment in America today is in truth a myth. It is what I call the great white lie of disciplinary sanctions. Very simply, disbarment in 20th century America does not mean permanent disbarment in the majority of states. As a result, we see repeated instances of thieves, liars, perjurers, rapists and other serious criminal offenders applying for, and sometimes securing, reinstatement to the practice of law. The specter of ever reinstating an attorney who has bribed a judge to fix a case, for example, or has committed other heinous criminal acts, is repulsive to most honest, ethical lawyers. To the public the prospect is inconceivable. Why? Because the public thinks in terms that are straightforward and honest, plain and simple, especially when it comes to core values like the administrat[ion] of justice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.242" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.242" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">63</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextFlush">In Johnson’s view, permanent discipline would provide a powerful deterrent lacking in the current system.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.243" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.243" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">64</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Professor Ronald Rotunda disagreed. Given the absence of consensus on what misconduct is sufficiently abusive to preclude reinstatement, he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page91" class="pagebreak" title="91">91</span>contended that a system permitting permanent disbarment is likely to produce inconsistent and inequitable results. Rotunda argued:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Because the purpose of discipline is to protect the public, if the court finds that the reason to impose the discipline has changed, and no longer exists, or that the risk to the public of future harm no longer exists, then the court should also reevaluate the need for continued discipline. Wisdom never comes to some people; we should not reject it in others merely because it comes a little late. . . . The possibility of reinstatement is a good policy because it serves the laudable purpose of giving the lawyer an incentive to mend his or her old ways. To take away this possibility is to take away an incentive to reform. . . .</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Proponents of permanent disbarment often claim that we should agree with their proposal because it will improve the public image of lawyers. We should resist that temptation: the organized bar should propose legal reforms because they are right, not because they might improve our public image. Lawyers engage in a lot of activities that are bad for their public image, from representing alleged Communists to representing alleged Nazis to using the Fourth Amendment in an effort to exclude probative evidence. If we do things that are proper but bad for the public image, we should respond by trying to educate the public. It is our job to lead, not to follow.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.244" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.244" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">65</a></span></p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Mitigating Circumstances</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">When discipline is imposed, there is also a question of what should count in mitigation. Here, one recurring and urgent question is whether a punishment should be lighter because, at the time of the misconduct, an attorney was suffering from mental illness, alcoholism, or substance abuse. The ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions specify that “personal or emotional problems” serve as mitigating factors and that “mental disability or chemical dependency” do as well, so long as:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />there is medical evidence that the respondent is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct;</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the respondent’s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and</p>
      <p style="text-indent: -21.6pt; margin-left: 43.2pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextParagraph">(4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.245" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.245" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">66</a></span> </p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page92" class="pagebreak" title="92">92</span>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.6pt; margin-left: 3pt;" class="TextParagraph">Concerned with client protection, others have been reluctant to view such difficulties as adequate mitigation. According to HALT (Americans for Legal Reform), for example, it is the job of disciplinary agencies to make sure that the risk to clients is “eliminated or minimized, not excused. The kind of leniency [granted for lawyers] is not accorded elsewhere—one can hardly imagine a bank forgiving a teller’s theft of thousands of dollars and keeping them on the job based on excuses such as alcoholism, mental disability, or willingness to pay it back.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.246" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.246" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">67</a></span> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 18.6pt; margin-left: 3pt;" class="TextParagraph">Courts, for their part, have been all over the map. According to two commentators: “While some courts have found mental impairment to be profoundly important in determining the appropriate sanction, others have been unwilling to consider mental impairment, even when it appears to be principally responsible for the misconduct.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.247" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.247" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">68</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextHeadParagraph">
        <a id="_Toc451861253" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Discipline of Law Firms</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Many also question whether disciplinary sanctions should be directed at law firms—or just individual lawyers. Currently, the Model Rules do not include a vehicle to sanction firms, rather than the lawyers employed therein, while only two states (New York and New Jersey) subject law firms to discipline, and even in these states, actual disciplinary actions against firms are rare.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.248" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.248" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">69</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">There is certainly precedent for subjecting law firms to the disciplinary system. Law firms can—and frequently are—held civilly liable in legal malpractice actions initiated by former clients, and firms can also be held responsible for improper pleadings, pursuant to <a id="dabmci_aeca46281e6e4354ae05995bb9f22f85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c)(1).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.249" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.249" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">70</a></span> Beyond that, corporate criminal liability has been an accepted part of American law for over a century, and other regulators frequently regulate (and punish) entities themselves and not just their constituent parts. Thus, for example, “[t]he stock exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission maintain disciplinary systems for brokerage houses, and not just for the individuals who work in those firms.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.250" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.250" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">71</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Law firm liability may also be broadly beneficial. As Professor Ted Schneyer has argued:</p>
      <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page93" class="pagebreak" title="93">93</span>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">Given the evidentiary problems of pinning professional misconduct on one or more members of a lawyering team, the reluctance to scapegoat some lawyers for sins potentially shared by others in their firm, and especially the importance of a law firm’s ethical infrastructure and the diffuse responsibility for creating and maintaining that infrastructure, a disciplinary regime that targets only individual lawyers in an era of large law firms is no longer sufficient. Sanctions against firms are needed as well.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.251" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.251" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">72</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">On the other hand, some argue that disciplining firms may be counterproductive because it enables regulators to take the “easy way out” and avoid identifying which lawyers are responsible for particular misconduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.252" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.252" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">73</a></span> As the general counsel for the Attorney Disciplinary Board of Michigan has put it, “if everybody’s responsible, nobody is responsible.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.253" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.253" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">74</a></span> Beyond that, such a rule might stigmatize innocent lawyers—who just happened to be at the wrong firm at the wrong time. And the rule would also force consideration of a slew of difficult subsidiary questions. These include: Must lawyers from a previously-disciplined firm disclose that discipline when seeking admission <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hac vice</span>? Must they disclose to malpractice liability insurance carriers? Will a new lawyer, who joins the firm post-discipline, inherit the taint? And, what standard should govern the firm’s liability: Should firm responsibility come automatically via something akin to respondeat superior, whenever a partner is sanctioned? Or, should a firm only be held responsible if it, itself, breaches a duty of reasonable oversight or supervision?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.254" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.254" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">75</a></span> Finally and critically, what sanction should be imposed on firms, particularly since organizations cannot be disbarred or suspended?<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.255" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.255" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">76</a></span> </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />A recent study analyzed 500 disciplinary proceedings in thirty-three states. That study found that male and female lawyers were subject to different penalties, even for the same offenses. One of the study’s authors explained: “Where a woman might be suspended, a man is more likely to be put on probation. Looking at the data and just modeling for disbarment, we found women are more than twice as likely to be disbarred as men for the exact same offense.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.258" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.258" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">79</a></span> In particular, the researchers found that women were disbarred 35 percent if the time, while men were disbarred 17 percent of the time, even holding the underlying violations constant.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.259" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.259" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">80</a></span> How, if at all, does this alter your view of permanent disbarment and David E.

      <p class="TextParagraph">While on vacation in Tennessee, Fawn Balliro, an assistant DA in Massachusetts, was assaulted by Greg Knox, her then-boyfriend. In the attack, Balliro suffered injuries to her head and face, including a black eye and cuts to her lips. A neighbor, who heard Balliro’s screams, alerted the police, and Knox was arrested on misdemeanor assault charges. Subsequently, however, Knox pressured Balliro to drop the charges because he was on probation for drug offences, and, if he was convicted of this assault charge, he would be incarcerated, and no one would be available to support his two minor daughters. Balliro agreed, although she was unsuccessful in preventing Knox’s prosecution. When called as a witness at Knox’s eventual trial, however, Balliro took the stand and testified falsely that her injuries occurred while falling. The case against Knox was dismissed, and the Tennessee prosecutor informed the Massachusetts DA’s Office of her suspected perjury. The DA’s office put Balliro on leave until she agreed to undergo counseling and report her conduct to disciplinary authorities.

      <p style="text-indent: 21.6pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="TextFlush">An important feature of the professional discipline regime under Rule 8.4, is that, in some instances, it permits a lawyer to be sanctioned for conduct that does not constitute a direct violation of the rules themselves. Specifically, Rule 8.4(b) subjects a lawyer to discipline for committing “a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects,” even when that criminal act falls outside of the lawyer-client relationship. The theory is that certain criminal acts demonstrate a “lack of those characteristics relevant to law practice,” such as “violence, dishonesty, breach of trust, or serious interference with the administration of justice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"> </span>Rule 8.4, cmt. 2.

      <p class="TextParagraph">Since their inception, bar associations have been concerned with professional performance and its effect on public status, and bar ethical codes have long included provisions on competence. Currently, Rule 1.1 provides that a “lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client” and specifies that “[c]ompetent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.” </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Almost no systematic research is available on the extent of incompetence among practicing attorneys or the strategies most effective in combating it. Further, as Chapter 16 notes, although we have some evidence that performance in law school correlates with performance in bar examinations, we have no idea how well either correlates with competence in practice. However, the fragmentary research available reveals that most qualities rated most relevant by practitioners and employing organizations are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> learned in law school or tested on bar exams: e.g., fact-gathering, instilling confidence, effective oral expression, client communication, time management, diligence, judgment, and supervisory capability.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">To address these problems, bar leaders generally propose a range of fixes, including skills-oriented bar exams, experiential law school courses, mentoring programs for new attorneys, support structures for solo and small firm practitioners, and improved in-house education by employers. (Yet again, however, almost no systematic effort has been made to assess the effectiveness of such initiatives.) </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Another response to competence concerns has been Continuing Legal Education (CLE) for practicing lawyers. The push for CLE began roughly half-a-century ago in the aftermath of Watergate, largely in response to public criticism of lawyers’ ethics. Nearly all states now require practicing lawyers to participate in CLE programs, generally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page98" class="pagebreak" title="98">98</span>ranging from ten to twelve hours per year.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.266" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.266" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">87</a></span> In most jurisdictions, some of the coursework must focus on ethics. A minority demand coverage of other topics such as bias in the profession and substance abuse. Failure to stay in compliance can lead to a sizable fine or even a temporary suspension of a lawyer’s law license.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The imposition of CLE requirements has been relatively uncontroversial. After all, most other professions require practitioners to satisfy continuing education requirements. Education is generally thought to be a good thing. (As the Chair of the New York State Bar Committee on Lawyer Competency once put it: “How can you be against education? It’s like being against apple pie.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.267" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.267" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">88</a></span>) And it is said that the requirement also enhances public confidence in the profession.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.268" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.268" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">89</a></span> On the latter, at the time CLE requirements were first adopted, an influential report concluded that educational requirements would benefit the “repute of the profession . . . not only because of the improved competence of young lawyers but also because of recognition by the public that the Bar is making every effort to give it the very best of service.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.269" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.269" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">90</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Others, however, are less sanguine. Critics point out that CLE consumes millions of dollars and millions of hours of attorney time. Yet, few CLE programs make any significant effort at quality control, and some seem downright silly. (Some courses on sports law, for example, have occurred at sporting events, complete with hot dogs and peanuts.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.270" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.270" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">91</a></span>) Additionally and more broadly, CLEs’ efficacy is unproven. In the words of a District of Columbia Task Force, which spent two years examining the issue and published a nearly 200-page report: “there have been no reliable, scientific demonstrations of the efficacy of continuing legal education.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.271" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.271" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">92</a></span> </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Some suggest that state CLE requirements should be eliminated altogether. Would you support such a change? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Since 2003, nearly a dozen states have started to allow attorneys to count a small number of qualifying pro bono hours toward mandatory CLE requirements. As Rima Sirota observes: “This arrangement is justified both as providing a significant learning experience for the attorney, thus fitting within mandatory CLE’s educational mandate, and as encouraging additional pro bono work, thus making a dent in the justice gap not filled through traditional pro bono incentives.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.272" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.272" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">93</a></span> Should more states allow pro bono work to substitute for CLE attendance? Or are there drawbacks to such substitutions? </p>
      <p data-OutlineLevel="3" class="Head2"><a id="_Toc451861264" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc36218836" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc39756254" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><a id="_Toc41908385" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Malpractice</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Five decades ago, malpractice claims against attorneys were so rare and practitioners were so unconcerned about liability that insurance coverage was generally not available on the domestic market. That situation has dramatically changed. Definitive data is impossible to come by because insurance companies do not disclose payouts, and many settlements remain confidential. However, experts estimate that 3 to 12 percent of attorneys face malpractice exposure in a given year, that annual insurance payouts total approximately $3.5 billion, and that claims, particularly large claims, are on the rise.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.273" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.273" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">94</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">What accounts for the increase? Experts disagree. Some believe that incompetent representation is growing. As the profession becomes more competitive, as profit margins decrease, and as billable-hour expectations escalate, lawyers are under more pressure to handle matters beyond their expertise. Risky financial speculation, corporate scandals, and real estate and debt-related issues have also generated more civil liability. Others believe that the uptick is attributable to rising consumer expectations and greater willingness among lawyers (representing aggrieved clients) to bring such claims.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Despite the escalation, the barriers to initiating successful malpractice actions remain formidable. Some barriers are practical: Many individuals with potential legal malpractice claims will fail to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page100" class="pagebreak" title="100">100</span>recognize that they have been harmed and/or will fail to attribute the harm to an attorney error (typically referred to as the “attribution problem”).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.274" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.274" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">95</a></span> Then, of the subset of would-be claimants who overcome the attribution problem (in that they recognize that they have been harmed and identify the lawyer as the culprit), many will be unable or unwilling to incur the costs and aggravation associated with actually filing suit. From there, even if a would-be claimant decides that she <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> want to file suit, actually doing so is difficult. Clients need lawyers (one’s odds of success in pursuing a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro se</span> legal malpractice claim is essentially nil), but, unless liability looks clear and damages are substantial, plaintiffs’ attorneys (who will generally assert the legal malpractice claim pursuant to a contingency fee) can be hard to find.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.275" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.275" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">96</a></span> Finally, many cases are only worth bringing if the errant lawyer has deep pockets or carries adequate malpractice insurance—and many lawyers have neither. Only Oregon and Idaho require their attorneys to carry malpractice insurance; in other states, some 6 to 60 percent of lawyers are uninsured.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.276" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.276" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">97</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Legal barriers are no less daunting: Like tort plaintiffs generally, a legal malpractice plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and cognizable damages, each by a preponderance of the evidence. These elements are discussed below.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 6pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Duty</span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A plaintiff must first show that the defendant-lawyer owed her a duty of care. When the plaintiff asserting the legal malpractice claim is the lawyer’s former client, and the lawyer’s alleged breach occurred within the scope of representation, this element will be easily satisfied. When <span style="font-style: italic;">nonclients</span> initiate legal malpractice suits, however, the duty question much becomes more difficult.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Traditionally, it was said that lawyers owed no duty to nonclients, even if it was clear that the lawyer’s services were intended to protect or to benefit the third party. <span style="font-style: italic;">See </span><a id="dabmci_b13de6441e9348b3bb3b5a06cdff253f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">National Savings Bank v. Ward</span>, 100 U.S. 195, 200 (1880) (“Beyond all doubt, the general rule is that the obligation of the attorney is to his client and not to a third party . . . .”). This bright-line privity requirement was often justified on the theory that extensive liability could would place an undue burden on the profession and would dissuade lawyers from offering clients vigorous representation. Some also said that it would be too difficult to “distinguish between harm resulting from inappropriate lawyer conduct on the one hand and, on the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page101" class="pagebreak" title="101">101</span>other hand, detriment to a nonclient resulting from a lawyer’s fulfilling the proper function of helping a client through lawful means.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.277" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.277" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">98</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Over the past several decades, however, many courts have started to relax this privity requirement, recognizing that nonclients are often affected by lawyers’ conduct and also foreseeably and reasonably rely on lawyers’ assurances.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.278" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.278" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">99</a></span> Reflecting this expansion, attorneys may now be liable to an estate’s intended beneficiary if errors in the decedent’s will prevent the beneficiary from receiving the bequest. Or, similarly, if the seller’s lawyer at a real-estate closing offers to record the deed for the buyer and subsequently fails to do so, the lawyer may be liable to the buyer, even if no lawyer-client relationship was ever established.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.279" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.279" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">100</a></span> Such holdings rely on agency principles, third-party beneficiary theories, or a balancing test that considers the predictability and certainty of harm, the defendant’s moral culpability, and the extent of the third-party’s justifiable reliance on the defendant’s conduct.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.280" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.280" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">101</a></span> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Breach</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">After showing that the attorney owed her a duty of care, a malpractice plaintiff must next show that the attorney breached that duty of care. Each state formulates its particular standard of care a bit differently.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.281" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.281" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">102</a> </span>Generally, however, breach can be shown if the lawyer failed to exercise or display the competence, skill, prudence, and diligence commonly exercised by lawyers in similar circumstances in the given locale.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.282" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.282" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">103</a></span> In applying this standard, the factfinder will compare the defendant-lawyer’s conduct to the conduct of other lawyers undertaking similar matters in the same jurisdiction, to see if the defendant-lawyer’s conduct conformed to what was customary or, alternatively, fell short.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.283" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.283" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">104</a></span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">While that is easy enough to say, actually showing that the lawyer’s conduct deviated from the norm is often difficult. Since there is no neat book that compiles “legal custom” or catalogs what reasonably diligent and prudent lawyers in jurisdiction X do or don’t do when facing problem <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page102" class="pagebreak" title="102">102</span>Y under circumstance Z, even establishing the standard of care generally requires competent expert testimony.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.284" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.284" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">105</a></span> If a plaintiff cannot find a qualified expert to testify to the relevant standard of care and opine that the lawyer departed from the standard, a legal malpractice case is likely to be dismissed, even prior to trial.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Cause and Injury</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Finally, even if the plaintiff can show his or her attorney owed her a duty and breached that duty, causation (showing that the client would not be injured but-for the lawyer’s breach) remains a formidable obstacle. If the former attorney erred in a tort case, this standard requires a plaintiff to prove a case within a case, showing that the underlying claim had legal merit which the attorney’s error erased or diminished.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.285" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.285" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">106</a></span> That means, in a medical malpractice case, for example, where the defendant-lawyer failed to file suit within the applicable statute of limitations, the plaintiff-client must go through the time, expense, and trouble of showing that, if the medical malpractice claim <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> been timely filed and vigorously litigated, the plaintiff would have more-likely-than-not prevailed under the governing law. If the underlying claim had only dubious merit, causation on the legal malpractice claim will not be established. Likewise, where malpractice occurred in a criminal case, plaintiffs in many jurisdictions must show actual innocence in order to prevail.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.286" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.286" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">107</a></span> </p>

      <p class="NoteTextFlush">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />When it comes to showing that the attorney-defendant breached, the burden on plaintiffs would be substantially lighter if a rule violation constituted negligence <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, as unexcused rule and statutory violations typically constitute negligence <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> in other contexts. <span style="font-style: italic;">See, e.g., </span><a id="dabmci_50714097aa6046c2b9dbc1fd156ef6e8" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Martin v. Herzog, </span>126 N.E. 814, 815 (N.Y. 1920). Yet, the ABA has resisted such a shortcut. The Preamble to the Rules of Professional Conduct states:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 12pt; margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="TextFlush">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[20]<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Violation of a rule should not itself give rise to a cause of action nor should it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached. . . . The Rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. . . . Nevertheless, since the Rules do establish standards </span>

      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Hold that professional ethical standards conclusively establish the duty of care (i.e., the <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> approach disclaimed by the Model Rules);</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Hold that a rule violation establishes a rebuttable presumption that the lawyer has breached the standard of care;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">3)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Permit the rule violation to serve as some evidence that the lawyer has breached the standard of care (i.e., the approach accepted by the Model Rules);</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">4)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Declare that ethical standards are inadmissible.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.287" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.287" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">108</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">Which approach is most sensible? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Many question the relationship between client-initiated legal malpractice proceedings and state-initiated attorney disciplinary actions—and whether, via principles of collateral estoppel, a court finding in the former can be used to simplify the latter, and vice versa. Generally, the answer is no. Professors Herbert Kritzer and Neil Vidmar explain:</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">A finding by a court in a [legal malpractice case] that a lawyer acted in a way that would constitute an ethics violation does not generally preclude a lawyer from contesting that before an ethics panel. The reason is that, in most states, an ethics panel requires “clear and convincing evidence” to find a violation, whereas, in most civil proceedings, the standard of proof is the less stringent “preponderance of the evidence.” . . .</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-left: 22.5pt; margin-right: 22.15pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">For different reasons, collateral estoppel based on findings of a disciplinary panel does not apply in a subsequent [legal malpractice] civil proceeding. The primary reason for this is that the defendant in a [legal malpractice] lawsuit enjoys the right to a jury trial [and disciplinary actions are not tried before juries]. A second issue is that, in some states, for collateral estoppel to apply, both parties (including those in privity with parties) in the previous forum must be bound by that forum’s decision; generally, the plaintiff in a [legal malpractice] matter is in no sense bound by the findings of the previous disciplinary proceeding even if the plaintiff initiated the complaint that led to the discipline.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.288" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.288" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">109</a></span></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">3.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />What about insurance? As noted above, a significant problem with the status quo is a lack of adequate liability insurance coverage, which makes many lawyers effectively judgment proof—and also means many aggrieved former clients cannot find representation to assert malpractice claims, even when those claims are meritorious. Beyond assuring adequate compensation, insurance has other benefits too. Namely, when insurance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page104" class="pagebreak" title="104">104</span>companies are involved, they can monitor policyholders for risky practices and require loss prevention strategies.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.289" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.289" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">110</a></span> Critical preventive techniques include systems for identifying conflicts of interest and ticklers to remind lawyers of important deadlines. </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Despite the benefits that would flow from making insurance mandatory, only Oregon and Idaho require all attorneys to carry malpractice insurance—and Idaho’s requirement is fairly new. In 2018, the Nevada State Bar petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court to adopt a liability insurance requirement. But with little discussion, the petition was denied.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.290" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.290" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">111</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Some oppose making insurance mandatory. Opposition is particularly fierce among members of the bar who do not practice full-time or who could not readily afford liability premiums. Critics also worry that mandatory coverage would force lawyers to raise their rates, chill pro bono activity, and encourage frivolous claims.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.291" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.291" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">112</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Supporters of mandatory insurance respond that, regardless of whether or not lawyers are insured, frivolous claims are exceptionally rare; no increase in claims occurred in Oregon, when it made liability insurance mandatory, and insurance premiums in Oregon are below those of comparable jurisdictions.<span style="font-weight: bolder;"> </span>Supporters also observe that, in many other countries, including Canada, Australia, and most of Europe, lawyers must maintain legal malpractice insurance as a condition of law practice.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.292" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.292" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">113</a></span> And, in many states, physicians and dentists must maintain professional insurance in order to maintain their professional licenses.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.293" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.293" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">114</a></span> </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Should legal malpractice insurance be mandatory? Why or why not?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">4.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another option—which some view as a compromise approach—is to require attorneys who do not have malpractice insurance to disclose that fact. Supporting this approach, in 2004, the ABA adopted a Model Court Rule which compels lawyers to “disclose on their annual registration statements whether they maintain professional liability insurance.” About half the states require some form of disclosure regarding malpractice insurance, but only seven require disclosure directly to clients.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.294" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.294" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">115</a></span> South Dakota has the most robust direct disclosure rule, which requires lawyers to disclose directly to clients if they do not maintain at least $100,000 of insurance and to convey this information in every written communication with clients and in any advertising materials.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.295" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.295" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">116</a></span> Perhaps as a consequence, in South Dakota, only 2 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page105" class="pagebreak" title="105">105</span>percent of practitioners are uninsured.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.296" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.296" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">117</a></span> Opponents of mandatory disclosure argue that the requirement constitutes a form of improper compelled speech and is misleading because the fact of coverage is not indicative of competence or even necessarily of the chances for recovery, given the exclusions written into most policies.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.297" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.297" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">118</a></span></p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Should states require uninsured lawyers to disclose their lack of insurance to prospective clients? Why or why not?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">5.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Even where the erring lawyer is uninsured or otherwise judgment proof, some compensation is generally available for fraud or dishonesty through bar-administered client security funds (which are subsidized by mandatory lawyer contributions). However, such funds pay only about 10 percent of the claims made.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.298" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.298" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">119</a></span> Is that defensible?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">6.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Under what circumstances should third parties be entitled to sue lawyers for malpractice? Should opposing parties have a claim against attorneys who violate ethical rules in contexts like discovery abuse?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">7.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Another serious impediment aggrieved clients face is initiating malpractice claims within the prescribed limitations period. Statutes of limitations vary in length, from as little as one year (e.g., Kentucky and Louisiana) to up to six years (e.g., Hawaii and Wisconsin). States also differ, when it comes to when the clock starts running. In some states, the clock starts running when the error or omission occurred—regardless of when the client became aware, or reasonably could have become aware, of the lawyer’s error or omission. In other states, the statute of limitations does not start running until the client became aware, or should have become aware, of the lawyer’s breach.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.299" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.299" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">120</a></span> Which approach is more justifiable? </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">8.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Model Rule 1.8(h) imposes two limits on lawyers’ conduct vis-à-vis malpractice (or potential malpractice) claims. In particular, it provides that a lawyer “shall not”:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(1)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer’s liability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the agreement; or</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 21.6pt; margin-right: 21.6pt;" class="NoteTextFlush">(2)<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in connection therewith.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt; margin-right: -0.35pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">A comment to Model Rule 1.8(h) provides, however: “This paragraph does not . . . prohibit a lawyer from entering into an agreement with the client to arbitrate legal malpractice claims, provided such agreements are enforceable <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page106" class="pagebreak" title="106">106</span>and the client is fully informed of the scope and effect of the agreement.” Should lawyers be able to force clients into compelled arbitration?</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 0pt;" class="NoteTextParagraph">9.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />As noted above, professional negligence can be very difficult to prove, in part because showing whether the lawyer’s performance deviated from the “custom” of the profession is difficult—and also because showing causation is tricky. In response, some commentators have argued that a preferable approach is to determine what constitutes reasonable performance under the totality of the circumstances, including clients’ legitimate expectations. That is the standard prevailing in other nations’ disciplinary as well as malpractice systems. Commentators have also argued for a less rigorous standard than but-for causation. One promising approach would be the test applicable in England and France, and used in certain medical malpractice cases in roughly twenty American jurisdictions. Under that “loss of chance” test, plaintiffs who demonstrate that the defendant’s substandard performance deprived them of a substantial possibility of recovery would be entitled to damages adjusted to reflect the likelihood of success.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.300" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.300" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">121</a></span> Would you favor one of these reforms?</p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">The role of judges as the final arbiters of justice places them in one of the most critical positions in the American legal system. Therefore, how they conduct themselves in resolving disputes—particularly taking care to avoid bias and conflicts of interest—has significant implications for the legitimacy of the rule of law. In almost all jurisdictions, judges are fully qualified lawyers, licensed in the jurisdictions in which they sit, although some federal administrative judges, and others working in state and local tribunals (especially in rural areas) are not.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.301" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.301" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">122</a></span> Overall, judges are bound by a special body of ethics law that is designed to promote impartial adjudication. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Knowledge of judicial ethics is important because some lawyers will become judges (3 percent of lawyers were judges in the last statistical count<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.302" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.302" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">123</a></span>), and also because many lawyers end up practicing in front of judges in court and must therefore be attentive to any deviation from judicial ethics that might undermine the validity of a proceeding. From the law student’s perspective, judicial ethics also has immediate salience since the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, or MPRE, frequently tests judicial ethics under the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. Indeed, the National Conference of Bar Examiners, which administers the MPRE, indicates that 2 to 8 percent of its test will typically cover judicial conduct, with an emphasis on maintaining impartiality and avoiding conflicts of interest. Although there is some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page107" class="pagebreak" title="107">107</span>focus on basic judicial competence (e.g., conducting the requisite amount of research before issuing an opinion), a review of MPRE exams reveals that most questions probe situations in which judges have actual conflicts, such as having a financial interest in a pending case, or engage in actions that raise the appearance of impropriety—for example, holding ex parte communications with litigants or engaging in outside activities that raise the specter of bias. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This section provides an overview of judicial ethics issues in relation to distinct sources of legal regulation.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.303" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.303" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">124</a></span> As with lawyers, the regulation of judges comes in different forms, which center around state and federal codes of conduct, in addition to judge-specific statutes and general ethical norms.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.304" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.304" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">125</a></span></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 6pt;" class="TextParagraph"><span style="font-style: italic;">Origins and Scope</span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the U.S. federalist system, there are two levels of judges and hence two type of judicial codes. In state systems, where most judges work, ethical conduct is policed through state codes of judicial conduct adopted by state supreme courts. Most of these codes are based on the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, originally adopted in 1924 after the first Commissioner of Major League Baseball, hired to clean up the sport in the wake of the infamous Chicago White Sox cheating scandal, was revealed to be cheating himself: taking a salary for his Commissioner work while still hearing cases as a full-time judge.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.305" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.305" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">126</a></span> Soon thereafter, the Judicial Conference of the United States, composed to monitor the federal bench, passed a resolution stating that federal judges would look to the ABA Model Code as the source of ethical guidance for federal judges.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.306" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.306" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">127</a></span> After the ABA’s 1972 revision of the Model Code, the Judicial Conference followed suit by adopting a full-blown Code of Conduct for United States Judges in 1973. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In the main, the federal judicial Code of Conduct generally tracks the ABA Model Code; the following analysis will therefore concentrate on the ABA version, which was most recently revised in 2007 and has been adopted in some form by thirty-five states (with another ten actively considering its adoption). There are, however, some notable differences between the ABA Model Code and the Judicial Conference’s federal Code, which merit attention. For one, the federal Code—while embracing general principles of upholding the independence of the bench, avoiding the appearance of impropriety, and acting impartially—has not adopted extensive prohibitions on bias, prejudice, and harassment, which were <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page108" class="pagebreak" title="108">108</span>incorporated in the 2007 version of the ABA Model Code (although the federal Code does prohibit affiliation with discriminatory organizations). </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Additionally, unlike the ABA Code, which (when adopted by states) applies to all judges in a jurisdiction (including those sitting on the apex court), the federal Code entirely exempts Supreme Court Justices from its purview. The rationale provided for this exemption is that, unlike judges in lower federal courts, which were established by Congress, U.S. Supreme Court Justices derive their authority directly from the Constitution, which provides that they may serve as long as they demonstrate “good behavior” and may only be removed by impeachment. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">This ethical exemption has led to significant controversies, most recently after the nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, whose attack on a woman accusing him of sexual assault as an “orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump,” caused court watchers to file an ethics complaint against him on the grounds that his testimony demonstrated bias and lack of integrity. The complaint was dismissed by the Judicial Conference’s Committee on Judicial Conduct on the ground that, although Kavanaugh was a sitting circuit judge at the time of the hearings, the ethics rule did “not apply to a judge who has resigned from a covered judicial office and thereafter been confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.307" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.307" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">128</a></span> In controversial earlier cases, Supreme Court justices have declined to recuse themselves despite prior connections with parties and positions.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.308" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.308" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">129</a></span></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 6pt;" class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">General Principles</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The Model Code of Judicial Conduct is organized around four basic canons that address the major areas of ethical concern. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Canon 1<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Canon 1&quot; \s &quot;Canon 1&quot; \c 16 " /> of the Code requires that “a judge shall uphold and promote the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.” The rules delineated under this canon are focused on protecting the reputation of the bench as a pillar of fairness from misconduct by judges, while also stressing that public confidence may be “eroded by improper conduct that creates the appearance of impropriety,” noting that a judge’s duty to promote public confidence “applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.309" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.309" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">130</a></span> While actual improprieties covered by Canon 1<span data-field=" TA \s &quot;Canon 1&quot; " /> include violations of law and ethics, the “test for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page109" class="pagebreak" title="109">109</span>perception that the judge violated this Code or engaged in other conduct that reflects adversely on the judge’s honesty, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.310" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.310" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">131</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Canon 2<span data-field=" TA \l &quot;Canon 2&quot; \s &quot;Canon 2&quot; \c 16 " /> is organized around the mandate that a “judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially, competently, and diligently.” This mandate requires that judges give “precedence” to their judicial duties (treating judging as the full-time job it is),<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.311" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.311" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">132</a></span> while performing the functions of the judicial role with competence and diligence (engaging in sufficient preparation and devoting the necessary time to perform crucial functions),<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.312" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.312" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">133</a></span> and taking care to protect the core value of a litigant’s right to be heard.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.313" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.313" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">134</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">A critical focus of Canon 2 is on action that judges must take or avoid in order to ensure impartial adjudication. Rule 2.2, often considered one of the most important, states that “[a] judge shall uphold and apply the law, and shall perform all duties of judicial office fairly and impartially.” This rule is frequently cited in relation to concerns about a judge’s ideological bias and requires that, despite a judge’s “personal philosophy,” she “must interpret and apply the law without regard to whether the judge approves or disapproves of the law in question.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.314" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.314" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">135</a></span> As will be discussed below, Rule 2.2, in combination with Rule 2.4’s prohibition on permitting “family, social, political, financial, or other interests or relationships” from influencing judicial conduct, form the cornerstones of judicial conflicts of interest law.

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Disqualification and Discipline</span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">The primary mechanism of enforcing judicial ethics is recusal. Under Rule 2.11(A) of the ABA Model Code, a “judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” The rule lists several circumstances requiring disqualification, including when a judge has a personal bias; has personal knowledge of facts in dispute; knows that the judge or a close family member (including a domestic partner) is a party, lawyer, material <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page111" class="pagebreak" title="111">111</span>witness, or has an economic interest in the proceeding; knows that a party or lawyer in a proceeding has given large contributions to the judge’s campaign; or has made a public statement that “commits or appears to commit” the judge to a particular result.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.328" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.328" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">149</a></span> The bases for judicial disqualification may be waived by the parties after full disclosure by a judge.</p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">In most cases, recusal is triggered when judges are asked by parties to voluntarily recuse. However, as we have seen in other contexts—like the decision by Attorney General William Barr to <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> recuse himself in the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election despite having taken a position on its merits prior to joining the Justice Department—what happens when a judge determines that his or her recusal is not warranted is a murky area. Typically, when there is a basis for judicial disqualification, a litigant must file a motion for judicial recusal with very judge overseeing case, which—if rejected—could place the litigant in an awkward situation going forward in the case. In practice, that means that lawyers are often reluctant to file recusal motions and even when they do, if judges refuse, there is little lawyers can do to force them out of a case. </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">Federal law imposes recusal rules on all judges, including Supreme Court Justices—although compliance is again largely left to the discretion of the judges themselves. Under <a id="dabmci_d1f7e0614ee64c2eb35dea9c3092c8ec" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />28 U.S.C. § 455(a), recusal is mandatory for any “justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States . . . in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” In addition, under <a id="dabmci_fccee24ee115410aaebdf8829de05c85" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />§ 455(b), federal judges must recuse when they have designated conflicts, including: demonstrating personal bias or prejudice; having knowledge of disputed facts; having served as a lawyer on the matter in private or government practice, or having served as a material witness; possessing a financial interest either directly or through a close family member; or having a close family member acting as a party, lawyer, or witness in the proceeding.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.329" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.329" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">150</a></span> The recusal statute permits the parties to waive judicial conflicts under the general “impartiality” provision of subsection (a) but prohibits party waiver of any enumerated conflict under subsection (b).<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.330" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.330" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">151</a></span> </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">At the state level, most courts have created committees to review charges of serious ethics violations and impose discipline up to and including removal. However, there are no analogous ethics enforcement bodies for federal judges, who may only be removed through impeachment. </p>

      <p class="TextParagraph">As mentioned above, in many jurisdictions in the United States, judges are elected at all levels, even to the state supreme court. There are currently eighteen states with partisan elections for judges (i.e<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>, judges run in affiliation with a political party), while twenty-one states have nonpartisan elections. Of these, seven states hold partisan elections for state supreme court (including Alabama, Illinois, and New York), while sixteen hold nonpartisan elections. Obviously, in states with elected judges, the ballot box offers a form of judicial control: If voters do not like the job a judge is doing, they can vote the judge out. The downside, of course, is that elected judges, particularly in partisan election states, may think of themselves as representing specific interest groups, rather than the public interest, and shape their jurisprudence toward the satisfaction of defined <span style="color: #000000;">constituencies. </span></p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">We have already mentioned the federal recusal law as a source of judicial regulation outside the scope of the ethics codes. Federal statutes contain other legal requirements bearing on judges appointed to the federal and, in some instances, the state bench. Most of these regulations track what is contained in the ABA Model Code although they impose different penalties. For instance, </span>

        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> makes it a “high misdemeanor” for a federal judge (including a Supreme Court Justice) to engage in the practice of law. Section 458 prohibits nepotism by proscribing the appointment of anyone related within the degree of first cousin to a sitting judge on the same court, state or federal (other than the Supreme Court). </span>
      </p>
      <p class="TextParagraph">
        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;">In addition to federal statutes regulating judicial conduct, some courts have held that judicial conflicts of interest violate a litigant’s due process rights. The most prominent case in this regard was </span>

        <span style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF;"> In this case, the remedy was drastic: The court vacated all 460 of Judge Spath’s orders issued during the two-plus years he had been negotiating for the IJ position.</span>

Section (a) prohibits a lawyer from representing a client in a matter “in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer . . . unless all parties to the proceeding give informed consent, confirmed in writing.” Disqualification of a former judge under (a) may not disqualify the former judge’s entire law firm if the firm institutes a proper screen and provides written notice to the parties and tribunal.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.337" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.337" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">158</a></span> As noted above, Rule 1.12(b) prevents a judge from negotiating for employment with parties or lawyers currently appearing in front of that judge.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">1.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />Protecting impartiality and combatting bias are the touchstones of judicial ethics rules, designed to prevent actual misconduct and the appearance of impropriety that could undermine public confidence in the bench. Bias based on race, gender, and other categories is clearly contrary to ethical norms, but was not explicitly addressed in earlier versions of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct. In 2007, the ABA addressed this omission, adding Rule 2.3(b), which states that a “judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or harassment </span>
        <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page114" class="pagebreak" title="114">114</span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;">based upon race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation, and shall not permit court staff, court officials, or others subject to the judge’s direction and control to do so.” Comment 2 lays out a nonexhaustive list of acts constituting bias or prejudice, which include: “epithets; slurs; demeaning nicknames; negative stereotyping; attempted humor based on stereotypes; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; suggestions of connections between race, ethnicity, or nationality and crime; and irrelevant reference to personal characteristics.” </span>
      </p>
      <p class="NoteTextParagraph">Can and should Rule 2.3 target implicit bias—subconscious stereotyping—that may manifest itself in unfair outcomes for specific groups? There is a large body of empirical evidence supporting claims of widespread judicial bias that has significant negative consequences for minority groups. For example, one study found that judges set bail amounts for African-American defendants 25 percent higher than for white defendants, controlling for distinguishing factors.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.338" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.338" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">159</a></span> A national study of judicial attitudes found that “judges harbored strong to moderate negative implicit stereotypes against Asian-Americans and Jews, while holding favorable implicit stereotypes towards Whites and Christians.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.339" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.339" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">160</a></span> How should judicial ethics address these systemic disparities? </p>
      <p class="NoteTextFlush">2.<span style="margin-right: 5px;" />While implicit bias may be hard to detect on an individual basis, other forms of conduct sanctioning discrimination are out in the open, raising concerns about a judge’s impartiality. This arises with respect to judges holding memberships in private organizations, like country clubs, that discriminate against women and people of color by excluding them from membership. In 2011, the chief bankruptcy judge from the Middle District of Tennessee was reprimanded for holding membership in Nashville’s white-male-only Belle Meade Country Club.<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.340" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.340" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">161</a></span> <a id="dabmci_a5d118978e1a4fdeb4bdfbc50776b867" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;" />The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct Rule 3.6 explicitly prohibits a judge’s “membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity or sexual orientation,” and also proscribes the knowing use of “the benefits or facilities” of such an organization, except that attendance at a discriminatory organization’s event is permitted if it is “an isolated event that could not reasonably be perceived as an endorsement of the organization’s practices.”<span class="FootnoteReference"><a id="ftnb.341" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781647084653/epub/OEBPS/section13.xhtml?favre=brett#ftn.341" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">162</a></span> </p>

One of those conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, had a son who, at the time, was a law partner of Bush’s lead lawyer, Ted Olson, while Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife was actively working on behalf of the Heritage Foundation to solicit resumes for jobs in a potential Bush administration.</span>

In the 1999, the case went to trial, and a jury returned a $1 billion verdict against the insurer. State Farm, predictably, appealed, and the case—</span>

During this period, a seat opened on the Illinois Supreme Court, and Lloyd Karmeier, then a Republican circuit court judge, ran to victory buoyed by nearly $5 million in campaign contributions; at the time, the election set a record as the most expensive judicial election in the country. The problem, though, was that, of those donations, $350,000 came directly from State Farm and its employees and over $1 million came from industry groups in which State Farm was a member. Upon ascending to the Illinois Supreme Court, Justice Karmeier rejected calls for his recusal from </span>

Three weeks after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Cheney and Justice Scalia went duck hunting together in Louisiana, and Scalia flew with Cheney on Air Force Two to the hunting grounds. Scalia rejected the Sierra Club’s motion to recuse himself on impartiality grounds, arguing that, because the suit targeted Cheney in his professional, not personal capacity, and they were just friends, the recusal rule did not apply.</span>

        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Moreover, Scalia argued that his recusal would harm the Supreme Court by bowing to political pressure and encouraging “so-called investigative journalists to suggest improprieties, and demand recusals, for other inappropriate (and increasingly silly) reasons.”</span>
